Early Access Review
 I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ...	So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.As if ...Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz.The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way. But then came the tortoise.	Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise.  Nope!	 I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest.At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him. Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on.But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again.While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both. Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement.In the end it was all too much.Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries. Rain started falling down, putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first, Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath.12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).Thanks for reading if you made it this far :-)			"

								I'm not one to write reviews for games - especially games that are in early access. So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game. I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam). So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review. The best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe. In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from ""civilization"". You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions. Sure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to ""guide"" your gameplay. The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game. The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated.With that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players. There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn. My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes. When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes. Losing is fun.All in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game. I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs. As I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus.

								Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.Really, what else do you need in a game?			"

								My Rimworld story: One day in my medium sized, seven person colony, we were attacked by raiders. I send my best gunman to deal with them, but one of my colonists was immediately shot, and incapacitated. The colony had a very good doctor, so I had the doctor drag him to the hospital to be treated. My other colonists mopped up the raiders and returned to work while my injured colonist recovered. He was in the hospital for days when I finally realized that he was shot through the spine, leaving him paralyzed. There is no current remedy for paralysis. He would be a reasonable drain on valuble resources, but I couldn't bring myself to euthanize him. So I gathered all the colonists into his wife's bedroom for a ceremony, in which my vegetized colonist was lowered into a cryostasis pod. Now he sleeps in a metal tube, next to his wife who didn't want to be apart from him, waiting for his fellow colonists to develop a remedy for his condition.10/10 Ludeon plz add mech suit for my sad vegetable. His cat misses him :(			"

								I had created a successful community that in it had two particular people. One was named Pidoux who was an amazing hunter and miner who happened to be gay. The other one was Jacob, a social person and doctor. Pidoux loved Jacob but Jacob was not interested. Everytime he passed by Jacob his heart would fluster, he would continue to confess his feelings only to be rejected.One faithful day, our settlement was attacked by a maddened elephant which tore Jacob's foot off. He was quickly operated on by one of our surgeons, but prayed before he was operated on. One operation later, Jacob was the owner of a peg leg. Everyone was asleep when he woke up, so he walked over to a comfy chair and meditated.Days after, we had decided to create a hosptial bed thanks to new research. Jacob was estatic to have such a great piece of equipment, but we had no steel.Pidoux, blinded by love, ran to a mountain and begun mining to find the precious resource. During the pouring rain, Pidoux hacked away, determined to impress his love. Suddently, rocks collapsed. Pidoux's body was not recovered, Jacob is staring at a completed empty hospital bed.

								I started quite innocently at a save, three wonderful colonists. Things were going well, I got some growth up and my happy colonists were making friends with the visitors. My farms were doing exeptionally well, and after not too long, I had over one thousand in Rice, Potatoes and corn. In addition to quite a lot of strawberries. All of this in my refridgerated room. I figured I didn't have to worry about food for a long while.I was wrong.I got the fine idea of buying a hen and a rooster from a traveller, thinking eggs would make some fine additions to my food storage. I made a barn and made sure all the animals had access to food.Focusing on other things, I completely forgot about the animals for a while. Until all of a sudden there were 30 chickens. I was a little shocked about the rate in which they'd grown, and started a hay farm to give them an alternate food source that didn't ruin me. This would all be good and dandy in no time. I was wrong.By the time I'd gotten the hay sowed and partially grown, I was down to less than 500 of all vegetables. And to top it off, a blight was around the corner and completely destroyed all my crops.I had to start over. Completely panicked, I slaughtered some chickens. At this point, it was 70+. So I figured taking 25 of them to the slaughterhouse would give me some time.I was very wrong. Desperately looking for a way out, I had to slaughter another 20 something chickens. Now they were approaching 70 again. I was just hoping for a caravan to show up so that I could sell some chickens and buy some veggies.I got some hay grown and decided to cut off the chickens access to all other food sources. Now they were getting past 80. But I had some hay, hoping it would work out, I kept at it. I didn't mind the chickens for a while, until I noticed that some of them were starving. By then, I'd gotten my veggie count back up a few hundreds. I let the chicken into my pantry. And forgot about it.Some time later and A LOT of chickens later, a caravan finally appear, so I figure, finally, time to sell some chickens. Let's check how many I've got. ♥♥♥♥ING 241 chickens is what I've got! And they've pretty much cleaned out all my food by this point. Angered and slightly panicked. I sell ALL the chickens. The caravan wanted them cheap, but I didn't care, I just wanted them gone. So, some 1600 Silver later, I happily decide that my days as a chicken farmer is over, And get four alpacas instead.I was delighted.Finally, no more chickens!The caravan takes on it's way and I go about my merry business of rebuilding my food stock. Until all of a sudden it pops up in the corner 'Chicken 13 has gotten food poisoning from rice'. Puzzled, I look over to the barn, and ♥♥♥♥ing sure enough, I have more chickens!It's at this point I remember, chickens lay eggs. The chickens I had before laid eggs, I ♥♥♥♥ing forgot to sell the eggs!So I go at it again, harvesting my hay crops early and locking them away from the food supply, mad at myself for forgetting the damned eggs. But these are just tiny little chickens. They don't lay eggs, yet. So I decided to let them live until they're adults so I can slaughter them for their meat. And I go about on my merry way.GUESS WHAT, CHICKENS LAY EGGS. And these started laying eggs because I forgot about them and they grew up! I got angry, because I could see where this was going. So I marked them all for slaughter and forcefed the eggs to my innocent settlers. They didn't like it very much, but I couldn't wait until the next caravan to come along.Now I don't run a chicken farm anymore. I will never get chickens again.I love alpacas.10/10 would do again.A perfect 5/7 score for keeping me entertained			"

								I enjoy Dwarf Fortress. But I felt disconnected with my dwarves. Honestly, 80 dwarves in one fort, and I'm supposed to care about how my Baron feels?Then I tried RimWorld. I got it October 20th of 2016. And. I pretty much played it for near 20 hour stretches. Until that Sunday night when I realized, ""I have work on Monday.""My first colony was thrown together in something of a huff as I didn't know what I was really doing, but the game is very straightforward so once I figured things out (and the ingame helper is a nice touch, Devs. Kudos), I was grooving.My two main colonists were a fighter and doctor, plus a crafter. They got along. All was well. Between the mining, expanding, animal taming, it all felt very easily managable. There were a few mistakes, but the colony thrived.Until he came along. The pyromaniac. He would occassionally start fires, usually after being rebuffed by the good female doctor who had her eyes on someone else. Often this would lead to him being arrested and thrown into a cell. If the fires were set away from the compound, then that was fine.It kept getting to the point everyone was tired of his abrasive attitude and having to put out his fires. Literally. His mood would always tank after the tribal and pirate raids, yet he seemed ecstatic when it came to lobbing his molotov cocktails at the would be attackers.Then IT landed. An AI Core. The crafter had gone out to retrieve something, and that triggered the core. Out slothed a slow moving, minigun armed slug. Everyone went on alert and was ready to fight, armed with the pistol, rifle, and knife that remained. The fighter died in a hail of bullets. He died. Blown literally into pieces infront of the good doctor. She went berserk, broken at the sight of her lover ripped to pieces. For all of the 5 seconds of rage the slug allowed before she was mowed down as well.The crafter turned tail and ran. Fear had overtaken him. He dashed into the recesses of the compound. The pyro had long since lost his mind, laughing and setting fires, about the colony, then in the compound. The first to burn up were the dearly dismembered lovers. The crafter tried to fight back the impending flames by was consumed.As the slug advanced, our moronic miscreant looked to the slug, then back to the flames... It was a simple choice in his mind. The loving, warm embrace of a firey death. The single thing he loved more than anything else in his life. A deep laugh emanting from the depth of his core as he leapt into the raging inferno..... Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching this all unfold sipping a red bull like, ""... THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME."" Rolled another colony and was up till 5:30am the next day still playing. This repeated ad nasuem all weekend in a variety of scenarios, now enabled by some mods, because hey, themed plays are fun. Especially the Cannibal Run. Oh man. That was... That was really bad.Then monday morning I show up to work looking like I'd been partying all weekend: ""Dude are you okay? You sound like♥♥♥♥♥♥ How much did you drink?"" ""... Rimworld."" ""Huh?"" ""... I was playing RimWorld. All weekend."" ""Oh. Is that a game?"" ""Yeah."" ""S'it any good?"" ""... Yes. Yes it is very good.""So that's my review of RimWorld. The first game I have played in the last 10 years that has managed to keep me up past 2am (when I usually pass out), through consecutive days without any pings of boredom or tedium. That hasn't happened in a very long time.Now if you'll excuse me? I have to plan out my Squirrel God playthrough. A mad human colonist with a bomb in his head, and ascetic tastes for squirrels. To raise them, to eat them, to create and command an army of them. And DEATH. DEATH TO ALL WHO OPPOSE US!! .... Maybe he'll let in the occassional boom rat. We'll see. Either way we're gonna have a lot of fun, am I right? :D			"

								This game is unreal. The stories and narratives that evolve as you play are endless. Let me tell you the story about Joe.Joe crash landed in a pod with two other survivors. Joe was not too bright, he loved to fight, and make art. That was all. He refused to cook. He refused to clean. He refused to haul things. He couldn't heal people. Joe was in his 80s. He was the only hunter in the colony. Time went on and the colony flourised. Stockpiles were high, foodstores were significant, many different varieties of meals and all were happy. Then the raiders hit. A significant force. Joe, being the only competent fighter, took to the fields. Frightened colonists in tow. The fight was fierce. Scouring the area, he discovered a couple of colonists were injured, he took them to their beds to die. There was nothing he could do for them, but offer them comfort in their final days as their conditions slowly worsened. Soon. Only Joe remained.Days and weeks passed. Winter, came and went. The stores of food were plentiful. To pass the time Joe created great works of art from the materials his dead too soon friends had gathered. Just an old man. Waiting to die. Making beautiful art.He made art that told the stories of his friends. Murals of beavers representing honesty. Frescos of winged marmots representing strength. He created art in rememberance. Suddenly. A call over the communications relay. Someone was in trouble. Looking for help. He offered assistance. Grabbed his weapons and charged outside. A young man, tribals on his heels. Joe charged. He slew bandits left and right. He cut them down like a man possessed. Til the arrow caught him. Then another. With one final swing of his mighty club. He took his attacker out. Fell to the ground. Dead. Joe may have died, but the colony lived on. The youth he rescued rebuilt. With Joes art, the only evidence of those who left it behind.This is just one of many different stories that happen in this game... This particular one took place over a year ago. There have been so many additions to it. So many great and wonderful things.			"

Ludeon, keep developing this and make it better and better. That said, I have to step away from it for the sake of my free time.EDIT: Though no one will see it, or cares, I felt the need to update this for the Wanderlust update. The game was addictive before, but this update cranks the addition up to 17. With the ability to expand to multiple settlements the game is just downright amazing.			"

								18:00 - I'll do another couple of minutes and then get something to eat.20:00 - Ok Just need to finish this off and I'll break for a few minutes.22:00 - Right now we're stable I can think about expanding again...00:00 - Did I remember to put defence turrets down?04:00 - Five more minutes08:00 - ""Hi boss, I'm really not feeling to good today, I think I'm coming down with something.  I'll take a day or two so I'm not contageous"".  Right just need to get some more resources in.......This game is deeply addictive.  I've racked up many sleepless nights trying to build the perfect colony and agonising over how best to keep everyone alive.  It's very possible to become attached to your colonists and find yourself reaching for the quick load when you lose one of them to bad luck, bad planning or just your own incompetence.Don't let the early access tag put you off.  The game is in a very solid and playable state and well worth the asking price I think.There are a huge range of mods which can keep the game as deep and varied as you desire but even without mods there are many, many hours of play time here.Pros:Simple to learn, much harder to master.Roguelike gameplay means it's very replayable.Cons:Risk of unemployment cused by non attendance at work.

								You've conquered colony building across the multiverse. You are a master of resource management. You are a trade mogul. A ruthless general. RimWorld doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. You will fail, and you will reload at 4 am with your sickday alibi already planned. You tried to be clever. You made elaborate plans. You re-rolled colonists until your probability calculations made sense. And then you howled in anger as your fledgling ecosystem is left to be defended by the last man standing, a near-zealtous pacifist. You watch as the raiders free the prisoners and your final coward runs to the stockroom. ""Finally"", you sigh ""he's going to pick up a weapon and at least die on his feet.""When the raiders find him, he is calmly eating a simple food ration in the dark. They unceremoniously bonk your last colonist over the head, and drag him silently into the night. And as you are left staring at your motionless, dark tomb of a colony, the rain begins to fall. Your generator batteries catch fire, and your dreams, your plans, your efforts slowly burn to ashes. And in that moment, you have one singular thought burned across your mind; ""This is the best early access game I've ever played.""			"

								Our only doctor, aptly named Doctor, got a bad case of the Mondays and decided to take a walk while the colony's leader suffered from an extremely infected neck wound he had recieved defending the colony. Our leader struggled bravely but without medical care he died a painful labored death. Farter, our brave leader's dog, took this loss especially hard and lacked an emotional coping strategy. He tore out our cook Herman's throat out as he was preparing his famous boomalope casserole. Sprinkles, the custodian,  was the next to go. The dog found our one armed janitor enjoying a beer in the common room. Sprinkles defended himself admirably but all was in vain as there is no viable defense against a grief stricken canine. Farter ripped off Sprinkles' remaining arm and dutifully trudged outside. He found Doctor strolling amongst the palm fronds, feeling sorry for himself and presumeably writing weepy poetry about his trials and sorrows. Doctor pleaded his case to Farter. How could this dog not understand that the living room had been too dirty? THREE DIRT PILES IN THE LIVING ROOM!? How can he save lives if there are THREE DIRT PILES IN THE LIVING ROOM? What kind of kiddy pool operation would make a PROFESSIONAL work under conditions like that? Is it any wonder he had to get out of there and take a power jog? Surely, our great and brave leader would have understood, right? THREE DIRT PILES!Death did not come quickly for Dr. Doctor. The bite had crushed his spine and only after two hard days did he finally succumb to the elements and starvation.  As for Farter, his job was over. It was time to rest. His victories had come at too great a cost and the defensive wounds he had taken each battle were taking their toll. Farter limped his way back into the colony base, past Herman still bleeding out amongst his boomalope meat, over Sprinkles' now armless body, by his master's gangrenous corpse, through the three dirt piles and into the freezer. Farter laid down. His frozen body was the last they found, behind a crate of strawberries.Good boy, Farter. Good boy.			"

Early Access Review
								Do NOT be fooled by the ""Early Access"" header on this store page. This game has more content than most full releases.This is the ""Dwarf Fortress with a user-friendly interface"" that you've been waiting for your whole life. Let's get the flaws out of the way first, since those often have more of an impact on whether you buy than the pros:1. There is no Z-layer. You cannot dig downward or build upward. To be fair, this would be impractical for people in the situation the game's plot takes place in, but the Z-layer is a big part of Dwarf Fortress and certainly bears mentioning.2. The world is somewhat less complex than Dwarf Fortress. There are obviously no elves or vampires or demons. Enemies are limited to humans (tribal through futuristic) and robots.3. The graphics only get about a C+ or B- in the current state. It's reminiscent of Prison Architect but with slightly less polish. Excellent for an early access build, however.That said, I was a KickStarter backer and have at NO point been disappointed with the game's releases or pace of development. The game has never once crashed on me, even in the very first builds I played. There has been at least one update every month, sometimes multiple. Even the very first initial alpha build released was a fun game, albeit with very little content and that was only entertaining for a few hours, and there has been a massive amount of content added since then.Mod content is already available, and has been since a very early alpha build.If every KickStarter game got this good this quickly, Early Access wouldn't have the bad reputation it has today.Bottom line, if it looks like fun to you, it will be. This ""Early Access"" game is better than most indie game final builds. Tynan (the creator) could have easily sold it as ""Early Access"" last year, and the fact that he's waited this long says a lot about how he plans to approach development. He didn't go for the quick cash grab, and made sure to have a complete and entertaining product before he sought any money from non-KickStarter backers. I have a great deal of confidence that this game will continue to receive significant and exciting content development for a long time to come.			"

								Takuya wasn't anything special.He spent his days troubled and mostly upset, his outlook on life being rather bleak. The other colonists didn't really get on with Takuya, oftentimes picking on him and mocking his clothes. When not working on his favorite hobby (gardening), he would often be wandering around, taking in nature. He was also fond of the dog - Freud.Takuya struggled with mental health. On one occasion, he simply lost all faith: abandoning his clothes and food and taking to wandering the fields at night. The others didn't really pay it any mind.Takuya decided to start making sculptures after he regained his sanity. Although not of the highest quality, they were admirable. He named them after his fellow colonists, in the hope that he might make them happier about his existence. He managed the gardens for some time, keeping the crops and flowers in best condition. No one was ever without food when Takuya was there.One night, the colony was set upon by brigands. Being chased across the land, a criminal had arrived seeking asylum, with a raiding party at his heels. Takuya propsed to let him in, so they did.Much fighting ensued - many blows were dealt. Much of the base was damaged by fire, and the battle ravaged into the early morning. By breakfast, the field was littered with corpses.Takuya never finished his last, grand statue. The gardens which he once tended so dearly lay neglected; overgrown.In the corner of a fertile field where Takuya used to visit so often stands a quiet, unmarked grave.The grave of the lonely gardener, who never found his place.I never in my wildest dreams thought that a game like this could have such an impact. I often scoffed at survival games, assuming that they could never leave a meaningful impression.I'll never make that mistake again.			"

								From the very beginning, we had a dog; his name was Jed. Jed was loyal, he followed his daily master, retrieved resources and fiercely protected the survivors. Then came the battle, far larger than any previous ones. Those damned heathen barbarians with their clubs and bows. We shot and shot and shot, yet still they came. Until finally our fortifications were overrun. One of our number was surrounded, with no chance of running. Jed being the brave companion he was, rushed in to rescue the now prone survivor. He was a roaring fury of teeth. But damn them there were so many, and they set upon him with their clubs. We covered him as best we could and finally their spirit broke and they fled, cowards that they were. The man Jed had defended was still alive, barely. Next to him lay Jed. Fierce Jed, whimpering from his wounds, we brought him back to the compound, not the shed with the animals; no, he deserved better. The doctor treated him as best he could, and we went about the necessary tasks of repair an reclaimation. THe next morning, when most of the animals would normally go outside to graze, Jed was not with them. He lay, panting on the bed in the room we had constucted just for him in the night; his spine crushed from the clubs of the horde. He lay there looking up at us with happiness, and sorrow, he licked our hand when we put our hand on his head. Covering our eyes, we left his room and went to the prison cells. The attackers had swarmed in large numbers, so naturally our artillery and machine guns had wounded many, rather than kill. Of the initial 7, 3 had succumbed to their wounds in the night, as we did not have adequate beds for them all. As for the remaining 4, we had a decision to make. They were murderers all, and they had reveled in the blood they had spilled, at least while they were free. Now, as we approaced them, they were less certain when seeing the hard look in our eyes. Winter was approaching fast, and we were in no mood to share what food we had with their ilk. And then there was Jed. Jed who had been with us since our ship had crashed on this forsaken world. Jed who had done more than one could ever ask of any companion, human, animal or otherwise. Jed. Those prisoners did not survive another night. We burned their clothes, if one could call such scraps clothing. The next morning we came to Jed with a special meal. His last meal. In many heathen cultures among the stars, the blood and hearts of one's enemies is thought to give strength to he that consumes them. We supposed that is was a fitting end for the ones who had attacked us and broke our community. We gave Jed his peace that night as he slept, and from his pelt our tailor made a coat of insurpassable craftsmanship. It now has its own stand in our armory among our other great works, a reminder of a warrior, a friend, a good boy. The barbarians now come again, and we are waiting. 10/10 FOR JED!!!			"

Early Access Review
Welcome to your new home! Good luck not getting killed. RimWorld is a colony-builder/survival simulation game from one man dev team, Ludeon Studios. In RimWorld you're presented with a scenario and using the group of people and resources you get, your aim is to survive on a randomly generated rim world. There are three basic scenarios but the game has its own scenario editor as well as workshop support which helps contribute to the game's huge replay value. Your main goal in the game to research and build a spaceship capable of getting you off what is usually a very dangerous world.   One of the key parts of RimWorld's gameplay is its AI Storyteller feature, effectively one of two difficulty levels. Your choice of Storyteller dictates what kind of events you'll see in the game while a second, traditional difficulty level, decides how tough these events will be on your colony. The most common events include the Mad Animal event (an animal will become very aggressive and target your colonists) a Raid event where a local pirate faction will attack you as well as positive events such as Cargo Pod drops or Escape Pod drops. There are also several different environmental events which add a new level of challenge to the game. They range from Solar Flares which temporarily disable all of your colony's electronics to Toxic Fallouts which will cause a Toxic buildup in a colonist (which can be fatal) if they aren't indoors. You also have colonist mental break events which occur when a colonist's mood becomes very low and stays that way for a long period of time. Sometimes a colonist will simply lock themselves in a room but serious mental breaks can lead to going berserk in which case the colonist will become hostile. Your colonists can also randomly get serious diseases such as malaria or the plague as well as common illnesses which are usually caused by combat-inflicted injuries.  Depending on your Storyteller and difficulty level these events can be very difficult, and will often be the downfall of your colony. Surprisingly, this isn't at all frustrating, in fact what I enjoy the most about RimWorld is the stories you get from your playthroughs and the most interesting stories come from the death of your colony. In my second attempt at the game, one of four colonists and the pet dog were killed during a pirate raid. The colonist who had developed a bond with the dog became incredibly unhappy and went beserk. He was equipped with a rifle and easily took out the two remaining colonists while the pirates worked on destroying my power supply. When my beserk colonists finally went outside, the pirates turned their attention to the poor sod, they peppered him with bullets and carried him back to their base. With that my colony was destroyed.   Generally when I'm utterly destroyed in a game I get frustrated and take a break from it, not RimWorld. Each time I've lost a colony I've restarted instantly and the reason behind this is the replay value the game has. Even if you're playing the same scenario, the colonists you 'choose' (you have no customisation options but you can randomise to get a group of colonists you'd prefer) have a huge impact on how your game turns out and how you manage your colony, even if you build similar structures. Your colonists will have varying skill levels for the different types of work in the game. To some extent these are random but they're also dependent upon the colonist's background (type of childhood and profession) and the character's traits. A doctor or vet will always have a high medical skill level while a torturer or hunter will have a good melee skill level. Traits often have more of an indirect impact on the colonist's ability. A beautiful character will be better in social situations and a psychopath is incapable of social interaction and only cares about things that directly impact them.   Colonist traits also influences how characters interact with each other and what consequences those interactions will have. If a character with the beautiful or pretty trait attempts to romance another character it's far more likely that the character will be successful. This might not seem like an important gameplay feature but interaction with other characters is one of the main happiness modifiers. Anything from having a nice chat to making love with another colonist gives a bonus to happiness but getting rejected or being insulted will make the colonist unhappy for quite some time. There are of course plenty of other happiness modifiers. Taking part in social or recreational activities gives large boosts while executing an innocent prisoner or eating human flesh give massive negative modifiers. The severity of the modifier dictates the length of the modifier. Having a rough night's sleep on lasts until the next night while getting rejected can last for an in-game week. There is some balancing that needs to be done for some of the modifiers, the modifier for getting rejected is particularly lengthy.  Being a colony survival sim, building is obviously a very important part of the game. If you're familiar with Prison Architect then the building mechanics will be fairly easy to grasp. You'll be designing and ordering your colonists to build different structures as well as furniture for your colonists to use and enjoy as well as production items such as butcher tables, cooking tables and research benches. You'll also have zones at your disposal to help run your colony. You can set up stockpile zones (and choose what's stored in any given stockpile) for storing resources, growing zones to grow food and other useful crops such as a plants for herbal medicine and cotton to use in the production of clothes. One of the things that RimWorld is missing compared to similar games such as Gnomoria is RimWorld doesn't have Z Levels, I.e. the ability to build up or down, you're stuck on the ground floor. This isn't a huge issue as the maps are very large (depending on what size you pick) but it's still worth mentioning. Tynan Sylvester hasn't ruled out Z Levels being added in the future but it requires a lot of work and so if we do see it in RimWorld it’s a long way off.  Verdict  RimWorld is not only an excellent, highly entertaining colony sim, it's also one of the most polished and content rich Early Access games I've had the pleasure of playing. It may seem like its priced a little high but RimWorld is absolutely worth every penny.  Lone Ranger Reviews.  El K.			"

Early Access Review
								At the start of my game, I picked up a wanderer named Big. The man was a huge slab of muscle, and looked like the man who could get stuff done. Except... he couldn't. The poor guy was too clumsy for his own good, except when it came to his hands and his eyes. All he could do was be a warden, handle animals, hunt, and make art.When I first saw him I was horrified at how useless he seemed. I built a small shack into the mountain with a small carving bench for him to spend the rest of his days just to be rid of him. However, Jude saw something I didn't. She saw a man with a heart of gold, even if he wasn't the best or the brightest bulb of the bunch. They started hanging out, and eventually Big, or Jude (not entirely sure which) popped the question. Jude was my main gal, I had given her the best of the best, and she earned it. She did everything in the long hours of the night while everyone else slept, and only took her rest as everyone else woke up. But she seemed to do all their work by herself.Tragedy struck, raids happened, and soon enough there were just 4 people out of 8, in the dead of winter, forced to cannibalize those who fell in raids. However, even after being infected with Sensory Mechanites, forced to endure excruciating pain, and watch her friends die, Jude didn't break. She appreciated those nights with Big and the art he had made. The others did too, seeing hope in the art carved into grains of wood.Winter ended, things were looking good, until a raid blindsided them while Big was on a hunt (even though he wasn't able to lift the kill, his aim was great enough that he was the safest hunter). Big went down, but he was a fighter and held on. He watched as his friends, NO, his family held off the raiders with the help of turrets Jude had made. 1, 2 went down. The third decided to cut their losses and ran home, but not without grabbing Big first. The others fought to save him, but none could quite match his skill with a gun.The raiders called for a trade, silver for him. Sadly, they had just used the last of their silver to finish sterilizing the hospital floor. With heavy hearts, they were forced to decline the trade. Not even a day later, they got the news. Big died of infection from his injuries, not quite able to hold on as they scraped together every scrap of silver they could to try and save him.This was the tale of the witling watcher. (He usually carved in the prisoner room, and watched the prisoners while doing so.And thats the tale of how I save scummed for the first time ever for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pawn.EDIT:  Tacking this on since this kinda exploded. I never played pre-steam release, and went in blind. My best advice for new players is to do Casandra Rough with Permadeath. Your people WILL die, but this way you can figure out how to start instead of trying to fight an uphill battle. For those who are confused by the UI and how to use it, just experiment, try just double clicking stuff or just randomly hitting buttons, its much better to laugh at your own failure than to follow an online guide.

It made me realize that all I really want from life is to be a muffalo taming colonist, eating pemmican, repelling tribal raids and stomping my wooden foot to the rhythm of my prisoner's heartbeat while I harvest his organs to sell for silver.I'm also looking for a wife to take with me to the lands we're going to settle. Must be fine with being legless from time to time.Edit2: No worries, people, I'm still alive!... I think... Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?			"

								My Story....My top dog Rick, 14 shooting skill, 15 construction and a bunch of other high skills was the king of my colony, he built the entire place from nothing to the fortress it is today, every raid, he was at the forefront of battle destroying people with his sniper rifle, he was the rock everyone relied on.Then one day something terrible occurred...We had just decided to take in a new survivor who was being chased by 4 pirates, it was a tough fight but we won, Rick was the only one unharmed, as he was fixing up his fallen comrades we were struck by another raid so I had no choice but to take them on alone (there were 6 of them)Rick was hunkered down behind a wall just in-front of our compound, taking shots but nothing he can't handle. One of the other colonists was able to walk at this point so I got him to join the fight.In the heat of battle I forgot to check what weapon this guy was wielding, HUGE MISTAKE, he stood just behind rick as the remaining 3 raiders closed in, he then proceeded to throw a frag grenade which took 2 of the raiders out but also completely mangled Rick to pieces.I had to run back to the armory and grab a rifle while the remaining raider was smashing Ricks brains in, I came back and finished him off.Anyways Rick is now brain damaged, has no ears, no nose and only one leg.He has gone from being the Rock of my colony, the destroyer of raiders and the guy everyone turns to in times of need to now only just being able to manage the cleaning role.I thought about ending his life but I couldn't do it, it saddens me every-time I load the game up to see the strongest and most reliable member of my colony resorted to cleaning up dirt and needing to sleep more than half the day.I just hope and pray one day I can get him back to normal....

								Ran a sweet little colony called 'Haven'. This random brawler joins us called Bowman, turns out he's awesome with a spear so I give him hunting duties. Bowman fearlessly defends the colony on several occasions from tribals and pirates. Anyway for some reason a bunch of beavers show up and start eating all the trees - this is unacceptable because wood is a key resource for me, so I dispatch Bowman to go and deal with them. The situation gets the better of him and unfortunately both his arms are torn off by beavers. I send another colonist out to go and rescue him and he's in a hospital bed just in time to save his life. This is annoying that I've now lost my best melee defender, but whatever I'll just buy some new arms for him and turn him into some sort of cyborg hunting machine.As luck would have it a passing trader just so happens to have a single bionic arm so I snap one up and schedule an operation to install it. My resident doctor (a criminal surgeon) is enjoying a few beers in the community centre and decides to head down to surgery because he's dedicated like that, and besides it's not like there's any laws on this planet against surgically installing bionic implants whilst under the influence.I watch the surgery progress with a bit of blood being splashed around but I have full confidence in my drunk, skill level 6 surgeon. But then things take a turn for a worse and I am notified that, regretably, Bowman has not survived the procedure. Devestated I go and inspect the colonists health panel and discover that my semi-competent, semi-sober surgeon has accidentally surgically removed his heart. I have never in my life laughed so hard whilst playing a computer game.Long story short, in the days preceeding a ton of pirates show up, kill the vast majority of my colonists, enslave the rest and then burn my colony to the ground. That in a nutshell is the story of 'Haven'.			"

								Got a colony going after countless failures and got a bit lucky. Things are going good. Figured out how to prioritize, and they're working like a well-oiled machine together. Start to spruce up the place; colonists are not neutral, they are happy! They're liking their lives under my direction. A raid comes to assault my base - I send my best shooters out and they dispatch the offenders. I capture them, and lock them in prison. Start convincing them to join the cause. One converts. This is amazing. One left to go, a loner. Doesn't seem very receptive to the idea of joining us. A new love blossoms! While one gal keeps rejecting a fellow colonists' advances, one of my doctors successfully woos my lead surgeon. They are married in front of the pond, and they party and drink the night away. Prisoner still isn't taking to our recruitment pleas. Probably upset because the power has gone out, and I didn't priortize my colonists' job list to haul wood to the generator.Escape! Try to sweeten the pot for my prisoner by adding some sandstone tile. Fancy! As I'm building, my colonist is overpowered and the prisoner runs out the door. In an attempt to escape, he begins assaulting my surgeon, and phenomenal chef. Her husband takes him out and puts him back in his cell. Things are going well, and I've built up a stockpile. Everybody is wearing cowboy hats and dusters, they look like cowfolk. Poison ship lands near my base. What's a poison ship? It kills everything? I can't deconstruct it, and I can't shoot it. Hmm. Build a wall around it. Looks like the pollution is subsiding. Things are good.Fire! A lightning storm lights a blaze outside my home area. Oh well, it's so far away. Oh no, we have a serious problem! Half of the map is ablaze. Expand home area in a desperate effort to put it out. It is futile. My former prisoner-turned-colonist is surrounded by fire. I desperately order my colonists to extinguish the blaze near her. Rain! Oh, refreshing, fire-snuffing rain! Fire's out, but my colonist is hurt. Bad.  My surgeon takes her to the hospital, and tends to her wounds. 3 days later, she's still incapacitated. Check medical tab. Right leg ... BURNT OFF?!?My surgeon attempts to attach a peg leg. First operation is a complete failure. She's bleeding out! Tend to her wounds, and try again. Success! She's up and working again. My colonist finally succeeds in wooing another, and now I have two couples in my colony. Does this mean children?Dig out underground storage. It's nice and roomy. Install air conditioners, set for grain storage. It fills up fast. My farms are doing very well. Traders arrive. Trade a bunch of rice for some animals. Get another dog ... they mate! Yay, puppies on the way!Bugs form a nest inside. My surgeon falls in defense of her colony. Her husband puts her in the medical bed, and tends to her wounds. They are too great. She succombs. The entire colony is affected, with her husband taking it the hardest. He has a mental breakdown, strips naked, and wanders. The other colonists leave him be. Nobody is happy anymore. I am not happy anymore. Rest in peace, Myrna. 10/10, would be depressed again.			"

								The older I get, the less I like violent games. Instead, I find myself drawn to games I used to scoff at as a youngster: Simulations and city-builders. I have no explanation, honestly. One'd think that I'd be in love with shooters since adulthood has introduced me to whole new levels of disappointment and frustration, but, somehow... it has also been very pleasant. Maybe that's why I like to build and micro-manage. I don't know, man. What I do know: I like ""RimWorld"" a lot. It is a base-building game that is best described as an accessible ""Dwarf Fortress"". You guide a bunch of characters (e.g. space-farers who have crashed on an alien planet or a tribe already living there) and help them survive by building a base and managing food and energy sources. You have to trade with other settlements and spaceships that occasionally enter your orbit. You have to make sure your guys and girls are happy and productive, but you'll also have to fend off pirate raids - ""RimWorld"" is quite fierce if played on the higher difficulties. There's a lot of fighting, if you want it. For those of us who just want to relax and build - you can do so by choosing one of the lower difficulties. The game offers three different AIs that control the ""events"" which occasionally hassle your settlement (like raids, solar eclipses, meteorogical catastrophes etc.). Some of them are REALLY dangerous and can wipe out your base, if they catch you unprepared. Toxic Fallout, I'm looking at you. The AIs differ in their predictability and the severity of the events they choose to unleash.""RimWorld"" is quite complex, but perfectly accessible for anybody in my opinion. You don't have to be a simulation buff to play it. Then, again, if you are a buff, you might find ""RimWorld"" a bit underwhelming compared to ""Dwarf Fortress"", since it lacks Z-Levels (underground layers you can dig to and build on) and its multitude of creatures. After approx. 20 hours with ""RimWorld"", I find myself gravitating back towards ""Dwarf Fortress"" which I find beefier. However, ""RimWorld"" is by no means a bad game and I keep coming back to it. The developers have been updating it regularly and I hope they'll be adding some unexpected stuff soon. I propose magic flutes that let you guile tribesfolk into lethal traps.			"

								My first experience with RimWorld!  First hour of play Decided to start off by enabling permadeath mode, since I want my ♥♥♥♥-ups to actually punish me. Get 3 decent colonists, find a nice location, everything fine so far!   2nd hourGot a very primitive base set up, survived the first raid consisting of one drugged-up raider with a shoddy club. She was easily dispatched of. A 4th colonist named Donovan arrives, his skill in growing enables me to grow Healroot. This is looking better and better! 3rd hourA stockpile for food with proper refridgeration is set up, several workshops created, built a spacious rec-room with a chess and a billiards table and several plantpots, refurnished the bedrooms in order to increase their size due to complaints from colonists. First harvest of corn and potato is harvested and stockpiled, the colony can now survive the winter season. At this point and time I confident, my base defenses have been fortified and food is plentiful. Even managed to build a specific section for medical needs. As I am caught up in my planning for further expansion, I fail to notice a rogue boomrat that aparently snuck into my rec-room. This ♥♥♥♥ing rat is quite hungry aparently, as it collapses on the floor. Seconds later it dies in a decent-sized explosion that sends fire all across the room. Which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that my entire base is built out of wood. Panic spreads in the colony, only two colonists are able to fight fire and one of them quickly dies due to the house burning too fiercly. The other one retreats outside. The death of the first colonist, Collins, sends his trusty labrador into a rage-fit and the mongrel decides to attack my sleeping colonists. It shreds the throat of two colonists before it makes it's way outside, shame that those two were the only ones armed with guns. My last colonist manages to vanquish the foe before passing out due to her wounds.  4th hourMy last colonist is unconscious outside of the base, which now looks like a reinactment of a scene straight out of Dante's Inferno. A lonely raider decides to pop by, destroys the solar panels for some reason before he decides to kidnap my wounded colonist. He picks her up and runs away with her. And so ends the tale of New Haven, a mighty encampment defeated by a single hungry boomrat. I don't know if I should laugh or cry so I grab a beer and decide to create a new colony.TLDR: Don't let hungry boomrats into your base which is built out of wood, it will end in fiery doom and hilarity!100/10.

Early Access Review
The Short of It: Don’t let the Early Access tag put you off. RimWorld is as good as finished, but still expanding, and it's an engrossing and captivating colony sim, a labour of love that offers hours upon hours of playtime and is a must-buy for people who enjoy building a community from the ground up and watching it thrive in the face of adversity… or wither and die because of a few poor decisions.The Long of It: RimWorld puts the player in charge of a few crash-landed settlers, stranded on an unknown world after their ship crashed, because of course it did. After the player makes sure the colonists’ immediate needs are met, such as food and shelter, the real work commences, and in order for the colony to survive, it will have to evolve, expand and research, as well as trade with neighbouring settlements for the resources it desperately needs, or desperately defend against them.What sets RimWorld apart from other colony sims is its colonist system. Colonists are all unique, and the player will have to make sure to keep an eye on what they’re good at, what they like and don’t like, and which colonists need to be around – or avoid – each other. Occasionally, enemy factions will attempt to raid your settlement, and you will need to keep evolving in order to withstand their ever strengthening attacks. Meanwhile, your colonists will be busy crafting items, constructing buildings, tending to the animals, hewing stone, researching new technologies, sowing the fields, hauling lumber, and countless other tasks, which they execute more or less automatically according to the priorities you give them. A player who sets his priorities carefully, can take up a monitoring function as the colonists take care of everything that needs doing, if (s)he decides to.The Right of It: RimWorld has many very strong features, and one of them is the personalities it gives to your colonists. They are semi-randomly generated, with a diversity of looks, skills and traits, making them all unique and possessing an actual personality, and they develop social relations with other colonists, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and these social relations can lead everywhere from joining another colonist in marriage to starting a fistfight at someone else’s marriage. Keeping them all happy is involving without ever becoming a chore, and you just can’t help but care about every single one.RimWorld’s gameplay is very solid, and the priorities and areas function lets you automate work, but still gives you a lot of control, eliminating the tedious parts of managing a colony but keeping the interesting ones. You can manually command colonists whenever you want, or even take full control of them when you need to give them detailed orders, for instance when they need to defend against a raid. Even better, while RimWorld is by itself already very polished, the game is fully modular, with an active modding scene which constantly delivers all kinds of content, ranging from small quality-of-life tweaks to big content-adding mod packs. Another nice touch is that instead of simply choosing from a shortlist of cookie-cutter difficulty levels like “Easy, Medium, Hard”, RimWorld also offers you several narrators to choose from, who don’t really make the game harder or easier, but different. And yes, the narrators too, can be altered or expanded upon by mods. Tynan Sylvestre and Ludeon Studios regularly update the game, often incorporating mods or acknowledging their ideas and including them in the base game, and so far, it seems like the influx of content, both official and from the modding community, is showing no signs of stopping anytime soon.The Wrong of It: There is really very, very little that is wrong with RimWorld, but the one thing that I did notice was that in the late game, you’re often forced to remain mostly static as you wait for opportunities to get a hold of some of the resources you can’t grow or craft yourself, like plasteel and uranium, and that’s a bit of a shame. But honestly, even static time in RimWorld is enjoyable.The Last of It: RimWorld is well-deserving of all the gushing reviews. It’s one of those rare jewels: an indie game crafted by a developer who kept going strong and never lost interest in the project, made with pure love for the craft. It really is one of those games you sit down to play ‘just for a half hour’ and before you realize it, it’s three in the morning, your tea is cold and payment of your taxes is four weeks overdue.

								Take Dwarf Fortress and Banished, blend together until smooth.Spread liberally onto a thick slice of classic Lost in Space themes.Sprinkle lightly with Prison Architect, for flavor.Serve with a generous side of Spaghetti Western.Comes with an intriguing AI and hypnotic soundtrack.***  I've played Rimworld for many months in the pre-Steam alpha, and it's about as engrossing as they come. Can't recommend it highly enough; it's the game that makes losing fun!  ***			"

								Day 1 - Crashlanded on strange alien planet. Low expectations, tons of joy - this is looking up!Day 4 - We have individual bedrooms finally.

Thanks, crazy boar.Day 13 - Crazy boar ate Charolette.Day 24 - Traders stopped by, I bought all their food. Should probably figure out how to grow my own.Day 36 - Potatoes planted! Let's make this colony a town!Day 38 - We've struck compacted machinery! THAT MEANS SOLAR PANELS WHOOOOOOTTTTTDay 42 - Dave is much more chill thanks to the air conditioning.Day 56 - Dave is too chill, thanks to smokeleaf. Seriously, Dave, go sow the edible* crops this time.Day 62 - A neighboring faction stopped by with a few items to trade. Instead of buying their wares, I took them all hostage.

								Day 1 - Wick, Adam, & Amber are flung onto the unknown grasslands of a strange planet. Adam & Amber, being lovers, clutch on to one another for safety. Immediately all three, under the influence of a cursor, carve their way into a mountain that has only one entry point and make some beds from the poplar trees they found nearby. A stale survival meal gives them nourishment for the night.Day 3 - The food supply cannot sustain with the eight survival meals remaining. Adam becomes the farmer for the group and begins planting potatoes, wheat, and rice. Amber begins hunting nearby game and making a freezer for the meat. Wick is still digging into the mountain. Wick is found to be the rival of Adam. No wonder he looks at him with disdain!Day 7 - A week has passed. Wick has recovered steel, components, and other materials from mining. He begins researching a new form of crafting for the group. It seems like Wick is doing all of the work. Adam and Amber are happy that they are still together. A caravan from another group comes by. They exchange an assault rifle for some of the group's rice and potatoes. Wait, was that all of the food? Wick is furious.Day 12 - Amber has killed nearly every animal (or things that even move) in the area. The freezer is full of meat and potatoes now. There are enough meals to last the group through the winter for sure. The group decides to name the town ""Myro"". They also decide to call their group ""The Black Sun Empire"". Pretty lofty for three space dweebs, but it has a nice ring to it. Defences are made. A vistor, Sheckly, decides to stay with the group. He takes the place of Wick. Wick is now in charge of defences (and planting flowers).Day 26 - The settlement has grown into a small village. Pigs and boars have been tamed. A Llama wanted to stay in Myro. An entire farmhouse/pigpen has been created for the new domesticated animals. Life is well in Myro. Everyone smokes Smokeleaf and is at ease. When raids come, the settlers close the main gate and send out the three guards, with Wick at the helm of the town's defence. The town has an election. Adam is chosen as the leader, as most people connect with him since he is a farmer and populist candidate. Wick becomes jealous.Day 31 - It is a quiet day in Myro. The total population of the town is now 19 citizens. The farmers are out in the fields harvesting and planting. The tailors and smiths are crafting away. The lone artist, Zeko, is sculpting another wacky statue. However, Wick and Adam get into an argument outside of the gates. Adam lands a punch on Wick, but Wick draws his pistol and puts a bullet straight through his head. The town guard come out and see Adam's head blown open with Wick standing over him. They do not arrest Wick. He buries Adam in a shallow grave outside of town. Everyone asks where Adam has gone when he isn't back in town by nightfall. Wick says he has no idea, but that he knew Adam was becoming very stressed by leading the entire town. The citizens want to wait a few days before they have another election. Amber knows what really happened, but is too afraid of Wick to say anything.Day 38 - A week has passed since Adam went missing. The town decides to move forward with the election. Wick is the new leader of the town. He immediately has Amber framed for the murder of Adam, since she thought he was seeing another woman. Probably Elise, the nurse who always takes care of his wounds. Wick throws her into the town's jail, which is located out of town for some reason. There is to be a trial, but no one comes in defence of Amber. The town needed a scapegoat, and Wick knew just who it should be.Day 43 - Amber has been found guilty. She is to be executed. Wick is waiting in the center of town with the rest of the citizens while Amber is dragged by the guards. Wick proclaims that Amber needs to confess her crimes, but all she does is spit on his face. Wick smiles, wipes it off, and pulls out his pistol. Wick looks Amber in the eyes and pulls the trigger. Now the true era of The Black Sun Empire has begun..._____________________________________________________________Overall, this game is one of the best I have played in a long time. If you use your imagination a little, rich stories can be crafted during every play-through. The mechanics are fairly simple and the characters are amazing. This is my first review, so...FINAL VERDICT: 9.5/10The devs are working very hard to bring more content to the game. Hopefully it will be enough to better the score I give it! :)			"

								I live in a 3rd world country so i gotta be careful how i spend the little money i have.For that reason i only play free games. The only bought game i have is cs:go.  But this game i bought.That says a lot.    Don't mind the hours i've played, i hit up the game on daily basis at work with no steam on.  Love all the ways you can fail in this game, can't believe i'd ever enjoy failing in a game more than winning it.   For me it's easily 10/10, i personally predict that upon release it should be bigger than Stardew Valley and compete with it for indie game top. All the mods potential and generally the potential of the game is big.			"

								This game, Simply Terrific.I love this game. Because i've tried to get into Dwarf Fortress but it's not my thing personally and the only 2 reasons for this being are the graphics and the hud. Otherwise the game would be amazing and amongst the best of all games, but we're talking about rimworld here not dwarf fortress. So let me tell you some pros and cons for this game and the reason why you should really get it because it is definitely worth getting it.Pros: - Now i'd bet most of you found this game through other similar games like as i had already mentioned before Dwarf fortress or banished. There is a Genre for these type of games which i'd like to call: Colony management [Now not only is this game fun for all the people who played similar games but also for new people, which in my opinion is a pretty big Pro]- I might be wrong about this, but i've experienced absolutely 0 bugs about this game and i think that for a especially an Early Acces game this deserves a Pro.- It's incredibly Unique. I actually like that Tynan(The main game developer) didn't copy too much from games like Dwarf fortress which he based this game on.- Challenging, the game keeps you at a constant pace of difficulty to keep you satisfied and not bored, although there is an option to change that for example the Randy random mode.- [Last words]To top it off the developer of this game is amongst the best i've ever seen, because not only does he listen to the communities ideas and suggestions, but he also involves into it! Though that might change because the game is getting very popular very fastCons:- This may sound ridiclious but can't think of any at the time i'm writing this.Suggestions:- Some big suggestions i had that everybody would love to see probably,- Vehicles and Rideable horses, this could really make the game interesting and with the new chemfeul added to the game (alpha 16) it may even get added soon.- y - levels Could not only be strategicly cool but also more realistic AND in Buildings.-  Multiplayer, This is probably the biggest thing. I mean the game could be so fun if this was added here's why and how i think it could be implented:So with the recent update (Alpha 16) Tynan has released your colonist being able to form caravans and form colonies on other maps, he also made it possible to have a spherical world map and litteraly look around on this map!The way i think multiplayer could be possible, is if players would just find a colony on the planet and play, it would be kind of like the game Rust where you make bases and the objective is to raid other people to become ""The king of the hill"" (Not originally called). Some incredible unique features to the game:- To top this post off entirely i just wanted to list a few features that were definitely worth mentioning- a Spherical map. This feature has been recently added and is one of the big things the game has you can see it in the pictures on this very store page!- Multiple colonies being able to play on multiple maps is something i'd never thought would happen and it's amazing.- Drugs, lol this is kind of a funny one, you can litteraly drug your people and make them stoned some of the descriptions in their "" Needs menu""  where you can see your colonists thoughts and need are sometimes hilarious. Also you can create drugs yourself which is also very cool.- The health system is very well made Not only those it conclude Illnesses and infections, but it also lets you perform surgeries for example. The health system is also very realistic as doctor colonists can fail them or that a room has to be clean to have a higher rate of succes.Official Final Words: Would i recommend you this game? Definitely is it worth the money? Yeah it's a decent priceIs it for arcade players? See here's the problem, this game might not be for all people. Same goes with the game Dwarf Fortress if you are not willing to learn the game mechanics, or you can't quite cope with loss i wouldn't recommend you this game. Rimworld is trying its best to make it appealing for everyone , which in my opinion Dwarf Fortress fails alot in.Thank you for reading everyone have a great day :)			"

								So after quite a bit of playing I finally won a play through and I feel good about myself. It all started with three colonists. a builder, a hunter, and a farmer. Thanks to rng they had a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains. they set up a very easily defendable choke point at the opening of the valley and it goes from there. more people show up along the way and this colony thrives. with little threat from raiders and limited spots for bugs to spawn they grow and grow. Then the diseases hit. progress completely halts for days at a time as everyone becomes a doctor in order to survive. Eventually everyone save the janitor has 7+ skill in medicine. Once the plagues let up the colony gets going again. the hunter eventually becomes more robot than man often singlehandly taking out raiding parties with trusty sniper. The colony starts enjoying their riches and builds and builds and builds until 21 people are swimming in silver and carpet. Not even the robots can touch them.  Finally the colony is at a point where shipbuilding is a very real option and start the ground work. getting 21 people into space isn’t exactly easy on the steel bank. Eventually people start dying. First to go die to a massive raiding party of over fifty pirates. Just their luck to have two separate factions attack at the same time. The next two were caught outside when a pack of man eating boars ran between them and the valley. our friend the hunter was also with them, but he survived his injuries with only requiring a new eye to match his other bionic one. After that came the bugs. They had grown in a new spot this time, one where they werent easily removed. Our brave hunter shot a hive full of fire and ran to wait out the aftermath. The fire spread, it spreaded too far! It felt like it was everywhere and it took the efforts of everyone just to limit the damage. People were fighting both fire and bugs as well they could trying to protect the nearby hospital and medicine stash. One by one colonists fell, only to be pulled out of the fire and rushed to the medical beds they were trying to protect. Our humble builder ran through the fire trying to save his friend only to be attacked by one last vengeful bug. Their dual shall be talked about for ages. Punch after punch, blow after blow they fought until the fire surrounded them. With no way out our builder downed the megaspider and grabbed his fellow colonist desperate to make it through the flames. But alas, his wounds proved to much and he collapsed surrounded by fire, his last deeds in vain as they went up in smoke. The heavens themselves cried at his passing, putting out the flames that had claimed three lives that day.  Desperate to forge on the remaining colonist realized that if they dismantled their power grid they would have enough materials to finish the ship. working as fast as they can all but two of the cryosleep pods were complete before raiders attacked taking advantage of the now seemingly defenseless colony. seven raiders fell to well placed traps while seven more made it to the no longer functioning turrets. Time was running out and one colonist knew what she had to do. Calling all five of the colony's pet boars and their one turtle she charged into battle unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe and its supervisor. With fire in her heart and steel in her soul our farmer tore into the remaining raiders dropping three of them in short succession with her bare hands. She drove the raiders off buying the builders plenty of time to finish the ship. Ignoring her wounds she climbed into her pod saying goodbye to the brave boars and turtle that gave their lives that day. With nothing left in the valley but the two remaining boars and enough food to last them till they die of old age the ship took off never to be seen again. 10/10 would ride a herd of boar into battle again.

								This game....I started playing back in the early alphas and I have been playing it for the year and a bit since. The amount of time and attention Ludeon puts into this game is staggering, they have listened to our feedback at every step and the result is the glorious thing you see before you. Those that know me know I love modding so this game was pure heaven for me, so much so I have spent the last year of my life solidly modding this game and nothing else. The game is robust, the simulation of things like bodyparts, health and relationships is crazy, the gun fights are epic, the diseases, the insects, the farming I dont see my love for any of it waning anytime soon. If you do finally get bored of all that, theres a healthy modding scene with a enough content to make 4 or 5 more games. So yeah.For the stories it creates to the giggles I get from the community, for the happy feeling i get everytime i hear Als guitar, great work Tynan, Ison, Al and others at Ludeon.Thankyou. Now, Randy, No squirrels this time.			"

								I have two questions, why is this game early access and is it the best game ever made ?  108 hours and I only installed it a week ago, obviously I've not slept much and had to take 3 days off work. Dont buy this game, it will wreck your life as it has mine.I installed it at the same time as doom and mad max and I've not even looked at those, this game now controls me. I will say the first 5 minutes I almost rage quitted as couldn't make anything do something, I'm glad I made it through those first few minutes although it came at a cost of insomnia. So I normaly play games on a hard level, no reason to be any different here with a cutsie looking game, WRONG, I chose hard setting and permafrost mode, things went well for an hour or so was just building rooms, thinking this is  nice, then a small raid turned up, i killed those got some weapons and I'm thinking I'm great. Then a flash flood, with lightning, nothing bad happening with that or so I thought, the rain stopped but the lightning carried on for a few more seconds enough time to start 3 small fires miles away, I figured I'd leave the fires to do their thing then a couple of days later ( ingame days)  I was surrounded by this wall of fire, my 4 chars are doing their best to stamp out the flames but 4 people with no water dont stand much of a chance and so it turned out, a few minutes lates my whole building is burnt to the ground and my people are dying, I quit, chose an easier setting and kept permafrost mode ( wrong again ) . Had to quit again, I'm now playing on the second to easiest setting with no permadeath and I specialy chose my survivors before starting this time. This game is incredibly fun, but you are only seconds away from dissaster and having everything erased right before your eyes. My advice is save regulary, dont select permafrost, or atleast until you know what you're doing. I'm not sure the 3 storytellers make any difference , they all seem to throw anything at you.This game is hard but very rewarding, you will care about your colonists and even their slightist injury, the enemies are not clue dead either, they will look for cover to shoot from, forcing you to do the same.So is this game better than Rome, my favourite game of all time, hard to say ,been so long since I played rome but if I had Rome installed, I would still be playing rimworld.

Early Access Review
								 I generally do not Leave reviews for a game. Least of all for one in Early Access.First and biggest issue and perhaps the only gripe that I have with this game is the instability of your saves between builds.PRO TIP: If you are planning to have a modded playthrough(and you should ; totally revamps the gameplay) make a vanilla Save prior to adding any modsNow for the actual review of this game.I have spent a total of 128 hours in this game. making it my 4th most played game ever and that time is split between two playthroughs (the first one I had to end because of the aformentioned reason).I generally do not admit to save-scumming,  but in this game, I did so shamelessly. Not because I was afraid of losing valuable members of my Tribe, but because I couldn't bear to continue without them. Spend enough time in this game and their patterns become yours. The ""One more Day"" rule applies here way more than your would first believe and soon  enough, the Sun in rising and even the Real World clock that you can enable in the HUD does little to nothing to stop this complusion to continue.Now for the reason to Buy:This game is Hard and random and gets harder and randommer the more you play. every decision you make creates a snowball and before you know it you have created this monster of a settlement cleared out one small tile at a time.Reason Not to buy:The level of involvement you get out of the game is based on the amount of time you invest in it. Seeing as the game is in early access, any update to the core Build or any mods that you might add could end up wasting hours of progress. Making that save unplayable (as in the save will not load). I went 3 months without playing pricesely for this very reason.Final note.Make sure you are willing to live with the decisions that you make in this game. The Following is the Story that unfolded in my Tribe that led me to get to the end game.I was happy to keep on playing the game with no real end, even though I had my spaceship built. But my hand was forced.I had 3 married couples in my tribe. One guy( I had named him The Miner as he was good at mining) started an affair with another female in the tribe ( causing destress to him and his wife and the female he was having an affair with). A few days past and the Miner's Wife started an affair with another Male member for the tribe. A few Bedroom Re-assignement later> The wife and husband are sleeping in different rooms with their lovers.But the writing is on the wall. This can't continue and soon enough the relationships will keep on getting too complicated to the point where it would be just utter chaos.So I load everyone except the Miner's Mistress into the pods and then right before lift off, I extract the guy Who was having the affair with The Miner's wife. I Didn't want for all of this effort to go to waste and thought it would be a good ending in paper atleast.The last two members of the tribe, deciding to stay behind, with bountiful food and farmland and animals to take care off.I though I would Imagine them living in this Rimworld, Providing sanctuary to those that need it most.Only the game does not end with the launch.The credits roll begining with list of people who made it out in the ship and who were left behind.The usual thanks and what not continue.The music keeps playing.Then you are taken back to your settlement.The game keeps on going.And you are faced with your decision.The stupidity of mine did not occur until I saw the two go into seperate rooms.In my haste to get my first launch going, I left the two halfs of a Broken marraige that had nothing to do with each other.They had little to no relationship with each other.I check their social and see the name of their respective lover with (Dead) next to their name.The realization dawn on me. For the ones who were left behind, the ones who left might as well be dead.I quit the game. I need a Break from this. Don't even bother saving it.09/10 : Broke my heart into a thousand pieces and I love you with all of them.			"

								I made the wise choice (After reading other reviews) to not go with a Permadeath scenario on my first build. In the end, I chose Cassandra Classic and left it set to Base Building. What follow is the thoughts and events through my first ten hours.Day One: Dear god what the hell do I do? Complicated! Agggh! Oh wait...Building stuffs is here. Let's see if I can't make a house over by this mountain?Day Two: Why aren't my guys doing the things I need them to? Oh. There's a thing for priorities. Sweet! Lets see if I can't force them to mine into this mountain so I can have a cave fortress!Day Three: OH GOD NO IT'S TOO EARLY TO BE RAIDED- Oh wait it's just one person. Alright! Big burly shooter bloke, up you go! Time to shine! Oh. You didn't kill her? She's stunned on the floor bleeding to death...We-ell...I suppose I can take her captive and have my Doctor look her over. At the very least, good practise for the future. Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ How do I make a prison?Day Four: Captive resting up. Doctor successfully handled all the wounds...Wait a minute...Infection? In her leg and torso? ♥♥♥♥. What do I do? Just let the Doctor handle that I suppose? Day Five: ""Immunity 96% - Torso."" ""Immunity 94% Right Leg""...Does this mean the infection is becomming immune to my medicine?♥♥♥♥♥♥ I better get the Doc to amputate her leg. At the very least, it's more practise...Waaaaaaaait. Immunity is at 100% and infection is going down? I'm a fblooming idiot... Can we reattach the leg? No? Well.♥♥♥♥♥♥ Let's stick a peg leg on her...Uh...Sorry to get off on the wrong foot there...Day Six: Despite shooting her four times, serious infection and a...Less than needed amputation...She's survived. Now, she's laying there captive with a peg leg, probably thinking she's been captured by a bunch of cannibals or something, since she clearly didn't need to have the leg off...I'm going to recruit her. Should be simple right?Day Seven: Prisoner doesn't want to co-operate? I can't imagine why...My hospitality has been impeccable! It'll have to wait, because my land is being ravaged by a pack of...Hyper intelligent beavers? Uh... Okay? I hope the colony likes beaver meat.Day Eight: Figured out how to tame a boar. Beavers are all dead. The prisoner has finally decided to join us...Riiiight as a dry thunderstorm hits and sets half the map ablaze. In the ensuing chaos of frantic firefighting, our newest recruit, Tail,  gets inadvertently set on fire. So she's back in bed again, recovering.Day Nine: Fires are all out. Given everyone a full day of freedom to do with as they please...Aaaand another raid. Lovely. Hang on...Are those -grenades- that caveman is lobbing at me?! There goes my Hunter. Thankfully he scares them off before having to be hauled off to the impromptu medbay.Day Ten: Just as I finish making a bedroom for everyone and a spacious walk in fridge for my food, a trading caravan comes in. Oh! They have a prosthetic leg! I'll take that and replace that awful peg leg on Tail. That'll make up for removing her leg, right? Maybe...And now the caravan members are fighting each other...One killed the other with her fists? Impressive. My hunter couldn't even kill someone with his rifle. Remind me not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off ""The Town In The Cave"" faction. And they didn't even take their fallen brother's weaponry and armour? Excellent! Time to give my Hunter a nice shiny new sniper rifle and armour set!Day Eleven: My poor tamed boar just got attacked by a Grizzly. My hunter attempted to save it...But it perished regardless and the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off bear is rampaging amok! And...Oh. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Tail's just had her arms torn off...Day Twelve: Tail can't do anything anymore. She has no arms and only one leg. Her mental state is dropping rapidly now that she's bedridden. I don't know what to do.Day Thirtreen: The batteries keeping power to my cave area just blew up. They were right beside my hurried Medbay area. The problem with Tail was resolved through fire.Day Fourteen: Buried the mutliated body of Tail. Everyone's mood is down the pan. My hunter has taken to wandering naked and cloud watching all day. My heart is broken. I failed that poor pirate girl. It would have been kinder to just let her die in the wake of her raid.At this point, I called it a night. What I anticipated to be a couple hours game time turned into an entire day. Despite all the feels I have right now, I fully intend to pick it up again tomorrow and start afresh. Now I know how the game works, I pray I can make my colony something worthwhile. If you're on the fence about buying this...Seriously. Do it. The first half an hour is a nightmare to pick up all the mechanics and functions of each and every button...But once you go past that point, it becomes a glorious mess of emotions. I've never felt regret like this over a one legged depressive former pirate in my life.10/10 would maim my potential recruits again.			"

								Three colonists crash land in a forest. ""Young"" and ""Walsh"" hit it off immediately and get engaged. ""Hun"" is a hard worker that gets things done.Compound slowly expands over time, including steel buildings completely surrounded by a steel wall. We are invincible.Get a distress call from an old woman running from some angry tribals. We save her and kill/capture the tribals (their bow and arrows are no match for our rifle and pistol). She joins us and becomes our charismatic chef.Get another distress call from a big geologist. Prepare to fight tribals, instead put up against trained soldiers in nano armor and energy weapons. Find out that we are, in fact, not invincible. Hun is killed, Walsh is downed (but rescued by Young), and the old woman disappears without a trace (seriously no idea what happened to her, no corpse or anything).We managed to down one of the soldiers. Young equipped his armor/weapon and killed a second soldier causing them all to flee. Walsh gets better and both he and Young are fully equipped in nano armor with energy weapons. Now we are definitely invincible.Another group of tribals attack. They are pathetic and quickly killed outside the walls by my new energy weapons.Wait, what is this? The energy weapons set the corpses on fire? Wow that fire is spreading quickly...**5 minutes later**The entire compound is lost and half the map burnt down before it finally started to rain. Apparently those weapons run on jet fuel because my steel walls and buildings were no match for that blaze. George W Bush would be proud. RIP trapped prisoners and that group of visitors from the other colony sleeping on my floor.I guess sleeping on the floor in the ruins of the compound was bad for morale and the geologist we saved earlier snaps and starts stabbing Young. We put him down with energy weapons. Thank god there is nothing left to burn.Young eventually snaps too and starts attacking her fiancee. She is downed but survives and is healed up by Walsh (thankfully he is a doctor).Deciding that staying in the compound ruins is probably a bad idea, we move on to find some shelter elsewhere. What's this? Some kind of ancient structure? Well we have nothing to lose so maybe it will make a good temporary shelter.Break through a spot in the wall, get attacked by giant bug robots. Run around the back and draw them out, then swing back around to enter the structure. Hah, stupid robots. There is something on the ground, looks like it does something to animals...maybe it will tame the ones nearby, I could really use the help.Activate device, animals go into a man-killing rage. Every single animal on the map rushes to the structure. Young and Walsh go down in a literal blaze of glory as the swarms of animals attacking them are set on fire by the energy weapons.10/10. Now I understand why the alien races in movies never trust humans with advanced technology. "

								JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY, SERIOUSLY.So, in my first experience with this game I played the game for almost 10 hours straight on permadeath mode. Decided to take the Randy Random storyteller as an option.Here's my story. ..3 crash landed survivors. 2 brothers, in a spaceship, and then a meteor hit...err...Yeah so they landed on the planet in the far northern reaches, and built a sweet settlement. Had some visitor’s quarters that could house like 10+ people (ty mods). As our three adventurers went along, they recruited another 7 wanderers to join their settlement. In the first year’s winter, the old lady of the group lost her mind and decided to walk nude into the wilderness...everyone was sad when she died and a few settlers visited her grave for months after. Many raiders attempted to steal what the settlers built and grew, but through blood and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kiting tactics, they survived. After the first full year, there were now 11 people in the settlement. Traders were a common sight, and the raiding had cooled off through the second winter. There were squabbles here and there, and the occasional rampant animal or man hunting pack of wild beasts. Overall it was quite peaceful; the settlers were able to create a life on this wild planet. They had gardens, electrical systems, defense grids, and even a hydroponics farm being built...and then it happened...They came from the sky, 3 of them. These monstrosities in metal armor crashing through the roof of the home. They started with the scientist, gutted her right in front of the youngest one. She lost it and ran into the woods. Then the settlers banded together. They waited outside of the laboratory doors. Those steel encased doors that can hold back even the wildest of beast or raider. 9 people fully loaded with every ounce of firepower they had to offer. Even some EMP grenades they had scored off a few raiders who were unlucky enough to catch a few settlers hunting. They didn't stand a chance. The doors came down like butter. The trade caravan that had been there, fled as soon as the fire started. There was nowhere to run. The metal beasts shrugged off every round fired, even the heavy machine gun couldn't penetrate their armor. They barely scathed these monsters. 7 people went down in the melee. Only two escaped to run to a safer place, maybe the doors of the freezer would hold them out, and they would leave with some goods and let them live? That's when the beeping started, ......... has burned to death, .......... has burned to death. It kept saying it, over and over until they were gone. All but two, but the monsters weren't done. They broke the freezer doors down, knocked the final two unconscious and lit the rest of the encampment on fire. They all died, slowly. First from stab wounds and power fist wounds and then they were burned to death...that was it...game over...maybe someone else will find use of the ruins of this place...?Seriously though, I was stuck for 10 hours almost playing this. I couldn't step away from this crazy story that was unfolding. If you are even considering it, buy it. You can return it if you play it for less than 2 hours. BUT, I doubt you will be able to put it down.			"

Text Summary:I used to love dwarf fortress, but never could get used to the control scheme. This game has the foundations for the same scope and scale, but it's not there yet. But what is here is a solid foundation, the core loop for the building, expanding, relationships and the foundation for the various aspects of progression, i like the entire scale and way trading works and the way crafting expands the abilities and scope of the game.Sadly the assets and abilities are not there yet, and it needs massive expansion - but the base assets are great and core gameplay is VERY well put together.currently a very solid gameplay experience, but gaps in both story and world are readily apparent, and are logical instead of abrupt. Clear places where content is waiting for the developers to add and the modding community to expand.I personally am not a fan of the sound design and assets, as i feel they are very sub-par in conveying information. The UI and general Graphics also need a ton of work, between displaying alerts and positions (especially on higher resolutions) and character animations.Where i am a fan of is the enticing pull of one more try when your colony dies of starvation and when you get eaten by a mystic horse or when you get killed by raiders or when....but... I still restarted my next colony after starvation killed my previous and i already cannibalized half my people and had them eat their loved ones.... and that is pretty damn good for a little indie game just hitting Early access.tl;dr : the foundations are solid			"

Well, ain't such a bad spot for a colony after all, I guess. Been here for a year and a half, having enough food, electricity, even a bunch of nice houses an' a little hospital place for me to work and take care of our people, as you see. Three more joined us after we crash landed, uhh... weirdly enough, one of those is the sister of my friend Matt. What's her face... A yeah, Yoko. Then we got Sullivan. Ugly, poor guy... Ain't good for much, but at least he's having fun sweeping the floors. And then there's Lynch.That lady got by us, because she was chased by some tribe folk. I don't know what she did, but those guys sure were mad at her. Well, whatever. She's got the aiming, was a scout before, she told us. But no use getting much out of her, anyway. Seems like she doesn't like man that much, always giving us that nasty stink eye... When she arrived, she had constant, terrible pain in her chest. Turned out she had lung cancer, growing. Not good.You gotta learn to deal with that. But you also gotta learn to deal with those darn tribe idiots, trying to raid our little home sweet home again an' again! That one time there were five guys, with clubs and bows. I don't know why they're still trying that... but our rifles and pistols sure get the job done. Maybe my aim was a little off or something, three of these savages survived. So, we pick them up off the ground, pack them in our little prison cell and start the medical treatment, because we're good folk, we ain't killing for fun just because they're hostile and so on... However, that one poor boy, only seventeen I believe, Matt made a fine swiss cheese out of him. No way that boy's gonna make it, I said. But weirdly enough his chest was still ok.I know... You're not supposed to talk about stuff like that but... whatever. I mean, one of our girls was in dire need of a new lung, y'know what I'm saying? Nobody really liked the idea, that's a given. But nobody stopped me either, when I prepared the surgery. Someone's gonna do the dirty work, Wilson, I say to myself all the time. And so I did.Surely enough, a few days later Lynch approached me because of that lung. Even if she doesn't like man, everybody know's here that I'm the doc and I know what I'm doing. And getting her a new, healthy organ was my intention after all. I'm telling you, it was like some Frankensteins movie or something, a storm outside, thunder clapping, as I prepared everything. But I ain't some crazy scientist, I got the job done, clean as it gets. Seems like I have the hands for it, ha.When Lynch awoke, I never saw her smile like that. That horrible pain she felt from that nasty cancer, well, it was gone of course. Surgery was a full success, no problems at all. Wilson, she said, seems like you're not such a weirdo after all. And we laughed, everybody was relieved. Good, hard times, I'm telling you.Well... But, whatever. I'm not really sure why I'm telling you this right now, sedation should've hit you hard enough by now. Sullivan told me he has this weird itch in his gut, sooo...... Where did I put my knife?Based on true events. That's RimWorld for you. "

								Rimworld could simply be described as a mix of Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, and Firefly. But it is so much more than that. Let us go through a standard day in rimword.Buying a hospital computer from a caravan who decide to let their animals eat all of your crops.Finding out that one of the raiders in the next attack is the brother of your colonist.Train an army of squirrels to attack you colonist's traitor brother.Too many attack squirrels died, so now your animal trainer colonist freaked out and went crazy and is now lighting EVERYTHING on fire.Trigger your fire suppression system to keep your hospital from burning down.Fire supression foam covers your entire hospital treatment room, makning everything dirty.All the dirty foam gives my sick colonists infections in their legs, forcing me to amputate them.10/10 would have colony of cripples again.That sounds made up, but crazy stuff like that actually happens. Remember, losing is common, but it can be really fun! Pick up this game for sure in you are interested, you won't regret it!			"

								In lieu of writing a detailed review where I pick apart what makes this game a work of pure genius, I'll get right to the key points that I feel make playing this game such a special experience.Rimworld is a game of imagination. Everthing in this game lends to painting a picture in your mind's eye of what your colony is experiencing. The graphics are minimalistic, with characters/animals/mechanoids represented with simple, vector ""pawns"" that move on a 2d grid. Most of the depth Rimworld provides is through text in menus and alerts. The true brilliance in this representational model is that you are free to visualize with your IMAGINATION what each scene of desperate survival looks like. Its almost like reading a book, and more akin to P&P D&D, or those old text based adventure games like Zork.In an age of hyper-realistic. AAA video games that leave nothing to the imagination. Rimworld seeks to cultivate the long lost art of creative thinking. It does so in a way that is both compelling, and (in many cases) emotional. You become attached to your pawns, colonist and animal, as well as the wellbeing of the colony itself. You are sad (or at the VERY least perturbed) when a Scyther takes your favorite colonist's head off in one shot, or your dog gets eaten by a wandering couger. The stories of Rimworld write themselves, and come to life in your mind.Pros:Simple aesthetic lends to imaginative interpretation of gameplay.Highly in depth-gameplay with micromanagement that is (largely) optional until you need it.Music is great and reminds me of Firefly (even though there are only a few tracks, I don't get tired of hearing them).Updates about the time you finish a few runs with lots of new content and bug fixes (thank you Tynan).TONS of replayability, custom modes, settings, mods, etc.Mod support through the workshop that adds to and fixes base content.Variation in difficulty with the storytellers, permadeath mode, and tradition difficulty as well as custom scenarios.Cons:Bigger maps aren't (yet?) optimized well, and can lead to lag on higher playspeeds and long load times.Some bugs and oddities affect gameplay adversely.Medical operation success rates and (inevitable) failures.Your game does eventually end, and you are always sad to see the pawns lauch off, and the colony abandoned...I just realized that this is possibly my most detailed review yet, RIP my opening statement.I know this review largely focuses on the ""deeper"" aspects of what makes this game great. The reason for that is you can always watch a ""let's play"" or a streamer or something to see what the game actually plays like. This review is simply my impressions after dozens (hundreds?) of hours crafting stories of adventure and survival in the Rimworld....Thrumbo/10			"

17.07.2016 : (EARLY ACCESS)Alpha 14Highly recommended!!This is my review after 20 hours of INTENSE gameplay.RimWorld is a sci-fi colony simulator where you've to survive in an hostile stranger planet. Everything is managed by a fantastic A.I. storyteller who creates dynamic events during the gameplay, simulating interpersonal relationships, psychology, trading, climate, biomes, diplomacy and a lot more..A typical scenario you can have in your first game: ""Your colony is formed by three mans, everyone of them with positive and negative traits. You're on a stranger planet, so you've to start to build a base, or at least a refuge for your colonists. There are a lot of dangerous things out there, such as wild animals (snakes, bears, wolves and many more) or bandits.Once you've finally your base, you've to survive, and mantain your colony happy, otherwise they'll start to fight each other, and it's not the easiest task of the game, believe me.""Gameplay and graphics is very similar to PRISON ARCHITECTS and DWARF FORTRESS (who ispired the devs).Actually is EARLY ACCESS, and probably someone of you could be scared of this, but there is nothing to worry about. The game is FULLY playable and BUG FREE, or at least I've not encountered a single bug in 20hours of gameplay. Very stable and light.Scenario is procedurally generated by seed, and events are ALWAYS dynamically created, so it will never happen to have a game like the previous one, not even if you load a previous savegame! Well, in the end, it's very rare to say in a review, that I can't find a single bad thing in a videogame, and this is one of those very rare cases.Absolutely recommended to anyone of you who loves games like DWARF FORTRESS, PRISON ARCHITECTS, and simulation games / base-building / strategy games.9.5 / 10 (waiting the rest of the content during the early access).

								RimWorld is a gritty base building / colony management game.It's similar to dwarf fortress, if dwarf fortress was gritty,and had guns and canabalism. Rimworld has a realistic healthand firefight model. Colonists can get plagues, tapeworms,malnutrition, limbs blown off, shrapnel stuck in them.Blood loss, Infections.There's also social relationships between your colonists.They all have opinions of each other. They can fall in loveand get married, and have children (if straight).They will hate their lover's killer.The game is brutal though. The AI storying telling is designedmake the best story. So as a general rule a colonist won'tsurvive more than a few weeks. Maybe I'm just a bit terribleat this game. You can harvest a prisoners organs, or yourown colonists organs, and sell them on the black market.But your colonists will get a negative buff unless they're psychopathic.But your colonists will get a negative buff unless they're psychopathicIf a colonist gets too unhappy or stressed, they can wander around anddo nothing, or more likely they'll go on a murderous berserk and attackeveryone and every animal in sight.This is one of my favourite games. I've spent many hours playing it.I've been following the development of this game for a long time,and have seen it change a lot.Tynan is a very capable developer, and one that listens to his players -he's often found on the game's subreddit.

								I own this game since mid-2014 and been playing it for hundreds of hours, again and again.Overall impression is it's such a great sim. game, per se! These are the core mechanics I particularly like in Rimworld:- Task management - Observation- Combat and survivalEarly game: you will want to survive and experience many of the things proposed by the story teller (new colonists joining, opportunistic events to help you start or that might kill you straight...)PS: starting difficulty must match with what you are looking for and able to do... Pick and choose carefully.With Alpha14, there are scenariis, so starting a new game is even more of a time, where you can plan on what your starting conditions will be.Mid game:The day 2 day job is to maintain a sane environment for your colonists to train and survive. Many events are there to make you fail at that, so make sure to plan, observe, research and develop skills to compete in your arsh worldLate game:The possibility is given to you to build a spaceship to evade from your colony, but this is nowhere mandatory. You might feel a bit bored (after quite a while and many runs), but nothing forbids you to try again with a different setup, in a different biome with other challenges.At one point, you might want to consider getting some mods as well, to enrich your experience in game.Conclusion and notes:The development process, which has not stopped during the while, made it so that I played numerous restarts, trying to get my brain around new mechanics, items and stories I could play with. Many mods have also been developed around it and it's accessibility in that regard made me love it more and want to participate.I found a great community of modders and persons loving the thing too, which in return gave me some more great moments to experience with, discovering new technics or facts I did not know about.For these reasons and even if only for playing, I would recommend this great piece of entertainment to anyone who likes simulation/tactical games.

								I like to base my purchases on how complex, challenging, and re-playable a game is.  Typically when I am looking to spend money (especially games upwards of $30) I want to know I'll get my money's worth.  I like to read other people's reviews to see not just that they rated it up, but that those who do rate it up have more than a handful of hours in the game.  Looking around at the reviews here, you can clearly see people are getting their money's worth out of this gem of a game.Having played ~30 hours I've been having an amazing time.  Rimworld is a unique blend of base building, resource management, tower defense and likely a few other genres that manages to engage you where you actually care about your colony and colonists.  Coupled with a RNG event system there is always excitement around the corner - maybe a blight will destroy 75% of your crops, or you'll be attacked by a group of rampaging bunnies (or elephants!), or a toxic fallout will sweep across the land forcing you to adapt to survive.  Even if RNG may scare you away, the difficulty ramps over time so you'll never be unfairly challenged, although you will be alerted to your weaknesses time and time again.The customization this game allows is also what makes it potentially fun for just about anyone, and the gradual increase in difficulty keeps things interesting. With a plethora of mods available and a scenario editor so you can play exactly the game you want - you can create a colony with superstars and top tier gear in a lush environment, a small group of desolate tribals trying to adapt to below freezing temperatures, a group of psychopathic cannibals, etc..  your imagination is the limit.In my latest game I had to abandon my best colony yet because of poor planning - instead of the typical raid of pirates charging into my fortified defenses (consisting of traps and gun turrets) they decided to blow open a back way into my base and decimated my infrastructure, overpowering my brave colonists (it didn't help that one of my ""smokeleaf"" addicted colonists decided to go smoke himself silly as they were tearing down the wall).  As annoying as some of these defeats are, you always learn more for next time.  I've just now started as a group of five tribals with no technology and it completely changes the way you play the game.Don't let the ""Early Access"" tag fool you - this is a complete game with a massive amount of depth, and great communication from a competent developer.  I can't wait to see what else is in store.  If this does sound interest watch a few let's plays to give you an idea of how Rimworld plays out.One other note - the soundtrack is absolutely stellar and really sets the theme.Highly recommended!

								Day 1: Three survivors crash land on an unknown planet, build a small shelter and huddle for the night. During the night a lightning strike lights the emergency rations on fire. The three shiver in the dark reliving the events of the past day in their dreams.Day 2: With no food supplies our intrepid Markus 'Seedlings' Grave takes his trusty hunting rifle and searches for game. Seeing a hare he fires a shot and hits a timber wolf who proceeds to maul him. Jannet 'Joker' Coben dashes to Markus' aid with her trusty plasteel knife and manages to wound the wolf. Jimmy 'Swan' Camble catches up to Jannet and levels his pistol at the wolf and pulls the trigger. Jannet takes the round in the head and dies instantly. The timber wolf seeing new prey sprints towards Jimmy. Fortunately; Tugboat, their yorkshire terrier comes to the rescue! With Tugboat distracting the wolf Jimmy takes another shot and shoots Tugboat in the head killing him instantly as well. Unfazed by the distraction the wolf takes Jimmy down and begins eating him will Markus slowly bleeds out only able to watch as he knows he'll be next.Day 3: Debris continues to rain down on the planet.

								I know what your thinking, ""look at the graphics, and 30 dollers wtf""I said the same thing for a year looking at this game. But here is the Lowdown on RimworldIt is absolutely Epic.The depth of this game is unprecedented.In its vanilla form it truly is a vary great game,but with the workshop? which has a huge active community The sky is not even a limit anymore. If you like colony building, a bit of exploration, tower defense,and survival games this has great big bits of each in it.you will not be disappointed. My one major Con.... pawn AI. they truly are stupid as Hell sometimes.The UI does provide ways of dealing with their bad choices but it is a bit clunky in that respect. I give this game a 9.5/10 and its still in alphaalso, its a must have for any brown coats out there.It is not in the Firefly universe but it harnesses its amazing spirit very very well.			"

								I started my colony as a lone, rich surgeon who had crash landed on the planet. I named him Boris. He wasn't a violent man, and shunned fighting whenever possible. One day a strong brute joined the colony after he crash landed on the planet and I used my medical skills to patch him up to perfection. Lovely! He did the heavy lifting, Boris did the research and looked after his sniffles.Things were going well.Then she came. She was perfect. She could shoot a gun like she was ex special forces - she could mine like a nutjob on meth and her construction skills were second to none. Boris was in love. Over time he tried to woo her, but she always rejected his advances. One day, Boris noticed the other two colonists had developed a little relationship, and wanted to share a bed together.Boris felt the rage. In the night he arrested the smart, talented lady. He strapped her to the surgeons table. He removed both of her arms.At least they will never cuddle in bed.Boris was not a violent man - but he was a ♥♥♥♥ing good surgeon.			"

								RimWorld is a game of survival and management where you are stranded on a foreign planet post-shipwreck, with limited supplies and only a few survivors to work with. You don't control your colonists directly (except during combat), but rather provide jobs for them to do and you set up what jobs each colonist is allowed to do in the ""Work"" tab. You will need to build shelter, find food, defend yourself against hostile tribes, and keep your colonists from going insane. The amount of crazy mishaps that can happen in this RW are what truly keeps things interesting. Similar to Dwarf Fortress your colonists can go insane after being put under extreme loads of emotional stress, causing them to snap. RW was initially released in 2013, outside of steam, and has been steadily improving ever since. The game feels very complete and is already packed with enough content to keep you entertained for weeks. There's already a decent modding community too, which is one of RW's strongest selling points at the moment. I've put over 140 hours into this game at the time of writing this review, and I've still not seen and done everything.GameplayYou begin the game with all of your colonists standing around in a pile of resources. The first steps to survival are building houses for your colonists to live in and growing crops or hunting for food. After covering the basics, you must decide what you'll do next. Will you create some storehouses, maybe a freezer to keep your food from rotting? Will you set up some defensive walls or traps to keep your crew safe from invasions? Or maybe you'll decide that crafting a masterwork-quality chess table made entirely out of marble is more important than anything else at the moment. After awhile, you will begin to experience raids from outsiders. This can be anything from a few guys with clubs and bows, to a heavily-armed force of armored, gun-wielding pirates. Characters in this game benefit from cover around corners of buildings or behind objects like sandbags, rocks or trees. During combat, you will usually ""draft"" each individual person and control them directly, otherwise your colonists will generally carry out their normal tasks rather than actually go out and fight the raiders. You can just move a character behind some cover and let them fire away, or control their every action and micromanage them like you would in a real-time strategy. If you're not a big fan of intense micromanagement, you also have the option to throw down turrets and watch the raiders get torn to ribbons while you kick back and relax. It all depends on how difficult you made your starting scenario, really, since primitive tribesmen don't really have access to automated gun turrets. The raids will continue to grow in size as your colony's wealth increases, making the game steadily more challenging as you play.Your colonists don't just lose HP when they're hurt either, individual parts of their body are wounded. For instance if a colonist is shot with a gun, it might wound their torso or permanently shoot off one of their fingers. Your men can lose eyes, hands, legs, and even organs. Don't worry, after installing a few peg-legs, hook-hands, and golden eyeballs your colonists will be as good as new. Diseases have immunity rates, characters can develop permanent psychological conditions like dementia, and they can even start off with old battle-scars or health conditions like asthma or clogged arteries. This level of depth can be seen in virtually every aspect of RimWorld, and is one of the main draws to the game.Currently the game's primary objective is to build a spaceship to escape the planet for good. You actually get to build the ship piece by piece, too. However, leaving the planet is ultimately up to you to decide. In RimWorld, you make your own objectives, you decide what it means to ""win"". Maybe your goal is to survive endlessly and build a huge, impressive, impenetrable fortress that will last for decades. RimWorld is moreso a sandbox game than one with a strict, singular goal. As gameplay updates comes out and modders get more creative, I imagine there will be more goals as well. Compared to Dwarf FortressRimWorld takes a lot of inspirations from DF, but it is by no means the same game. First of all RW does not have strata (Z-Layer), everything occurs on a single elevation, which means you cannot dig underground or climb on top of mountains. DF is an incredibly complex experience with virtually-bottomless gameplay depth, while RW is a lot more basic by comparison. RW has plenty of depth and content to keep you entertained for potentially hundreds of hours, but comparing RW to DF is like comparing an Olympic swimming pool to the Atlantic ocean. Both are fun, both have depth, one is just on an entirely new scale. I don't think it's a fair comparison, because RW is not trying to be DF, it just took inspirations from it. It is also worth noting that RW is fairly easy to get into compared to DF. People often find DF daunting due to it's cryptic interface and vague visual style. However even without watching tutorials or reading guides, an absolute beginner will understand the basics of survival in RW.Unlike DF where huge droves of migrants regularly come in from out of the blue, RW expects you to use it's prisoner system to obtain more colonists. Sure there are a few random events that give you a new colonist here and there, but if you really want a big crew you'll have to take prisoners. Opponents who fall in battle can be captured and taken to a prison cell that you build. From there, they will need medical treatment and food. Once healed up, one of your colonists will act as a 'Warden' who can chat with the inmate and attempt to recruit them. Recruiting can take a long time, and is harder for some than others, during this time your prisoner will use up valuable time and resources. You may also choose to release them, execute them, or just ignore them and sell them off to traders as a slave later on. This system is very cool, as it allows you to sort of pick who you recruit rather than just getting handed a completely random colonist you may not even want.AestheticsWhen I originally checked out RW on steam and saw the artstyle, I was immediately disgusted. Everyone looks like hideous blobs of flesh, everything and everyone is ugly. It's like Prison Architect but worse in every imaginable way. Even as someone who doesn't really care about graphics, I legitimately find the artstyle to be both disturbing and distracting. I understand that it was designed to be simple, but there's a fine line between low-quality graphics and zero-effort visual garbage. The developer has said the artstyle is final, sadly, so don't expect the game to get prettier overnight just because it's in early access. Thankfully the game is very mod-friendly, and there are already mods to alter the visuals.The audio on the other hand, is great. RW has one of the most beautiful and cozy videogame soundtracks I've ever heard. I absolutely love RW's music. It's got a really good cowboys-in-space feel to it with some nice tribal beats to fit the uncharted-planet-survival theme, and a few of the tracks remind me of Earthbound or Faster Than Light. The music is dynamic too: relaxing and calm while you're building and managing your colony, then switches to a more upbeat track during combat sequences. The sound effects are decent as well, nothing stands out too strong aside from the occasional alert sound of a colonist dying from an extreme infection from an improperly treated gunshot wound, or the sound of a party ending -- which both use the same exact alert sound, because apparently the developer has a twisted sense of humor.Rating: A			"

								Well, you'd say, ""30 dollars for a singleplayer game, just out of early acess? Never!"" Well, let me tell you, Rimworld is the most amazing, indepth colony simulator out there. Birthed from the ideas of Dwarf Fortress (except with updated, Prison-architect-like graphics!), both the game, its creator(s) and the community surrounding it since early alphas is superb. It will have you go through an entirely different storyline of colonists every playthrough, in every enviornment you can throw on your poor three crash landers. Although its gone through its array of bugs, unbalances, and old graphics thrown out, this is very well the current peak of it's development -- With even better to come. If you're looking for a game you could play for hundreds of hours, investing in events ranging from blissful peace to pure destruction and insanity of your colony, this is it.			"

								So I had my colony of Fawge Town thriving. Technology was good, chokepoint was good. But then something happened that at the time i didn't believe was a big deal. Toxic Fallout. Stay inside otherwise you and your animals will get sick over time, collapse and die. Anyway I didnt give it much thought. However only 4 days had passed when I realised the food was running out. And the only food source I had left were my three huskies and pet Panther. It was a hard choice but I had to slaughter one of my dogs and prepare her meat so that the rest of the colony could survive.. for two more days.Day 6 I had run out of food again and this time I had to slaughter another Husky and my pet Panther which had helped me defend the colony from many raids. The day after their sacrifice was made the toxic fallout ended.. And their deaths were in vain. I have not played a game that made me think so hard on a decision. I seriously thought my colony was going to starve to death. If I make it - It's going to be for those poor huskies and pet panther =(			"

								Rimworld, the 2D colony-building simulator by Tynan Sylvester is justifiably one of the most anticipated releases of July 2016, which had a huge following way before it arrived on steam. Boasting a rich gameplay that you can mold to your liking – be it tougher, easier, or just plain sandbox where you get to build a pretty base, it is sure to please the fans of the colony management genre easily. I know I am one – I bought the game from the site in August 2015 and easily DROPPED OVER 300 HOURS IN IT before it launched on steam.If you hate reading, these are my 15 mins of honey-mouthing the game on youtube (and for a good reason at that!): 


YouTube™ Video: Rimworld Alpha 14 and so on and so forth - well worth the buy! 

			Views: 117		

			Yeah... just listen to me honey-mouthing a game for 15 minutes... Because it deserves it!		

So, in true fashion of my reviews, let’s take a look at the GOOD and the BAD.The GOOD:1. The gameplay – I will never get tired of saying that, to me, the gameplay is everything – and the gameplay of Rimworld is downright amazing. The developer has made the best Colony Management sandbox game and let the player mold it to his or her liking.2. Selectable storyteller – I would like to make it clear that “Storyteller” is a rather vague term in Rimworld. It simply represents the dangers that the game will throw at you and thus create a “story” about your colony. Phoebe allows for easier base-building (although on higher levels the dangers are just slightly weaker than Cassandra), and Randy just does whatever he feels like – including early poison/psychic ships.3. Selectable difficulty – depending on the chosen storyteller, you have 5 difficulty levels that will shape your adventure, including a permadeath option that saves the game at regular intervals, and if your colony dies, that’s it.4. Selectable starting position – since Rimworld creates exactly that – an entire world, you get to choose your starting position from a plethora of tiles, ranging from tropical forests through deserts or tundras, to ice caps. Every single square of the terrain is generated for you to play on – and all of them have their specific climate, flora, fauna and geography.5. Selectable scenarios – the game gives you three base scenarios and THE FREAKING ABILITY to MAKE YOUR OWN – you get to select how many people will start with what, under what conditions and so on and so forth!6. Selectable playing map size consisting of the exact terrain you chose to land on – ranging from fertile plains to desert wastes and  impassable mountains. You may also find some abandoned buildings to claim and thrive in!7. The map of the colony is dynamic – you are not set in a static environment where nothing changes. The map is teeming with life (unless you are on a polar cap), and can spawn various events based on the climate, the storyteller, or the weather – like dry thunderstorms, flashstorms, heavy rain, heat waves, cold snaps, and so on and so forth.8. A plethora of resources for you to exploit and use to improve your base, ranging from mineable ores to harvestable trees and tameable animals. Want to have a chicken farm? Sure! Want to have a turtle farm? Yep! Want to have a kitty or a doggy? Or both?! Or many of those?! YOU CAN!9. Meaningful research tree consisting of lots and lots of techs, adapted to the scenario you selected, or made up for yourself – in of itself, this adds another layer of management to the game, because based on what you research the game will take a certain shape. You can choose to forego early good clothing and brew beer and make your colonists happy – or rush electricity and geothermal power to give them early boost to electricity and have them live in more pleasant conditions. It is all up to you.10. Meaningful interactions between the colony and the surrounding world – the game generates a number of tribes, outlander towns and pirate bases, with which you can develop relations – be it good or bad. Sending gifts and releasing people belonging to a faction will raise their opinion of you, which in term can have them send help when you need it the most – or you can just plain anger them, kill them, and sell their flesh and skin (read: leather) for lots and lots of silver. And if that wasn’t enough, there is even the ability to TRADE with these people or even signal passing spaceships and buy or sell wares to or from them!11. Very deep strategic layer – everything from selecting your place in the world, through your starting colonist skills, to how will you play the game involves a huge amount of thinking and strategical planning. Every single aspect of the game ties so well together, it is insane. A single oversight may cost you a valuable colonist, or maybe even half your village. The game actually rewards good play, and punishes mistakes – and to its credit, not unfairly.12. Lots of ways to create an awesome looking base with lots of colors and beautification items constructed by the colonists – you are only limited by your imagination!13. Awesome value for the money – even at its price tag of 28€/30$, this game is an awesome experience, and an awesome value for the money. I dumped over 300 hours in this game and I see multiplying that play time by a ton.14. A lot of heart – last but not least, you will feel really attached to your colonists, and be happy for them when they thrive, or sad when they die or get badly injured. That is, unless you like seeing your minions suffer, in which case you can start counting the amount of limbs, noses and toes that they will lose throughout the game…And now, to take a look at the BAD.1. HUGE learning curve – if you are just starting Rimworld, I would suggest you play at a low difficulty level and get used to the game as much as you can. You really need to set a good system of farming, security, joy and safety going and improve it as you progress through the higher difficulty levels. Rimworld is a game of pain and suffering, in which the smallest oversight can wipe out half your colony.2. The soundtrack, while very relaxing and pleasant to listen to, needs to be expanded, as themes will often repeat – to the point where you may simply opt to reduce the volume to 0 and play your own music.3. No diagonal structures – hardcore builders may be rather♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the fact that they have a square grid to play with, and no diagonal walls and structures, which make some shapes look kind of weird, blocky and quirky.4. Very late game needs optimization - you may experience some game lag on very big maps with lots of items (be it animate or inanimate) on them. To its credit, the game does warn you of that, but it clearly needs more optimization.5. On a more jovial note... Torch lamps are OP man - you are really hitting 2 stones with 1 bird - not only your colonists lose the ""in the darkness"" debuff, but the temperature in the room gets raised by a few degrees. Nerf em! NOW!CONCLUSION:Grab this game without a second thought if you are a fan of any of these genres: colony simulation, colony management, base-building, city-building, or are a fan of games that allow you to get very creative in a sandbox environment. Even in its current alpha state, you will get a great value for your money, and I expect it to receive glowing, and well-deserved recommendations from both reviewers and critics. You owe it to yourself to try it and experience it.			"

								My most resent set up of Rim World was my best and my worst. I started out great. Got electricity. I had plenty of food. I had two cash crops “corn that became simple meals and herbal meds” that I was selling to the traders. Even got up to 7 people Everything was going great. Till one day. It was like every other day. Just a normal day. I just got through the hard summer and now in the fall with no heat injuries, which was a first. Everything was looking up. Then a Raid came. I have already been through a bunch. So, I knew the drill. I had sandbags already lined up in a defensive positon. I posted up all my people. All in the right spots. They all had great weapons for that point in the game. Snipers, and LMG. What made this raid different was something I did not see till it was too late. I normally check the enemy’s weapons to know what I a dealing with. But I missed one enemy, and guess what that mother f**Ker had. “FRAG GERANDES”. We starting firing. I got two of the three down. I had this in the bag till that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ threw that grenade and killed two of my colonist. It was now a bad day. One was a best friend and a fiancé. The other was a best friend to the whole group. I was also upset. I lost a great builder that day and a great craft’s man. I had to re-group the rest of the team to prepare for the big mood drops. I had to hold them together. After the hard winter and three colonists going bezerk. The winter was finally over. We hit the spring with the colonist were almost done with their mood drops. I was getting happy that we made it through with no more people dying. Plus, we even had a new couple get married. But what I learn is that Rim World is not for happy endings. The first heat wave was setting in. the problem is that this one was the worst. I had two coolers for the colonists, but it was not enough. They were going down with heat strokes. I was getting worried. But I kept my drive. I quickly threw in that new cooler, but it was not fast enough.  With only one to two more days left on that mood drop. The heat wave took out 3 of my last 5. My last two were pushing, but then the worst came. One of my last two ran out to mine something. She went down. I made my last guy go save her. I was lucky too. He knew some medical skill. I thought I could first save my doc then the rest. But then that red flashy box drops down. “MAD F**KING AMIANL.” I was like RUUUNNNNNN!!!!!, but that animal caught up to him. It bit him and he went down. All my colonist was unable to walk. I watched in shock for 10secs before I turned off my computer. I was hurt that my best colony ended up with the worst ending. The moral of the story is to f**king check every enemy, because those freaking FRAG GRENADES ARE NO JOKE. :’’( "

Early Access Review
								It's Dwarf Fortress for those of us who were always interested in its concept, but couldn't get through the ASCII wall and the learning curve, in a space setting that's heavily inspired by Firefly (so there are a multitude of worlds with varying degrees of technology advancement, and you're going to see people from all sorts of backgrounds). You're in charge of guiding a group of colonists through their trials and tribulations in one of the titular Rim Worlds; distant, isolated planets lacking in strong central government and low in population density, and your job is to get them to stay alive long enough to... do whatever you want, really. There is a clear ""end game"" goal here (build / access a ship and escape the planet), but the real fun of the game comes from developing your base in whatever way you want, for as long as you can, while surviving the ever-escalating threats that the AI will throw at you.Both in art style and construction-oriented gameplay, the game is immediately reminiscent of Prison Architect, but Rimworld is much more than that, as it's also packing a surprisingly deep combat system that demands careful planning, both while building and during combat itself, if you want your colonists to live to see another day. The AI ""storytellers"", a concept not unlike L4D's ""director"", ensures that you meet a level of challenge that, at the very least, will give you a memorable tale to share after your colonists' demise.And when the time comes and your colonists die, you WILL feel it. There are many, many easy / dumb ways to die in this game, and learning about them is part of the experience; you'll just HAVE to tell your friends about the one animal handler who died in combat, only to have one of his pets go mad from grief and butcher one of your colonists, or the colonist that sacrificed his life so you could learn about cave-ins the hard way, or the dangers of running a drug operation in a colony full of stressed people fearing for their lives...If there's one negative aspect about it, it's the fact that its tutorial is simply not good enough. Many important mechanics are barely mentioned or not even touched upon (setting work priorities manually is one such glaring omission); losing colonists because of mistakes you're aware of or gambles gone wrong is fine, but having them die because you didn't understand a part of the UI is frustrating, and there may be a lot of that if you don't go looking for tips before diving in too deep.Overall though, it's an amazing game. It's in Early Access not because of it being a buggy mess, unplayable or imbalanced; it's simply there to let buyers know that there's still more content being added to it, and the end of early access will mean the end of development for the game. I can't recommend this game enough, it's absolutely worth it at full price!			"

								So, I just realized I've had this game for 4 weeks and as a result, have a ridiculous amount of playtime on record. I regret nothing. I am absolutely, head over heels, 100% in love with this game. If you like city builders, if you like management and simulation, if you are anything like me and like games that you can play while you binge watch Parks and Recreation -- this is the game for you.The depth of this game surpasses first looks - its mechanics are similar to Prison Architect - people, moods, needs - coupled with the resources and supply lines (like Banished) that need to be overseen in order to complete tasks. At the same time, the breadth of the game creates the charm and engagement of Stardew Valley - skill trees and backstories of the tiny characters create another layer that you can dig into.... or not - one of my characters was paralyzed/braindead after to a gun fight and I tirelessly searched for a brain implant so he could return to work. It was amazing. It can be an epic colony, extravagantly decorated with all desired amenities or it can be a derelict barrack built for war. The base game is still early access, but everything in the game is smooth and there is plenty to do.If you enjoy additional control over the creation of your colony, or if you would liketo add in more options and asthetic possibilities - the mod community is very active and I have added 40+ playtime hours and counting with the ones I've downloaded.I'm excited to see what the developer includes in the future - this is a wonderful game, and I would recommend it to everyone.

								 Dingus...  Dingus was a great shot and he loved to spend time in the garden. He had a sister named blackhat. One day the battery room exploded leading to a terrible fire that spread out of control quickly. The other 2 colonists (good friends who we've had from the start) heroically fought the blaze and both died doing so. We had 2 prisoners in a small outbuilding at the edge of the settlement, seeing that the fire would soon reach there building and either burn them to death or set them free    blackhat executed them.  Not being able to stop the fire We prepaired for the end. Suddenly at the last second just before the last few buildings went up, it started raining, saving what was left.  With a few small buildings left, brother and sister were still alive but starving. In desperation dingus and blackhat to my utter disgust grabbed the executed prisoners(the fire never did reach the prison building) and set the corpses on the dining table and ate them raw.   After that it got really bad...  Blackhat , already upset at seeing her friends burn to death and executing 2 people that in the end, did not need to be killed, snapped. She just couldnt get over eating raw human flesh to survive.  She took off into the hills with her knife killing every little critter that crossed her path leaving a bloody trail of rampage and little corpses. dingus takes off after her. She aproaches 2 panthers and headlessly attacks them with her knife. dingus is almost to her. Blackhat is ripped apart by the 2 panthers just as her brother reaches her, forntunatly she badly crippled them both. Dingus finishes the job, digs a grave for his sister, but because of his absolute refusal to haul things,has to watch his sister slowly rot mere feet from her grave..  I knew this would be the end.. No human mind A I or otherwise could cope with all this trauma. The death the cannibalism, the horrible irony of watching a loved one rot because of your own lazienes.  Sure enough Dingus's mood was done in. had had a full mental breakdown  tore off all his clothes and just walked away from it all. Close to the end now soon he'll starve to death or get mauled by a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of turkey or somthing.  ..  but .. whats this?? a crashed crate full of.. DRUGS!   crashed right as I came out of my stupour. right in front of me.  well ♥♥♥♥ it lets smoke some.               1 year later 6 ppl in the colony now and things going well   dingus (while stoned out of his tree) saved a girl being chased by raiders and we've made new friends from there..  mostley dingus has come back from his drug addiction and is leading a full life.  Only thing is.. we cant get medicine,  we cant grow healthroot (no one has skill high enough) and past few traders to come through maddengly dont have any.                  Dingus catches malaria and dies in bed.   buried next to his sister in the grave he could never finish... Would be saved by last minute drug addiction only to die of malaria a year later again... 11/10			"

								I'm not really sure what I'm doing, food is running low, people are getting depressed from how bad the accomodations are on this planet. I mean, what do you expect? We are living in a small alcove carved out from the sheer mountain wall in a desolate alien planet, it's no Ritz Carlton... My main hunter got sad from sleeping on the hard rocky floor for too many nights in a row. He threw his rifle on the floor, took off his shirt and pants off and started wandering outside, eventually fixating on a wild turkey and followed him around for days. I wonder why he decided to do this?Rimworld is an attempt to replicate a semblance of Dwarf Fortress's complexity with actual GRAPHICS. I've always felt DF was one of those games that was much more fun to read about rather than play, somewhat like Eve online. From what I understand Rimworld doesn't come close to emulating DF level complexity, but it is extremely intricately detailed in its own right.Injuries are simulated all over the body(To the level that a guy can have his right ring finger bitten off by a beaver), colonists have their own personalities and wants/ skills, as well as unique traits. These make all the colonists feel more like real people as they have a semblance of personality, for example some of them won't really mind living in squalor, while others want an extravagant bedroom or nice chairs or something. You can assign tasks but not all of them can do everything so optimizing job priorities is a large part of the game's challenge. Colonists will develop relationships with one another, ranging from falling in love alll the way hating one another and starting fights. You really get the sense that yes, you can tell them what to do but they are their own self contained entities with wants and needs that require management or else on day they'll decide, ""♥♥♥♥ it, I'm out"" and start stabbing and eating everyone else or something.Combat is more interesting too, with cover based shooting, melee combat, automated turrets, traps, etc. It is much more complex than the standard ""Right click on someone and go hit him"" of other similar games.Rimworld's graphics are the simplistic, charming Prison Architect style, with similar mechanics in ""zoning"" and construction mechanics. This game has been in development for years and it shows, there are plenty of features and mechanics in this game, as well as a distinct lack of bugs (so far).My one complaint is that there isn't much of an in game tutorial, but there is a helpful advice message system which helped me out a lot. Still, I would've preferred a small mini campaign like in Prison Architect so I can at least get a general idea what I should prioritize and what I should work towards, but I'm sure this information will come with time as I mess around in the game more.Highly recommend this if you like colony simulators, it's amazing!

Early Access Review
								This is a long review, so I'll start by jumping to the conclusion:Rimworld is a graphically appealing colony management game, set on a distant world, with a strong 'wild west' vibe. If you enjoy colony management games with a good balance between strategic depth and fun, then this is a game worth checking out!Now for the wordy bit of the review:To be clear, this game was given to me over a year ago by the developer, and again, recently I was offered an opportunity to play the steam release a few days ahead of the official unveiling (Alpha 14) That being said, I'm an avid fan of the colony management genre and judge the game against the likes of Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Prison Archetect, and even the oldies like Startopia and Dungeon Keeper. First, let's get the comparison to Dwarf Fortress out of the way; Rimworld is not as complicated as DF. But then, what game could ever claim that? But Rimworld does an amazing job of distilling the fun from the complexity. You will find yourself building traps to blunt raider attacks, large industrial areas, prioritising research and even delving into animal husbandry. Whatever you do, it'll focus more on being a game, than a complex world simulation.That said, there's a lot of strategy involved, it just never feels like fun is taking a back seat to it!The visual aesthetic closely resembles Prison Architect, so if you're familiar with that game, and enjoy the art style, then you'll find a lot to like about Rimworld's clean, sometimes cartoony graphics. Rimworld also boasts some amazing audio assets and impressively atmospheric music that really helps to set the mood in the game!The difficulty is highly customisable, and combined with the detailed scenario editor, allows you to tailor each game to suite your particular skill level. Want steadily rising levels of tension and challenge as you play? Then pick an AI storyteller that will emphasise dramatic pacing and adjust in game events to match your situation, keeping you on your toes but never throwing truly impossible odds your way. Want a relaxed experience where you can focus on learning the game? Pick (or create) a scenario that affords you a generous set of starting conditions, and an AI story teller who will give you plenty of time to prepare or recover from each event... the game can be as brutal, or as gentle as you want it to be! :)Finally, as for longevity, without even touching on the topic of modding (Rimworld has one of the most rich and active modding communities I've seen in these kinds of games!) the base Rimworld experience offers enough potential to adjust your game and starting conditions that I find it unlikely that anyone will grow bored. There's enough strategy involved in making a successful colony, and enough difference to be found in the various events that might occur, that you're virtually guaranteed a different experience each time you play.In my opinion Rimworld is a solid example of a colony management/simulation game, where the raw fun of the game has not been hidden beneath the complexity of the simulation, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of the genre.

								This game is best described as either a casual version of dwarf fortress or a hardcore version of the sims.  The style of the game is very similar to Dwarf Fortress.Like in DF, losing is fun.  It's how you learn.  While it's not nearly as ""deep"" (i.e. convoluted) as DF, there are certainly a lot of things to learn.  But unlike DF, the GUI does a good job of communication and everything is pretty much self explanatory.  My favorite resident so far was a 81 year old bounty hunter who was the best sniper I've ever seen.  We rescued her from a band of pirates.  She eventually went deaf, but never really minded it.  My least favorite was a belligerent pyromaniac who hated everyone. I don't allow pyros in my colonies anymore.			"

								I rarely write reviews and most of them are just for fun, but this is probably the best sandbox game I've ever played so far. If you played Banished, Timber and Stone, Factorio, Dwarf Forest, Prison Architect you're gonna like it.What's inside it: Lots of replayability. Scenario System and difficulty settings makes every colony(or tribe) different from each other, thus providing the player with ability to customize the game as you want to. You can even create and download scenarios from other players in workshop. Tons of content. And I mean it. Game will never get boring even in the mid and late game, especially if you'll choose challenging difficulty to spice up the gameplay with some action. If you want to have more content workshop has it all. Alongside with that you have Interactive World, which will be harsh, just like the real world, but that what makes this game even more interesting.So don't let the Early Access scare you! Even if the devs will stop releasing updates it's already in a very good shape and the community makes it even better.TL;DR Just buy it already, you won't regret it			"

Early Access Review
								I think it's valuable to have a review from someone who just bought the game and not just those who have been hooked on it for years- and I can say confidently that this is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Full disclosure- I'm a long time Dwarf Fortress player, so:1) If you like DF, you will love this game.2) Don't let that scare you if you couldn't get into DF, see the accessability section below.ACCESSABILITY / DIFFICULTYComing from zero experience, it was easy to learn the game (if you don't mind losing a couple times, which I found fun). The UI is very intuitive and easy after a bit of clicking around, there are helpful pop-ups to guide you. Those complaining about a lack of a tutorial must just want everything spoon-fed to them.GAMEPLAYIf you like simulations, colony builders, that sort of thing, this is for you. It is deep, but I really think this game could open the genre to new audiences. If you don't like having to try more than once, twice, three times to understand how to be successful, this is not for you.GRAPHICSThey're good. Not the game's selling point, but suffice to say they're better than they need to be. SOUNDRimworld has a very space-western vibe, and that comes through especially in the sound. I love Firefly, so it was very appealing to me. DEV SUPPORTAgain, I just bought the game, but the developer seems very committed to his players. There are suggestion threads on Reddit that he browses.EARLY ACCESSAs stated in the description, there are little to no bugs. I haven't noticed any, at least.OVERALLIt's #1 on the Steam Top Sellers (at time of writing) for a reason. It's amazingly well-designed. It has great replayability for those second, third, fourth attempts. What are you waiting for?			"

								Rimworld is a complex story driven colony survival simulator with (pausable) real time tactical combat, which needs more than 2 brain cells to play. It's also a proof of concept that a good game doesn't need good graphics. Don't get me wrong it's not ugly, but it's not a beauty either.Instead it draws its immersion and credibility from simulating a lot of things that most games would ignore. It gives you freedom of choice, with lots of (moral) decisions. It has a huge replayability by telling a unique story with different events each time you play.Every colonist is unique, based on childhood and adulthood stories they will have or lack skills, traits and enthusiasm in certain skills. Each colonist can have his/her own customised priorities for tasks, daily schedules and outfits. Making it possible to specialize people for specific tasks.Every colonist has a simulated psyche. Certain events will improve or worsen their mood. Having a good meal and all basic needs fulfilled will boost their mood. Seeing a person die or many corpses lying around will worsen their mood. This however is also based on their traits. A psychopath will not mind the death of others, while someone with bloodlust will even like it. Masochists will enjoy pain. A ""Green thumb"" will get a bit of happiness for every crop they sew. And it's not always the enemy attacks that will kill you. Often the most critical times are after fights when your colonists are wounded and about to break from the mental stress. Mentally breaking can lead people to going crazily wandering around, leaving the colony or even going berserk. There are so many things to take into consideration, like the beauty and space size of an area, or the quality of beds and furniture which will all affect the mood of colonists.Every colonist has a body with simulated limbs and organs. Each part can be damaged or destroyed. Each part is responsible for either manipulation, movement, consciousness, eyesight, hearing, blood filtration, blood pumping etc. Those abilities are bound to the colonist's performance. A cook with only one arm and one eye would be terribly slow at cooking. An old person with only one kidney will most likely not survive an infection, or a sickness. Luckily there are (expensive) implants and bionics to compensate in the mid-late game. You can also take the morally low road and harvest needed organs from prisoners, which will negatively influence the psyche of every non-psycho in the colony. It is also technically possible to build a bionic superhuman that has most abilities improved, for a very high price of resources.Had a nudist woman once who felt constrained by her cloths so I let her run naked. She got an instant mood boost for that. Got into a fight and took a bullet to the right lung. Survived the fight and got stitched up by a doc, but left with only one lung she was permanently slowed down afterwards. I took one lung from a pirate prisoner and implanted it into her. Had the whole colony mentally on the edge for days for having harvested organs from people ...This and many other stories derive from the game's wonderful complexity. It produces more immersion than most other games which just look great, but are simply dead inside.Im playing this game since 2 years now but it never gets boring. The storyteller will trigger events every now and then, which will force you to adapt to new situations. Be it a sudden solar flare, a sun eclipse, a pack of manhunting animals, a toxic fallout which will kill everything outside not under a roof, a pirate / natives / mechanoids attack, or a fallen chunk of ancient spaceship sending out psychic waves, driving every colonist crazy the longer you wait. The game gets constantly updated with new events which will keep it exciting for a long time.Had an ancient spaceship fallen into the map, started to screw my colonists mentally. Shortly afterwards a group of natives entered the map and prepared for an attack. I sent my fastest colonist with a gun to the crashed ship and shot it. From the damage it spawned it's mechanoids, which angered some of the natives nearby. I retreaded my colonist and just watched the show. Part of the natives were fighting the mechs, the other part was on their way to my base. At that point a pack of manhunting boomrats also entered the map and started to attack the natives. Also one hare turned crazy and ran to my base (monty python anyone?) It was an epic fight, seeing all my enemies neutralizing themselves. In the end I just had to shoot the hare, while the remaining natives were fighting exploding boomrats and retreating in the end. Got a lot of loot for free. It was a good day.The difficulty is customisable both by choosing a different story teller & hardness but also by choosing a biome. Each biome plays like a different game. In a tropical area you have a lot of wood, food and animals, while possibly getting malaria and sleeping sickness. In a tundra or desert environment you have to worry about the temperature. Too cold and you can not plant anything and people might freeze to death, while most things won't spoil quickly. Grow your food in hydroponics (which are expensive and have to be researched first)  inside a warm room. This overall consumes a lot of energy. Too hot and people might get heat strokes and foot will spoil quickly when not cooled. A freezer room is required to keep food cooled here. This also defines the outfit to wear. Parkas and toques in cold biomes to keep warm, while cowboy hats and leather coats in hot biomes to keep cool.Gears and weapons are degrading, especially when stored outside. They are also craftable and the quality will depend on the crafters skill. Different gear will protect different body parts and are based by their quality values. However, research is needed for most technologies before they can be build. Trading with other factions or space traders will get you the other stuff you need. It is also possible to tame animals with a high enough skill. Those can be bred and herded for meat, egg, milk, fur, wool or leather production. The building mechanics are fairly simple, closing off an area with walls/and a door will generate a roof. (house) Mining rooms into a mountain with no support in between will let the roof collapse. For those comparing it with prison architect, it is a lot easier to build rooms or add to an existing room. I would even say it delivers a way stronger game experience with just 10 colonists than prison architect with its 100-300+ inmates & staff.It is possible to micro every colonist whenever needed on daily tasks (unlike in Banished). During attacks colonists are able to be drafted and controlled directly. Fights have a cover based system where positioning your pawns behind walls, sandbags, trees, or even stone chunks will give them more or less cover. The only thing that is bothering is the amount of friendly fire. So make sure nobody is standing in the line of fire. In every fight there is a possibility that enemies are not killed, but incapacitated. Those can be captured and taken as prisoners. What you do with them is up to your moral compass. You can either treat them right, heal their wounds and try to convince them to join your colony, or you can simply sell them to a slave trader, or harvest their organs.However bare in mind that it can be a slow game at times (fast forward is possible) and may not be easy to understand at first. But if you give it some time to learn it you will be rewarded with a great experience.Rimworld is by far my favorite game since 2 years. It gives the player a lot of possibilities, with a love for details. It is kept interesting for a long time thanks to the event storyteller system. If you like games like Dungeon Keeper, Startopia, Dwelvers, Evil Genius, Dwarven Fortress, Prison Architect, War for the Overworld or Space Colony, you will probably love Rimworld.			"

City building/clan management is my absolute favorite genre, and RimWorld is one of the best out there. Easily in the top three of all time. While the asking price seems steep - it's really not. In fact, if I wouldn't have recieved a Steam key, I would have repurchased, no questions asked. It is that good.There is so much in this sandbox. Everything is just butter and works together so well. The user interface is crisp and everything is so intuitive. The way the whole system works together allows for so many layers of complexity that you could play this forever, and it wouldn't really get redundant. The developers have somehow pulled off this amazing trick of keeping in-game options fairly generic as to decrease having to sift through layers and layers of menus, but also somehow not making it boring by only having 2 or 3 styles of chairs. The replayability is sky high. It's crazy.Of course there is a learning curve - you have to expect that with any game that is going to really be worth it. You invest some time and trust me it pays dividends in pure entertainment. It is a shame that so many people (I was one of them) think this is associated with/ripping off Prison Architect because of the art style. Yeah, it is similiar, but that is where the comparison ends. So just get that out of your head right now.With each colony I create, the experience is surreal. The music and events and dialogue all really suck me into whats going on. The night and day cycles create these great shadows that remind me of amazing summer evenings. They just did this really right.Pros:+Honestly, this game is close to perfect as far as being a clan management sim with a procedural story that is drastically different everytime+Music is some of the best I've heard for a game like this+Graphics are super crisp+User interface is awesome - great balance of everything being very functional without clutter+Metric tons of content and replayability+Very much worth every penny of that thirty bucks+Fairly easy to learn considering the depth and possibility+Artwork and graphics overall and top-notchCons:-I hate that it is confused with Prison ArchitectIf you are into clan management games - don't worry about the high price tag - get this game as soon as you can! It will probably actually save you money because it will consume your gaming time instead of buying new titles lol.			"

								I've heard so many people say that this game is like Dwarf Fortress mixed together with Prison Architect. Is that true? Probably. But having played both those games, I would have to say this is more like something else altogether. I've had this game for a long time; much longer than it has been on Steam. If you're looking for a game that delivers on the Early Access promises then stop here, buy this game, and go have fun for hours on end. Watch as your settlers fall in love. Cry as they get mowed down by raiders. Laugh as the pyromaniac sets fire to your kitchen. Chase elephants off your medical crops with a light machine-gun. Start it all again when the sun sets.			"

								It is hard to tell that this game is in early access because there is already so much content and it is so much fun! The Firefly aesthetic is simply brilliant, the music is cool and the game-play is so addictive. As I play the game, I frequently find that I have difficulty in finding a good point to stop playing. I'm always thinking to myself, 'just one more day'! After 100+ hours, I still feel like I am learning the game and haven't experienced everything. Just to remind you, this game is supposed to be early access and in alpha! Rimworld has various ways to customise the difficulty, which I really appreciate, so you can set the level of challenge that suits you. By adjusting the AI storyteller personalities and the difficulty setting, you can take your pick from relaxing base-building game to super hard permadeath experience and, indeed, anything in between. It is worth noting that the game is absolutely ruthless in higher difficulties so if you are looking for a challenge then you will find it here!The major strength of Rimworld is that it creates awesome stories and addictive game-play that will keep you coming back for more and more. I can't recommend it enough!			"

								I think the best way of describing RimWorld is Prison Architect with more going on and less control. If this game appeals to you solely through that sentence, buy it. You'll love it. If not, then let me go into more detail.First, let's take the assumption you have seen what Prison Architect is, a top-down view with people wandering around and surviving in a realistic way, you overseeing them. This game stays true to that, just with many more hurdles.Think of it as doing a 200m Hurdle Dash. Except there is a hurdle every three steps. You could get over most of them, but a lot of them you're going to stumble through, until eventually you trip up. That is this game. Struggling through an onslaught of challenges, just making it through, until one gets you.There is room for improvement. Tutorial is non-existent, luckily I am a souper-jenius and managed to understand it from messing around, but it could require some learning to get started.The game is viartually bug-free. Which is a bonus.I'm struggling for bad points, but it's really just the Anti-Beginner Missiles. Lots of people compare it to Dwarf Fortress. I am not one of these people.			"

								It's taken me a while to write this review, because I've been (and still am) split very much 50:50 on whether to recommend this title, but on balance in the game's current state unfortunately I cannot recommend it.Certainly there are some good things here, I have over 40 hours logged because the game's world and mechanics are intriguing; the graphics have a certain charm, they are more than adequate for a game like this, and it is set in an interesting and well thought out sci-fi world. Unfortunately I kept finding myself underwhelmed by the content and options that the game actually presented me with.I should state that I have played and enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, and I am a big fan of permadeath and Roguelikes in general - I have ascended in and even contributed to Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, which by the way is a free and awesome game so go download it now if you haven't played it :)The problem for me with RimWorld is that while there is a really interested structure of a game here, that structure has not been fleshed out with enough meat. For something that has been in development for nearly 3 years this is quite worrying, especially with the apparent pace of updates released by the developer. I really do hope to eventually be able to change my review, what needs to change for that to happen is that the mechanics need to feel rounded out in the core game without relying on mods. Certainly there are mods available that fix many of my concerns with the current gameplay, but £23 is rather a lot for a title that then requires mods to turn it into something resembling a complete experience.I'll conclude this review by listing some specific things that I think badly need addressing; going through this list it becomes apparent just how nearly every single mechanic in the game feels majorly lacking. Warning, some spoilers ahead, though they are very minor.1. Some bits of furniture can be ""uninstalled"" and moved to a different location, but it seems completely arbitrary which furniture this can apply to. It doesn't apply to workbenches, so if you want to move one a single square to the right you have to completely deconstruct it and rebuild it, *wasting* resources. There is a mod that makes them all movable. This mod simply switches some flags in the xml files, no more, so it would be incredibly easy for the devs to enable this (like a 10 minute job) and there doesn't seem to be any logical reason why they don't.2. Many of the workbenches have only a single option for what you can build. Would be nice to have a bit more variation, when the build queue for each bench technically alllows building many things of different types.3. Research is too expensive and makes much too big leaps. Would be nice to see a proper research tree with smaller increments of unlocking different builds, rather than typically unlocking an entire bench with all the things it can build. Weirdly there is one research option that unlocks a new type of seed to grow, but *all* the other seeds start unlocked. The research just overall seems bizarre. I can right now research (among not many other things) ""carpetmaking"" or ""ship antimatter reactor"" ... the latter only takes twice as much research as the former ... this just seems like not the right decision to be making.4. Not enough options for surgery and implants. I can harvest someone's heart or kidney but not their limbs or their eyes. I can implant bionic legs, but I can't repair a broken spine. I can't construct these bionic implants myself. It seems like half the options there. Again there is a mod that provides a whole extra set of technologies to enable all this but it just feels the vanilla tech is unfinished.5. Variation of enemies. Particular the mechanoids, there are only two types. Surely mechanoids could be even more varied than humans or critters?6. GUI. There are all kinds of odd bugs and inconsistencies and awkwardness in the GUI. Sure it's a massive improvement on DF but It *really* needs some love. There are also some basically usability things missing, for instance being able to compare the stats of two items or two characters side by side, or see a grid overview of the skills of all my colonists. When setting work priorities there is a grid where you have to hover over each cell to see the value of that specific skill, it's really awkward.7. Combat. The sometimes continual raids that the ""storyteller"" throws at you get really tedious to defend, you have to micromanage every unit, which is really jarring next to the normal gameplay which is the antithesis of micromanagement. Combat should be set up by giving colonists rallying points or patrol areas, so during a raid they will all go to those locations. Take away direct control of the units, and make the raids a bit easier to compensate. This would much better fit the gameplay of a ""colony builder"" game and be a lot more fun. Currently the best way to defend against raids is to abuse gameplay mechanics and pathing logic to direct the enemies into killboxes, which to me feels like cheating. Things need tweaking A LOT to make these firefights enjoyable. Also if you have trained any pets then they will get immediately slaughtered, probably by friendly fire. You can’t really mix melee and ranged combat at all because everyone (even those with high shooting skill) aims so badly they will just shoot your own melee dudes and pets instead of the enemy.8. Balance. The game is very hard, and switching to easier difficulties doesn't seem to change much. The ""storyteller AI"" basically decides when it wants you to die and there doesn't seem much that can be done about it. Apparently this is the point of the game. I would find these stories much more interesting if my colony had a chance to develop a bit further before inevitably getting decimated by overwhelming forces. It doesn't help that it's extremely slow and difficult to recruit new colonists, so usually losing even one or two (which is very likely to happen in any raid) is a serious detriment to any progress. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I was just not finding it enjoyable.9. Size of map, travelling to other sectors. The default map really isn't all that big, so resources are strictly finite. When you start the game you pick a spot on a *huge* world map but then you can't visit anywhere else on that map (even though factions from elsewhere can visit *you*).Well ... I think those are all my biggest gripes, I could probably think of more, but this demonstrates the scale of the problem. I could see past one or two of these flaws because there is a really interesting game underneath struggling to get out, but with this many barriers to me enjoying it I just keep not wanting to carry on with my game. I'm not sure how long it will take the devs to fix all of this, if they ever do, but we could be waiting another 3 years.			"

								Straight up, I was put off buying this because the graphics don't look that great.A few days ago, after a few drinks, I was checking my steam queue, spotted it and thought I'd give it a try - I can always refund, right?I've now played it for 28 hours in the last 3 days... DAMN! This is a really fun game, with depth, but it doesn't get massively time consuming in the resource management category.So ... my first game - this is the story of Mike, Inumi & Dave & Trixie, who is Dave's pet dog. They're the suriving crew who have crashed on a planet and need to survive.Well, other than Mike & Dave arguing over Inumi, who isn't interested in either of them, which makes them both sad, it's going ok. They even have a rifle, which Dave knows how to use.Inumi is a nudist, so prefers to run around with no clothers on. I'm not sure this is helping the community, but she's good with plants and has researched how to do stone-cutting.Mike is a vet. He's great with animals and medicine. Luckily for Dave, after he gets badly wounded by taking on a pirate raider, people are just another animal, so Mike is able to patch him up well. Oh, except for his right arm, they was shot off during the fight.Dave? He's a sherriff. Doesn't like people or fancy things, just wants to get his job done. Trickier now he only has one arm, but not impossible. He loves his pet dog, Trixie, or rather he did. She got killed in the crossfire with the raider attack. This makes Dave even more sad.Whilst I was worrying about Dave, I took my eye off what the other two were doing and then realised Trixie's corpse was gone. Huh, odd. I'm pleasantly surprised that the food situation isn't as bad as I thought though. Then I spot the ""Yorky leather"" in the stockpile. Inumi is a bit of a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ tbh.But it's ok, another lifepod has crashed near our survivor's base and, on investigating it, it contains Dave's mother! She's wounded, but Dave carries her back to the base and Mike uses his vet skills to help Dave's mum recover.On only a few hours, Dave's mum is feeling better and gets up from the bed he loaned her. Dave is still fast asleep on the cold floor, having not got a spare bed. Dave's mum though? She goes and eats the Yorky stew for breakfast and then heads to the stockpile and helps herself to clothes and a gun, then leaves out the front door.Mike & Inumi are kinda upset, but Dave goes to deal with it. After all, he's the sherriff and, it's his mum.His mum is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about being called out and draws a knife and starts stabbing Dave. I can see why he left home now! Dave panics, and blows his mum's head off with his shotgun.This makes Dave even more sad, like really, really sad.He gets back to the base, to discover that Mike & Inumi have been chatting each other up while he dealt with killing and burying his mother. Mike & Inumi are now lovers they tell him.Dave didn't think he could get more sad. He was wrong.Still, at least Inumi has a present for him ... a nice Yorky skin cowboy hat.Dave snaps.I'm now running a single-person base, populated by a guy who is going to starve to death because is massively sad & guilty and won't come out of his room. Also he can't cook.----------This game comes up with some great and flawed characters and plays the interactions against each other beautifully.Very much recommended! :D			"

								My favourite activity to do in this game is to mine into a mountain near, or in my base. Create a very small wing in the farthest area, and put colonists that have drug addictions in there, one at a time. Of course, I give them a handfull of rations, a hydroponics tray, lights, bed, TV, and sculpting desk. Steel included, and furnish the pad. Claiming the bed as their own, I lock them behind five doors. I check on them every once in awhile, to see how they're doing. Slowly they drive themselves mad, screaming and banging on the door to be let out just to get one more hit of yayo, wakemeup, flake, or booze. By the end, they've changed. Like lobotomized patients, they leave once clean. Their hell's over. But everytime they look at the drug, they run the risk of going back in this ""decontamination"" room I made. A person named ""Ceti"" is a prime example. My place has wakemeup all over it, and, unfortunately, my favourite cultist, Levi. Is a hardcore addict of it. He NEEDS this stuff to do his godly work of research, construction, and gun-fu. But Ceti here has a chemical fascination. Every ♥♥♥♥ing night he'd go berserk because he couldn't get more Yayo, so he relied on taking Levi's wakemeup. This proved a terrible move, as every night I'd see him wasting all of my ♥♥♥♥ing drugs on overdosing himself, while levi had a strict schedule. Ceti didn't follow his. The poor ♥♥♥♥. He got locked up in my decon room. He loved it at first, a great isolated place to himself. But he quickly learned, the hydroponics tray wasn't for drugs. Oh, no. It was for cotton, for him to be a valuable member of the colony and to help grow some clothing fibres. He started to binge out on food to cope with his crippling addiction to drugs. This proved a terrible move, as he slowly fattened himself up, and then slowly starved himself as a result. The crippling pain was intense, as his only things to do were sleep, watch TV, or make grand sculptures from steel. But, he made it. Malnourished to nearly fatal levels. His drug addiction got cleared. Just as he hit the floor with his bones showing. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lived, but the next day.. He got angry because ""Oh, why is levi's room better than mine!"" and the first thing he does..? Get back on wakemeup.Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ won't make it out this time. Freeloaders get the Decon room. Get those nasty lazy thoughts out, fill them with productive, happy thoughts. Lazy trash.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  RimWorld Status:  Early AccessDeveloper:  Ludeon StudiosPublisher:  Ludeon StudiosGenre:  Survival StrategyRelease Date:  16th of July, 2016Type:  Single-player General ImpressionI grew up playing Starcraft and Startopia. PC games which shaped the strategy genre at the turn of the new millennium. Both games portray Sci-Fi colonial ambitions and Startopia does take it further into detail than Starcraft which focuses more on the initial defense of settlements. More than a decade and a half later, the prospect of simulating humanity’s colonization efforts are still a captivating subject in both the film and gaming industries. RimWorld may not look as flashy as Startopia, but it has surpassed it by far in sheer complexity and freedom of choice. A pleasant surprise being only enhanced by the fact that its dev team has just debuted onto Steam. I did notice that some compare RW with Dwarf Fortress or The Sims series, but c’mon just take a look at those and you’ll find more complexity in Prison Architect (which shares even the visual style with RimWorld). All in all, the game I’m reviewing today is unique enough to fit into its own subgenre. So let’s focus on the colony survival strategy at hand!I strongly advise you play the game’s tutorial first since even if it barely scratches the surface, it will set you on the right path. RW does prefer the teaching method involving as much freedom as the situation warrants it. And those instances shall be plenty and quite random. You will have to learn from this game while actively playing it and through the many mistakes you may commit. Not entirely the player’s fault but no one said that founding and maintaining a colony in a more or less inhospitable environment, would be easy. Much of the RimWorld’s appeal stems just from how unpredictable it can be, thanks to procedural generation on a widespread scale. No playthrough could ever be similar, even with the exact same starting supplies and terrain which to settle. That may also have contributed to the lack of a storyline per se. You get to spin the tale, so to speak. In real time (with the excellent option of pausing the action whenever you please) and as a direct consequence of your activity.With trial & error taken into account, you can at least influence the severity of the events which will put your management and survival skills to the test, through the game’s Storytellers. Think of it as the Artificial Intelligence governing the less predictable part of this strategic simulation. HAL 9000 throwing the dice for you. You can choose the more relaxed nature of a storyteller which will allow you to build up your base, see your colony prosper unchallenged by raids or cruel weather effects and once you feel like you’re ready to up the ante, switch to a storyteller of increased difficulty and more random behaviour. RimWorld is first and foremost, a game about variables. It is not easy and it was never meant to properly cater to more casual strategy fans. But at least you are given a fair chance to adapt and overcome the odds stacked against you. Real life is never as kind.The gameplay when you hit that “New colony” button, allows you to choose an origin for your first “lucky” few colonists while also simulating the scale of your planet’s forced exile. Players are free to pick the location of their colony, in regards of proximity to AI-controlled settlements and terrain type. The latter will certainly influence the game to a large extent since the resources you may harvest and make use of, are dependent on soil, presence of animal and plant life as well as the temperature itself. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out just how much of a great idea would be to settle near deserts or frozen wastelands. At the very least pick arid or tundra, if you desire a decent challenge. For most players wanting to grasp RimWorld’s mechanics without the feeling of accomplishing a chore, pick locations within a temperate climate.Once you pinpointed the colonial foundation it is time to build, survive and prosper through constant expansion on the map and especially through trade with the neighbouring settlements. I’ve yet to reach that final stage, since it’s obviously a time consuming process which also involves careful planning. But I shall definitely never surrender without a fight. Against the savage pirates/slavers which gleefully stare at my colonists and even against the forces of nature, you have to firmly stand your ground. RimWorld’s also tackling more mature themes than its similar counterparts on Steam. Touchy subjects or even taboos, such as true gender equality, sexuality, slavery, tyranny and last but not least, cannibalism. You didn’t expect an idyllic colonial life, did you? Much like the Overseer within a Fallout Shelter, how you treat your subjects/employees/friends is up to you to decide. Extreme circumstances may or may not warrant equally extreme measures to be understaken just for the survival of your settlement.If only such complex strategic simulations could be rendered within a fully 3D game engine. I’m never one to shun a game just for its plain looks, but RimWorld certainly deserved more than just a 2D bird’s eye view. From a pure gameplay perspective, it accomplished its intended purpose but it can still hinder the game’s appeal to new players, as if the overwhelming variables and sheer amount of displayed information wasn’t enough. Sounds are also just decent enough while not standing out in any way. Alas, the game has plenty of merits which are sadly not accompanied by Achievements and Trading Cards either. Perhaps in a future update. RimWorld’s ambitions need to reflect themselves in a price tag that is most appropriate. So far you’d best wait for a Steam Seasonal Sale, before picking it up. I’m curious what can Ludeon Studios implement in the base game from the many additions that the Steam Workshop features already. Will your colony thrive or fall prey to a cruelly random event? Only time will tell…Strong Points+ Complex colony simulation.+ Freedom of choice and replay value from procedurally generated assets & events.+ Massive third-party support through the Steam Workshop.Weak Points- Slightly overpriced for an Early Access title.- No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.Rating 80/100  This review was submitted for ReviewExperts, through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming.

								Best top-down 2D colony management game. I played it a lot before it came to Steam, but now, with the Steam Workshop it even more convenient to get a mods which makes the game much better.Positives  Various factors which affect colonist mood.  Complex medical, surgery and damage system.  Very good and atmospheric music.  Pleasant graphics and smooth animations.  Interesting game universe, combination of sci-fi and western. I prefer sci-fi setting much more instead of regular medieval setting like in Dwarf Fortress.  Steam Workshop and  lot of complex mods which improves the game significantly, and actually which makes the game great and not boring to play for a long time. NegativesLack of multiplayer. The game created on Unity Engine which is extremely flexible and allows to create multiplayer game easily, but for some reason author don't plan do it. With multiplayer this game will be even better, because there is no other ""DF like games"" with multiplayer.			"

Ate them, then fallout stopped the next day, morale was low. Animals started to reappear and i started getting food, then few days later BOOOM SIEGE! I panicked and started deconstructing everything to build a spaceship, colonists tried to mine compacted steel near the siege camp and by the time i realized they were all dead or kidnapped except for 1 man. I was like ok i can handle this alone, kept building the ship but the guy got crazy cause all his friends and his wife were dead. He decided to start burning up the house. My game died with him.			"

								Jen was a good person. She was one of the 3 to make it off the ship, her father being another. In fact Jen and her Dad were a good hunting team. The colony needed food and we saw a bear so Jen and her Dad went out fearlessly. Jen knew her Dad was a better shot so she lured the bear out and danced around only getting a few scratches. On the way home we saw raiders getting ready to assult us. Two with guns and one with a club. Jen, even though she was wounded, bravely took up arms to defend the others. Again she was hurt in the assult and so was nearly everyone else. It was not battle that took her brave life, it was infection. Got in her blood and she died in the night. I'd like to say she was peaceful but truth is she was in a lot of pain. So in honor of such a horrible loss, we built her a tomb. Jen was in charge of tending the fields and she loved it. She was always chipper and happy without a care in the world. So brave. As a memorial Jen's Dad agreed to take over her fields. But its not going to be the same without her.October 9, 2016 - October 10, 2016... Beloved daughter, survivor and friend. I'm sad now. She seriously wasn't ""GOOD"" but she really made the colony a better place.			"

								Started a colony with a guy named Frank. Had him for a long time and somehow went completely unscathed through countless battles. I thought to myself, ""Wow! This guy is superman!"". Next fight: loses both of his arms. Somehow he is still able to do research for me, so I decide to keep him around. After about a year in game I give him 2 bionic arms. A while later there is a massive raid that kills one of his best friends and his wife. Completely depressed, he continually goes berserk and keeps putting my other colonists in the hospital (those bionic arms helped him with that). I end up having to euthanize him. As one of my doctors kneels by his bed after his latest berserk rampage that needed to be stopped with a shotgun to his face, they have a farewell chat and then the doctor ends his life. I now have a shrine built to him in the center of my colony. He will always be remembered.On a more technical note, the storytelling AI is a genius feature that I have never seen in another game. You really get the impression while playing this game that there is a story that the AI is taking you through. It controls the stream of events your colony experiences to create a certain experience for you. I don't know exactly what is happening behind the scenes, but it really does feel that it is doing much more then simply sending you random events depending on the size of your colony.If you have any interest in colony/town simulation games, then this is a must buy.

								Up there with Factorio in the sense of replayability and joy. Has totally altered the way I think and do things, even in day to day life. Priorities, my friends, priorities; unfortunately that priority is playing Rimworld. This is a game about colonizing, so that means there is a lot of work to be done. Lucky for you, there are colonists that are there at your beck and call in order to fulfill that long lost dream of living and building your very own colony. Far... Far... Away.			"

								My only cook (Grub) got gut worms somehow and now hates everything and constantly goes beserk trying to kill everyone, so the solution was to remove his stomach. For some reason though, he wasn't happy with that and began to attack all my colonists during a raid attack. The next day he got a disease. Which I believe he spread to my hunter. We now have no source of food or anyone to cook it. Then Grub went beserk when my doctor was trying to heal him. My doctor couldn't heal Grub in time since he was injured himself, and Grub died to his severe illness and my colony soon died of starvation.I hate Grub, but I love this game.			"

								I had a well established colony. I had 9 colonists equipped with sniper rifles, assault riflles, pump shotguns and kevlar vests and helmets. Then the unthinkable happened.A maddened elephant started attacking my colonists. I got the firing squad together. Elephant charged my colonists and managed to nail 2 of my lads before dying. Both incapacitated.Get them to the medical ward only to discover the bad news. One had literally lost both feet due to the attack and the other his entire right leg.Decided that instead of two food draining incapacitated potatos laying in bed all day, I would rather human beings that contribute to society. Decided to start operating and installing peg legs.I tried twice on the man with no feet and both times only managed to stab the lad twice in the torso aswell as giving him a scratched ear. No dice.I tried twice on the man with one leg and both times only managed to stab the lad once in his good leg, three times in the torso aswell as a bruised arm. No dice.Decided to give it one more go to the man with no feet and he encounted ""Minor problems"" during surgery which ultimately ended in his death. Death by being crushed. In a medical ward. With no furniture other than the bed on which he laid upon. Riddle me that.Gave the other guy a crack and he too died due to unforeseen complications.Would recommend to friends who want to experience the thrill of wild foot eating elephants.			"

								It was going so well. Fall was coming to an end and we had a larder filled with food that would last the winter. We were set. We might even have gotten one more quick harvest before the cold killed all our crops. Then the raid came.I set up a defensive line and focused on killing the raiders that were attacking... I'm sure there were six of them... why are there only three here? Oh.OHHHHHH.The other three had gone around my defensive line and were in the process of lighting massive fires all over my farmland. They shot and kidnapped one of my pacafist colonists and left. The fire however raged on, and spread from the crops to the larder. Months of work up in smoke. No Food. Fire extinguished we set about salvaging what we could. A barely grown harvest, and the only source of meat we could find on short notice. The dead raiders. With only a handful of meals could we survive the winter? No.Shortly after the cold set in a rogue herd of boomalopes entered the area hungry for manflesh. Maneating Boomalopes are a bit like maneating Antelopes, except when they die they also explode. Hense the boom. They can't open doors though.I locked my colonists inside, and hoped the threat would pass. They'd get bored and move on. But the Boomalopes could smell our desperation and lack of food reserves. They could wait. By midwinter the temperatures outside were -10 degrees and the food was gone. We needed to get outside. We needed food. With little option my best fighter stuck her head out the door and shoot a boomalope, hopeing to wound or kill the beast. It mearly drew its ire. It charged headlong at the door, was shot at mellee range, died, and exploded. The explosion blew the door off. The herd had found a way in. My colony burned a 2nd time, as rampant boomalopes flew towards me and exploded, lighting fires all over my base. My hunter was in bed desperatly trying to recover from explosion related injuries while my other two survivors were putting out fires. Then the raiders came. again. They shot my two remaining survivors (one died outright, the other they left bleeding in a corner) and they kidnapped my hunter who was dying in bed. The Boomalope fires had destroyed most of the roof, and as my final colonist lay bleeding, it would turn out hyperthermia would be her eventual death, in that frigid winter of death. I had lost, and losing was fun.  "

								Obviously I have become addicted to this game, much like my entire colony's psychite addiction. I managed to tame a male and  a female panther, now i have like 30 panthers trained to maul any raiders.   I also had about 30 cats which i had to sell to a trade group because they were eating all the raw meat. My most profound moment, tear to my eye, was when the pet elephant was trained to haul items.   Finally researched some serious stuff, like making components, and drilling for steel, thats when it gets interesting.   The last raid (about 10 dudes) was completely obliterated by my new mortars.  It took me many tries and the learning curve was very steep, but the last colony i built has been going strong for a long time. Key: make sure you start making stone bricks and replace all your wooden structures because its just gonna burn down. And put batteries inside.   Enjoy.			"

I was not sure if this game was worth the 30 bucks, well, the amount of hours I've played and enjoyed, I say it was well worth it. There is so much into this game that will make you loose track of time.It did not take long for me to get the basics down, and I was doing pretty well too. Watching some tutorials will definitely help you, and after that, you'll have an amazing time building and maintaining your colony. There is so much content to this game, it's amazing that there is more content to be added!There are castastrophic events that you would have to deal with, such as raids, toxic ship, etc. And there are good and crazy ones too, like getting invaded by 30 muffalos, and boy did we stay comfy throughout the whole winter season! Also having to raise chickens was a crazy experience, I created a farm for my chickens and later they laid eggs that hatched to chicks, worst mistake of my life to create a farm for them because I had over 100 chickens and my food supply was diminishing lol. I'm not doing that again...I really recommend this game, every colony has its own story, and there's so much to it that will keep you playing continuously and entertained! "

While it doesn't have quite the same depth as Dwarf Fortress it still has an amazing amount of systems and options for the player to explore. Rimworld also has a far more accessible learning curve, but that doesn't diminish from the experience as the game does get very hard as it goes on, especially if the player chooses a hard AI Storyteller. If you feel any interest towards this genre of gaming then I highly recommend buying this game. If you're a veteran of games like dwarf fortress then you may find its depth lacking, but the game still has its charms and you may find that its still an enjoyable experience. Though the game doesn't have a modding community the size of the likes of Skyrim, it still has a fairly dedicated one that produces high quality expansions. I have found that the content these mods add help to shake the game up a bit, and I hope that some of their features are added to game officially.Overall Rimworld is a great game. I have been following it since its first alpha and seen all the changes it has undergone. While the updates have been slow they have all added significant features and I have never once felt regret for supporting the game. "

								This game is glorious and heartrenching at the same time. Excellent way to forge stories!In my first game, my group of survivors had crashlanded in a grassy, open plain. Their lovely fuzzball of a Husky survived, bonding nicely with the oldest member of my motley crew who had lost much in the crash. Three weeks in, the bandits attacked. It was the husky that saw them first, and bounded into action. The others quickly noticed something awry, and grabbed the few weapons that were at hand, charging after the valiant pup. Sadly, in the panic, the failed to shoot straight, and our noble canine took a serious thrust of a spear before the raider fell in a hail of poorly aimed bullets. We had no way to treat the pup, and with a heavy heart, her companion, trainer, and friend, through tears, had to end her suffering. She was a good dog.NEVER FORGET, ALWAYS REMEMBER!Excellent game for forging stories, would highly recommend!			"

								 If I had the intelligence and programing ability (and the numerous other aspects that go into game design), this is the game I would make. As I am a sociologist (boo hiss) watching how my colony devolves/evolves is a fascinating experience.  Yes, of course the emotional experience of crash landing on planet can never truly translated to a ‘game’, but this, this is truly a world I can believe in.  The ethnographer in me wants to ‘see the world through their eyes’ but the human in me, of course does not let this happen. I want to intervene in the community and direct their world.  This translates to a beautiful and awe inspiring in all aspects.This is truly unique game; all comparisons are truly of the table. Yes, it’s a bit like ‘Dwarf Fortress’, yes it’s a bit like etc., but none, and I mean none, truly do this justice. Looking at screen shot will never encompass the emotional attachment you have with your colony, the sheer genius of the game is this emotional hook. Within the game things actual matter life and death have consequences. This blocky, almost primitive graphic take on a far greater significate when you are actually involved in the minutia of the ‘game’ (I hesitate to use that word!). Truly remarkable, and I hope the author(s?) are richly rewarded for such a unique experience. Recommended without a doubt.			"

								This is my first ever Steam review, which is testament to just how much I love this game. I've been playing Rimworld for nearly two years now and am happy that it has finally made it to Steam!I'm 31 and there are very few games I have ever encountered that I have sunk as many hundreds of hours into as Rimworld. The variety of each game and the challenge of the story-tellers is actually staggering. As a game still in its alpha stage, it is more stable and has more content than most triple A games. The updates are frequent and make significant improvements to the gameplay every time and the developer communication is excellent on the ludeon.com forums.The real strength of this game is the modding community, which continues to add amazing content to the solid core gameplay on a nearly daily basis. I can only hope that the addition of Steam Workshop will help make the modders life easier as the game continues to evolve.The game itself is the most fun in its early to mid stage, reaching something of a plateau towards late/endgame. However, the developer Tynan is more than aware of this and will address it in a coming update.I can't recommend this game highly enough.			"

I love dwarf fortress, but Rimworld actually made me care about the people I command.Especially that one woman that wasn't told to fight off the scyther invaded the camp, she got shot in the back, spine broken.I kept her in the hospital, incapable of walking, for I wanted to find a way to save her, since she was my best colonist, I owed that to her. Maybe if I got advanced enough I could replace her spine?Alas, a flashtorm told me otherwise.Here they were, fighting a loosing battle against the flames. I had to make a decision and packed everything I could into one single caravan. They couldn't carry her with them.Abandon settlement, rebuild. The lost tribesmen got chased off their camp once again.Everything is good again. Except the burns on my hunter got infected, and got the better off her.Fast forward to the end, my colony was populated only with domesticated wolves that outlived their master.Rest in peace; Komodo, Val, Hunter, Meat and tribesmen who met less glorious ends.Except you, ♥♥♥♥ you Arroya, I always hated you.

								I personally think that Rimworld is a great game. It takes a more indepth approach to the colony and/or city simulator, not in comparison to dwarf fortress but in the genere it is in a different league than the sims or banished. Instead of giving you a boring population that is without traits and addresses tasks and goals given by you or the game, you are given individual colonists with a large reliance on efficiency, and are governed completely by you (if you want to go through the work to micro your colonists). You have the opportunity to create/generate characters prior to entering your custom or preset scenario. Once you begin gameplay you adress colonial needs and assign priorities and jobs to your various colonists that all of individual skills that better suit different tasks.Throughout the growth of your colony you will be presented with challenges and opposition wether by hunger, weather, space pirates, aggressive tribes, or mystical space robots with sword arms. provided your colony survives long enough, you will eventually have the opportunity to begin mechanizing your colony with prosthetics and implants through research and commerce. The world is generated prior to entering your first colony with a map of the entire artificial world covering either 30%, 50% or, 100% of the planet. The world is divided into hexagonal territories which, for some odd reason are square in colony view, are uniquely generated every single time a new initial save is created peppered with friendly, neutral and hostile factions and settlments.Positives-Detailed-Challenging-Several methods of playing-Challenges are presented based on narrator (for lack of a better term)-Infite possibilities-Randomly generated landscapes and world-Personalization of colonists and pets-Complex disease, injury, and addiction systems. (i once saw a turtle kill a bear by biting its eye and giving it an infection, turtle still died. RIP Lawrence)-Stil in development-ModdableCons-It can be really hard-AI narrators will punish relentlessly-Hard to create colonists that are effective without negetive affect on the colony or themselves (not really a ""con"" it keeps the game balanced but some may not like it)-Still in development-Costs moneyTl;dr: Hard colony sim, lots of customizability and funny/infuriating gameplay, still in development, comparable to dwarf fortress.

								The best way to review a story driven survival colony game, Is to tell you a story.3 survivors of an unknown accident, crash land on a random planet.Unknowing how to play the game, progress was slow, but eventually we had a cosy little settlement.3 beds, table, heat, light and stove. Everyone was happy.This is when S### hit the fan. I misjudged how big my farm needed to be, so hunting was the only way to keep the colony going. Raider attacks, eclipses and shared living was starting to take its toll.The final straw was when the food ran out and Earl (My hunter) couldn't catch anything. Tim (My handyman) had a mental breakdown. And Earl's Son (Ivo) was injured in a gunfight.A few weeks later, my colony was up to 5 people and 1 prisoner (which i took pity on). I accidently sent Ivo out hunting on his own to fight a Grizzly. Earl came to the rescue, but it was too late.Ivo was alive but very badly wounded, Earl was worse off as his arm was completely ripped off. And to top it all off, i ran out of medical supplies and Earl is the only trained doctor i have.The next day, Ivo's wounds got infected. Earl decided not to amputate his arms as there was no medicine.But then a trader came by and sold some medicine, Earl gave it to Ivo and he started to recover, but it was too late. Ivo died 1 hour later.The depression, the lack of food, the occasional cannibalism and winter was setting in. My colony was doomed, but with every great story there came a twist. A cargo pod just came out of nowhere filled medical supplies. The farm finally yelded a decent amount of crops. Also a trader came by and sold me a bionic arm which was then attached to Earl during a extensive operation.2 escape pods landed on the planet only a few days later, It was Roslyn and Masaru, Earl's wife and other Son.That is were my story must end. As there is yet so much more to see and do.10/10 Would decimate the Turkey population again.UPDATE: A lot of things have changed since this review. My colony now has 15 colonists. A nearby mine shaft got infested with alien insect thingys. 2 colonists got married but it rained during the ceremony. Raiders continue to get tougher each day, luckily my turrets and perimeter wall are still holding up. 90% of the buildings in the colony are made out of Plasteel.

								After 19 hours I can say this game is pretty awesome. I would ignore the EA tag as this game fells like anything but an EA title. There are 3 different scenarios to choose from: the standard of 3 people crashing on a planet and trying to survive, the rich explorer on his own looking for adventure, or 5 surviving tribe members trying to rebuild after a catastrophe. If none of those tickle your fancy they have added an editor and you can make up your own scenario (it is pretty epic what you can do).Once you get everthing set up then you choose a map size and a location on a planet. Make sure to pay attention to the times you can grow crops, you don't want to be stuck somewhere you can only grow crops for a limited amount of time, and also pay attention to the average temps as some people like certain temperatures. After you selcect your planet is when you get to pick your crew of people. I suggest trying to find people without any injuries (scars included), and make sure to be diversified in the peoples abilites. It's funny some of the quirks these peopel have :)Launch your game and immediately pause so you can scope it out, plan how you want to build and set your people to working. I recommend watching some videos before hand as there is a learning curve, but once you get the basics down it's a ton of fun. I can see me investing a lot more time into this one for sure. Good luck and have fun!!			"

								I've been playing videogames for more years than I will admit here, a lot of them through Steam, but I've never before  felt the urge to write a review. Well, I can't think of a better game for my first one. In my humble opinion it is a revolution in the genre. Yes, some can argue that alot of the mechanics and concepts were there before, but they are put in such a great way that makes it one of the best games I've ever played. It does have a lot of innovations on its own.  The depth of the simulation is HUGE, specially regarding everything related to the colonists: mood, health, addictions, etc. I've had  to face some very interesting ethical dilemmas while trying to make my  colonists survive. For example: Should i feed and spend my precious medicines on this prisoner which I may not be able to recruit? or do I want his organs to heal my only firefighter? Some of them even kept me thinking about it hours after playing the game after extrapolating them to real world scenarios. That adds a lot to the replayability, not to mention the customizable start settings and the different storytellers.You can play a peaceful (not THAT easy) colony builder or a hardcore survival blood-fest game depending on your mood. Harder difficulties and 'unfair' storytellers are great for epic histories of battles and heroic deeds, but also for  sad while amazing  stories. Like the colony that was lost after a sinister incident (involving serial killing) that started when someone's yorkshire terrier died. A minor incident can lead through a cascade of disasters that will ruin your settlements if you don't notice and correct it while you can.The artwork is simple but great and the music ...WOW..seriously, spot on. One of the few games where I keep the music on after all this time playing.EDIT: Rimworld was available through the official website years before it was added to Steam, don't trust the hour record.10/10 Definitely recommendedRuffus we will always remember you !!

								I've been playing this game since the early alphas and the thing i like about it the most, compared to the other colony sims, is it's RTS-based battle mechanics.there are plenty of great colony building sims out there and there are plenty of great RTS games out there, but rimworld was able to seamlessly combine these two genres quite beautifully.this is the kind of game where a raider can chop off one of your colonist's legs and then the player would be able to operate on that colonist and give him a peg leg.this is also the game where you can butcher that punk raider who chopped off your colonist's leg and turn his bloody carcass into a lavish meal or feed his corpse to your pet warg and her babies.and then loot that raider's cool jacket.-----yes random reader, you read all that correctly. what are you waiting for? go buy it.

								Extremely steep learning curve but also extremely amusing.My first game lasted just shy of 3 days.  My ship wrecked survivors started building a small habitat to share and sleep in near what I thought was an abandoned structure, as there tend to be a few on every map.  The structure was made of steel walls, and my survivors wanted a steel house.  They tore down one section of wall only to discover ancient slumbering death robots which poured forth and quickly filled my survivors full of holes.  Did they kill my crew?  No... they blew off limbs, punched holes through torsos, and then let them slowly bleed to death as the robots systematically destroyed everything they had built.  The one creature they did kill outright?  The pet dog.  And they made sure to do it in front of the crew before any of them had bled out.10/10 Would unleash sadistic murder bots again.			"

								There are plenty of reviews and let's plays out there that will let you know if this game is for you or not.That being said, this game certainly scratches an itch. It's solidly built, maintained, and consistently enhanced by an honorable and respectable developer, not to mention the modding community.I'm not that good at video games these days and was worried that this one would be too complicated for me.

								I have always loved this game and its contunual updates.  I love to see that this has finally made it to steam.  If you are on the fence about it, watch some game reviews.  This game starts off very basic.  It may look simple, but it is extremely complex.  That being said, it is on a learning curve that you will pick up swiftly.  The different biomes provide different challenges, so this game is never static.  It has a little bit of everything that you need in a Basebuilding game - farming/combat/management.The goal is to survive on a planet, build your spaceship again, and GTFO.  Can you survive?			"

								Owned Rimworld for a long time before it was steam released.By far the cloest thing to dwarf fortress that isn't incredibly hard to get into.This is another top seller for a reason, gameplay is challenging and fun, worth a try if your into sim games.. Has a great potential for steam workshop support although curse has a mod page for it already.I feel bad for anyone who didn't buy it earlier for the early development price but it's actually worth the money. Far more content then most triple A titles and you'll expirience no bugs what so ever from anything upto this patch now.			"

								A team of expert scientists crashed on the Rim World. The first of which was Ian. Ian was a Female Botanist but was also a psychopath for some reason. Second was Mishly, our colony leader. She had a high skill in shooting however she was a geologist, which didnt really make sense. Finally, Fox, she was in charge of building and taking care of injured patients, she was a computer scientist, which also didnt make sense. We also had a pet named Genius which really fit the team of expert scientists.We began the constructing the colony, slowly but carefully. I proceeded to create 4 8x8 growing areas of rice, corn, potatos and hay to feed Genius. After 2 days, our colony began to be large enough to be named. I named the colony... Potatoville. After that a colonist named Kim, proceeded to join the colony. She was the MVP, cooking food and collecting resources all night while everybody else was sleeping.Kim saved us from a forseeable food shortage. This all fit her occupation of being a servant. Finally something that made sense. After constructing a powergrid, of 1 solar panel and creating individual bed rooms for each colonist and a workshop/joy section things started to look pretty good.Then a foolish raider named Jonathan appeared. He attempted to take down 2 of my colonists which had a pistol and a rifle. He then fainted. I felt sorry for him has he laid seemingly dead in the front of our main house. I then put him on prisoner status. I made my wardens try to convince him to join the colony. We cured all of his injuries, creating a nice little bed, allowed him to go nude since he was a nudist. Yet it wasnt enough, he still couldnt be convinced to stay. I figured that I would be better off executing him. Middle of the night. Ian, proceeded to murderur Jonathan. I constructed a grave to memorialize Jonathan. RIP Jonathan - Useless Prisoner 2016 - 2016You thought it would end there didnt you? Well everything turned into havoc a day 3 days later. A turtle. This mad turtle... He proceeded to trap 3 of my colonists in my tiny ""research shack"" even though they were all fully armed, they werent able to shot the turtle or hurt it. Mishly tried to shot the turtle, but to no avail. The turtle killed all 3 of my colonists then ran towards Mishly. Genius attempted to protect Mishly, only for both of them to die seconds later. The turtle killed all my colonists. 10/10 - Would lose the game to a turtle again.Proof the the Horrifying Event: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107995368/screenshots/ "

								Ben, the quiet loner who mines and occasionally sculpts, had a mental break down and attempted to bludgen himself to death because his pet Husky Asphalt died in an angry turtle attack. This is Rimworld.Sasquach, the pascifist nurse who can build a room like nobody's business, got heat stroke and went a little nuts, shedding her clothes in the living room and running for the hills in the middle of a heat wave. This is Rimworld.Inga likes to beat people with a stick. This is Rimworld...Rimworld is a strategy game masked as a top down colony sim with a unique aesthetic and an emergent, complex AI system. Yes, you have to build and manage a base like most sim, sandbox games. However in Rimworld there are complex factors that are super important to the success of your colony.Stories are generated by ""simulating psychology, ecology, gunplay, melee combat, climate, biomes, diplomacy, interpersonal relationships, art, medicine, trade, and more"". Key word ""and more"". Your sims can go insane and it will completely ruin your entire colony when Bert decides to strip and run out into the tundra and pace around in an unresponsive daze! Factions can attack but when taken prisoner can potentially become part of your colony, but only if you have someone with social skills that can chat em up. This is what makes Rimworld so fun and addictive. I have started over about 6 times, sometimes because of updates but also because I am super curious about how colonies will end up in tundras, or jungles, or if I choose 3 men or 3 women, or 5 tribal members or 1 rich loner. No two stories are ever alike! It's hard to tell that this is even an Early Access game. It could be balanced a bit more, especially in Cassandra Classic mode, however it is very enjoyable.I would highly recommend this game if you love simulation, strategy, humor, survival aspects, and if you enjoy replayability. 10/10 I'm totally obsessed and can't stop playing. It's summer and I'm always inside playing this game, dammit! Look what you've done to me, Ludeon Studios!!			"

								Seriously awesome.  This little game even in early access is truly captivating.  I find myself re-starting over and over to see what random things I can encounter.  This game seems to adapt, creatively, to whatever it is you try to do and try to opress your motivations creatively.  It's an amusing game I can't seem to put down.Example Stories:1. Built a mountain bunker with only one tiny ingress point, made some impressive defenses.  I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off all my neighbors on purpose, killed every one that came by.  Eventually one of them sent a large group and half of them came and mined their way into the back of my base in two different spots, while a third group setup mortars to destroy me from afar, while a few also rushed my front gates.  That's some impressive and entertaining AI right there, I wasn't even mad at losing like 8 hours worth of effort into my community.2. Built a cute trading village in the woods, pleased all my neighbors the best I could (always one pirate group though, unfortunately), grew lovely crops, trading my way up, had bionic parts for a few of my sims, loving it.  My two main gunmen were recovering from injury from some raging animals and could not fight, only to get raided from enemies.  Barely fought them off with choke points, traps, and running around the map like an idiot as my base was being destroyed and my two fighters were killed.  Only traders/craftsmen left.  Expected to die at the next major raid, but that never happened, instead some insane storm came and blew all my crops away, and since my food storage area / fridge was partially destroyed with a collapsed roof from the raid, the storm blew away most of the food in storage right as winter approached.  Ran out of food in the dead of winter, couldn't afford to buy more via trading, as sim after sim died off, the others turned into canibals eating the dead.  One after one, after eating human flesh my sims all went mad and then died off, some just wandered out into the cold and died, some just sat in their room died of hunger, one set his room on fire and went up in a blaze.I'll add more soon  :P			"

								I've been playing Rimworld for about a year, and it's easily one of my favorite games of all time, which is saying something because I've been playing video games for about forty years! The best part of this game is the stories that it generates. Here are three of them (some games heavily modded):PSYCHOThe first game of Rimworld that I ever played was going great until the raiders came. My colonists put up one hell of a fight, but after driving the raiders off all of them were incapacitated except for Sally, the neurotic brawler. As her compatriots were bleeding out on the ground, she decided that she wanted to go play horseshoes. Nope. I ordered her to rescue her companions. Then she wanted to play chess. Huh-uh. I ordered her to bandage their wounds. After that, she wanted to go grab a bite to eat, but I ordered her to feed her fellow colonists first.Finally, when she was able to tend to her own needs, she found that she had fed all of the meals to the other colonists, leaving her with only a few raw potatoes. She ate them and went to bed.Great, I thought. Crisis averted.Then she woke up in the middle of the night. One by one, she killed all of the other colonists as they lay helpless in their beds. Then she went outside, stripped off her clothing, and wandered around in the snow until she died of exposure.The moral of the story: Mass murder in Rimworld often begins with eating a raw potato.HARVESTIn another game I played, we managed to capture a raider who had a great set of skills, but a really high recruitment difficulty. We kept him around trying to recruit him for over a year, but when food became scarce I had to consider whether to cut him loose, or cut him up (y'know, for food). I hadn't come to a decision yet when the colony was raided again. We fended off the raid, but one of my colonists lost an arm in the process.At that point, my choice was clear. I tried to recruit the raider one more time, and failing that, I sent in the doc.As my colonist admired his shiny new arm, I realized that I now had a use for the stubborn raider: spare parts!Years later, when the raider finally hobbled out of our compound on two peg legs, he had only one eye left, no limbs except the ones we'd made for him, and his nose was gone. Oh yeah, and he was naked, too... we took his clothes before we let him go.The moral of the story: Recycle!THE EPIC OF LEMMYIn my most recent playthrough, the colonists walled in a large area soon after they landed, trapping a few animals in the process. I soon ordered one of the colonists to hunt these animals for meat. This was no problem until the colonist tried to hunt the tortoise. As soon as the bullet penetrated its shell, the tortoise flew into a rage. The tortoise was on him like lightning (that is, if lightning moved really, really slow) and bit his toe off.As the tortoise chewed idly upon the aforementioned severed toe, I took a closer look at him and found that this wasn't his first rodeo. He'd been shot and stabbed before. This was a tortoise that I could respect.I left him alone after that, adopting him as a kind of mascot, but not really bothering to tame him and make him a part of the colony. But Tess, the colony's warg, was not as impressed as I was. She considered the tortoise as a snack to be consumed at a later time.So it wasn't long before they decided to rumble. Tess got the short end of that encounter, and for her trouble she got three shattered legs that had to be amputated and replaced with peg legs (remember, mods).At that point I named the tortoise Lemmy. Because he was a bad♥♥♥♥♥Lemmy spent the next few years wandering around the compound (Tess, meanwhile, got a fourth peg leg after an unfortunate incident with a cow).But eventually as the compound developed, there were fewer and fewer dandelions for Lemmy to eat. Afraid that he would starve, I decided to tame him. It was easier than I thought it would be, and the first thing that Lemmy did was to head outside of the compound (as a member of the colony, he could open doors now).Not long after, as Lemmy munched on dandelions, he was attacked by a group of tribals. At 191 years of age, Lemmy wasn't as spry as he was when he was in his seventies, and he was cut down before he could fight back. As he lay bleeding out in a patch of his much-loved dandelions, he would have given the tribals the finger.But he didn't have one. Because he was a tortoise.The moral of the story: If you spend fifty years as an underappreciated musician, some nerd will eventually name a turtle after you. But not a real one, though. A fake one. On the computer.tl;dr: Learn to read, lazy♥♥♥♥♥ And buy this game.This is Rimworld. Welcome to it.			"

								This game is phenomenal. I don't think I've ever gotten as lost in my own imagination with a game as I have with Rimworld. My roommate had a hard time understanding how I had become so invested in the world and story represented on screen in the game's Spartan graphics.If I can add anything that's not in previous reviews: don't test drive this game on the easiest mode. The pure base-building mode almost turned me off until I came back and gave it another go on the harder difficulty. The threats are all the fun and give your compulsive building a purpose.Also, beware! This game is unbelievably addicting. When one game can run you 12-30 hours (or more), you should prepare accordingly.			"

Ludeon above I love this game, and seriously couldn't praise enough in this review.I first started playing around the release of Alpha 7, and had pirated at first due to admittedly not having the money to blow on yet another game. By the time I had the money to blow, Tynan had already announced that buyers would not be getting Steam keys after 'x' date, so I just decided to wing it until the Steam release.'Bout another year later, many alphas, here we are. Take my $30 and my many hundred more hours to come!			"

								Rimworld is one of those few games that does what it does unbelievably well.  Rimworld is a base-building/colony management style game, but these genres it takes to a whole new level in complexity.The game itself is considered an 'early access' title, but don't be fooled by this, there is a breath and depth of content here that goes far beyond a $30 price tag.  You can easily get hundreds of hours of play time in Rimworld, as there is so much depth that even after almost 150 hours of play time myself, I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface.  There are always so many new things, new mechanics, new items, new ways colonists interact with things that I'm learning about that things can stay fresh for a long time.  Rimworld is one of those games that takes a short amount of time to understand, but a lifetime to master.Part of the replayability is the sheer variety in any given game.  You can choose a difficulty, a biome, a storyteller (the style of AI when it comes to how challenges and boons come to your colony), and you can even generate your colonists.  Everything, right down to those very colonists have such depth, it's difficult to explain in a review.  One colonist might have an excellent skill with firearms and cooking, but might be incapable of dumb labor and like to eat human flesh.  Another colonist might have a bad back and cataracts, but might be an excellent researcher and particularly strong willed.Another part of the replayability is the extensive and highly active modding community, which have created amazing mods to keep the gameplay fresh and fun.  Everything from mods that reduce micromanagement, to mods that allow you to play in H.P. Lovecraft's Call of Cthulhu setting.  Mods that allow you to engineer organs, or mods that add additional weapons and enemies.  There's truly a mod for just about everything.The graphics and sound effects are simple, but the true value in Rimworld is the story that gets told as you progress through your game.  When raiders come, will you defend yourself and then set the raiders you capture free?  Will you try to convert them to your side?  Will you tear their organs out to sell on the black market and use their skin to make arm chairs with (yes this is totally possible)?  Will you tame wild animals and breed them for food and materials as a farmer?  Will you simply slaughter them as a hunter?  Will you grow and concoct drugs to enhance your colonists abilities and keep them happy?  Or create these drugs to sell and make a tidy profit?  Do you prefer a simple, defendable base?  Or a beautiful, symetrical base?  There's really something for everyone in Rimworld.I could say so much about Rimworld and I really feel like it wouldn't be enough.  I know videos aren't always the best way to communicate the experience of a game, but in this case I think it's approrpiate.  If you ever want to see the depth a RImworld campaign can get, here are two modded ones I'm running, along with all of the insanity that happens in each:The start of a Playthrough of 5 Psychopaths that slaughter, remove organs, and sell off all that cross them.

								I have never played Dwarf Fortress. I watched people play this for a few days before trying it and even then I was unsure about it. I can't stop playing it. It's possibly one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I've owned it for literally 108 hours and I have played for 58 hours.It is incredibly satisfying and challenging. I am not a big fan of micromanagement but since you can pause the game to issue orders it completely negates the need to focus on tons of stuff at the same time. It is easily the best $30 I've ever spent and that includes donating to charities. This game is so good it could be called ""Complete"" in it's current state and it would still be worth it. The fact that it's in Early Access and we can expect more features in the future is amazing. Plus the modding community is great and will be another huge source of content and features.I have not encountered any bugs (or at least if I did, I didn't notice them). There's only a couple small complaints I have about the game and they're just minor user-friendlyness details.10/10			"

								Best in class right now.Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly(minus the ships).Complex yet simple.The difficulty is adjustable somewhat.I cant stop playing it.the Devs are really on top of the developement cycle, and add new stuff constantly.Very well thought out, very good sense of humor throughout.If you are even slightly interested in this genre, do yourself a solid and buy this game.

TL; DR - Amazing game, recommended for fans of micromanagement. Greatest strength is its modability. 100% worth the asking price.Watch my Let's Play RimWorld here.StoryThis game has no story, beyond the simple seeds given to you at the start, depending to the scenario. In the most traditional scenario, you start your game with three people crash-landing in on a planet on the rim of inhabitable space. Your ""objective"", which you are in no way obligated to pursue, is to build a spaceship that will allow you to get off the planet. Emergent storytelling is the name of the game. Your people, pawns, have 'unique' personalities which interact with each other and the game mechanics in a way that creates chaos or peace, success or failure. No two playthroughs will be unique.GraphicsRimWorld has simplistic 2D graphics which are nonetheless thematic and charming. The art style seems mostly consistent and there's nothing that seems to be out of place. Despite the simplicity of the graphics, the movement and interactions of the pawns with their environment invokes the same idle interest as watching an ant farm.GameplayIn the vanilla game, gameplay is mostly tight, with some elements being clunky. For example, commanding several pawns at once in combat, or expanding zones, have seemingly simple and straightforward interfaces but both offer features that take experience to discover, as they are not obvious. Most of the game will be spent interacting with the tabs Architect, Work, and Restrict. These allow you to build, set job priorities and assign schedules to your pawns so that they will develop and take care of the colony in an efficient manner. While you are capable of giving the pawns direct orders the game obviously intends for you to use the scheduling and priority systems.SoundThe sound effects in RimWorld are nothing to write home about. Doors woosh when they're opened, animals make a variety of noises and guns make satisfying bangs whenever they fire. Where RimWorld's audio shines is in the soundtrack which, even though it contains only a few songs, is stellar and evocative of the whole 'space western' theme of the game.OtherWhere RimWorld has a huge advantage over similar games is in its mods. There is a huge, active, community of modders, both here on steam and on the Ludeon forums. Mods allow changing the game in radical ways, completely overhauling the way you play the game. While the vanilla game is already almost great, mods definitely push it there.RimWorld is an ""early access game"" but I think this is wrong. If development stopped now, I would consider this a great game worth the asking price. As it is, the game is still being actively developed and is subject to change.Score5/5 - Great "

								I started the game with 3 people. A husband and wife with their daughter and her doggie.I finally figured out how to hollow out a cave and make a living. I named the cave Bates motel. I had our group haul all of our supplies and things were going okay at first...In the beginning everyone slept in the same room. Colonists started having mental breaks because of room sharing and horrible living conditions however. So I moved the daughter out thinking she hated being stuck with her parents in the same room. I figured the 2 in the other room might benefit from a bit o love making perhaps make me some new colonists.... Surprisingly this only made them more erratic and depressed. Especially when I put them in the double queen bed to sleep together.About 2 hours in the main guy snapped and shot the lady I thought was his wife and then shot the daughters dog. Turns out it was his mom and girlfriends dog. After he shot his GF (the 22 Daughter) too I realized my mistake. I had separated them for 2 years. Eventually the GF had broken off the relationship. Apparently the son slowly went mad stuck with the mom night after night when he was supposed to be in the room next door re-populating the colony with his sweetie. He then went psychotic and killed everyone. Afterward he went into the field next door and punched a boomalo until it exploded and injured him. With nobody to rescue him he sat there and died in the field.10/10Would play Psycho sim again.THRILLING.Oh and don't mess with the Alpaca herd. They will !@#$ you up!			"

								Kimmy lost it.. I mean she really LOST it...  maybe it was lack of food.. maybe she was tired and finally FED up with all the dirt.. why wasn't anyone cleaning??  Maybe it was a recent infestation of creepy-crawlers.. (what WERE those things?).. that we barely just survived.. I don't know.. but she LOST it and went NUTS..  before that.. she was great!.. one of the best colonists..one of the first...  unfortunately.. she lost it.. and went Beserk!  Now, normally we'd just get a couple of us together..  grab her and punch her silly then haul her to the med bay.  This time it was different..we didn't get there in time.. because  you see Kimmy decided to lose it... RIGHT in front of our pet Grizzly Bear!  ( You don't start punching a Grizzly Bear.. I don't care HOW freaked out you are. )  Kimmy didn't win that fight.  I think she was dead before she hit the ground.  We buried her in her own custom sarcophagus.. she will be missed.. and occasionally one of us goes over to visit her when we need to remember how great she was.  The rest of us made it off the planet.  She didn't.  We'll miss you Kimmy.Yes.. like others (true story by the way.. courtesy of RimWorld!)..  I have played about 300 hours of RimWorld since Alpha  9.. it only gets better and better.. make sure you have about 6 hours free for starters.. because this is one heck of a ride.. every time!  Would tame Grizzlies again.. (but keep them out of the house this time)..  {grin}  ENJOY RimWorld!!  It is fan-freekin-tastic!!  ---SHD  (Now to start Alpha 14!  Woo HOO! YAY Steam!)			"

								Never before has a game made me say. ""How in the hell did you manage to cut someone's head off while removing a kidney?!?!? Whatever, I'll just forbid the room and leave her corpse in there.""  That's pretty much a summary of what this game will be like.                        Rimworld is kind of like building a skyscraper. You have to make sure the structure of your colony is stable, anticipate and create solutions for problems, and pray to whatever god will listen that a 50-tribal raid doesn't swarm your kill zone. You will suffer serious blows as you build a colony of whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the prime target of pirates, mechanoid hives, and rabid squirells. That isn't a joke. Squirells can actually be quite dangerous if you don't treat all of your colonists squirrel bites. The main part of this game is resource management as well as colonist management. For convenience, me and the rest of the Rimworld community will refer to colonists as ""pawns"". Your pawns our whiny, greedy, ungrateful, psycholigically sensitive, and fragile bags of meat who will complain about anything that isn't stylised perfection. Because of this, you need to accomodate their needs so they won't go insane while building your colony. Pawns will require a small list of items in order to be satisfied with life. They are:-Food-Shelter-Clothing-Good health-Comfortable furniture-Spacious surroundings-Nice looking surroundings-a random need that will be given to them with a trait. You can view a pawn's traits on their character screenAs you can see, providing all of these and possibly more doesn't look easy. And it isn't. However the main ones you should focus on are the first 4. However, Pawns don't gain a mood boost from being well fed or rested. They get the opposite if those needs aren't being fulfilled, but they won't be grateful when you do give them those things. Because of this, try to give your pawns 1-3 of the last 5 items at any given moment. That way they won't go insane and kill your only doctor.                   Speaking of doctors, after you have fulfilled your pawns needs, they will work. Each pawn has a special set of skills that can be strengthened with doing tasks. For example, say you have someone with a construction skill of 10 with no interest in construction and someone with a construction skill of 8 with a burning passion for construction. If you set both of them to work, at first pawn #1 would do a better job, but pawn #2 would learn how to construct better around 5 times faster, thus surpassing them. Overall, try to assign pawns to tasks they are good at or interested in. If you want to view a pawn's stats, check th character screen again.                  Now finally, I will talk about raids. Raids are events that occur where raiders from other factions ( or mechanoids ) will come with weaponry to try and raid your colony. This is where combat kicks in. The top 2 skills on the character screen for each pawn are Melee and Shooting. Assign pawns who are good at Melee to smash tournaments and give your skilled shooters guns. When a raid comes, get your combat pawns behind cover and let them fire. if you want to make a pawn perform a specific action to a person or object, then right click on the object. In combat, this can be used to target specific raiders or order your Melee people to target Kirby. You can also build security turrets to automatically target raiders from a distance. However, these do blow up when they take too much damage. I once had an extremely successful colony get wiped out when too many people stood near an exploding turret.                 Remember, these are just the basics. You probalby would have been better off had you just looked up a tutorial vid for the current version of rimworld.			"

								Though I haven't played this game for that long, I can give a good retelling of a colony I built which was pretty fun. Rimworld diary; Colony 2: Things are off to a great start, Dragon & Shepard are constructing the base, John is growing, hauling♥♥♥♥♥♥and generally being a good dogsbody. The base grows and everyone is happy, production is starting to roll and I have plenty supplies, meals being cooked, potatoes being harvested, trees being chopped, ect. Somewhere a week or two in, after a couple of small bandit raids, I rescue this little prick Wallis. He's alright at the start; a male model, only interested in Art and incapable of intelligence, and any kind of labor. After giving him the task of making a few sculptures he just sits the ♥♥♥♥ around all day. Eating, puking and making a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. So I euthanize him and harvest some organs. Great, I think, problem solved. No. Problem not solved. It starts the beginning of the end. The one thing he could do was shoot and after a big raid and my main doctor going down. Things begin to descend into madness. Everyone is in a bad mood and it's a struggle to get them out of it. I buy beer from traders and make them nice things. Psychic drone. Everyone is teetering on the edge of mental breakdowns. Gamble, an old lady who likes to brawl and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things gets successfully saved from being chased by a group of tribes people. Still. Things are bad but looking up. Oh no. Another raid. John gets ♥♥♥♥ed in an explosion, my two pets, a husky and a terrier die defending the colony, Gamble is severly injured battering the crap out of some guy. The bandid raid ends in many casulties, how do I fix this? ♥♥♥♥! Shepard has a mental breakdown after trying to save everyones lives. Gamble is in bed starving. She has a mental breakdown and Shepard and Gamble battle it out and ♥♥♥♥ each others♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The colony eventually dies with Shepards confused mutterings echoing the now silent walls of a once thriving community. 10/10 "

								My time in RimWorld...so far.  There were 3 people, one named Grandpa, one named Dahl, and one named Connie.  Connie was a miner, Grandpa was a farmer, and Dahl was the fat guy from lost...but he did cook pretty well.  Connie suffered from drug addiction and Dahl was addicted to Wake-up meds.  Everything was going great, They built a nice little house, set up a medical ward, built defenses, and got the rice field planted.  Their storage was piling up and Connie and Dahl were battling their drug addictions fairly well.  It was a peaceful little colony that was becoming close knit.We had another person show up and joined,  her name was Anath and she was a naked tribes woman that excelled at cooking.  Anath pulled her weight and blended in with the community quite well, plus, it was always great to the guys to have a naked 25 year old female walking around all the time.Everything was great....until a rabbid squirrel attacked our colony.  First the squirrel went after Connie.  She shot at it several times but only hit it once,  the squirrel downed her.  Grandpa got behind protection but the squirrel simply jumped over the barricade and downed him,  Anath was the next to be downed as well.  Dahl managed to kill the squirrel but the damage had been done. Dahl rescued everyone and it seemed that Connie was the worse of the others.  Connie eventually gained severe infections and succumbed.  Grandpa had recovered but he went mad, Dahl's addiction messed up his mind, and Kaletha our faithful pet went into manhunter mode after being griefstricken of Connie's death.  Kaletha killed everyone.  A pirate attacked the village while Dahl fell down, Kaletha did one last act of kindness by saving our village before I saved the game and exited.  This game gets deep! Create your own story and please share! 10/10 would rabid squirrel again! "

								I will be reaching 100 hours played soon so i thought i should go ahead and give my review.Rimworld is one of the greatest games i have ever played and will be the template,or always be the comparison for the upcoming Colony Simulators.The amount of detail and depth put into the game is overall impressive,you forge a emotional attachment to your colonist and colony as you learn and build.I do believe that this is not a game for everybody,most new players consider it overwhelming,but i assure you its simple.My roomate who does not play video games at all has gotten into the game,watches me play and has created their own colony.The game is very similar to Prison Architect,but on a much more massive scale,instead of building for profit you are building for survival.Rimworld randomizes esentially everything,your starting colonist,their quirks and the map that it generates along with the story teller.The Story Teller is very interesting and tries to fit all different playstyles/difficultyTheres a Story Teller that makes it more of a BUILDING game,theres still dangers but you get alot of time in betweeen events to build.Another Story Teller gets progressivly more and more difficult as you buld and become more wealthy.Lastly,the ""random randy""Story Telller,anything can happen at anytime,no matter what you have or are currently going through,you're at the mercy of Randy.The Story Tellers generate a ""story""as you play,this is done by having random events or introducing new colonist,that may have ties to existing colonist.Colonist are able to fight,marry,form freindships and make enemies or ""RIVALS""Always changing your colonies ""story""and never truely being the same.I would like to share my first Rimworld colony story,teh story of man named Grunt:  https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/5nzjcd/the_ballad_of_grunt/My current colony has now been ongoing for 60 hours realtime,i believe that Ealry Access Colony Sims are now the new Early Access Survial Games,and Rimwold will always be held in the highest regardi cannot even begin to list the amount of things possible in this game,you can be a Intergalactic Yayo producer and salesmen,or you can even harvest Humans/Organs and be Slave/Organ trader,Ontop of all of this is the Steam Workshop support.Anything is possible in this game!It is fully worth the $30 price,this is coming form somebody who has bought 3 copies of the game now at full price.

								While Rimworld isn't necessarily a bad game, it does quite a bit of wrong and rather strange things.  Steam doesn't really give the capacity with a simple ""recommend"" to explain that but that's why we have this text area.  After 109 hours I'm still unsure if I like it or not.  It is a fantastic game to chill out and listen to podcasts with, but there’s so many issues that I feel more like I'm fighting the game than actually playing it.  Modding the game to fix my issues just brings new issues to light.I probably won't stop playing the game, but I can't recommend it in this state.  I just hope I can later.We'll start with my biggest issue by far, the whole ""happiness"" system.  I like the idea in concept but it really REALLY doesn't work out well.  Some debuffs stack twice over with other debuffs (Friend died, Spouse Died) for what should really just be compressed into one.  Colonists seem to prioritize the strangest things (Best friend in the whole world died, -8. THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ EMMIE WONT GO OUT WITH ME -20) so there really doesnt seem to be a whole lot of consistency.  Dead bodies give a stacking debuff even after the colonist has shot the 500th raider to death with his sniper rifle.  This seems poorly thought out, considering that 30 man raids can happen by year 2 and you need to deal with the bodies.Mental breaks happen far too frequently and give the impression that your colonists all have the mental fortitude of a 5 year old.  The minor breaks (threshold events that are supposed to tell you bad things will happen later) almost never happen.  Instead you have a person go instantly from OK to ohgodheskillingeverything in one snap.  Or if berserk rages aren’t your thing, how about that colonist that moved dead bodies for the 500th (They really should know this is normal by now) time suddenly going into a daze in -40 degree temps and stripping off all equipment, forbidding it, and then dying in the snow.  These events really need to have a higher threshold, and allow the minor events to trigger more frequently to blow off some steam.The next issue I have is the combat.  The damage system specifically.  It doesn't seem right that a person with a short bow can slice a guys arm off with his first shot and kill him.  In general the limbs seem to have the durability of a wet noodle, constantly flying off colonists whenever there’s a chance.  This doesn’t even touch on the issue that every enemy seems to be a god at shooting, hitting 100% of all shots from behind 2 layers of granite wall, but I digress.On a related note to combat, the way raids work removes the ability to make bases that aren’t one giant building.  You absolutely must make it that way, surround it by walls, and then abuse AI pathfinding to make the raid come through killboxes.  The whole experience feels like cheating because you're relying on faults in the AI and not skill.A funny thing to note is that raiders don't actually follow skill logic.  A raider incapable of violence will still be happy to snipe and a raider incapable of mining will be happy to be a sapper.The storyteller forces you to play mediocre, but not in a way that makes it feel you're fighting impossible odds.  It goes easy for awhile and then smacks you with a raider drop into your main base, setting everything on fire.  Not only that but the difficulty gap between the “Some Challenge” (AKA Easy, first difficulty is accurately named “Base Builder”) and “Rough” (Normal) is absolutely massive.  At no point in the “Easy” playthrough was I threatened in any way, but on my “Normal” playthrough everything got set on fire in Year 2 Summer, due to a volcanic winter making it impossible to grow crops and raids coming every day.Research level for scenarios seems a bit vestigial.  You can be researching spaceships while still having a neolithic tech level, but I expect that to change eventually.Colonist job priority even with manual priorities seems to be all over the place.  Set cleaning to below main job priority means they never clean.  Set it to equal and they run back and forth between the job they are doing and cleaning, not actually finishing either of them.There's a number of other issues with the game but they are minor.  Things like arbitrary furniture moving, research gaps, and events with no counter besides not playing.  The issues with the game currently are so numerous and so glaring that I have to wonder if they'll ever get fixed.  The concerns are further compounded by absolutely bizarre decisions by the developer (Passive aggressive modding support, steamworks DRM despite being proudly displaying the DRM free version on the main site) and makes me think that all of these things are intentional.I just hope I'm wrong.

Not only are the story mechanics effective and moving, the strategy is deep and well thought out, allowing the player to experiment with many different play styles without hitting an ""invisible wall"".  Honestly I saw my friend playing one of the first Alphas for this game and didn't think much of it, I got it myself a month or 2 later and took 2 days off school to play.  10/10 buy it and support.  The price is steep but worth it, you will get hundreds of hours out of this game, and Tynan the developer is dedicated and in full development mode, so updates and fixes are montly.

								One day an angry monkey attacked my camp and my band of tribespeople had to fight him off, thus injuring the monkey's shoulder. After seeing the monkey in pain and incapacitated, Camblar decided he would help the monkey. A day or so later Camblar names the Monkey Baldy and he becomes the tribe's best friend/mascot.Time passes and Camblar develops a crush on Trout, a gatherer, and they share their feelings of love as the tribe continues to expand there village. However the tribe failed to plant crops earlier in the year and suddenly the food is running out. As everyone stuggles to survive and find a way to get more food, Camblar is taken ill with some sort of plauge due to malnutrition. For the next few days Camblar can do nothing but rest in bed while the rest of his tribe is scrounging the jungle around them for berries and animals to hunt. Trout tries her best to tend to Camblar, bringing him food and medicine, and Baldy sleeps curled up next to him every night...but he doesn't seem to be improving...As Trout goes out on an ill-advised hunting mission with her friend Scorpion, the healer, her thoughts still dwell on her love, Camblar. Unfortunately her fragile state leads her to sustain a nasty scratch on her leg from a capybara, and soon after as she lies in a bed next to Camblar, trying to recover, she develops an infection. Things are looking grim and the herbal remidy supplies are running out, so Grey does the only thing he can do and builds a statue with some marble they had cleared away earlier. He creates a fair likeness of Camblar and Trout, symmetrically lying next to eachother in bed. In hopes of raising their spirits he puts the statue right next to their beds.But hope is not lost! Camblar's condition seems to be improving, as though he has developed an immunity to the plague! As he recovers he starts to do everything he can to help Trout, who is still bedridden; he cleans, he hunts, he builds, and he brings her food every day. And amazingly, Trout begins to recover as well, surving the infection some how and regaining her strength. The tribe can now celebrate at last as the crops are almost ready to harvest, everyone is in good health, and Baldy the monkey helps keep everyone happy.All is well in the village of Antioch.[...]Until there's a heatwave and everyone dies of heatstroke in their beds because they don't know how to swim, except for poor poor Camblar, whoose heat tolerance and non-violence meant he survived long enough to watch all his friends and loved ones die. Finally, depressed and alone (except for Baldy), went out into the jungle and got bitten by a cobra.A raider comes to the empty village and sets the crops on fire, incapacites Baldy, and leaves.And then a panther finishes Baldy off and eats him.And at last, Camblar dies.The End.9000/10 Would live, love, and die again.(And believe it or not that's pretty much EXACTLY what happened, I had tears in my eyes)			"

								Violet arrived at the colony approximately a year and a half after its founding.  Over the next two months, she helped build the space ship that would bring everyone back to civilization.  The ship was close to being finished when the wargs came...  A dozen of them... maybe more... started charging toward the camp.  The colonists knew the wargs would leave them alone if they just shut themselves inside for a few days.  The turrets though... They needed to be turned off or risk drawing the wargs inside.  Violet was closest to the door... She sprinted outside and ran from turret to turret, turning each off.  The last switch was flipped before the wargs spotted her.  She raced to the door, but was caught by the legs.  She knew if she kept moving to the camp she would draw them inside... She turned and stumbled as far away from the camp as she could, wargs tearing at her back until she collapsed.  The rest of the colony watched her fall and lie there, alive, with an army of wargs swarming her.  They knew they couldn't go out and rescue her.  It would have drawn them inside and cost the entire colony their lives.  So they waited... and watched... as Violet bled and starved over the next two days.She died.  The wargs left. The colonists made sculptures in her honor before taking to the stars.10/10 would watch a gut-wrenching display of heroism again "

								I played this before it was on steam all the way back from Alpha 3 as such my actual playtime is SIGNIFICANTLY higher.this is perhaps one of if not the best colony-survival game available, drawing inspiration from games such as dwarf fortress and prison architect combining various technological elements and is made/written VERY well with simply stunning levels of detail.to actually start a game you need to create a world that you like and then start a new colony, form there you roll for your survivors and stats, one of the game packs gives you the option to custom create survivors!!! #jealous form there its completely up to you as you do your best to ride out whatever narrator you chose as they weave the story of your survival, or more likely your glorious failure, each narrator has a difficulty rating and i definately enjoy the harder difficulties most.the premise of the story is that your survivors were in  cryo stasis on a ship which, for some reason, is on the ""rim"" of space but something happens to destroy the ship and only a few survivors escape pods crash land on a planet, hence rimworld, where they then have to fend off dangers form both raiders and nature long enough to construct a ship to get away.the game itself is rich with features and details, many crops top grow, an animal taming system, health and disease, and yes you can harvest organs, many areas of research, prisoner and recruitment system a massive array of ingame events i cna go on.if theres any game i give a perfect score to its this one.10/10			"

								Alright. So i've had RIMWORLD for a good 200 hours, my all time favourite game. AND ITS STILL IN EARLY ACCESS!Theres so many people writing about the in-game experience, so look at those if you want that.. The updates are fun, new, exciting, and come right on time when you're feeling like a changeThe customer service is beyond good, I rasied an issue with receving a steam key and I got help and a solution right awayI would personally pay upwards of $60 (aud) for this game, but if you're really on edge then wait for a sale and then go for itI imagine there is a steapish learning curve, i've had the game for a while now so i've learnt as it upgraded. But I would encourage you to push through and give it a try.AND THEN THERE ARE THE MODS! Everything you wish was in the game, there are in mods! and if there are any super great ones that everyone thinks should be in the vanilla game, it gets added! Fantastic game, one of my favourites!

								As a Dwarf Fortress player I must say that  RimWorld is great in what it does. It creates a world in which your colonist/tribe have/has to survive the environmental stresses, manhunting/crazy animals and even raids trying to kill/enslave your people .. or steal your supplies. Something I still miss from DF are the z-layers. But this will not hinder your experience much since there is a lot to do on the surface anyways. It may not even be necessary since it has one big improvment over DF that changes a lot. Easy modding and mod access for players through Steam and the Ludeon-Forums. By making modders able to improve the experience and share this work with others easily it is the players choice how he or she will play and shape their own experience and difficulty over and over.Even if you do not like its predecessor in spirit, try it out and you will see that the thought ""Just 5 more minutes."" will be a common thing during playing this wonderful game.

Early Access Review
								This game is fun and addictive. The description is spot on. Its like Sims+Dwarf Fortress+Space. Totally awesome. Its dedication to making meaning out of the little things is truely exemplary. Running a colony is not easy and keeping everyone alive despite themselves is challenging. The game gives you a lot of tools and a lot of problems and you have to figure the rest out. Its a lot of fun IMO to do so. Every colony I start has new challenges, complexities, and dies a different way LOL.See, your colonists are flawed people. They have had hard lives and lived through a lot. Everyone has their preferences, quirks, strengths and weaknesses. They are also people, not drones. They want nice things... and get unhapoy when forced to toil endlessly slave labor conditions. Its just as much about the people as it is about progression. To understand, let me tell you a story. This story is mostly about a teenager named Fay. Once there was a crashed colony shop and it had 3 survivors. The other two colonists are Erin and Taya. But Erin and Taya are only important in that they are militantly opposed to cooking for themselves. Perhaps their parents only ever ate out and Erin and Taya deeply believe that they cannot even learn to cook.Fay though, Fay can cook. Not well however. She is in fact, terrible at it and will likely never be good. Despite this, Fay has to cook for everyone. Its largely self defense because Erin and Taya refuse to cook. So either Fay cooks or she eats uncooked rice and boar corpses.And so the colony lived on...or it would have of not for Fay's crucial addiction to alcohol. She is massively alcoholic in fact, but there's no booze at all on the crashed colony. Prolonged sobriety is intolerable for Fay and so, once a month, she has a mental breakdown from withdrawal. Usually this means she just flings off her clothing and wanders in the woods for a while.It also means that, once a month, Erin and Taya have no one to cook for them. I have no sympathy for their week long starvation. The lack of proper work getting done during that time is deplorable however. As Erin and Taya also have mental break downs after a week of eaten raw-rice covered frozen squirel corpses, I start to care less and less about curing Fay's alcoholism and more about just getting the woman a drink.The opportunity arises when a trader comes through with beer. Fay trades generously for said beer and her mental stability improves dramaticlly with every swig. For a while, meals get cooked and work gets done in the colony. I have hope for the winter.Until Taya's mom, Raven, shows up. Injured and crawling to us through the wilds, she is rescued by Taya. Even better, Raven can cook! The colony is saved! Stability at last! And then she promptly dies of a stomache infection....in Taya's bed no less. We tried to amputate her stomach to save her, but the operation failed. Not that success would have been success.Taya is destroyed by this event, understandably. In her grief, she steals all the colony's beer and drinks herself sick. Can you blame the poor lady?Immediatly, a deprived Fay plunges into withdrawal once again. She breaks quickly and runs off naked into the winter night. It doesn't end well. The colony looks doomed at this point. Taya and Erin stare at the stove that puzzles them so as they munch on a mad racoon that is dead on their table.But lucky stars above! A new cook wanders in and wishes to join the colony! It's a godsend. We are saved!Before the new cook can set down her things, Erin and Taya go nuts from eating frozen raw rice and dead bandits. Super nuts. The Shining nuts.Berserk with hunger and probably rabies, Erin and Taya kill their savoir chef before fatally mauling each other.Erin dies atop the corpses of her fellows. Inches from the unused stove and stockpile of food that could have saved them all. If only she'd believed in herself and tried to cook. Just once...So yeah, this game rocks. Its hard but hilarious. You'll be balancing the most ridiculous, yet natural, problems while constantly expanding your abilities and liabilites. Other important facts1. No multiplayer2. No victory conditions, you play forever and just have to roll your own win.3. Combat is simple yet strangly, deeply tactical and statisfying.4. There's also factions and regional politics to manage.5. The UI is a little intimidating, but ultimately its not hard to use once you grok a few critical tools (like zones).I paid $30 for this on early access, which I normally NEVER would do. Its been a great purchase so far. Many lulz and many facepalms. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it Fay, Erin, and Taya. ^_^ "

								I started off in the desert to see how it was as a change. We had 3 survivors, Bellerose, Roman, and Ramyn. AKA Noodles.Noodles was the greatest doctor in the game. He could patch up anybody, with a stick and a block of ice, probably. Sadly, we had few resources. The only steel we got was from steel walls all over the world and wood was not to be seen. We managed to build our homes shotgun style (one corridor with rooms on the left and right) and hoped for the best.We found an ""ancient danger"" which was a large limestone room, covered in darkness. We needed supplies, so we broke it down to see what was in there. It was cyrptosleep chambers. 4 of them. Despite warnings I had read from guides, I opened them.3 guys and 1 female popped out of the chambers, 3 of them in shock. The other one had an SMG. He opened fire at Bellerose, who fled the scene. Due to cyrptosleep sickness, the man started to spew his lunch all over the limestone floor. Noodles, being a brawler, rushed at him with a knife. He managed to kill the man, and we gave Bellerose his SMG since she was the only one who wasn't a brawler. However, during the fight, Noodles got his left foot shot.Since he was the only certified doctor in the colony, we had to put him through amateur care. Meanwhile, a mad animal was running around (Iguana) and was closing in our home. I sent Bellerose out with her Tec-9 and she shot the Iguana, but she got injured as well.While Bellerose was in bed, resting away her pain, Noodles, who got shot in his foot, crawled out of bed to get a medic kit and heal Bellerose. This hero. Sadly, he got a major infection in his left foot. Due to the lack of medical knowledge from anyone, we had to amputate it.When he recovered, we gave him a wooden peg leg. He was fine with it, even though he moved slower. When he woke up, everyone went back to sleep. He continued the freezer we were building at the time for around 4 hours before going to sleep. Around this time, a woman named Minla joined our colony.This man has done so much. But sadly, he couldn't help our food problem. We were running low on food. We had to grab the bodies from the cyrosleep chambers (they were still fresh) and poor Noodles was so hungry, he had to eat the corpses. Raw. Before they were bucthered.This obviously took a toll on his mental health. He asked Bellerose out, and got rejected. This was the breaking point. He stabbed his cat, and chased after Roman, who got cut up. We needed Noodles. He was a great doctor. I decided to make Bellerose melee attack Noodles. This didn't work out well. He chased after a rat, stabbed it, and finally stabbed Minla. He got over his mental breakdown, and rescued Minla. Due to his peg leg and his wounds over his torso, he walked at a snail's pace. This resulted in Roman and Bellerose slowly bleeding to death in the middle of a desert.Minla and Noodles rested. The wounds over Noodles chest got too much, and he got a major infection. Then, Minla woke up, grabbed a knife, and went berserk. She tried to stab Noodles for killing everyone else. Noodles was quick to take her down of course, and went back to sleep with a corpse in his room. When he woke up, he truly snapped. He wandered around the corridor, completely nude, and dropped his knife.Raiders attacked. They smashed the cooler, the solar panels, stole gold and a bunch of clothes, and lit one of the wooden walls on fire before running off. Noodles didn't notice this. He wandered around still, until he got downed from a heat stroke. He couldn't escape.The fire burned everything inside the entire house, except for a couple of human meat for some reason. Including Noodles.Rest in peace Noodles. You may not be thinking right, but you'll still be a hero.			"

								The current alpha (version 16) features several initial starting conditions, three AI storytellers that guide how often hostile units and events occur, a brief tutorial (though in-game hints and notifications are present), and randomized maps on which to settle. Each colonist has a very particular set of skills for cooking, medicine, research, and the like, some of which they are passionate about and will gain experience for more quickly. Colonists automatically undertake tasks (if they are allowed to perform that specific job), including resource collection, construction, crop maintenance, moving goods around, and crafting things. Colonists also exhibit complex moods based on their traits and surroundings. Each settlement can include houses, stockpiles, kitchens, dining rooms, workshops to produce goods, hospital rooms for healing the sick, power turbines to generate electricity, research labs to unlock new options, and freezers to preserve food. Hostile enemies will invade, so defenses must be constructed (the game utilizes cover); prisoners captured after a raid can be incorporated into society or harvested for organs (among other options). Overall, the game is more approachable that a lot of colony management simulations but still features rather deep mechanics in several areas.

								Highly addictive colony management sim that is difficult to put down once you get hooked. The term ""emergent gameplay"" gets thrown around a lot these days and most games don't get it right. RimWorld is an exception as it pretty much excels in this regard. All of your colonists come with a wide variety of traits, skills and personalities which makes for some very interesting and amusing scenarios as the game progresses. This is one of those games where each new game feels different and can lead to various outcomes (and it often includes the violent breakdown of your colony).There are plenty of different difficulty settings to choose from. You could play it as a relaxing colony builder for example or gradually ramp up the difficulty and make life hell for the colonists. You'll have to keep your colonists well fed and taken care of by setting up production chains, defend them from extreme weather conditions, fend bandit and animal attacks as well as deal with their interpersonal issues. As a colony builder it offers you a lot of freedom over how you build and expand. It's extremely satisfying to build a well laid out and well-defended colony. The UI right now isn't the best but it isn't bad either. I'm sure it will be improved with further updates but the game is quite playable and fun.RimWorld is mostly the work of one developer and it's remarkable in that aspect. It contains depth that's rarely found in big budget games with teams of hundreds of people. I am constantly blown away by the emergent scenarios it throws at you and none of that is scripted. One moment your colony may be running like a well-oiled machine, the next moment a single wild animal might start a chain of events that ultimately lead to it's complete breakdown. These failures never feel frustrating and you can always go back to a previous save (unless you're playing on permadeath).The graphics are simple and might not look appealing at first but the game has a certain charm of it's own. You'll begin to appreciate the little details and effects on various actions and items. I personally feel like it's a great looking game and the visuals do grow on you. There's a lot to do in this game and it's impossible to cover all aspects in a few words. For example I haven't even touched upon the deep crafting, farming and work assignment mechanics. Bottomline is - if you like management / sim games and love building stuff it doesn't get better than this. This is probably the best Early Access game I've bought and is definitely a case in favor of the medium.			"

Early Access Review
OVERVIEWNote: RimWorld is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was 0.16.1393.RimWorld is a science-fiction village simulator and survival game from independent developer, Ludeon Studios.In RimWorld, you take control of a small group of colonists trying to survive on a frontier planet. You have to manage not only their use of natural resources while they establish and grow fledgling colony, but also their psychological state and social interactions.GraphicsThe graphics in RimWorld are an odd mix that I wasn't sure about to begin with, but I've decided that I like them. Characters are represented by these funny little 'pawns' with no animations, that just sort of glide across the ground, pausing every now and then to perform an assigned task. They're very basic, but also presumably very low in resource usage, and there's something appealing about them once you get used to them.The world is presented in overhead view, with a useful zoom range, and looks very nice. Map tiles are well textured and blended together. Some of the objects don't look fantastic (for example, the wood-powered generator didn't really look like anything to me), but generally the game looks good. Weather effects and the day-night cycle look very nice, too.The interface took a little getting used to as well, but it's consistent and works well. I'd suggest renaming the 'Architect' menu, though; a great amount of the items within it have nothing to do with architecture. Depending on your screen resolution, you can scale the UI significantly; I played in 1920x1080 and the default 1x scale was fine. There are no other graphics options.SoundThe music in the game is very nice, indeed. I'm not sure about the number of tracks, but they all have a consistent feel to them that really suits the game. It's very relaxing.Sound effects are well normalised, but nothing really jumped out at me as being particularly good or bad about them.There are no voices, or at least I haven't heard any yet.GameplayRimWorld is a village simulator in a science-fiction setting. The game gives you three scenarios, three 'AI Storytellers' (essentially event generators), and a range of different difficulty levels, then generates a planet for you. You select a landing point on the planet based on a number of variables, such as climate and topography, and then you're on your own, with between one and five colonists under your control, ready to start a new life.Colonists are individuals, with individual backgrounds, needs, and psychoses. These are done very well, and there's a great range of variables. You don't have any direct control over your group, though; you can only randomise the variables and hope for a good combination.On Day One, you need to focus on the simple things: shelter, food, defence, and that sort of thing. The game gives you some resources with which to begin, but you need to make sure your colony is self-sufficient in at least the basics before your starting stash runs out.Basic gameplay consists of designating objects or structures to build, lists of tasks to complete (called 'bills' in RimWorld), and setting up 'zones' in which activities are to be undertaken, or from which activities are restricted. You don't normally directly allocate colonists to take actions, but rather you control them indirectly through the work roster, where you can prioritise certain actions over others separately for each colonist.Defence is handled differently, with an option available to draft each colonist individually to a defence activity. In this case, you can take direct control over moving each colonist -- behind cover is a good idea! -- but they will still actively fire on interlopers at will, so there's not too much micromanagement required.As the days pass your colony begins to thrive -- or not -- and your colonists develop happy relationships -- or not! There's a research technology tree and a good range of things to build, grow, and maintain. It all takes quite a while, but the basic time controls let you pause and issue commands (very useful for defence), as well as speed up time by a large factor, so you're never waiting too long for something to happen.It's all very well balanced and a lot of fun.RimWorld isn't perfect, though. It's still in Early Access, so I have hopes for further improvements and additions. It does seem very stable and playable even now, but there are a few issues I'd very much like to see addressed.First, colonists often just ignore their work assignments. I haven't managed to work out why this happens, but often they'll just ignore something I've designated, or I'll have one of my colonists do nothing, with a UI message telling me they are idle, even when there's plenty of work for them to do based on their work priorities. Even creating more new high-priority work doesn't get them out of this state, with the only way I've found to force them to do something being to manually prioritise a particular task. Even then, though, they'll often revert to their idle state afterwards.Second, the behaviour of wild animals is completely unnatural. Bears will happily wander around ignoring other animals and colonists alike, with only random 'aggro' events or failed animal handling attempts causing them to attack anything -- and then they just attack wildly until they die. I'd love to see some more realistic animal behaviour implemented in the game.And third, there's just not enough 'stuff' to make! I don't know if it's because the UI is only designed to allow one row of options in each menu, but the options available are rather limited. Sure, there's enough to keep you busy, but I want more, more, more!The game also has an active modding community and makes use of Steam Workshop, so if you want to head off the beaten track into user-made territory, then that's an option.PROS AND CONSPros:+ In-depth survival simulation in an interesting setting, and it's FUN!+ Excellent game design and balancing+ Great musicCons:- Colonists sometimes ignore work- Animals don't behave naturally- We need more of everything!CONCLUSIONAt the moment, RimWorld is an excellent game. I hope it becomes even better before it leaves Early Access.Super SaveSaveSave for LaterPauseQuitRage QuitNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

								I serverly enjoyed this game, and will continue to play it. The rogue like elements wiht survival and emontial needs of your colonists make the game challenging and interesting to play in, along with the satification of a self-sufficiant colony. The delvelopers have been up with updates and bug fixes, and never stop to bring new and innovative mechanics to the game that change it completly. This game is not for those looking to play casually, well, you can, but be prepared for this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥in and leave nothing but a sad and depressed feeling as you then watch everything burn... But then you find many, many mods that change the game even further and dive back in with a new game!My gripe about this game is that the learning curve to it scares people away, and the UI is scary to those who are used to seeing a freindly one, its a bit clunky and sometimes difficult to find what you are looking for. Also, remember when I said that it likes to kick your♥♥♥♥♥in? It does that alot, and fairly often, to a point where this is the only game where I have save scummed a few times becuase of some of the things that have happened that led my colony to wiped off the face of the planet. Finally, my last gripe is that when playing it over and over, over coming hte struggles and problems that face early on makes each game fun and lasting, but when you get to the time of self-sufficiant, decemating all enemies within seconds, and being increadably rich, gets boring and nearly all games I had ended up like that. However, with the newest update likely added very new mechanics and features to be explored, the last bit can be forgotten, and besides all that, the game is great, and I will keep playing this.			"

								First playthrough experience: Standard fare, survivors work hard to set up a camp, a few dangerous events but all in all everything is looking good. Then a massive lightning storm hits and all hell breaks loose. Half of my outer buildings are wooden and as the grassfires rapidly approach some catch fire. My crops are burning as well. I rush my 4 colonists out but I realize too late that one has a trait that prevents him from fire fighting. He catches fire and I return him to the medbay. I also learn that another character only will fight fires in the open and not in buildings. I'm struggling to figure out what's going on and how to save the base when what happens next: A RAID! My one guy who won't firefight (its in his character traits) is recovering alone in the medbay. Where are the raiders headed? Right to the medbay while we are on the opposite side of the base. One of the outside doors has burnt down and is gone, so the medbay is not protected. He gets out of bed and preps his rifle. One raider rushes in, runs by him drawing his fire, and his buddy knocks my guy on the back of the head, he's down. My second guy rushes in with a pistol and gets laid out almost immediately. My warg runs in immediately after, gets bonked, and spends the next 10 minutes wandering in a psychotic daze. I have one man left, the chef who has a knife, but the raiders are leaving. He chases them down with a club, leaving my engineer who refuses to fight internal fires behind. My chef chases down one of the raiders and finishes him off, claiming his great bow. I send him up to fight the building fires while my engineer tries frantically to revive my unconscious drifter and get him in a medical bed. My geologist is dead in the medbay room. My engineer manages to get the drifter up and in bed and runs to get a medpack. My chef puts out the fires which spread into our foodstocks. Food reserves saved (winter is coming). As my engineer reaches the stock room, the reality of it all hits her and she breaks down into a anxiety attack and cowers in the corner while my drifter bleeds out. My chef breaks and goes bezerk, looking for anything moving to shoot with his new bow. The warg wanders aimlessly into the area and gets a final arrow in him and falls unconscious to the ground to bleed out. I saved the game under another name with my engineer cowering in the stockroom and the chef roaming the base in a bezerk state...10/10 would experience the horror again.			"

								100 hours in and I decide to start a new colony by putting 3 folks in their 20's. I like to roleplay so I put myself as one of the colonists.A week later, my in-game mom joins our colony. A month later two straight women, Isodora &  Sweetpea , joins the colony (on separate occasions) and fall in love with each other.Several weeks after the first month, the two madly in-love colonists get married. 2 minutes in the post-marriage party, mom  successfully woo's one of the married couple and starts an affair.Night of the honeymoon, A raid takes place.My in-game dad,  is part of the raiding faction. Dad kills two colonists and kidnaps one of the married couple while mom sleeps with the other one on their honeymoon. In-game me had a mental breakdown and put things on fire. Fire didn't kill me though, it burnt me a bit but it was a maddened turtle that finished me off.10/10  would roleplay again and see how ridiculous my next death would be like.			"

								First day, the planet overheated. All my people died of hearth attack. Second day I said I have experience now. I will name my people. One was my name, one was my girlfriend and one was a friend of ours. I tried to make a romance between me and my gf. I even forced them to sleep together. After one day she felt in love with our friend and I could not stop that. Me and my gf agreed that the right thing to do was to kill him, she could not accept that she cheated on me in the game. I killed him in the game, in his sleep. After, the character of my gf felt into depression and left the group. And after, I was bitten by a rat and poisoned all my body and no one was left to cure me. It was a very sad game. I dont recommend using your name or very close friends.I will definitely start a new story again.			"

								Rimworld is my dream game. When I played RTS's I always made a little town and defended it creating my own game within a game. I tried games like Sim City but it just didn't fit the type of game I was looking for. So when I saw Rimworld on Kickstarter and all of my dreams come true I had to have it.I have played Rimworld since Alhpa 1 and loved every second of it. When I play Rimworld it's not hours that go by but days. I love building a colony the way I want and defending it from raiders. All of the events that happen in the game make up a fun story with laughs, tears and rage.Rimworld got mod support on Alpha 2 or 3 so the community has been very busy and active making fun mods to keep you playing again and again.I know early access games can be hit or miss but trust me Rimworld was total gold on Alpha 1 and has only gotten better with each update. This is one early access game you DON'T need to worry about.			"

								I really wanted to give this game a review yesterday, but I wanted to wait until I had 30 hours so I could give some good input.Let me start off saying that this game is beautiful. Even in a toxic fallout during winter, I still liked the atmosphere.The developer is amazing. You could go on any Reddit post that has a question, and you would surely see an answer from the lead developer.PROS:I usually don't play games like this, but with all the reviews, I just had to buy it. I haven't stopped playing it since I've bought it.Super fun when you get the hang of it.There's always more to do in your colonyMicromanagement is masterfully made.CONS:Can be hard to learn.You'll kill a couple colonies before you learn the game completely...Overall, I'd give this 3 captured pirates and 6.5 colonists that were injured by wild boar revenge out of 10.(9.5 / 10)			"

Early Access Review
								Ignore my playtime - I have 1000+ hours since around alpha 7, this game is superb and an absolutely fantastic investment for the amount of time you can get out of it.To start, this game in its purest form is about controlling randomness. The planet is randomly generated. Your colonists are randomly generated. The events that transpire are random.You start with nothing - a few colonists with randomly generated abilities, personality traits, and possibly injuries or other health conditions. You have a handful of building materials, enough food to last a week, and some simple weapons. From there, it's your job to help them survive.However, you don't control your colonists directly. You give them orders, and they will try to carry them out. This isn't an RTS game - at its core it's a procedural story generator, and your role is basically to keep your colonists alive for as long as possible as their lives play out. You are like a mostly powerless god, able to guide your colonists but can never overcome their free will or innate personality traits for long. Things will never go exactly as planned, and that is part of the joy of the game. Traders will visit your colony, you will get raided by pirates and tribals and even mechanoids, colonists will get to know each other better and even fall in love, random disasters will happen, your colonists will get sick... their lives play out while randomness happens all around them.Once you get accustomed to the basic mechanics, the purest and arguably most fun way to play this game is 'iron man' mode - don't just reload an autosave whenever anything bad happens to your colony. When someone dies, they die. In some circumstances, that will mean the end of your colony. But sometimes you will continue, hampered by the loss of a colonist but hopeful for the future, eventually thriving without them. This is RimWorld at its best - a rich simulation that allows for some incredible storytelling. There are few games where you will ever find yourself so attached to what are essentially randomly generated pawns.A lot of people in the reviews are comparing RimWorld to Prison Architect, but it's only like PA in the sense that the art style is similar - the graphics are simplistic and representative. The game does not play the same way at all. It's much closer to Dwarf Fortress, but really it's a little unfair to compare RimWorld to another game because it doesn't really feel derivative of anything else. It's very much its own thing.I think it's easier to say who I wouldn't recommend this game for:- If you like to have tutorials and hand holding throughout, this game is not for you- If you don't like challenging games, this game is not for you- If you want action and constant battles and explosions, this game is not for you- If you like predictability and hate randomness, this game is not for youOverall, RimWorld might not be the prettiest game in the world, but what it lacks in looks it makes up for tenfold in replayability. Ludeon are constantly adding more content, they listen to community feedback, and even though it's Early Access this game has vastly more content and replayability than most completed indie games.I've invested hundreds of hours into this game and will probably invest thousands more. Couldn't recommend enough.			"

								Rimworld is a young and beautifully seductive... yet cruel and exotic mistress with a severe case of “BPD” (Borderline Personality Disorder) that you’ll find yourself running back to night, after night, after night. Once you understand her language, her …ways, endure her pain and suffering inflicted upon you nightly, and start to survive her fiery and destructive emotional outbursts. You’ll start to see the heavens part and the Godrays pour in on the potential that you can have, sharing a life together in a blissful new world harmony.However, if you mishandle her, miscalculate or neglect her needs, or… even say just one wrong word to her… expect everything you have painstakingly endured and built to be torn down in front of your very own eyes in a blaze of uncontrollable psychotic glory. When that moment finally happens, when the realisation that this thing, this… monster, that you once held so close and dear in your arms with all your hopes and dreams invested into, finally breaks free from its mental restraints of care, stability and love… You find yourself dazed and confused … staring into an endless moment of emotionless hindsight. You face your final moments alive on whatever world you have tried to stake out a living on in silence… you watch as your cooks arms are blown off by raiders that have stolen some new GlitterTech incendiary weaponry that is now setting your whole map, base, settlers and outer defences on fire… but its ok you never liked his simple cooked one ingredient meals that gave you food poisoning anyway……. WATCH IN HORROR!!!….. as your newly hatched chickens are beaten to death in melee and your pet house cat “Snuggles” neck is cut in cold blood, just because one of your own settlers is in a psychotic mood that their room isn’t as beautiful as someone’s else’s….. sigh R.I.P Snuggles and baby chicken nuggets. And finally watch as your last settler alive succumbs to extreme heatstroke that your whole base was suffering from, and dies on the floor of his very own room, his last thoughts of wishing that he had laid better quality floor boards… but just never had the time to do it…as his vison fades to darkness… Because, you see, an eclipse has blocked the sun for last 2 days which has knocked out your solar panel farm and drained the backup batteries that was once powering all of your bases air conditioners. Just then a solar flare event takes place that wipes out all electrically powered devices, so those wood fuel generators that you just built over the last 2 days to compensate for the loss of power the eclipse caused… are now useless. Then the left hook comes out of nowhere, that one you did not see coming, oh yes… an epic heatwave just shows up to say “hey, how you doin” …. pushing your global temps to 55+ degrees Celsius even in the shade. Without cooling available it effectively and slowly turns all living things into a sack of sizzling seductive bacon…. Hmmm bacon. In the famous words of Private Hicks “Game over man .. Game over!.“ 9.5/10 - Current Alpha State  Considering that this is still an alpha stage game, RimWorld shows a remarkable amount of polish and potential, however, whenever you do find a shortcoming with a game mechanic you don’t quite like, I guarantee you there’s a mod to meld this game into your style of play or aesthetic pleasure. The modding community on steam and the official forums is also very strong with new mods, updates and tweaks being added almost daily at the time of this review.A big plus for me also is that the developer listens to the modding community, and has quite simply stated that there are certain things he wants to expand in the final game content. And has announced to the modding community to focus creating those elements for it to be implemented into possible future alpha builds.As a student game developer I love this idea and will implement into my own game development plan when that time happens. Also for those that haven’t clocked like 50+ hrs on similar games like “Prison Architect” you will initially struggle. I’m not going to lie there’s currently a very steep learning curve even with the adaptive tutor enabled, but once you get over it, it’s pretty simple and has very enjoyable concepts to understand and master.These are all my reasons I have given RimWorld a Terminator 2 sinking fiery thumbs up.

								This is one of those gems of a game. One of those games that never gets old. A complete diamond.I backed this game a long time ago and its one of the best decisions Ive ever made. I very highly recomend this to everyone.Now the review...Its a colony sim game where your ""pawns"" are stranded on an outlying Rimworld. The game is driven by one of three story tellers that act as your ""rng"" trigering events and helping progress the game as you play. The goals of the game are simple, survive and try to get your colony off of this unforgiving land, but the gameplay and chances to achieve this are complicated.Each pawn has their own traits and moods. You must balance all the survival aspects of the game in order to succeed, however be warned; this game is unforgiving, balancing hunger, hapiness and raids. The depth of this game is beyond phenominal, if a pawn isnt properly taken care of they can break down and go on mental rampages. World events like super volcanoes can force your pawns inside, needing to grow their food indoors in hopes of lasting till the dust settles all while fending off pirates, natives, and wild animals.Pawns can fall in love, divorce, have rivals, hate each other, throw parties, instagate fights inside your own colony and so on.Now this is a colony building game, so there are aspects of building. Walls, defences, art, furniture, temperature controling systems. On the surface this game looks pretty simple, but as you play you will see the depth and complexity sewn into each fiber of this absolute gemstone.The community is 2nd to none, with an outstanging group of modders and mod support.Basically what im saying is why are you still reading reviews and why havnt you bought it yet?

Personally I'm enjoying this game and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about those who chose to reject a great game due to its ""horribly biased gender view"" (though, ironically, not due to the fact that this game allows incest and harvesting skin, meat and organs from helpless prisoners.). Maybe one day some kind modders can come up a good solution for you easily-triggered folks. Does uniformly distributed sexual orientation sound good to you?			"

								My first experience with Rimworld last night. Start with 3 shipwrecked colonists. Going pretty good, establishing base of operations. Random person walks up and joins us. The harvests are plentiful. Life is good.  Lone pirate attack. They kill best hunter/marksman. Knockout pirate. Take them as prisoner. Tend to their wounds and talk them into joining us and replacing the person they killed. Life is good.  A group of 9 abandoned cats joins the colony. Little did we know this would mark the end.  Group of 3 pirates attack. Defense turret destroyed by grenade flinging pirate. New reformed hunter dies. A cat dies and one of the colonists thinks this is a good time to go ahead and butcher that cat for meat. While picking up cat a grenade lands nearby. Colonist actually survives blast. 2 pirates killed, other flees. Cat butcher colonist is taken to medical bed for doctoring.  2 colonists that do most of the work come down with the flu. Confine them to their beds. 1 of the flu victims eventually goes berserk, kills other bed ridden comrade in their sleep with a knife. Beserk stumbles into hallway and starts attacking cats. Other colonist is now healed up from grenade and enters hallway to be stabbed by berserk. The colonist that has been taking care of everyone ends berserk with 2 rifle rounds. Berserk's trained dog goes mad upon seeing its master killed. Kill dog. They bury the 2 flu victims. Colonist that survived a grenade! and got stabbed by friend, wound gets infected. They die.  Remaining colonist doesn't bother to bury them, just drags the body off to where it won't be seen. In utter hopelessness I order last colonist to kill all the cats. Instead she heals and nurtures them. Cats multiply. I leave cave dwelling cat lady to her unkown fate.... most likely killed by pirates and then eaten by cats. "

 My Experience with Rimworld  Before I break it down into my personal Pros and Cons, I'd like to preface it by sharing a little bit of my experience with this game. I have been playing  Rimworld  since Alpha 3.  I try to describe this game to my friends and coworkers and I've never felt like I could properly explain the satisfying feeling you get from setting up a successful settlement.  I first heard about it from a good friend and fellow game enthusiast while I was home on leave before celebrating my honeymoon with my wife.  I decided to check it out while we were in the cabin relaxing and I remember feeling myself become enveloped in the game's depth and imaginative qualities.  I hadn't felt so lost in a game since I picked up WoW in 2004.  Needless to say, I continued playing.I played this game for hours and hours while overseas on a little Acer netbook.  I've never played a game with so much depth that can also run on a brick from 2009.  It introduced me to one of the friendliest modding communities and even enticed me to learn XML just to try and give something back to that same community.  Pros:   *Replay Value - You will play world after world, colony after colony and it won't even feel like you've lost when you restart.  *Friendly Support Team - I've had no issues dealing with Ludeon's people and I'm now a huge fan of Tynan.  *Modding Community - Incredibly dedicated group of people who only want to share a positive gaming experience with you.  *Customization - Everything can be changed whether it be with a gameplay mechanic or simple mod, it can be what you want it to be.   Cons:   *Learning Curve - It will take a few hours and scenarios to really get a feel of this game.  The smallest change in the updates can effect so much as well, which is somewhat of a Pro in it own right.  *It's an Alpha - Sometimes you can't get around the fact that it is an Alpha, albeit the most playable Alpha I've ever enjoyed; it can, at times feel a little unpolished.  *It's not for everybody - It really isn't.  Like I said earlier, describing this game and showing to to my friends/coworkers doesn't really work.  You may not know that you're going to enjoy it unless you really knew what you were looking at beforehand. I'll be editing this review as time goes on to update for current Alphas and to correct my formatting.  Thank you for reading my review on one of my favorite games.			"

I on the otherhand decided to lay my life aside for many hours of playing this amazingly deep and enjoyable game.  I cannot wait to see what the devs do with this going forward.  As it is this is a stable, full feeling and enjoyable game worth many hours of your time and easly worth the price of purchase.			"

								This is what all Early Access games should strive to be!  Truly lives up to being playable, fun, and generally bug free (except for insect hives).  The developer is active on the forum and subreddit and incorporates feedback into updates.And the gameplay itself?  A great mix of base-building with resource & people management.  A refreshing mix of having colonists with free will, strong controls for optionally setting specific priorites per person, and even being able to ""draft"" individual colonists for extreme micromanagement.  Lots of difficulty levels depending on how hardcore you want things to be, and plenty of big and little things to accomplish.  As a bonus, there are plenty of mods on the Steam Workshop.  All in all, well worth buying in its current state!			"

								Ok so, first of all I have to say I don't usually do reviews but believe me when I say this game deserves all the credit I can give it.Now, you gotta understand something about this game, you can't just buy it, hop in, play it for a bit and beat it, RimWorld will simply not allow you that, and that's good, that means more bang for your buck.When you start playing you'll mess up a lot of things and the game might seem unfairly unforgiving, but trust me, it's all about making for a good gaming experience. You'll lose more often than you'll win, heck I only beat the game after playing over 160 Hours, if that's not challenging I don't know what is, but in the end it still feels good, it feels like taking a punch and getting back up just to take another punch a few days (ingame days) later and get KO, RimWorld has no mercy, yet you know you can do better and believe me you'll strive to do better, the game manages to compel you.Ok so after this introduction let me tell you more or less the pros and cons.Pros:-Challenging-Hundreds of hours of play time-Active community making mods-Fun-New features added continuously, dev is really cool-Good bang for your buck-Adaptive AI that really works for any playstyle-Smooth performance, no lag or anythingCons:-Robs you of your life and sleeping hours-A bug here and there but nothing major-Still in alpha sure but this game is being developed properly so no worries-This game won't have a sale anytime soon so either buy it at full price or comeback in a couple of yearsExtra:Well with that out of the way let me just tell you a little bit of my latest story, which was the one I actually made it to the end!So I start on this planet a bit on the cold side but not too much, 3 guys right, everything starts smoothly enough, an easy raid now and then nothing too bad. Eventually I get 11 colonist, the most I ever had in any playthrough (it's hard keeping these little guys alive), so the AI decides those are way too many and throws down a sort of shipwreck that contains mechanoids inside, I prepare my colonists for the battle ahead and get some (guys with ranged guns) behind nearby sandbags I built near the crashed ship, and some (melee folks) really close to the ship, so the mechanoids come out and amongst all the gunfire, grenade tossing and punching I lose 4 colonists (funny enough I never managed to find one of the corpses, it wasn't anywhere to be found on the map, not in any graveyard or in plain sight, perhaps it was blown to pieces in the midst of the battle) and that wouldn't be too bad if not for in the next day I got 4 colonists with the plague and despite my best efforts they all died, so now I'm back to only 3 colonists. After this nothing major happened, apart the ocasional raid, crazy manhunter animals and infestations inside my base with genetically modified insect like creatures designed to kill, among other small things. So eventually I got back to 9 colonists and started preparing to leave the planet, bear in mind it took me almost 3 ingame years to get here, and you see, it takes A LOT of resources to build a new spaceship. So I started getting what I needed all while maintaining my base operational, and as luck would have it a new infestation spawned but this time was away from my base so I didn't have to fight it off in the meantime, although these bugs keep spreading and multiplying until there's no hope left, I tried using mortars to shell the multiple hives that had spawned over time but they were way too burrowed inside a mountain (and by now it was unthinkable to send my colonists in to fight these buggers), so now I know I have a deadline to get the hell off this infested forsaken planet. Now for the grande finale, as the spaceship was getting finished I got some colonists inside, and when it was finished and I was getting ready to get the last couple of colonists inside their cryptosleep caskets to blast off, and as I'm about to do it this giant raid comes my way with 30 raiders ready to pillage and murder everything that crossed their way so I hastily got my remaining colonists inside and blasted off just as the raiders were getting through my defenses. And this ladies and gentlemen was one story among so many others, the AI driven storyteller does a really amazing job, one of the best, if not the best, AI I've ever had the pleasure facing in any game.If you liked what you read please do buy the game, this developer deserves it and this game sure as hell does too.Thank you for your time.PS: It seems I might have stayed up playing for too long, the sun is rising.

								One of the very, very few games to draw me in for marathon sessions for YEARS on end. I got into RimWorld the day after the Kickstarter ended and have loved every single iteration of RimWorld. While a lot has been added to the game over the years, it has somehow retained the core of what made alpha 1 an absolute blast. It's a rare game where you grow attached to your pawns, to the home they've carved out of the wilderness, proud of the work you have accomplished and the threats you have survived. And you will get attached, you will holler in rage when one of them dies, or loses an eye, or gets kidnapped. You will rage quit when raiders blow their way through your walls to get to the undefended innards of your base, torching and destroying whatever they see. You may even shed a tear when a beloved pet gets mauled by a cougar. But you know what else you will do? You will start a new colony. You will fight tooth and nail to establish a safe haven for your burgeoning colony. You will learn from your mistakes and become better, stronger, smarter. You will learn how to survive on the Rim, to thrive, and maybe, maybe you will make it off the planet. Whatever you do, you will have fun. This is easily one of the best games I've ever had the joy to play. If you like base building, simulations, 'ant farms', you can only hope to fall in love with RimWorld. I'm glad Tynan waited so long to put this on Steam, I'm not sure I want to know how much of my life this game has devoured. And to think, I still have to load up a mod or two someday, should I ever get bored with the vanilla game. So far, that has not been the case. A very loud and hearty recommendation from me.			"

								Add 300+ hours to the total played as I owned this before its arrival on steam. This is my go to game for some humorous fun. The variation in biomes is excellent. Extreme cold did mean crossing some lines of food choices. Prisoners in these environments should be more co-operative for their own benefit! There are relationships and pets, friends and enemy’s so plenty of dynamics. I’ve had hilarious adventures like starting a new colony with 1 guy, his lover and his ex-wife … (Only his ex-wife could shoot!).One tip for survival is an old video of mine about freezers! Having a stockpile will save your life and your animals! 


YouTube™ Video: Rimworld - Dual Freezers 

			Views: 5,941		

			Currently freezers are better than fridges as nothing spoils. Video contains tips and tricks for building your own freezer. New recommendation for hot biomes to set freezer temp even lower.		

I think there should be a gun safety classroom … you will understand soon! My husband tries to save their lives I work on survival of the fittest principle. Unfortunately the mortar’s are so safe they rarely hit anything!No real tutorial but there are tons of you tube videos. Despite this the game is completely playable and has deep content crafting even though listed as Early Access. The best part is they continue to add more great stuff. This one ranks up there as one of my all-time favorite early access development success stories. Good work guys!For those having trouble ... let them die, learn from their death and then make a nice statue and a hat to remember them by. Fans of Gnomoria and Prison Architect should give it a go!			"

Early Access Review
								If steam would feature a ""neutral"" choice, that would be it for this game. Bare in mind while reading: You can like this game. There are great parts, but since there are many positive reviews, I feel it is necessary to state some of the things that might annoy the potential player and customer. I cannot stress it enough: This review is not meant to convince you that this is a bad game. It is not. But I feel that it is important to list the downsides aswell. If you can bare with the statement of downsides, read on. So, back to the original review:My personal opinion: In the beginning, the game was great fun, because everything was new. But over the time, first issues showed up:Micromanagement: You will basically have to do everything by yourself if you want to see it finished. Otherwise, the characters will find ways to screw up, ignore your orders or in many, many cases, get themselves killed. Hunting for example is one of the worst jobs for the characters, but can be most effective if you do everything on your own. Every time you will have to mark the creatures that shall be hunted and the characters will do it or not and if they do it, you will have many times where you watch them trying to shoot a sleeping hare for half a day. That is not effective. It gets more effective if you let a melee fighter hunt. But, it is still untopped if you simply take a guy with a melee weapon, put him on draft, kill everything you want to see dead and order haulers to get the carcasses. That will max out hunting, but YOU have to do it. There is another method though and that is ... mods. You will read that word alot in this review.Combat: If you do not micromanage the combat to an absurd level, everything will go down the drain. Ranged fighters will not automatically increase the distance to engaging targets. They will not stop firing even if they have already hit the friendly infront of them 3 freaking times and are about to kill him. The enemies however can have a ranged skill of 3 and be dumb as feck and will still manage to throw spears over several obstacles and hit three guys behind the cover of a steel wall. I had a situation where one enemy, completely unskilled, managed to shred off three armes and one leg with 4 attacks. The game was over after that. There is one great answer to this problem: Mods. You can find realistic combat mods to add some logic to a bugged and simply weird combat system.General logic and game difficulty: I play on rough and permadeath because that is the way the game is meant to be played. However, if you decrease the game by one difficulty, you will feel a huge gap. It will be dumb and dull. The game in general is not difficult, no matter what kind of difficulty you play. It only has one mechanism that makes it difficult: Crippled logic. If you present a problem and take away ALL the possible solutions but one, you will automatically have a difficult problem. And the game features tons of problems like this:- Heatwaves. If you play as tribals, early heatwaves will most likely end your game. Why? Because the game does not care about shade, wetness or if your home is build into a deep mountain. There are only two solutions: Micromanagement everything and be lucky or add cooling items like a cowboy hat or a vent. Thats it. - Manhunting packs. Why on earth would 24 boars swing by to attack your steel walls to crush you and your people? Why? And even if you somehow manage to fight off 8 manhunting boomalopes, everybody will be stressed and Roger the dog will go nuts and try to eat Betty the cook, which will make you shoot him which will make Denver, the dog owner, go bezerk. Yes, you are managing a bunch of lunatics and you will have to fight of the strangest things you have ever seen. While it sounds fun and can be fun the first time, it will be a game ender in most cases, causing you to start from scratch, doing the same stuff that was fun once over and over and over again.- Fires. It does not matter if you have a high technology colony, they will not be able to use buckets of water to put out fires. Steel walls will burn and the fire will spred. Steel. Walls. Will. Burn. And when an early dry thunderstorm hits your map, you will have tons of fun micromanaging every single firespot because your beloved colonists will find ways to get them in the middle of a fire and be killed.- Explosions. A power coduit will explode like a ton of super floyd TNT. You will not be able to place fuses. Unless you use ... a mod.- Moods. I had to laugh several times when I saw how this game was MADE difficult with moods. ""Feeling terrible for no reason"" is one of the best. But I also liked the combination of ""My husband Bob died"" and ""my friend Bob died"". One colonist will get multiple mali because of the death of one person. If you harvest the organs of a pirate that killed two of you people in an attack 2 minutes ago, people will be upset because ""innocents"" were harmed. Adding mechanisms like this is cheap if you ask me. On the other hand, you can command your colonists to do tons of stuff, but you cannot force them to do something that would actually bring joy into ther hearts. Like put 4 people at the billard table to have a good time. Well, you could certainly try to change that by ... you guessed it ... installing mods.- Extreme moods. So yeah, Bill has great clothes on, but his pants are down to 14% durability. He will be annoyed and yeah, he will most likely go postal on the others because of that hole in this pocket. That might sound extreme, but it can and will happen. People can go over the edge because of worn out clothes. And yeah, we found Bill in the stables, completely naked, punching the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the animals. At first, this might be fun but it will be frustrating and tedious over the tons of replays one will have.- Enemies. Watch them destroy steel walls with wooden clubs. Watch them break steel doors with bare hands. Its fun.Storyteller: That thing - to be entirely honest - really put me on the edge. Not so much that I dropped all my clothes and punched the innocent dog but I find it kind of dumb and insulting that the game is advertised with an individual and cool AI storyteller. There is none. What is meant is the random event generator. Thats the mechanism that will ""decide"" what random event you will face next. Is that a story? Certainly not! Otherwise, I would be a doctor because I can use a first aid kit. People, ... let me pass, I am a doctor! Boom, heatwave. Yeah, funny story.Mods: While the description states that the game already has alot of content, I would say, that is not true. The early content is neat and nicely done but in the midgame to lategame, there is nothing much to do. Unless, and here we go again, you install mods. Seriously, the game will be boring quite quickly but it will be more fun with mods. So, why is that a problem at all? Because I paid 30 bucks for it! I would not mind AT ALL if it wasn't for the price tag. Because I feel bad about all the modders that invest time and effort to make this game better and get nothing out of it. If half of the money would be distributed amongst the modding community, cool. If the game would be sold for 14,99, cool! But I paid 30 bucks for an early access game that does not feature alot of content, is artificially made complicated and will rapidly be 70% tedious and 30% fun. That is the main problem I have and why I would not recommend it unless somebody really wants to support the developer or simply has a passion for unfinished games that give you problems and take away all solutions but one.So, to sum up: For 15 bucks, sure why not. But 30 bucks for a game that will only be nice if you have 12 mods installed, sorry ... but no. In that case, wait until the full game is being released and check the reviews, especially the negative reviews, for the content.Now, fanboys ... please feel free to insult me and crush my feelings.

Early Access Review
								This Game is really, really awesome! I was slightly skeptical when i first saw that it looked similar to Prison Architect, but I decided to go for it anyway because the idea of building up a space colony seemed pretty cool. I am very glad I did. It really isnt anything like prison architect except for how the artwork looks and how you build but it plays totally different. Even though this title is still in early access, this proves that not all early access games are terrible or a joke. This is very well put together and each time you play, as the developer intends, it's a new experience, a new story, with different colonists. Since i've purchased this game, this is the only game i've been playing and my steam library contains over 100 games. It is addicting on the levels of Sid Mier's Civilization and the replayability is even higher. If you are unsure on whether to purchase this game but you like Sci-Fi, Tycoon/Management games, games in which you build something from nothing yourself, or if the idea of running your own tribe or space colony is appealing, i'd say one hundred percent get this game. Right now, it's selling for Thirty Dollars, and I think it's actually worth more, I appreciate the lower pricing range for the fact that it is early access and the developer knows that bugs can be found. My experience thus far has been seamless and bug-free at 35.3 hours game time when this was written. In addition to all the greatness in the original game, there is already a very large modding community turning out some great mods and scenarios for everyone to play and there is additional content coming every day! Final Rating for me , Five Stars, 10/10 / 100% love it. Thank you Ludeon Studios and everyone involved for creating such a great, quality game, keep up the good work!			"

								Been supporting this for about 2 years, great to finally see it on steam! These devs are phenomenal the amount of changes I've watch RimWorld go through is mind boggling, it's so far from the game I first played in 2014, and every step of the way it's been non stop improvements. These guys don't mess around! As for gameplay, this is a game for EVERYONE. Casual gamer? No problem, relax and build your base with an occasional interruption of a small invasion or alien attack. Looking for a challenge? Turn up the difficulty and prepare to spend every week in game fixing yourself up from the last attack, only to be hit again by the time you finish fixing up. If you like roleplaying there's an endless world with amazing stories to be had, the characters are all unique and as are their interactions with one another, and how they handle the environments and events around them. If you're more like me and just like to build a huge colony and not worry about the lives of the characters - go right ahead! They are yours and will do your bidding (within reason), just keep them relatively happy and you'll have yourself a massive compound with an unstoppable army in no time. Well, that's about all I have for right now. This game is 100% worth the money, I'd highly recommend looking into it if you haven't already, I've had hundreds of hours of fun adventures on this game and it's never been the same twice. I look forward for many more adventures in the future!			"

								I followed Rimworld since before it was accepted in to the Early Access on Steam and it has come leaps and bounds since those earlier versions I saw uploaded on Tynan's (the main developer) youtube channel. The game is like Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft had a child and that child became an astronaut. When I say it's like Dwarf Fortress, I specifically mean the colony management parts. Minecraft shares the survival themes and it's the closest game I could think of that matched in that aspect. In Rimworld, the three base scenarios are a group of 3 crash survivors, a group of 5 tribesman who have fled their land and a rich explorer. There are now tons of other scenarios (I haven't played any since most of my colonies die out early) and there's a lot of different ways to play Rimworld. After choosing the scenario you go on to choose from 9 different levels of difficulty. There are 3 AIs (in the base game, not in the other ones from Workshop), one that gives you a gradual progression in events, one that sends whatever the heck it wants at you whenever and one that's intended for playes that want a calmer experience. After choosing an AI you get to choose one of 6 overall game difficulties and if you want to include permadeath. There's peaceful if you just want to build a nice large colony that lives peacefully and then there's extreme where the game will try to ♥♥♥♥ing end you. After all those tedious settings, and creating your colonists you enter the game ready to challenge nature and other AI-driven enemies on a Rimworld. The game's great but if your attention span isn't very long you may have issues playing longer saves. It can be a little tedious just like all colony management games.			"

								I've found too many survival games to be tedious, and tend to lose interest n sandbox games pretty quickly. That being said, I can't put down rimworld. I find myself laying awake at night, thinking of ways I can optimize my base defenses, while still trying to build that extra bedroom so Bishop stops complaining about disturbed sleep...			"

								this game was a pleasant suprise.i bought it at full price at the recommendation of reviewers and friends.  i was expecting a ""prison architect"" clone, and at that would have found the game serviceable.  what i got was so much more.the game shares the same art style and basic functions of ""prison architect"" but is a fundamentally different game.  i actually enjoyed playing it more than PA.  hunting, farming, mining, crafting, training animals, trading, basic diplomacy, inter-colonist relations, mood, object quality, random events, an ai ""storyteller,"" and an ""end game"" are what it adds beyond the ""build, plan, manage"" formula of PA; in the setting of a colony stranded on an unforgiving planet.  at the writing of this review, i have completed one colony playthrough on ""hard"" difficulty at around 60 hours.  i could have completed it in about half the time if i didn't go for a ""100% complete.""  i'm looking forawrd to further playthroughs with mods, different start conditions, and harder difficulty at some point, as well as eagerly looking forward to what further content gets added to the game; so can say for me that replayability is high for the game.100% recommend for management/build game lovers, even at full price.

								For me this is one of the games that creates this magical feeling of something special, something new. It manages to create interesting stories again and again. I've played the early access version for years now and I can still get excited to play again. While the core game is pretty solid, where it shines is in the mod building community. Some mods are almost essential while others add a lot of content and flavour. So don't miss out on what you find in the workshop, and if you want to take it a step further, in the game's mod forum[ludeon.com].			"

								RimWorld: Losing is FUN! (TM)or... How I learned to stop worrying and love the boomrat.Crazy thing... about an hour in to your settlement, your chest will puff up with pride, a single tear will roll down your cheek, and you'll be filled with an urge to go tell someone all about it. This will be approximately two weeks in to your experience with the game.If you've ever loved Dwarf Fortress, or if you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but wish it was a little more accessible, RimWorld might be worth your time. While it certainly isn't without glaring flaws, I find over all, this game's brilliant successes more than make up for them.The gameplay, which, cards on the table, is the most important thing for me, is on point. I find most of their systems to be well balanced and interesting. Difficulty is extremely modular and customizable, and you should be able to find the right amount of challenge for yourself. Unfortunately, starting the game still feels a little cumbersome. Without downloading mods, you cannot control anything about the survivors you take with you on your expedition, aside from rerolling them randomly over and over until one fits your needs. EDB Prepare Carefully *helps*, but in my opinion, it's too far in the other direction; it allows TOTAL control over your settlers, with zero limits. If the random rolls were a little more playable, that would help, or maybe if you could save certain survivors.Visually, this game is a perfect example of aesthetics vs. graphics. The graphics for this title are pretty simple and plain, but aesthetically, it comes together very nicely. I do recommend some visual mods here- My favorite is one that recolors stockpiles. Excellent for organization!The best part of this game is its accessibility. I can't tell you how many people I've shown Dwarf Fortress, only for them to go ""Oh, that looks REALLY complicated. I mean, cool, but REALLY complicated."" RimWorld has a very well written tutorial to show you the basics, and then an exceptionally designed hint system, that warns you when you're about to shoot yourself in the foot because you don't know what a gun is. For example, I was building a sprawling apartment complex to combine my summer cooling units. The game went, ""Uh, hey boss, I know that LOOKS more convenient, but if a fire rolls through here, your lack of fire breaks is gonna make this place light up faster than the end of Burning Man.""And I was like, ""Oh, that's a good point, tutorial dude! Thanks!""Essentially, after the first tutorial, the game offers unobtrusive tips, tailored around the activity you are currently performing, with suggestions based on what the game thinks you might be doing wrong. I found the tips to GREATLY increase my enjoyment of the game, and it's the best handling of a help system that I've ever seen.So let's break it down.Good: Fantastic ""tribe management"" gameplay, with an emphasis on roguelike Die and Try Again strategies. Excellent tutorial system, and the mod community grabs this game from the ""Good"" category and thrusts it violently in to ""Unmissable"". Bad: While the aesthetic is alright, the sprites do feel a little too similar. I do feel like the difficulty curve ramps up a little quickly on your first couple play throughs, but you'll get the hang of it after a while.Ugly: Character creation. Dear god, just let us express some preferences instead of spamming reroll over and over again.Recommended Mods: Glittertech, Hospitality A15, Recolor Stockpile			"

								A game that in which you die in tears and fire or live long enough to make that armchair out of Human Leather.A game of highs, lows and eccentric pawns to create memorable stories. Combined with a constant stream of invovative updates and one of the best Modding communities I have ever seen Rimworld is truly a masterpiece that I am proud to have backed near V 4 and spent hours playing and replaying.  Hopefully we can keep this pace up and that the Steam Release will draw new players into our crazy world.			"

								Early Access, my muscular buttocks. I've been playing Rimworld off and on throughout development, and even the very first alpha version I tried was remarkably solid and fun to play. Granted, there's a lot more content now--and I mean A LOT more--but at it's core Rimworld has always provided a smooth and entertaining experience. Tynan Sylvester's work ethic and quality control are unmatched by literally any other developer or game I've followed, and Rimworld could easily have shed the EA moniker a long, long time ago.In fact, Rimworld is one of the rare games--and I'm struggling to even think what might have been the last one--that I've been more than happy to pay full price for. In the era of bundles and Steam sales, that's saying quite a lot.The AI Storytellers and customization options for a new game allow players to tailor the experience to their whims. If you're looking for a challenge, you can pit yourself against the ever-increasing threat of hostile raids. More interested in the opposite end of the spectrum? Virtually eliminate threats altogether and focus your efforts on building your fledgling outpost into an impenetrable fortress. Or a vacation resort, if that's more your thing.But besides all the incredible gameplay mechanics at work--farming, animal taming, base-building, fortification, defense, combat--the most incredible aspect of Rimworld is the attachment you develop to your colonists. Even when the game lacked much of the depth and complexity that's been fleshed out over the past two years, you still got to know them as individual entities--traits, personalities (based on a few key variables), every injury they suffered, every mental break your other colonists had to wrangle them back from. When one dies, you may find yourself scrambling for a recent save file to bring them back. Not because you want to cheat the outcome, but because he or she was there from the beginning and it just doesn't feel right continuing without them.I got into playing Rimworld because I was excited about the base-building aspect, but there's so much more to enjoy here. It's sort of a top-down, base-building, survival, people sim. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know what will. I guess that makes this paragraph the TL;DR.So yes. It's worth full price. On sale, it's practically stealing.			"

								This is the story of how ""M"" murdered ""Engie.""-M joined the colony early on.-M and Engie started a friendship, as they worked tirelessly getting the colony up and running.-However, all good things come to an end.  -Raiders, jealous of my town of ""Freedonia,"" initiated a raid against us.  It was not uncommon, but, in a sick twist of fate,  M's brother was one of the raiders.  Engie had no choice but to gun down M's brother as he charged her with a club. This broke something inside of M.  For weeks later M would have nervous and mental breakdowns.  The colony always nursed him back to health, and with the introduction of beer, we thought all would be well.  But M always held a grudge against Engie.The emergency sirens go off.  Another attack is underway.  A mad elephant has grown a taste for human blood.  Engie and M go to defend the colony at the sandbags.  Engie takes aim, and fires the killing blow against the rabid elephant.  M took aim as well....but he was not targeting the elephant.  In a single shot that resounded from my speakers, M shot Engie once in the back of the head.  I looked on in horror as Engie, my best colonist and leader, lie dead next to the elephant.I knew M did it on purpose, but I couldn't prove it to the other colonists as they hid inside the base during the attack.  Fortunately, a new colonist named Timo joined up and I knew what must be done.  I told M to go hunting for food, but little did he know that he was hunting a Warg.  I made sure he didn't take his gun, as he thought he was going to hunt rabbits.  The warg vicisiouly attacked M, but did not kill him.  As he lay unconscious, Nemo, our doctor,  wanted to rush to the rescue.  I told her ""no. Timo will go get him.""  I gave Timo Engie's old pulse rifle, and sent him to ""take care of M.""  As M lay dying with hands outstretched for help from our new colonist, Timo raised his rifle.  ""For Engie.""  Those were the last words heard by M before the sound of a discharging pulse rifle resounded through the air.***10/10.  If only TV writers would play this game, we would have no end to outstanding drama on television!***			"

								I've been playing this game since it came out of Kickstarter, about two and a half years ago. I keep coming back to it because the of the insanely fun stories that happen. I am not going to regale you with any of them, since they are too many to count and I don't think I could choose. Updates are consistent, adding major new features every 2-3 months. The first Alpha I played back in late 2013 was Alpha 4 if I remember correctly, now it's Alpha 14 so roughly a new major update comes out every few months. The mods made for this is great and the community is nice overall, helping you with base layouts and tips. Downloading a mod for improved defences like trenches and embrasures together with a mod for zombies is probably one of the most fun times I've had with a game. I still miss that fortress town I made a few months ago to withstand those relentless zombies and desperate raiders... Every colonist's home was a bunker and they were laid out in a defensive grid with overlapping fields of fire. It was glorious.In my view, this is the essence of indiegaming and you will support a passionate developer who really cares for the game. So buy it already!			"

								  Rimworld is, essentially, a game in the Dwarf Fortress management/builder genre.  Compared to DF, however, it's much more tightly focused and scoped and a lot more easy to control.  It has a wide array of interesting encounters.  It even manages to serve up some reasonably compelling combat, frequently a weakness in these games, via the expediency of having combat be directly controlled by the player instead of relying on mushy indirect AI orders.  Complaints?  Relatively few and far between.  It's occasionally a bit unwieldy to manually have something moved somewhere, units don't automatically override behavior/location based forbiddances when manually ordered to do something, and getting a unit to manually do multiple related tasks (say, build multiple segments of a wall you want prioritized) is awkward.  Hunting AI is poor- units will stand at maximum range and plink all day at something instead of closing to a range where they have reasonable accuracy prior to firing.  Medicine usage (none/herbal/good/exceptional) is per-character, which can force a lot of micro to ensure you don't waste you entire stock of medicine treating low-risk injuries like bruises.  Etc, etc.  On a meta level, I feel like the endgame could use a bit tweaking- I got to spaceship building before I'd even fully exploited the tech tree, and once I got there the notion of sitting around griding time and resources to build the spaceship was unappealing.  Still, my time with the game so far has been compelling and addictive.  If you like the genre, I'd highly recommend RimWorld.  It is currently my favorite entry one of these kinds of games.			"

								I've played RimWorld for quite a while before the Steam release, but I'll try to keep my remarks focused on the Alpha 14 version.Scenarios are interesting. They offer a fresh experience to someone like me who has played and tested the game to death. They allow you to change the rules of the game and create a unique story.I've played with mods in RimWorld before, but having Workshop support at launch has meant that it's even easier for modders to get their mods in the hands of people. Of course, for modders there is a downside - it's more difficult than ever to get visibility for a mod unless it's advertised elsewhere or it reaches a certain threshold of subscribers and gets into a collection.But I digress. The gameplay itself is similar to previous versions, but a few adjustments have been made. For example, wild animals and visitors trapped within walls will now attempt to dig their way out and leave instead of standing around until starvation and insanity set in. An AI which doesn't react to exploitative gameplay spoils my immersion. So this gets a thumbs up from me.Another small but significant change - roofing is now something which must be constructed, rather than instantly appearing as soon as a room is completed. If I get too ambitious building shacks for colonists, some of them will have walls but nothing above them to keep out the elements.The insect infestations which were introduced in Alpha 13 now occur in a narrower range of conditions. Given that they're intended as a consequence for digging deeply and greedily into the mountains, this means you need only fear an infestation if you've actually mined into the mountain rather than picking at the visible veins.Map conditions can now be permanent as part of the scenario system. If you've ever wondered how you might survive on a planet where electronic devices don't work because of constant solar flare activity, now's your chance. Or perhaps you prefer the eternal night, in which case a permanent Eclipse is right up your street.You can now play as a tribe, rather than a group of crashed survivors. There's a bit of a challenge to be had, initially surviving without all the technological advantages that industrial-age colonists have. Indeed, your tribe learns those secrets at a slower rate - the more advanced the technology, the longer it takes for it to be researched. Great for long-term playthroughs.Tribes do have one ace up their sleeve - they start with the knowledge required to make a long-term food preserve called pemmican. This is a great way of using up meat which would otherwise go bad in warm temperatures.The gun turrets which were a staple of previous alphas now need to be researched. This means that in the early stages of a game, you need to stave off raids with deadfall traps and whatever weapons you can make, buy or loot. It definitely gives you an incentive to do research.It seems that there are a few minor issues with Alpha 14 which will be fixed in a later iteration. For example, there's no real benefit to mining into a mountain if you want to escape the outdoor heat.Overall, I would say that this has been the best update yet, and I can't wait to see what else Tynan and Ludeon Studios are cooking up.

								Like Prison Architect (in art style) meets Dwarf Fortress, but without as much complexity or depth (literal and figurative).Whereas in Dwarf Fortress the UI is a mess and you can dig through many layers and do many many things, Rimworld seemingly decided to start with the bare-bones of making a user-friendly UI and build up from there. The game is in Alpha 14 at the time of writing this but it feels pretty complete in the early-game. There is plenty to do and build for long enough to keep you coming back for days, but as you advance your colony you may realize the game slows down a bit as it goes on. This is likely just a product of Alpha-ness that will be addressed in future updates though, I can't imagine the developer doesn't have lots of plans.That said, when you start installing Mods and Mod-packs is when this game *really* shines. Between the ""Hardcore SK"" mod pack, ""Mega MOD Pack"", or many others, the game turns from a bare-bones almost-Dwarf Fortress into a game truly capable of standing up in its' own right.The mod community for this game is huge and adds a lot to this type of game; From combat ""realism"" overhauls, to new structures/production/technology trees, to even new character traits, mods turn this game up to 11.

The stories that generate from the game are hiliarous to share with people.   Long term play of a single colony is rare for me because I like starting from scratch so much, and adapting to my environment as best I can.  It's so varied each time I play, and seems to have endless replayability.

Or possibly a way to link games with other players and be able to trade, by sending caravans of people with what you're selling and calling for help where your game would load into their map so you could control your colonists to help aid other players. Other than that the game is great, it generally plays great with almost no game breaking bugs in my experience. If you have $30 and want a single player game that you can have tons of replayability with, i would highly recommend this game.			"

								I could write a lengthy review on why RimWorld is a good game. But it simply is, if you want a technical detailed overview look elsewhere.Time flies when playing RimWorld, it's a great game even on its current EA state, features are being added and the game is being updated regularly, there is a ton of mod support adressing issues, QoL improvements or implementing things that Tynan hasn't got around to (or doesn't want to)It's really fun trying to see your colonists survive and eventually escape, the stories that come up withing the game feel organic and meaningful (even if some aspects do need tuning)I know the price seems steep for a PA re-skin, but it's totally worth it, it's a genre defining game,  I mean it.

								Supported it since early early stages. Randomly saw a twitch streamer play it, and it blew me away. Had to buy it, so few games revolve around colonizing a planet in a sci-fi setting. Great genre, great storytelling, and great entertainment. Worth every penny.			"

								Been playing this game for months now. But it has finally came on steam. The game is basically like Prison architect in terms of graphics. But game style is much different and very nice. You have to manage a colony of colonist that arrive on strange new plant.Each time you start the game the map is procedurally generated. Hence, each time the experience is new. Overall the game is must buy. "

								I've played RimWorld for the last 2 and a half years on and off. Through the whole time Tynan put a lot of work and effort into the game. It has grown from a litlle towerdefense game to a full fleteched simulation game,  which you can slowly begin to  compare to the big dog DwarfFortress. It's still not as complex as DF (but which game is?) and it maybe never will, but it's the closest thing you get. Love this game, the community is great, and you can mod the sh*t out of it. If DF just frustrates you, but you still got that hardcore simultation game itch you wanna scratch, BUY IT!			"

								i will now recount a very tragic love storyour colony was thriving and we had just recruited a new member of our society, a woman which i named dracula. in her bio it said that she had a lover, james living far away somewhere. later i recieved a message that read that james himself was joining our colony. he must have longed for his lover dracula for some time and had finally decided to join her and be with her after all this time. truly a display of true love. after alot of planning and preparation james finally had the guts to propose to her but she coldheartedly rejected james and ended the relationship. after the soulcrushing rejection james lost his mind and went of a very sad wander to reflect over his life. he wandered for an entire night and when he came back she was waiting for him.....when he arrived she instatly insulted him and ofc he insulted back, that started an argument and that spiraled into a massive fist fight in which with one strong blow dracula murdered james, shattering his spine. then to avoid suspicion she hastily burried his shatterd body in a nearby open grave.after we reburried him in a sarcophagus as he deserved, what was he remembered for? his sad psycological breakdown..that poor sod may you rest in peace james this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased RimWorld roughly a year ago during the somewhat early stages of its development. And since then I have sunk hundreds (if not thousands) of hours into it before it was finally brought onto Steam. I did not come from a background of Dwarf Fortress of Prison Architect, nor did I believe that I would be a fan of the methodical and careful harvesting, construction and management that RimWorld's gameplay prominently features. I bought into RimWorld because I saw my favorite streamer play it, and it seemed different than the masses of shooters and fighting games that I had invested so much time into.When I first booted up RimWorld, I sat down with a glass of ice water and familiarized myself with its core gameplay mechanics. Each of your villagers is unique, with varying degrees of aptitude in everything from mining to creating artistic masterpieces. Your job as the player is to assign tasks that these villagers will complete based on their intelligent AI system; it is critical that you carefully manage what tasks are prioritized by which villager in order to ensure that your villagers are constantly working to build and improve your colony. However this is balanced by a Mood system that requires that you also manage your villager's health and recreational levels. That's the basic rundown of the system but I could go on for hours and hours and hours about the intricacies of the game. What's important is that you won't find yourself confused by how the game works at all.By the time I was wrapping up my first session of RimWorld, I reached over to take a drink from my glass of cold water and realized that all the ice had melted and it was lukewarm. Somehow, nine hours had passed. I was hooked. When a mad boar gored a good man to death, I wept. While my men and women fought with raider scum, I shouted with rage and frustration. And when even in the midst of surviving in a harsh and unforgiving new world, my survivors still found time to find love, I celebrated. There is something beautiful about RimWorld's complex (yet simple) gameplay. It manages to reach out and grab you, to really make you feel invested in the tiny pixels that mill about on your computer screen. It's very appropriate that the game's AI systems are labeled as storytellers, because RimWorld tells a story - your story. How it develops and ends is entirely up to you, and that's what makes RimWorld so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fun. All you need is a playlist of your favorite music and a nice glass of your favorite refreshment and you're ready to create a beautiful new world.Buy this game. If you have even the slightest interest in base building or city building simulations, or have any sort of history in games of those genres you will enjoy RimWorld thoroughly. It's also incredible how amazing RimWorld's developers are at building and expanding upon the game. These are people who refused to release the game because they felt like the game ""needed more features and depth,"" though I can say with certainty that at the time it had plenty of both. These devs are committed to making this game an amazing one, and I'd recommend you get behind it. Also boomrat infestation ♥♥♥♥ed my best colony, please send help.

								This is a great game. It says early access, but I have never encountered any bugs that I can recall. There are regular updates and improvements. It has Steam integration.The developer seems to be absolutely invested in improving and expanding an already great game. You can run it on a non-supercomputer (see: laptop) just fine. One impression you may get from it, is that it's one of those hard games that keeps coming at you until it destroys you. This is not the case at all. You set the difficulty in the begining. You can set it to a hard level, but I like to set it on ""base building mode"", which is just the second hardest difficulty level. It provides some challenge, but allows you to build up your community.I'll tell you one thing that happened to me. The mood of your colonists is important. I had one guy that was very talented but a bit neurotic, and one day he went nuts. Unfortunately he went nuts homocidal style, and started attacking his fellow colonists. Of course the colonists returned fire and killed him. Unfortunately, he had bonded as the main handler for a pair of fully grown bears. They didn't like when he was attacked; like not at all. You can imagine the bloodbath that ensued.The potential for unpredictability and unforseen consequences in this game is really high. It's an indie title that I cannot recommend enough. If it sounds like it's up your alley, grab it (on sale or not).			"

								I don't normally write reviews but this game is one of my favourites of all time, and I know it just came out on steam so a lot of steam users will not know anything about it.This game is kind of like dwarf fortress lite, it is simpler and better looking than DF, but has similar gameplay concepts. The main thing that makes this game great is that it has a very simple, streamlined and comprehensive modding system. This means that there are hundreds of excellent mods available so you can get the gameplay you like customised for yourself. I imagine it will take a while before all the mods make it onto the workshop, especially given that they probably have to be updated for the newest version. But you can check out what is available on the forum: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?board=15.0If you like squad based tactical games, survival games or resource management strategy games this one is worth a look. If you are turned off by 2d graphics then this is probably not for you.Ignore my steam hours played stat, I have played thousands of hours of this but I uses a heavily modded directory which I will probably never let the steam update system get near. Even just starting the game for 5 minutes in steam overwrote my mod config file. Until steam implements the ability to roll back updates so that you can keep playing your modded version for a while after a patch comes out, I would recommend copying the directory out of steam if you are using a lot of mods.

The Interface    It appears that some people are complaining on the complexity of it I had the game since alpha7-8, with that said. The interface may over take you for the first few min or so. Its all layed out in easy to understand format. 2, Hours    Weather youre just starting or have been here since alpha 1. The game its self is VERY easy to understand, and if you have any questiong or need help everone on the forums are a huge help and a bit smartassy.3. Game knowledge    I wanna say its very simalar to any survival game, but with an rts twist. Survive. Grow. Prosper. Repeat.Now i myself have well over 2000 hours in this game i play it almost everyday before the steam release. Like ive said ive been here since alpha7-8. I can assure you that youre gonna get what you payed for and then some! Tynan takes care of this game like his own kid. Update come around for bug fixes pretty regulary unless he goes on vacation. But that happens once in a blue moon.If you still arnt sure about it watch me play it here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMQWWk_yMUkHvQESKyPisgThe forums: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php    I will happily accept your friend requests if you have question before buying this game.I do appologize for any misspellings as it is 3 in the morning for me and worked all day			"

								Rimworld is currently one of my favourite games to date, and I've been playing it for 2 years before it launched on steam. I can only say; GET IT. You can easily sink hours upon hours into Rimworld. You get attached to your colonist. You share their joy, feel their pain and mourn when they die. Don't get me wrong, Rimworld is not without its flaws, but it's being constantly updated and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. So do yourself a favour and buy it!			"

								Unbelievably addictive and fun.In many ways, it resembles the ultimate simulation game that I've always wanted, a realistic simulation of surviving in a different world. Every aspect of living is simulated, Temeperature Jungles settlements need aircons to prevent heatstroke, iceworlds need heating. And those two need electricity, so if a solar flare knocks out your generators, you are in trouble, neccessatting good insulation and wood supply to outlast the solar flare.Most food will spoil in a few days, so construct a cooler to freeze a room and store your food there (this can be easily automated)! But freezers like in real life merely transfer the heat to another room. So this freezer needs vents connecting outside to prevent overheating the other rooms! This of course is unneccesary if your biome is freezing yearround, just build it outside to benefit from the environment.Food You can farm, keep animal husbandry, or hunt. Its possible to survive on just one source, but meat+veggies gives mood bonuses. If a wave of toxic fallout comes, or the outside terrain is too inhospitable, then you may need indoor farming with hydroponic farms and sun lamps. Cannibalism is always available for the desperate, but that gives severe penalities to mood (unless they have the cannibal trait, which gives a huge boost instead!).Mental stateYour colonists/pawns do have emotions, they may breakdown in stages if their mood is too low, making mood an extremely important part of the game. Brew beer, make sure the colony is tidy and clean without corpses, decorate with art, wear good clothing, etc etc.HealthYour colonists have detailed health stats, from fingers to toes to each major organ, they can all be damaged in combat. A good doctor can treat them, but sometimes wounds are so severe lungs, legs, eyes can be destroyed, so now you should either buy an expensive organ from traders,  or capture a prisoner and harvest their organs instead! (This gives a mood penalty unless the pawns have the psycopath traits)Depending on the biome, they can get a variety of infectious diseases, malaria to flu to sleeping sickness, then they are bedridden for a long time, you'd have to prepare for this eventuality if you are living in a jungle.CombatCombat is tactically simple but strategically deep, the positioning of your base, preconstructed defenses and traps, weapons and armor, will determine the result long before it begins. Enemies are affected by the same stats as your own pawns, so playing in iceworld biome with -90c temperature outside during winter means your enemies will just freeze to death while they attempt to bash down your doors!ConstructionYou can build your base outdoors or inside mountains, the first is faster but the latter is safer (can't have droppods penetrating mountanis), Strategically design it for work efficiency, thermal insulation, and defensive capabilities. Your pawns don't like sharing bedrooms or being disturbed in their sleep, organically pushing you to make seperate bedrooms with a hallway connecting them.PawnsEvery colonist is different, with different personality traits, different skills, different prohibitions, different health conditions, they really come alive and ensures you care (or hate) each individual pawn. You can assign the types of tasks they can work on and they automatically do so. But they also need play, need food (and a table to eat), and may be distracted. You merely guide them, not dictate them, which makes them more alive than the sims in my opinion. In combat though you can control them 100%, which prevents frustration in these critical momements, with just enough micromanagement to feel fun but not tedious.See the multitude of dimensions a player has to consider? This means there is always something on your mind, always something you can do better, driving you to play for hours and hours, I bought this game without much expectation (didn't like prison simulator), but it has proven incredibly addictive.

								Day 1: Three soldiers two being AWOL brothers Pvt. Loco and Sgt. Jenson and supervised by a super neurotic general “The Spear” that tends to babble concerning things, his squad will follow him unconditionally though. After landing on a strange planet all three-set out upon to find a good place to lay low for the night as temperatures reached to around -4 degrees. The three stumbled upon a derelict building with no structural damage so they built a door and bedded down for their first time in this unknown place.Day 2: After waking from their cramped place Jenson walked outside and in the morning sunlight now noticed the huge bay area was completely walled in on every side, leaving just a small opening leaving little area for an ambush.  The rest of the day was spent building a central outpost building inside the cove.Day 3: The Spear awoke hearing a far-off sound of gunfire. He stumbled through the darkness of the new home they had built outside where he sat and listened…… two minutes go by and all seemed well, Spear hadn’t heard anything but had a very uneasy feeling, a shot rang out and smashed into the wood wall next to Spear he without hesitation ,due to his Veteran background, wheeled to his left and shot his rifle through the darkness, a yell rang out and he knew he had hit his mark, at this moment Jenson and Loco were out the door. With the spears eyes finally adjusted he noticed that they still weren’t alone. Hiding behind the sandbag fort they had built that day Spear began to tell Jenson and Loco that he had seen two figures in the darkness. Loco without hesitation leaped over the sandbags and went off into the darkness. Jenson knew Loco had always bore a bloodlust ever since he was an orphan as a child and both were forced into gang life. Jenson slaughtered a 17-year-old boy and 23-year-old girl. They were attempting to flee as Loco got both and stabbed each over 12 times. His bloodlust was filled and he went to bed happy even with the bruises he sustained.Day 12: The three have been through hell and have been joined by a follower by the name of Greer. The fort had sustained multiple raids that yielded one prisoner, Claudia, and had raised considerable defenses. It was this day that the end became a real reality. Jenson ran into Spears room to which he stumbled upon a babbling crazed Spear. He was having one of his flashbacks from the Great war of 5487, these could go on for hours even up to days. A raid was imminent and the spear had been hoarding ammo for the two guns left for the fort. This left no other choice but for Loco, Greer, and Jenson to pick up what melee weapons they had left and set up a defensive position. Raiders outnumbered our combatants 4/3 and our first casualty was Greer. He sustained a shot to the head and died nearly instantly. Loco went into another of his rages and killed two of the raiders before succumbing to his injuries and going down. Jenson also knocked one out with a club causing the last raider to run away. It was this moment Spear ran out the door and one shot rang out through the cove. He had killed the fleeing raider. Jenson meanwhile took Loco to his bed and with closer examination noticed Loco had 3 fingers missing and was a deep gash in his thigh. Jenson tried his best for hours but Loco eventually died of blood loss. Overwhelmed Jenson took out his pistol and began to look for Spear intent on ending his life for getting them into this situation. As Jenson broke into Spears room he was no match Spear unleashed a shot right though Jenson’s shoulder. Spear with the hate of betrayal in his eyes shot once more into Jenson’s chest killing him. Spear began a downward spiral from this point on. Survivals guilt set in and he became depressed. Day 14: Now out of food Spear has begun to starve and being too depressed to gather food was rapidly wasting away. Claudia’s screams from the prison began to grow louder and louder as the hunger pains began to grow worse. As Spear began to bury the bodies left outside he notice it was starting to snow. Temperatures had reached -23 degrees and The Spear knew Claudia must have been freezing and starving, so he grabbed a basket of berries to bring to her, but as he walked by one of the bodies he noticed it was his son who had joined the pirate nation nearby. Spear had planned to leave that night and travel to another village, but he finally snapped. He walked to the storage closet where he took out the IED that he got scavenging after a raid and strapped it under his vest. As Spear opened the dark grisly prison door his life flashed before him. Claudia with little energy she had lunged at the spear as he grabbed her and pushed her into the cell closing the door behind them. Spear shouted “ALLAH AKBAH lol jk” and detonated destroying both of their bodies leaving nothing left of the stone cell just the door. The three Vets had a total of 16 confirmed kills, and were all awarded metal of honors post-Humorously Please get this game it’s one of the best, after putting hundreds of hours into Dwarf Fortress and I can say that this game can one day be as ambiguous as Dwarf fortress and I hope to put hundreds of hours onto this game.

								Incredible. That is how I would describe this game if only permitted one word. The gameplay, while not groundbreaking, is unique to each playthrough and provides great stories of heroism, comradery, and the inevitable downfall of your colony. The modding community for this game is amazing, considering the relatively short time since it's availability. The game is still in the alpha faze yet provides more entertainment than most major releases have been able to. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys sandbox gameplay with little or no goals other than prosperity. Truly one of the better games on Steam.			"

								Been playing the game since soon after it was released, and I've kept coming back to it.Rimworld is a 2D, top-down, science-fiction, story-driven colony basebuilding game. If you've played Dwarf Fortress, you'll find it pretty easy to pick up. If not, your colonists are probably going to get shot, frozen, eaten, burned, and so on before you get the hang of it, but its tutorial system is quite clever and generally makes sure you're on the right track.The game takes place 3500 years in the future, where humans have colonized the stars and so on. Because there is no faster-than-light travel in the game, some civilizations have regressed without contact with other civilizations. You crash-land on a world on the edge of colonized space and are given three survivors, two guns between them, and a few supplies that didn't burn up in the atmosphere. On the rimworld with you are indigenous pre-agricultural tribes, medieval feudal kingdoms, modern city-states, post-scarcity transhuman roboticist spacers, and any number of pirates trying to take your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you have to survive by trading with, kidnapping, or slaughtering them as you try not to die of ♥♥♥♥ing malaria or hypothermia or get eaten by wolves.It's pretty fun, well worth the $30.

Worth every penny. - More Details:                        I've been playing this game for a while now, even before the (Steam) release. And the impressions on this game were outstanding. There's so much you can do, manage and think or act fast for the safety of your colony, in this case it depends on the type storyteller you choose from/game-mode. -Challenges:                  The game offers three types of storytellers, each with a different perspective. Either you are a hardcore player or peaceful/dislike challenges. The game also have season, these are; Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. Keep in mind tempetures are very important for farming. Of course, all this depends on how you play or customize your gameplay, endless possibilities to start from.-Colonist:              Each colonist have their own traits, likes, dislikes, relationships, friendships, opinions, gay, straigh, lessbian, cold blooded, nudist, night owls etc... you name it. Each, trait will have an impact against others as in real life of course. However, those personalities will affect and cause rage and fights and even lead to serious injuries. If not dealt with as best as possible for the good of your colonists/happiness.-Biomes:              A variety of biomes are offer to play on. Each one of them provides with differents kind of wild life as well temperature and natural resource to use at your avantage. - Research and Craft:                               Research is very important to craft great gear, weapons and many useful utilities to enforce your colony and their survival.--------------------------------------TO BE UNCONTINUED-------------------------------------   There is more than you can think of.

								Ok so I have been playing this game since August of 2015 (pre-steam release) and I'd say I put about 400+ hours into the game. I feel I can comfotable give a decent review. From me, this game receives a  9.2/10 . This game only gets better with its constant stream of updates. Some say it feels unfinished but in my opinion this could ship as a finished game now. Pros   High  replayability. Fun combat mechanics. Open building system with tech trees (Building is similar to Prison Achritect). Indepth health system. Many different play styles. Lots of mods available. Cons  Some bugs. Can be hard to start off / mildly steep learning curve. No solid end-game.  PLEASE KEEP IN MIND RIMWORLD RECEIVES REGULAR UPDATES AND IS IN EARLY ACCESS!   "

								I would estimate the time I have put into Rimworld to be something along the lines of several hundreds of hours. To me, Rimworld is a game one can never get tired of. It becomes great fun, especially in later stages as you progress and develop your colonies, both internal and external conflicts will arise and with the latest updates there are a plethora of possibilities present. You tailor a scenario to your own liking, which means you can choose how you want to start, what traits your characters start with, what clothing, how old they are, and much much more.In short it seems like a watered down Dwarf Fortress, but it still remains a damn good game to this day.

								I very highly recommend this game!It's a truly unique game, and very well designed. It can be a little tough starting out, but it's not dwarf fortress. The mechanics are simple, but the game has so many features and interactions between them that there's a lot of depth. The fact that your colonists are mostly automated lets you sit back and make decisions rather than micro-managing.The randomized events, map generation, and different biomes give the game a lot of replayability. I actually have about 100 hours more than steam says, because I had the game before it was on steam.Make sure to look into mods after you've learned the game! This game has amazing mod support, and there are dozens, maybe hundreds of good quality mods out there. Steam workshop makes it really easy to search and find them too.			"

								I don't really go for these survival sim type games, but on recommendation from a friend I picked this up yesterday.  Do I recommend it YES, WHOLE HEARTEDLY YES!!  Rather than a review (I'm terrible at reviewing stuff) let me give you a rough synopsis of my current colony.We crash land on a planet, slowly beginning to get our bearings and some shelter, storage and garden built.  All of a sudden we notice a Timber Wolf nearby, is it friendly or hostile?  Our resident Hunter would rather not take a chance, so breaks out his rifle and fires a number  of times.  Out of 6 shots, 2 hit their mark, but sadly all this seems to do is♥♥♥♥♥♥the wolf off, who comes charging at our Hunter, he fumbles reloading and ends up having to take off at speed to try and avoid getting eaten,  obiviously the Wolf is faster than our Hunter so he's constantly being nipped at the heals.ANOTHER ALERT!!A Squirrel has gone nuts and is attacking one of the other colonists, chasing her down until she collapses from her wounds far from base.  She needs rescuing, so I send out my final colonist to bring her home.  In the mean time our Hunter is looking a lot worse for wear and is slowly making his way back to base with wolf in tow.  He just makes it inside in time.  Wolf starts banging at the door trying to get in.Cut to the other 2 colonists, they're now helping each other back to base, after the Squirrel attack, unaware there is a Timber Wolf trying to get in.Oh no, he's seen them, just before they get through the door to safety he pounces, killing one and severely injuring the other.  Wolf passes out due to his injuries from the Hunter.Hunter heres the commotion die down and begins to head towards the door, completely unaware his pet cat, enraged by the smell of blood, attacks him and leaves him immobile on the floor.So now I have 2 immobile survivors and absolutely nothing I can do, but wait for the infections to set in and kill them.Just when I had given up all hope, a native comes to our area to join our happy little colony, he carries the injured to their beds, treats their wounds and feeds them, before going to bed himself.and that my friends is where I have left this story.  I can't wait to see what happens next.What will your story be? "

								As you can probably tell, I've put a few hours into this game.This is one of those games where you'll lose a day in, an entire day. You'll wake up in the morn, open it up, and the next thing you know, your colony is being assaulted by exploding rats and it's 7am the next day. Not saying that happened to me, but still.It has a lot of mods, some that are really good, some that are necessary, some that are ""Well, that's a cool idea, but I don't need it"". There's also a series of Lovecraft mods that allow you to be assaulted by Eldritch Abominations or make your own cult. Neato.The game has problems in a few areas, but what game doesn't have problems? The most recent patch of A16 nerfed drugs a bit too much to be used, but can still be sold by the dump truck load easily. Never used drugs with my colonists, so whatever.The game doesn't have multiplayer and honestly, it doesn't really need it or I can't see how it would be implimented anyways. Multiplayer is something that should honestly be added last, after everything else the dev Tynan adds.Anyways, enough rambling, back in I dive.TL;DRGame is gr8. 10/10 Would make Human Leather Cowboy Hats and Dusters again.

								Incredible. That is how I would describe this game if only permitted one word. The gameplay, while not groundbreaking, is unique to each playthrough and provides great stories of heroism, comradery, and the inevitable downfall of your colony. The modding community for this game is amazing, considering the relatively short time since it's availability. The game is still in the alpha faze yet provides more entertainment than most major releases have been able to. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys sandbox gameplay with little or no goals other than prosperity. Truly one of the better games on Steam.			"

								Been playing the game since soon after it was released, and I've kept coming back to it.Rimworld is a 2D, top-down, science-fiction, story-driven colony basebuilding game. If you've played Dwarf Fortress, you'll find it pretty easy to pick up. If not, your colonists are probably going to get shot, frozen, eaten, burned, and so on before you get the hang of it, but its tutorial system is quite clever and generally makes sure you're on the right track.The game takes place 3500 years in the future, where humans have colonized the stars and so on. Because there is no faster-than-light travel in the game, some civilizations have regressed without contact with other civilizations. You crash-land on a world on the edge of colonized space and are given three survivors, two guns between them, and a few supplies that didn't burn up in the atmosphere. On the rimworld with you are indigenous pre-agricultural tribes, medieval feudal kingdoms, modern city-states, post-scarcity transhuman roboticist spacers, and any number of pirates trying to take your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you have to survive by trading with, kidnapping, or slaughtering them as you try not to die of ♥♥♥♥ing malaria or hypothermia or get eaten by wolves.It's pretty fun, well worth the $30.

								Rimworld is a mix between dwarf fortress, banished, prison architect and kings of dragon's pass. Strangely enough, I never got into one of those games, but this one is very addictive.Creating your colony from scratch, watching all the different characters interact is fun indeed, even when everything goes wrong. And it will go wrong sooner or later. Stories are created this way and you really feel invested in them.Replayability is through the roof and a lot of mods enhance it even further. Highly recommended and it's even early access!			"

								Unbelievably addictive and fun.In many ways, it resembles the ultimate simulation game that I've always wanted, a realistic simulation of surviving in a different world. Every aspect of living is simulated, Temeperature Jungles settlements need aircons to prevent heatstroke, iceworlds need heating. And those two need electricity, so if a solar flare knocks out your generators, you are in trouble, neccessatting good insulation and wood supply to outlast the solar flare.Most food will spoil in a few days, so construct a cooler to freeze a room and store your food there (this can be easily automated)! But freezers like in real life merely transfer the heat to another room. So this freezer needs vents connecting outside to prevent overheating the other rooms! This of course is unneccesary if your biome is freezing yearround, just build it outside to benefit from the environment.Food You can farm, keep animal husbandry, or hunt. Its possible to survive on just one source, but meat+veggies gives mood bonuses. If a wave of toxic fallout comes, or the outside terrain is too inhospitable, then you may need indoor farming with hydroponic farms and sun lamps. Cannibalism is always available for the desperate, but that gives severe penalities to mood (unless they have the cannibal trait, which gives a huge boost instead!).Mental stateYour colonists/pawns do have emotions, they may breakdown in stages if their mood is too low, making mood an extremely important part of the game. Brew beer, make sure the colony is tidy and clean without corpses, decorate with art, wear good clothing, etc etc.HealthYour colonists have detailed health stats, from fingers to toes to each major organ, they can all be damaged in combat. A good doctor can treat them, but sometimes wounds are so severe lungs, legs, eyes can be destroyed, so now you should either buy an expensive organ from traders,  or capture a prisoner and harvest their organs instead! (This gives a mood penalty unless the pawns have the psycopath traits)Depending on the biome, they can get a variety of infectious diseases, malaria to flu to sleeping sickness, then they are bedridden for a long time, you'd have to prepare for this eventuality if you are living in a jungle.CombatCombat is tactically simple but strategically deep, the positioning of your base, preconstructed defenses and traps, weapons and armor, will determine the result long before it begins. Enemies are affected by the same stats as your own pawns, so playing in iceworld biome with -90c temperature outside during winter means your enemies will just freeze to death while they attempt to bash down your doors!ConstructionYou can build your base outdoors or inside mountains, the first is faster but the latter is safer (can't have droppods penetrating mountanis), Strategically design it for work efficiency, thermal insulation, and defensive capabilities. Your pawns don't like sharing bedrooms or being disturbed in their sleep, organically pushing you to make seperate bedrooms with a hallway connecting them.PawnsEvery colonist is different, with different personality traits, different skills, different prohibitions, different health conditions, they really come alive and ensures you care (or hate) each individual pawn. You can assign the types of tasks they can work on and they automatically do so. But they also need play, need food (and a table to eat), and may be distracted. You merely guide them, not dictate them, which makes them more alive than the sims in my opinion. In combat though you can control them 100%, which prevents frustration in these critical momements, with just enough micromanagement to feel fun but not tedious.See the multitude of dimensions a player has to consider? This means there is always something on your mind, always something you can do better, driving you to play for hours and hours, I bought this game without much expectation (didn't like prison simulator), but it has proven incredibly addictive.

								Day 1: Three soldiers two being AWOL brothers Pvt. Loco and Sgt. Jenson and supervised by a super neurotic general “The Spear” that tends to babble concerning things, his squad will follow him unconditionally though. After landing on a strange planet all three-set out upon to find a good place to lay low for the night as temperatures reached to around -4 degrees. The three stumbled upon a derelict building with no structural damage so they built a door and bedded down for their first time in this unknown place.Day 2: After waking from their cramped place Jenson walked outside and in the morning sunlight now noticed the huge bay area was completely walled in on every side, leaving just a small opening leaving little area for an ambush.  The rest of the day was spent building a central outpost building inside the cove.Day 3: The Spear awoke hearing a far-off sound of gunfire. He stumbled through the darkness of the new home they had built outside where he sat and listened…… two minutes go by and all seemed well, Spear hadn’t heard anything but had a very uneasy feeling, a shot rang out and smashed into the wood wall next to Spear he without hesitation ,due to his Veteran background, wheeled to his left and shot his rifle through the darkness, a yell rang out and he knew he had hit his mark, at this moment Jenson and Loco were out the door. With the spears eyes finally adjusted he noticed that they still weren’t alone. Hiding behind the sandbag fort they had built that day Spear began to tell Jenson and Loco that he had seen two figures in the darkness. Loco without hesitation leaped over the sandbags and went off into the darkness. Jenson knew Loco had always bore a bloodlust ever since he was an orphan as a child and both were forced into gang life. Jenson slaughtered a 17-year-old boy and 23-year-old girl. They were attempting to flee as Loco got both and stabbed each over 12 times. His bloodlust was filled and he went to bed happy even with the bruises he sustained.Day 12: The three have been through hell and have been joined by a follower by the name of Greer. The fort had sustained multiple raids that yielded one prisoner, Claudia, and had raised considerable defenses. It was this day that the end became a real reality. Jenson ran into Spears room to which he stumbled upon a babbling crazed Spear. He was having one of his flashbacks from the Great war of 5487, these could go on for hours even up to days. A raid was imminent and the spear had been hoarding ammo for the two guns left for the fort. This left no other choice but for Loco, Greer, and Jenson to pick up what melee weapons they had left and set up a defensive position. Raiders outnumbered our combatants 4/3 and our first casualty was Greer. He sustained a shot to the head and died nearly instantly. Loco went into another of his rages and killed two of the raiders before succumbing to his injuries and going down. Jenson also knocked one out with a club causing the last raider to run away. It was this moment Spear ran out the door and one shot rang out through the cove. He had killed the fleeing raider. Jenson meanwhile took Loco to his bed and with closer examination noticed Loco had 3 fingers missing and was a deep gash in his thigh. Jenson tried his best for hours but Loco eventually died of blood loss. Overwhelmed Jenson took out his pistol and began to look for Spear intent on ending his life for getting them into this situation. As Jenson broke into Spears room he was no match Spear unleashed a shot right though Jenson’s shoulder. Spear with the hate of betrayal in his eyes shot once more into Jenson’s chest killing him. Spear began a downward spiral from this point on. Survivals guilt set in and he became depressed. Day 14: Now out of food Spear has begun to starve and being too depressed to gather food was rapidly wasting away. Claudia’s screams from the prison began to grow louder and louder as the hunger pains began to grow worse. As Spear began to bury the bodies left outside he notice it was starting to snow. Temperatures had reached -23 degrees and The Spear knew Claudia must have been freezing and starving, so he grabbed a basket of berries to bring to her, but as he walked by one of the bodies he noticed it was his son who had joined the pirate nation nearby. Spear had planned to leave that night and travel to another village, but he finally snapped. He walked to the storage closet where he took out the IED that he got scavenging after a raid and strapped it under his vest. As Spear opened the dark grisly prison door his life flashed before him. Claudia with little energy she had lunged at the spear as he grabbed her and pushed her into the cell closing the door behind them. Spear shouted “ALLAH AKBAH lol jk” and detonated destroying both of their bodies leaving nothing left of the stone cell just the door. The three Vets had a total of 16 confirmed kills, and were all awarded metal of honors post-Humorously Please get this game it’s one of the best, after putting hundreds of hours into Dwarf Fortress and I can say that this game can one day be as ambiguous as Dwarf fortress and I hope to put hundreds of hours onto this game.

								After 11 hours of playtime, planning to have thousands this, yet still Early Access Game, is extremely fun. I looked at the game and frowned upon it, but pushed my self to buy it and test it out. I do NOT regret it, I've had so much fun already. The game can be quite challening at times, especially on the higher dificulites, but it's all a learning progress. The funniest, most chaotic moment I've had on this game so for would be during a storm and raid at the same time. I had 4 colonists and a medium sized colony, all buildings very close to each other. Lighting strikes 1 building and fire breaks out everywhere. A lamp also explodes catching crops and another building on fire, then a raid!!! 4 raiders are coming in from 2 different sides and my base is burning down, my AI is scrambling everywhere, when boom, lightning hits again., and we have more fire spreading. We manage to kill 2 of the raiders, and damage a 3rd pretty bad, whom later bleeds out, while the 4th raider gives up and leaves, By this point almost everything is gone, and everyone is bleeding and we have 1 without eyes..... He dies of infection very quickly, a second gets a major infection in his torso from gun shots, another has infection in her legs and the last bleeds out. We have no food, no shelter, and only about 2 things of medicine left, sadly we all died. ): I reccomend this game for a blast!!			"

								Ah Lovecraft mods. No matter what game they managed to slither into they always makes for interesting stories. This is one such story.The planet I ended up with was a desert with a large number of mountains and a huge ♥♥♥♥ing ocean. So I go the rich explorer and give myself a little boost in wood and cloth. I crash land into a tundra. There are pockets of rabbits and squirrels, along with some Elephants. So I build a little♥♥♥♥♥♥shack and get to work building into a nearby mountain. And after a few days my colonist (Wendy) suddenly runs off. I see her go towards this spooky lookin' monolith. She stands there for a second and then goes back to her room. She then makes an Occult Grimoir and takes a huge mood debuff. This is where things take a fun turn. I build into another mountain and mine out a giant church and occult research room. I get it all floored and lighted up and set to work. While researching weird symbols Wendy turns into a Cultist. Nice. She then names her cult the Esoteric Order of Dagon...fitting. I craft her up some robes and a Cthulhu mask. I then end up making an altar and sacrificing some rabbits for power. Then I get the message, two people join me in obsession of joining my cult... alrighty. I craft them up some robes and get them some beds in already mined out rooms.Now we skip to season later. I've held off countless raids from the local tribes and even some Deep Ones. Wendy is now head cultist and everyone has a good life. My mountain base is now a fortress equipped with untold eldritch horrors trapped within the stone. I am now fairly well equipped with some guns and a many melee weapons. My colony is now 7 strong and has no signs of stopping. Sermons are held for Great Cthulhu and father Dagon. But life is kinda boring as while the Lovecraft storyteller can be brutal it doesn't really give you a ton of events to work with. So I gather my cultists find a nearby coastal village. So I caravan up and gather my most loyal followers and set to work. We arrive to what can only be described as a shanty town. I draw a rune and wait. Now when the first thing you research on, on the forbidden research table is figuring out what all those ♥♥♥♥ing symbols are. And when done researching you can then make a rune that attracts Deep Ones. They will defend the rune with their life until they are all dead. The towns people put up a fairly good fight and even managed to take down a Greater Deep One. But that was all for naught as they were then slaughtered by the eldritch tide. Mopping up the Deep Ones was easy for me as Harpoon-guns work wonders against them. I then take all the coastal towns♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ back off to my colony. A great first raid, and there were still so many more to come. And while raiding coastal towns was fun for a little bit I got bored, but it was mostly because I killed all the coastal towns in my area. But something did come my way as one of the local tribes tried raiding me again, but this time...with an army. My guard of Deep Ones could only hold off the tide for so long before they got overwhelmed. My turrets did most of the killing, along with the more...unstable part of my colony. But they did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, they killed the co-head cultist and Wendy's lover. Wendy fell into a deep depression and I had to straitjacket her so she wouldn't go off the rails and murder people. This lasted for some time, but Wendy did eventually get out of her stopper and started leading sermons and daily sacrifices once more. But she was out for revenge and as it turns out the tribe responsible for killing Wendy's lover was also the biggest tribe in the world. And thus began the war. It was easy at first as my tide of Deep Ones did most of the work for me, but the farther I pushed into their territory the harder the raids would get...and the wounded count would also get higher. Lucky was I that my underground farms has reaped a bountiful harvest this season and I had a plenty herbal medicine in stock. It did get tricky when a plague of insanity swept through my lands and rendered most of my colony null. It wasn't until Wendy herself died in battle that I was on a real disadvantage. She was there the longest and was friends with most people there. She also had some REALLY good stats. She did die fighting however. Taking many tribal people on her way out. I built her a special place of rest, right beside her lover.Fay the new Head Cultist took over and boy was she good with her social stats (it was the main reason I picked her). She was a non-violent soul however and would never engage in combat. This wasn't a huge problem, but I like a social leader more than one with a huge bloodlust. Our numbers grew greatly as we went from a mere 7 people to now 12, all of them cultists. I also had a pack of 4 people, all of them had the traits of, cannibal, psychopath (I forget what it's called correct me if I'm wrong), and bloodlust. I had them wear black goat heads and differing robes. I called them the Spawn of Dagon and they wrecked♥♥♥♥♥ All except for one used melee and the one who didn't was their leader. His name was Sven and he was a ♥♥♥♥ing monster in both ranged and melee. He also liked getting hurt so...that was a plus...I guess. But I used the Spawn for more ""covert"" operations. They did win me the war when we assailed their fortress of♥♥♥♥♥♥and mud. Well it was properly built for an NPC village, but the faction leader was there and blah blah blah. The final battle was to begin.The best way to describe the fortress is a wooden castle. But that's...slightly inaccurate. I began the siege with drawing 5 runes outside the ""walls"". The first wave of Deep Ones got ♥♥♥♥ing obliterated. I didn't really anticipate the number of arrows they were packing...the short answer is...too many. As the waves of eldritch horrors crashed upon their walls my cultists waited for the right time to charge in. The Spawn of Dagon however took a differing route. They dug into the mountain for a flanking assault. We did get the jump on a few archers held up inside a little shack. And with that we gained a small, but valuable foothold within the fortress. And with that I constructed not 1, not 2, but 7 runes. The tide of Deep Ones was spooky, but it would be worth it as Deep Ones now streamed into the fortress taking out many archers and guards inside their humble abode. And with the storm gate open, but overflowing. The Deep Ones did end up dying, but the damage they caused was massive to the point where I just sent my army to deal with the rest. And with most the damage done I took who I could prisoner including the faction leader. And while the war was won a larger threat came to my colony and destroyed it. An avatar of great Cthulhu came in the night and just ♥♥♥♥ing ganked my colony to an early grave. And with that The Chosen were mushed into the dirt.And thus ends our tale. I will be back with more tales in the future my friends, but for now. I bid you goodbye.			"

Early Access Review
								This game will imprint Murphy's Law into your brain forever.As a veteran of Dwarf Fortress, there have been many attempts at cloning the legendary game's masochistic ""Fun"" that grabs you like you just did a line and slaps you in the face, leaving you to beg for more. While I have logged many hours in Gnomoria and Towns, and other such games, they just have not been able to keep my attention for long. Whether it be poor AI, a feeling of general disconnect with the world, or just simply, lack of enough ""Game"" to be interesting, it seems like Rimworld has finally hit the bullseye.Hell, this game might even captivate me more than dwarf fortress at this point. With its absolutely beautiful soundtrack reminiscent of both Prison Architect's (Same composer, I think) and poking a teeny bit at the nostalgia for Firefly, the world feels both alive, and interactive. If you want to and you think you are up to snuff, you can siege an enemy town, picking off bandits with precision down to the finger. But beware, however powerful you feel you are, the game will always, and I mean ALWAYS cut you down to size. While I've found Randy Random, ironically, to be the most balanced, and the easiest of gamemodes, Playing him on rough and above is just as masochistic as picking Cassandra or Phoebe. Beware their lulls, they can and will destroy you without a second though. And you. Will. Love. It.Oh, and Workshop! And mods! Did I mention mods? I probably should have!TL:DR This game is crack cocaine, and in its Alpha state, holds its own against the current king of Colony games, Dwarf FortressYes. Yes. And Yes. This was my best purchase of 2016.			"

								This is an Alpha 15c review, which isn't code, that's just the version.  Obviously.Yawn, another early access game primed ready to disappoint when the devs decide to go spend their hard earned money on wine and cheap hookers (hold the wine).  I can already feel the inevitable sense of betrayal in the air.I hope not.  I really, really hope not.  This has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.  Funny, sad, horrendous at times; few games have generated so many unexpected stories while I wasn't looking, and then slapped me round the face twice for not paying attention.  Like the time my bunch of colonists ran out of food in the middle of winter and ate the family dog, then a mad squirrel, then a lonely trader looking for some business.  We drank his beer though.  Like the time my colony set on fire and the internal temperature of the cabin hit over 2000 degrees, roasting my little minions alive while they desperately tried to put it out (please, devs, can we have vanilla fuses?)Graphically, it's reminiscent of prison architect, and you are a benevolent colony god staring down at your colonies burgeoning attempts to survive in this new world.  They cook, grow, mine, chop, and butcher their way across the map; hunting resources to build ever more complex stuff to vomit on when your 17 year old degenerate accidentally gives everyone food poisoning.  Like all sim management games, there is a steep learning curve, so fully expect your colonists to perish a lot in the early game, and quite frankly the end game.  The devs have provided a menu based tutorial helper for basic controls, as well as an opening tutorial, but it barely taps the surface of what can be done.  Learning how to prioritise work is a necessary feature you joyfully uncover for yourself, which is for the best because winter is looming and all your people are running around in pants throwing horseshoes at a wall, while the storehouse is filling with cloth.There are even NPC traders and raiders to deal with.  The former hang around your base and charge silver for items, the latter charge your defenses with increasingly worrisome weapons.  Set up turrets early on.  You won't regret it.  Then loot their corpses and keep the weapons, just don't let your starving colonists anywhere near the bodies (not a joke).All in all, I love the game.  It's fun, weird, and horrific in a fun and weird way.  Do yourself a favour; put on your crash pants and descend into the wilderness.  You won't regret it. "

Early Access Review
								I found this game had a steep learning curve. Thankfully the latest alpha release includes a tutorial and sort of an in-game ""wiki"" for different items. The game itself is beyond fantastic. This game is early access but honestly plays better than most stable live releases. Once you understand the game, you can customize virtually every aspect of your colony by setting gamerules--and the rich modding community allows for some truly epic possibilities.As for the gameplay itself, it functions as a 2D survival/base-builder game. You select a group of colonists who crashland on a ""rimworld"", a sort-of ""backwater planet"" on the edges of space. Your goal is to build a self-sustaining colony and ultimately construct another ship to leave the planet (although you can easily just sandbox this game and you really never have to leave). There are multiple difficulty settings, and there are even built-in debug tools if you enjoy cheating/pure sandboxing it.Gameplay includes building, hunting, combat, agriculture, production lines/crafting, trade, and even medicine. The latter is a particularly interesting aspect because not only can you treat injuries, you can perform surgeries on your colonists such as organ transplants, bionic upgrades--and you can even harvest prisoner's organs and sell them on the black market. Newest update lets you grow, manufacture and sell drugs, as well, if that's your type of thing.There really is no limit to this game. It's a complete time-sink and one of the most entertaining EA games I've ever owned.			"

Early Access Review
								I love rimworld. Even for being Early Access, in this case it doesn't mean the game is buggy, but could just use a few added features; which are easily added or supported at the moment with the incredible mod support in the workshop. RimWorld is the perfect balance between deep like dwarf fortress, but still usable in terms of UI and options. The UI notably is a lot like Prison Architect, and it is not a bad thing. It definitely serves its purpose. If there is anything I'd like more, it would be more handles for support in terms of mods and custom games. Let's say I'd like to play a scenario that is Star Wars themed; I'd like with that scenario to be included that it would be possible to have a set of characters with the famous names, maybe a visual themepack and custom occurences using the assets in the game. As well as maybe more ""gameplay"" ways. Like it would be possible to send my troops offmap, and load in a new map where I'd actually be raiding other nearby tribes in real time. Maybe a way to infiltrate as a sole pawn in an existing tribe and working my way up in more of an RPG perspective of things where the AI handles the colony. (I'm pretty sure looking at the manager mod could help in creating an AI). Though these are mere suggestions. For as the game goes, it's one of the only games on Steam I bought at full price, without regrets. Certainly the best game ever from Early Access.			"

								AI storytellers that will look like they wanna help you to non-players (sending supplies and rain when a fire is blazing the forest) bur players know they want you dead. Last gane I had Volcano eruption (area super cold and plants die), toxic fallout (everything not under a roof dies), a flash storm (lightnings ignite an area to burn the map down), and an eclipse (makes your silar generators useless), my n.1 shot got insane, and to finish me off, a pack of war hounds that were berzerk came to eat my colonists alive. The game is brutal..... As a fan of prison architect, a game where I build stuff and FIGHT is awesome!			"

								Disclosure: I Kickstarted this game. Therefore I suppose I TECHNICALLY got the game for free? I have played several hundred hours before it was released on steam.The game is great. It is difficult and can murder you and your colony horribly but once you have an idea of the mechanics it can generally be manageable.The standard setup puts you in control of 3 stranded survivors after a horrible space ship crash. Fight disease, raiders, random events, raiders, food shortages, raiders, mechanical androids who want your sweet tasty flesh, raiders and raiders. Oh there are also raiders who occasionally show up to smash up your crap, kill your colonists and/or kidnap them. All in all the game is relatively well balanced if you use the normal AI storyteller (read ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI) but can be more challenging with the more difficult or random storytellers (massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai)Cons: If you do not like the game constantly challenging you. It also hates you and your colonists. Especially the ones you named after your best friends.			"

								I love rimworld. Even for being Early Access, in this case it doesn't mean the game is buggy, but could just use a few added features; which are easily added or supported at the moment with the incredible mod support in the workshop. RimWorld is the perfect balance between deep like dwarf fortress, but still usable in terms of UI and options. The UI notably is a lot like Prison Architect, and it is not a bad thing. It definitely serves its purpose. If there is anything I'd like more, it would be more handles for support in terms of mods and custom games. Let's say I'd like to play a scenario that is Star Wars themed; I'd like with that scenario to be included that it would be possible to have a set of characters with the famous names, maybe a visual themepack and custom occurences using the assets in the game. As well as maybe more ""gameplay"" ways. Like it would be possible to send my troops offmap, and load in a new map where I'd actually be raiding other nearby tribes in real time. Maybe a way to infiltrate as a sole pawn in an existing tribe and working my way up in more of an RPG perspective of things where the AI handles the colony. (I'm pretty sure looking at the manager mod could help in creating an AI). Though these are mere suggestions. For as the game goes, it's one of the only games on Steam I bought at full price, without regrets. Certainly the best game ever from Early Access.			"

								Been playing Rimworld for around 9 months now and I love it.  The latest update (A14) has really smoothed out a lot of the game imo. & the introduction to steam will definitely make using mods easier - not that it was difficult before, but it's nice to have everything in one place and to easily add/update extra features. Even without the mods, it's a great game.  The devs being open and interacting with the players & modders makes rimworld feel like a community, even though you're playing alone. The story you create is always frustrating, heartwarming, shocking, and sometimes downright silly.Currently playing using the rich guy scenario, and as usual, rimworld has a funny sense of humour... My first four peeps are incapable of violence. Always excited to see what comes next!			"

								Rimworld is an overall fantastic game that really makes you feel like you got your money's worth after all is said and done. The game has a small learning curve when you're first getting started, but with the aid of their helpful tutorial and all of the publicly available walkthroughs and fan-made tutorials on the internet, it should be an easy curve to traverse. If you're on the fence about buying this game, I would highly suggest watching a few playthroughs on YouTube or elsewhere. It really is a ""play your way"" kind of game that is centered around basebuilding and colony survival. The developer continues to release amazing content month in and month out, and I believe he deserves all the support he can get.9/10			"

								The One and only! TRUE PAIN SIMULATOR! You think it is about survival? Well, it is, but partly. It is a game about suffering from whatever your new narrator friend Randy throws at you. -Play as a early-medieval tribe, lost in the mountainous jungle-Find a good, spacious cave. Okayz, it is our home now.-Start making all the settlement stuff: rooms, beds, tables, corn farms, chess tables for the most clever of your tribesmen...-A small group of three peaceful travelers passes nearby-THEY HAVE A SHOTGUN, AMBUSH THEM! KILL THEM ALL, THE SHOTGUN WILL BE A NICE TROPHY FOR THE CHIEF!-Your chief now has a shotgun. And a kevlar vest. His tribespeople look at him in admiration-Start digging your cave's walls. Maybe you will find gold!-But you found a hidden, spacious room with two strange things, that say ""Cryosleep casket"" in the description.-And... OH MY GOD, THERE ARE 2 HOSTILE ROBOTS WITH CHAINGUNS NEAR IT! RUN!-Your tribespeople hid behind a corner, waited till the pursuing robots appear and bashed them to death with wooden clubs and spears. Those few blasts from the chief's shotgun have also helped-Found out you can't loot anything from the dead robots, carry them to the dumping area-Also found an ""open"" button on those cryocaskets in that room. All right, loot avaits!-Your chief, with 2 of his most trusted mates, open the cryocasket...-And find an angry, angry dude, with a shotgun, who instantly blast the chief to the stomach! Your chief's stomach is destroyed, but he is still alive, somehow-Chief's mates punch the man to the death, looting another shotgun.-Carry the bleeding chief to your dedicated hospital bed and treat his destroyed stomach. He will keep on living, somehow. Just have to get used to that hole in your belly.-While you were doing that, you find out a bug infestation in your storeroom, along with two bug hives.-The bugs near it were tiny, but were chipping away on the walls. Noone eats your walls and gets away with it!-You are confident. You killed two damn chaingun robots, you surely can deal with a few bugs!-All your tribesmen gathers near the storeroom and open the door. The chief's most trusted mate, now also with a shotgun, makes the first shot, killing one of the small bugs...-WRONG MOVE, MATE! Three huge starship-troopers-like bugs emerge from the hives and, disregarding your two hard-earned shotguns, slaughter the whole tribe-Experience butthurt10/10, shoulda bought some insecticide instead			"

								I've put in a good 300 hours playing this game since I got it back in Alpha 9 (iirc), and I have one thing to say about this game: brilliant. It may be in early access but I still haven't experience a single crash whilst playing vanilla or any noticeable bug for that matter. The way Ludeon runs this as an early access with the ocasional big feature updates and smashing any and all bugs found inbetween means you don't get the continually festering buginess you find in many early access or even ""fully released"" games like minecraft where the devs just focus on killing the worst of the bugs before adding new features.All in all I would whole heartedly recommend this game to any of my friends or anyone who likes colony/city sims somewhat like what you got with firefly-edit: and if your not quite sold then I suggest searching for rimworld alpha 14 lets play on youtube and see what the game is like			"

								This is basically Little house on the prarie with exploding rodents and automated turrents.If you like survival, base building/management, resource management, crafting, or any of those traits in a game, this is pretty much the best game out now. Think of it like The Sims or Prison Architect except you have to worry everything from growing enough crops to survive to alien bugs with plasma rifles invading. (That and most of your residents aren't in prison cells... Probably...) The type of game I wanted my whole life but didn't really know was missing until I played it. I used to be a fan of RTS games. But apparently, all I really wanted back then was games more like this. I've been playing it for years in alpha, and every time you think it seems done, the next update adds tons of exciting new features and makes it an even better game. Really exciting.			"

								Rimworld is one of those games that you can put alot of time into if you dont mind the trail and error aspect of the game, as while the game tries to teach you both with a tutorial and a smart AI which will suggest tips at ideal times, it still relies on you to understand what is happening and why something went downhill and how to counter it. Overall I would highly suggest this game only give it some time to set in as to what you need to do.			"

								So here I was, capturing a prisoner and putting him in my prison. Later on I add a second Prisoner. I decide to have some fun, Dexter style. What I do next is not for the faint of heart, John Snow goes to the prisoners and replaces one of the guys legs with peg legs, then takes out his kidney. I keep the body parts cold until a trader shows up to sell them. I then let the prisoner go free, while keeping his Kidney and legs. What about the last prisoner you ask? I let him off easy and just sold him to a Slaver for silver. After that happened, the other Survivors got really angry and mad because of my organ removal and selling a prisoner to the trader. Leason learned, You're Colony does not like it when you remove Organs of prisoners or sell them to slavers!Emprace the failure that you will face young jedi :)Enjoy Colony Management? Building and crafting stuff? Think Cannibalism and taking prisoners sounds fun? Like to die alot?  Pick this up!I have over 200 hours on this game before it came to steam (You could get it from the devs website or if you backed kickstarter). For me this is a game I can sit back and relax while I play, even though things get crazy and intense alot, things still manage to be enjoyable and some how relaxing.Reminds me of a cross between Prison Architect, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. You can set up bases, scavenge for things, craft stuff and take other people prisoner! Set up you're colony how ever you want! Allow each character to do only what you see fit.You can tell that the developer has had a blast working on this game and that alot of love, sweat and tears have gone into crafting this special game. The game also has a great AI storyteller that really effects the game, think of Left 4 Dead's game master as it tosses different nastyness at you.Make sure to get some beds up and keep everyone busy! Grab some snacks, create a game and get ready for a real blast! The game also has mod support and has come a long way over the last 3 years.  The main guy making this game has done a wonderful job so far and while some might say it is going to slow for them, for me it is perfect. He is taking his time to do things RIGHT. And every single update I look forward to and enjoy.The good far outweigh the bad in Rimworld, there are a few negatives or things that can be improved though. The UI can use some improvement and for some new players the game can be a bit tough to learn the ins and outs of (aka has a steep learning curve). There is so much good with this game though, the ideas are great, gameplay is fun and you can really be creative in this game if you want to. And lastly, as I mentioned before, I find the game very relaxing, even when I am getting attacked by bandits or animals, or some other crazy thing happening. This is a game worth taking a look at!Wonderful, unique game that I am SOOO glad to see has come to steam! One of the best indie games of the last 2-3 years for me personally and it isn't even finished yet. Support this wonderful game and this wonderful  fellow who has created this great game. Welcome to steam Rimworld!			"

								Having bought the game over 2 years ago, I can say that it has improved a lot and has, yet, much space to improve. Needless to say that, in its current state, it is already a solid and pretty good experience. Nevertheless, the steam's early access program will allow a better exposure of the game to gamers and will allow the developer, Tynan Sylvester, to make a great progress towards a final stage, which will, almost certainly, correspond to the players expectations/desires.I can affirm that Rimworld will NOT be one of those games that enter Steam Early Access with no intents of future upgrades, on the contrary it will be similar to Prison Architect (which in my opinion, was a model of what every game should be in Steam Early Access).When discussing what is great I would say:  Great graphics and artstyle;  Complex system interactions between colonists;  Lots of replayability;  The new scenario system;  Great moddability;  The commercial and faction system.Having this said, it is important to remind that this is still an Early Acess which means there are bugs, there will be with each new update and this is an unfinished product.Overall I had a great experience and would totally reccomend Rimworld!

I think this is the first time I've bought a game twice despite still being able to play it with the first copy. (I bought fallout 3 twice for 2 different platforms).I let my friends play the DRM-free version because in my eyes, this game is so fantastic, that I think everyone needs to enjoy it even those not fortunate enough to buy it, it's an experience everyone should enjoy, even those not a fan of the genre, because I guaruntee, they'll still love it.

								As a long time player of Dwarf Fortress this title piqued my interest.   It definitely is heavily inspired by DF and i think does it justice.   There is a level of detail that is definitely appreciated, and the difficulty can ramp up pretty quick.  There is tech to be researched, food to farm, booze, exploding livestock, the whole works!The soundtrack is nice, and the effects are mostly fitting.  The graphics are basic, but coming from ASCII it is a breath of fresh air. My only regret is letting Horace the yorkshire terrier get eaten by a panther in one bite.   "

								Totally voted this game for ""Best Use of Farm Animal"" award.Nothing deserves it more than being able to cripple your animal- be it mines, accidental gun wounds, or getting stabbed to death by raiders. Did I forget the bionic limbs?Anyway, this game is a diamond in a coal mine (Especially in early access, it's amazing). I've never had such a replayable single-player experience. Lots of cool mods, great stories to be shared, and its a great way to pass time.If you're considering purchasing this game, yes, get it.			"

								Ok, so i have played this game from that first alpha/beta stage, i am actually not sure what it exactly was. Right from the start, i saw the potential this game had. Becouse of this game, i have an account on patreon. I put my money and my trust in this game, and boy, it delivered.While still being in alpha, it offers tons of content, i admit, my last full game was around the 12 version i think, i simply dont have time for it now, but its awesome to watch it grow and becoming better and better with every update, not mention the content made from normal ppl. There is that certain atmosphere when its night and raining outside and you just watch your colonist go to sleep after the day of another hard work. When you plan the working schedules etc. and then you see it work, when you colony grows to be bigger and bigger and then it will get stomped by crazy AI. When you take a prisoner in to the colony who has a brain damage (i think she had literally bullet in her brain) and i in that version of the game, i could not fix it.  So i had to replace all of her limbs by high-tech prosthesis and she could atlest clean the base from dirt and stuff. Its a generator of great stories, that i can tell you.Of course, its not for everyone, so better check it on youtube etc. and make your own opinion.And now its on Steam!!! Hell yea!			"

								While I don't usually review things, I had to post this. To quote a friend of mine talking about this game:""Yeah, I havent played it since my pregnant goat locked herself in the food locker and drank all my beer, causing my guys to get mad, bash each other and caused one of them to torch a plant which spread to my generators, burning my colony down.""I've been playing since Alpha 5-6 and the game has become a lot more in-depth and detailed since its early beginnings. If you love base building games then this should be on your wishlist.			"

								An absolutely infuriating game.Fifteen cats randomly join the colony and start eating all the food. The doctor gets depressed and goes on an eating binge because his room isn't luxurious enough, then catches malaria. Meanwhile the 69 y/o farmer with dementia goes on a delusional walkabout and angers an elephant who comes back to the colony. It wrecks the place and badly injures the rest of the population. Doctor ends his pity-party and gives the entire town malaria while healing them.11/10 would binge eat the entire food store and become a crazy cat lady again			"

								Before this game was released, I had at the very least 300 hours in the DRM-free game.Although the game is in early access at the time of writing, it is still a fantastic game. It is, however, quite deep and rich. It is not an easy game to learn, and you will get punished, harshly, for apparently no reason. You think everything's going pretty damn well, you finally got your new farm setup, all that's left is setting up defenses on that si--- aaaaand massive raid. Half your colony is dead. Your lovely farm is on fire. Raiders kidnap your main doctor, and shoot your dogs. They also blow up your generators, and it's mid-winter, temperatures are -60ºC outside. They survive for the season, feeding on their dead comrades. The remaining few step out of their destroyed shelter as Spring comes, but it's in the middle of the ice sheet, and even though it's Spring, it's still -40ºC. Everyone dies to the cold.Editing this review to mention that the modding community is great. They manage to take the game a step further and really cover all the bases.			"

								Very good game.If you like games like Prison Architect, Dwarf Fortress and Gnomoria you will also love this one.The basic scenario (there are multiple, including player created ones) is to build a base and escape the planet. While working towards this goal you have to make sure to take care of the needs of you colonists. You have to provide them food, shelter, protection and keep them inspired.This game is still in Alpha so I am not naming everything in detail but here are a few cool things you can do in the game:-) create a coke farm and raid peaceful villagers-) become a merchant, get a small fortune and build a mansion of gold-) create a huge military base and keep elephants as combat pets-) fight alien bug infestions in power armor -) breed cats en masse, let them all bond to one of your colonists and then kill the colonist off. you now have a rage fueled crazy horde of cats that rips apart all of your visitiors-) build a giant wall to keep foreigners out			"

								This game is deep and fun to play, espescially if you like getting attached to your little colonists and inevitably watch them get stabbed, gunned down, die of malaria, toxic fallout, burnt to a crisp, eaten by giant insects, panthers, lions, wargs, and even get struck by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lightning. You'd think that they would have a stiff upperlip about all this, no? But instead they bicker and complain and do the stupidest thing like shoot at their friends for a dirt stain on the floor, or being woken up early. The game is fun, incredibly challenging, but the ramp-up is a little bit unfair. I'm at the stage to where I'm building the ship up, my colonists dying one by one to insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t random things, like everyone getting sick or mechtoids dropping in through the roof. My defenses are outstanding, lined with autoturrets and ten colonists, most of them great shots and armed with charge rifles. and yet, the game finds ways to slowly kill the colony bit by little bit. Prepere for the worst, but it doesn't matter. You live or die by the RNG			"

								This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rimworld is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RIMWORLDThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner. I rate it 10/10 Game Of The Year, Nice work Ludeon Studios	 :D			"

								I put over 400hrs into this game prior to its release on Steam.By it's lonesome, it's a really well done game. Tynan (the -almost- sole developer) has delivered an experience like no other, and I absolutely recommend this game. He's gone WELL above and beyond what was promised when this first came to Kickstarter years ago, and he continues to add to it.What's even better is the highly active mod community that's developed in the meantime (on Ludeon - the RimWorld website) that is slowly being incorporated here via Workshop. The mods bring this game to an entirely new level.I'd highly recommend purchasing this game.			"

Within 3 or 4 days of owning it, I've logged almost 40 hours of gameplay. I never played Dwarf Fortress, so I can't exactly compare it, but it reminds me of an expanded followup to FTL when your crew fails, only now we get to see what happens after they crash land.Community support and culture on Reddit has also made this game a blast.

								The Gods were angry.For thousands of years the gods had watched over the peaceful tribe, when the tribe prayed for rain and good health, the Gods answered, for the tribe prayed to no one but them. And for thousands of years the tribe gazed galliantly upwards, looking to no one but the gods. But one day, the tribe cast their eyes upon a giant metal ship.The sky people brought them machines to guard their fields, weapons to hunt bigger animals, and in turn the tribe gifted the sky people all of their treasures. The treasures that they promised to the Gods.Furious with the tribes betrayal, the gods struk out. Possessing the giant machines the sky people brought, the Gods slaughtered the tribe, burned the village. Killed men and babies alike. The world was cast into a week long eclipse; for the Gods could not bear to look upon those they had once loved so. Five tribespeople managed to escape under the darkness. They ran far away, into the desert. Desperate to escape their creators wrath. As the hopeless survivors fumbeled with broken tools in the quiet of the night, one man rose to the challange to lead his comrades out of their misery. His name, was Val Chief. Under his protective gaze, the few lost soles under his guidance soon began to build a flurishing village. One with a large central hut where all the tirbespeople could laugh and eat in safety. Soon, even the Gods could not ignore their sucess, the eclipse lifted, and the tribes people were free to enjoy the sun once more. As the years went on, Val fell in love with a woman; Seara, the village healer. Their love blossemed like the endless rose fields the tribespeople had planted outside their main hut. Seara had many suitors, the strong warrior Flint, protested his love for her almost every day, but she always stayed loyal to Val. In the heat of the summer, they married. Val and Seara lived happily within the safety of their new tribe for many seasons.And as the village grew, so did Vals generosity. He wanted nothing more than to help all the lost souls he found wandering through the desert, after all, he was a hopeful optimist. So when a man called out, desperate for someone to save him from the vicious bandits chasing him, Val instantly offered him sanctuary. The five survivors gathered their spears and bows, then headed into cover. The bandits soon came raiding, they shot at the tribes people with their metal bows. As Seara bravely charged the nearest bandit with her club, another attacked her. Before anyone could come to save her, she was shot. Dead. Enraged, the surivors charged the bandits and drove them off, injuring many on both sides in the process. The two standing villagers took the injured to their beds, and the dead to their graves.Seara was buried within the field of roses. Every day, many of her friends would come to meditate by her grave. But not Val. Unable to face the dire thuth, that his generisity had cost him the love of his life, Val hid in his room, nursing his pain. Both physical and mental, until he could take it no more. His wife was dead. He was alone. It broke him. One day, blinded by pain, Val grabbed his spear and took to the main hut with a deathly glint in his eyes. He murdered the dog first. Then the turtle. And as he fumed within the walls of the hut he worked so hard to build, his friends gathered outside, bows ready. They waited outside, hoping upon hope that the beserk rage would fade, but Val had other ideas. He charged outside and began hacking his friends. They were forced to stop him. A spear through the heart. Val fell, dead. They buried him beside his beloved wife, surrounded by roses, they were together once more. The tribe lived on, continued to flurish, but the story of Val and Seara was never forgotten.A story told by the scenario system within rimword.10/10 - Made me cry over pixels.			"

								What a great little fun game. This has all the management you could want and it goes for realism. After a few failed games of my settlers dying to heatstroke, pirates, and starvation, I finally had the hang of it. I had one of my founding colonists get her jaw and leg shot off in a pirate raid, she was in bed for days, until I gave her a peg leg and a denture. Now she can walk again! Her husband is a little repulsed by her disfigurement, but at least she's alive. It's pretty difficult, even on the easier settings, but you learn quick how to survive. I'm growing hops to make beer to keep my people happier. You have to hoard food once you have a few extra people, it will go fast. Build a wooden storage room with 2 ACs. Keep it cold so it doesn't spoil. Power is important. There are many ways to generate it.I was finally able to get a leg up on the raiders by building a single Assult Rifle once I had the means. This rifle tore into these thugs like butter, in the right hands. I also had sandbags placed outside of my base to defend. I lost people and had a few injuries and scares, but I survived and expanded into a large compound with steel and stone walls. In addition to the assault rifle, I now had a shotgun, sniper rifle, incendiary weapon, pwd (smg?), plenty of pistols and shivs. Made a longsword for the guy who prefers brawling up close. I feel OK when 4-5 pirates come knocking on our doors.You forget this is an early access game because of how functional it is now. I'm sure they will work out the few kinks and bugs I've seen, but as it is, it's a hectic fun survival strategy game. For now, there is still more to do...			"

								Ahh Rim World. Such beautiful stories you tell. You've earned my recommendation wholeheartedly. The following story is from my first playthrough. I’ve done about 5 now, each with their own beautiful character and story arcs, complete with social challenges. It’s amazing to watch it unfold and I’m excited for the future of RimWorld.Freedom Colony:It was a nice day in Freedom. Hammer the Oaf, freshly stranded had met up with a few lucky other colonists. Silver, the fiery, genetically grown combat medic was the first person he met on this god forsaken planet.. She was a after the war geneticist, and Hammer was in love with her. Unfortunately though, Hammer was ugly. Hammer loved people and animals the most out of anything in the world. His true love however, was Silver. He tried to talk to her almost every day, but his voice was so annoying and he was so ugly, that she became very irritated and would insult him. He felt bad so he went off to find an animal companion to cheer himself up. Hammer, the Oaf that he was, found a playful adult cougar. NOT THAT KIND OF COUGAR KEEP READING. He wanted to be best friends! But the cougar mauled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Hammer, and his right arm was shredded as ♥♥♥♥.   The other colonists tried to save his life, but because of the severe infection, it was deemed his right arm would have to be amputated. Silver the Combat Medic/Geneticist( and far over qualified to save Hammer), horrified by watching hammer be mauled and also already on the edge of mental breakdown due to Hammers repeated advances, finally snapped. She ran off into the night, leaving all her clothes behind. She took the pistol, however. Hammer the Oaf lay on the operating table. The operation was to be performed by the only person qualified to operate……. José.  José, the agriculture and architecture extraordinaire took it upon himself to save Hammers life. So he got to work. Hammer emerged from the operation to find that somehow his liver had been punctured (wtf José really???) and his torso was badly cut. He soon died, and the other colonists minds broke as well.  It was chaos and for one night, the were all…...free….…. Running off into the wilderness they somehow found themselves, lost out there, among the wildlife. I wept for Hammer. For Silver. For José, you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For the less important characters without names, many of whom died horrific deaths as they lost their minds snapped like twigs with the weight of the void pressing down on them.10/10 I didn’t know if it would be worth $30.It is.

								What a fantastic game!  I would highly recommend it.  There are so many options that every time you start a new game it is like playing the game from new.  I am now on my third colony.  I have learnt as I go.  There is so much to the game that you learn every time you play a new game.Please bear in mind that this is an early access game and some of the larger updates mean you are unable to play your previous game saves (unless you opt not to update the game of course).  This is, to date,  my only criticism, but it was my choice to buy the game in Early Access so I guess I just have to put up with that until the game goes to general release.****UPDATE****Well over 100 hours of gameplay and I am still hooked.  On my 5th colony now, having successfully rescued my colonists at the previous attempt.  I am still hooked.  The game changes each time you start a new colony posing different challenges (be it weather, geology or fertility of the land).  I am looking forward to what the next update brings.  I have encountered no bugs at all so far.  Keep on going devs!			"

Our crew consists of Tanya the hunter, Navarro the doctor and Esper jack of all trades. We built a shelter, rather slowly as nobody has great carpentry skills. But it works. Tanya went out hunting and man is she good with that rifle. Nobody is a decent planter but we plant some crops(potatos, cotton and corn).We encounter a passerby named Pyrra. She is extremely intelligent but does absolutely no work. Won't clean or haul anything. She has ner nose is books the entire time. Grant it, since she is borderline genius and she will be coming up with research projects left and right. A single raider attacked up with nothing but a club. His name was Lynx. We put him down easily. His nose and arm were shot off, and we captured him and threw him into a makeshift cell. He wont be happy when he wakes up. The next day, not only did blight strike our crops (100% of them were destroyed), but raiders attacked. Twice. This was a group of 3 tribesman armed with bows, pikes and other primitive weapons. We put that down easily as well killing all 3 attackers. We have technology on our side. The second group was looking for their friend, but we were not so lucky with them. They were armed.... well. Much better than us. They stormed us and we took heavy fire. Dr Navarro had a grenade go off next to her and she immediately fell into shock. We managed to kill two of the others and chase off the last guy. Esper caught up to him as he was already shot in the leg and beat him to death with the butt of her pistol. This next day was even more of a nightmare. A heat wave set in, A raider snuck in behind us the day before and destroyed our generator, while we have our Dr laying in bed trying to recover from the grenade. Her wounds have turned into infection. Esper is bedridden from heatstroke. We are scrambling trying to fix this damage that has been done....Well our Dr didn't die of heatstroke. She went berserk in the middle of the night from all the damage our prisoner has brought upon us. She broke into his cell and attacked him. In self defense the cell mate beat her to death. We should have killed him when we had the chance. Immediately after this, more of his buddies showed up. They blew a hole in his wall and broke him free. Pyrra was injured in the blast and lost two of her fingers, but she will be fine. Esper recovered from heatstroke and tried to treat pyrra, but is not very skilled. We are running dangerously low on medical supplies. Two days have passed since Dr Navarro was killed. Across our coms came a frantic voice searching for salvation. She(Emminent) has raiders on her tail. We agreed to help and I have no idea why. We were already in a desolate situation. Luckily it was tribes people again with low tech weapons. Tanya was hadling these invaders easily enough until one tribesman got close and cut out her eye. Our only soldier is now missing an eye and we have no doctor. As the tribe ran away, they set all of our crops and storehouse on fire. But we got lucky and it immediately rained!We sifted through the debris and were able to salvage about 90% of our potatos 0% of corn or cloth. The rain continues. We worked through it. Tanyas eye healed the best it could. Esper and Emminent rebuilt the store house and Pyrra researched some more technologies to possibly help us with our endless raider problem. We are starting to run into a food problem. We were relying on the meat that Tanyas hunts were bringing in. But with her missing an eye, she is bringing in less than half of what she used to. Nobody else is good with a gun at all. We can't hunt animals with clubs and spears. Is this how the tribes people turned into backward technological barbarians?And this is where my story ends. A small group of tribes people attack doing very minimal damage. But:Pyrra gets a small cut on her arm. We have no medical supplies. It festers. She dies.Esper gets grazed by a bullet. We have no medical supplies. It festers. She dies. Tanya and Eminent cant cook what little meat is left and there are no crops. They are forced to eat raw meat. They both get the plague. They had no medical supllies. They both die.The end. Buy the game.			"

								I don't usually bother writing reviews for games, but I bought this one a few days before the steam launch and many many hours of gameplay later i feel that I have to put something out there. This game is great (although you might end up still awake when the sun comes up occasionally). There are obvious graphical design influences from Prison Architect, but as soon as you start playing you realise that the similarity is really only skin deep. Building your colony can be very satisfying and straddles the gap between a building sim and a survival defense game. If you prefer the more base building aspects, or if you like the idea of dealing with multiple varied threats like diseases, raiding parties, rabid animals etc, both are available. Depending on which 'storyteller' you choose (part of the games difficulty settings), your first colony can run smoothly, gradualy growing and attracting more settlers as you grow food, mine rocks, build up your living quarters and defenses, or ... as mine did, a volcanic winter followed by some sort of nuclear fallout can drive your previously content survivors into deranged idiots, who attack each othr, strip off, run outside in the cold and eventually die.The game is also very complete for an 'early access' title, there is no aspect of the game which feels unfinished and although i'm sure some changes are to come, the game almost could be full release at the moment. If there is any aspect of gameplay missing, in my opinion it would be a little more management ability for your colony, such as the ability to set switches to be turned on / off at particular times etc.There are some decent mods out there too which add or improve various of the games features although some modded aspects have since gone on to be incorporated into the vanila game. Final verdict: Must give it a go. It is definitely worth the £22 / $30, and if you fancy supporting the devs, you can purchase it directly from the website to ensure they get most of your money.			"

								I wish I could say my Rimworld story was like everyone elses, where a group of nobodies makes a name for themselves and lasts a few years until that badass Alamo shootout kills everyone in a blaze of glory. I wish I could say I raised my group of scavengers into a force to be reckoned with, with guns and turrets and state of the art facilities. I wish my experience was like that.It was not.My experience was, to put it bluntly, harrowing.I had chosen the start where you start as a single individual, with good equipment and a history of living a luxury life on a Glitterworld. I was a woman barely in her twenties, who had fought a war shortly and had a good hand at shooting while also being able to build fortifications in record time. My name was Engie, and this was going to be a great experience full of adventure and riches.I had landed near a mountainous region, and decided to make a highly defensible position based on single doors and lots of turrets. I only made rooms that were directly within the mountain, with my farms outside in the natural sunlight and weather. The first few months were quiet, with a few settlers coming in to join the newly crowned Daedalus Outpost and make themselves a home made by the sweat of their own brow. Everything was peachy and perfect, with an emphasis on helping one another and making sacrafices so that the greater good would prosper. After awhile the raiders would come and attempt to enslave or steal, but the sentries were always there to defend the settlers while Engie and a select few made shots with pulse rifles and slugthrowers. No matter what they did, the multi-layered defense system was always there to protect and keep the populace safe. Eventually, they stopped altogether. At first, we thought it was because our system was impenetrable. We were completely wrong, and we realized it when a green haze came over the horizon and everything in it's vicnity started to die out. A toxic fallout had come to our region, and we had no idea how long this was going to last. I won't say what happened during that fallout, because to recount such an event is to fill this story with even more dread than what is to come. I can only imagine the raiders who came in the dead of winter, noting how everything was cold and lifless around the mountain. They had come prepared for a fight against the sentries, but all of them were shut down from what seemed to be a lack of power. The raider burst through one of the doors, and started to try and find the residents, wary of an ambush or surprise fire. They found the door to the walk-in freezer, and opened it.One can only imagine what they thought, when they saw the last resident of Daedalus Outpost.In there sat Engie, the original survivor and the leader of this group of individuals. This wasn't the founder that the raiders had heard stories about, with her bravado and deadshot aim that was the bane of attackers everywhere. This was a much more harrowing version, covered in blood and clothed in a parka that was undoubtedly made from human skin. Surrounding her was a copious amount of blood and meat, which may have not been easily identifiable if one of the original residents hadn't been strewn across the butcher's table, missing limbs and body chunks.When she saw the raiders, Engie screamed and charged at them with only her bare fists. Obviously having been driven mad by the necessity to eat her friends, she went towards the raiders with a desire for more meat, more food to survive this decaying land of death. She didn't even make it halfway towards them when a bolt went straight through her eye and out the back of her head. The raiders left empty handed, running out of the mountain to go back to their homes where such a terrifying experience may be forgotten. Daedalus Outpost was abandoned, a once prospering settlement that turned into a dead zone of legend. The only clue as to what may have happened there was deep in the mountain, where a freezer room held the remains of a savage and the meat of her friends.			"

								The Gods were angry.For thousands of years the gods had watched over the peaceful tribe, when the tribe prayed for rain and good health, the Gods answered, for the tribe prayed to no one but them. And for thousands of years the tribe gazed galliantly upwards, looking to no one but the gods. But one day, the tribe cast their eyes upon a giant metal ship.The sky people brought them machines to guard their fields, weapons to hunt bigger animals, and in turn the tribe gifted the sky people all of their treasures. The treasures that they promised to the Gods.Furious with the tribes betrayal, the gods struk out. Possessing the giant machines the sky people brought, the Gods slaughtered the tribe, burned the village. Killed men and babies alike. The world was cast into a week long eclipse; for the Gods could not bear to look upon those they had once loved so. Five tribespeople managed to escape under the darkness. They ran far away, into the desert. Desperate to escape their creators wrath. As the hopeless survivors fumbeled with broken tools in the quiet of the night, one man rose to the challange to lead his comrades out of their misery. His name, was Val Chief. Under his protective gaze, the few lost soles under his guidance soon began to build a flurishing village. One with a large central hut where all the tirbespeople could laugh and eat in safety. Soon, even the Gods could not ignore their sucess, the eclipse lifted, and the tribes people were free to enjoy the sun once more. As the years went on, Val fell in love with a woman; Seara, the village healer. Their love blossemed like the endless rose fields the tribespeople had planted outside their main hut. Seara had many suitors, the strong warrior Flint, protested his love for her almost every day, but she always stayed loyal to Val. In the heat of the summer, they married. Val and Seara lived happily within the safety of their new tribe for many seasons.And as the village grew, so did Vals generosity. He wanted nothing more than to help all the lost souls he found wandering through the desert, after all, he was a hopeful optimist. So when a man called out, desperate for someone to save him from the vicious bandits chasing him, Val instantly offered him sanctuary. The five survivors gathered their spears and bows, then headed into cover. The bandits soon came raiding, they shot at the tribes people with their metal bows. As Seara bravely charged the nearest bandit with her club, another attacked her. Before anyone could come to save her, she was shot. Dead. Enraged, the surivors charged the bandits and drove them off, injuring many on both sides in the process. The two standing villagers took the injured to their beds, and the dead to their graves.Seara was buried within the field of roses. Every day, many of her friends would come to meditate by her grave. But not Val. Unable to face the dire thuth, that his generisity had cost him the love of his life, Val hid in his room, nursing his pain. Both physical and mental, until he could take it no more. His wife was dead. He was alone. It broke him. One day, blinded by pain, Val grabbed his spear and took to the main hut with a deathly glint in his eyes. He murdered the dog first. Then the turtle. And as he fumed within the walls of the hut he worked so hard to build, his friends gathered outside, bows ready. They waited outside, hoping upon hope that the beserk rage would fade, but Val had other ideas. He charged outside and began hacking his friends. They were forced to stop him. A spear through the heart. Val fell, dead. They buried him beside his beloved wife, surrounded by roses, they were together once more. The tribe lived on, continued to flurish, but the story of Val and Seara was never forgotten.A story told by the scenario system within rimword.10/10 - Made me cry over pixels.			"

								I have been playing this game since alpha 3.   I estimate, at the time of this posting, that I have put over 500 hours into this game if you include all the different alpha versions.  This game has come a long way and I expect there will be even more to come.   As the game is now, alpha 14 as I write this, it could be considered a complete game when you consider the amount of content.   It will keep you busy for hours.   At $30, it's well worth it.Basically you start with a few resources and a handful of colonists and eventually grow your colony into something much more.   The end game idea is to build a ship and escape the planet you are on.   But the enjoyment is actually building up your colony and defending it against exterior threats.  There are many threats including raiders, weather events, and starvation/exposure (in the more diffcult biomes like desert and tundra).  Each threat is unique and has systems in the game to deal with them.  You can play any game type you like.   Meaning, you can deactivate threats you find annoying or unbalanced.  You can choose your biome as well.   Perhaps you want to play an easy biome with more raiders?   Or you want to play on the Ice sheet with minimal raiders?  It's up to you.At the end of the day Rimworld would be labeled a Basebuilder when it comes to genre.   But in reality, there is so much to it than that.  And even if you want to use a mypopic definition like ""Basebuilder"" when classifying Rimworld that's fine.   Because even within that narrow definition, Rimworld would be the best ""Basebuilder"" I have ever played.			"

								Was given a Mother and Son and a fat russian apocalypse survivor. The son couldnt do labor or fight but he could tame animals and was a psychologist.....right. The russian dude was really usefull but he had a eating problem and the mother could only build and cook. After 3 days the son had a mental breakdown and was beaten to death by a lhama. The mother asked the russian for sex was rebuffed then had a mental breakdown because the russian wouldn't share the only bed and made her sleep on the ground. She attacked the closest rabbit and was nibbled to death. Right as all seemed to be lost a a russian female wanderer arrived and they both hit it off. Neither of them can do medical care though so it probably wont last long. 10/10 would watch a psychologist have a mental breakdown again.			"

								Please note I have played many, many hours of this game from pre-steam alphas.THIS GAME IS DOPE. The basics of the game involve you building a village (I say village because of the new system which means you can play as a tribe rather than colonists) and helping your villagers/colonists suvive by building shelter, making enough food for people to eat and defending your villagers/colonists from the dangers that the game throws at you.There are 3 different 'stroytellers' for you to chose from, Cassandra Classic where the challenge level increases over time in a classic style of games, Pheobie Chillax where the focus is more on basebuilding and the size and wealth of your village/colony increases the difficulty level but you have more time to prepare and recover or Randy Random where most of the rules don't apply and the RNG gods have free reign to massively p*** you off by swamping your village/colony with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pirates that somehow manage to cut off the arm of my best colonist by punching them. (How does my best colonist get her arm punched off? HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN???????) However there is still an aspect of difficulty increasing overtime, just it can happen really suddenly.Tame animals, kill other animals, build up a city and unlock all of the researches with the intent of flying away on a spaceship you build (except most people don't do this unless a new alpha is due to be released and they want to finish their current game) all whilst surviving the cruel and harsh worlds and also the cruel and harsh raiders. Take them prisoner in order to recruit them or slaughter them where they stand in order to minimse injury. One thing with the game though is that a lot of people (myself included) would mod this game a lot because the mods add soooo much to the game which can be good or bad depending on your opinions on moddingBut I promise if you like games like dwarf fortress you will like this and even if you don't this game is a load of fun "

								Just found out that Rimworld is on steam now, Played the game since alpha 11, Never a dull moment in this game, its a fantastic game with a very immersive gameplay that punishes everything you do and bearly ever rewards you. A perfect colony simulator. So many injuries, illnesses and things that resoult in a colonist getting a mental breakdown or going berserk. I never played such a detailed game ever in my life. All I can say, The game is worth every single cent you pay for it, you really get what you pay for. Even if I try I can't find any major drawbacks of the game, or any cons at that. This game is just perfect, streight 10/10. I must've spent like few hundred hours in this game already before it came to steam. And remember kids, Bloodlust, Psyhopath and Abrasive (On one colonist) is the best way to get your colony destroyed. :)			"

								Rimworld is a Colony survival / management game, with some incredibly deep and meaningful mechanic systems that mesh together to make a very very awesome game if you are into this genre.Ive played Rimworld easily for 100+ hours prior to it releasing on steam, and from the moment I started playing it when I first found out about the game (which at this point i dont remember how i found it, maybe kickstarter) every time you play the game, there are very good chances of you being put into an interesting situation where you have to make a decision that has implications down the road.It is always a pleasure to start a new colony as the new alpha versions get released since they are usually packed with new features and systems in an already complex yet simple game. Simply starting my colony in this steam release of alpha 14 show me something ive never encounted before, which makes for an interesting story. (my three colonists happen to be a mother and her 2 sons) I could go on and on about the game, but in the end, its your own personal journey through the game that will be very unique and hopefully you find interesting.There is base building, farming, combat, injury, trading, pets, disastors. seasons, temprature, reasearch, crafting, all woven together so elegantly!

								I dont know how much hours i put in this game, it must be a few hundred.Rimworld has slowly become my favorite game of all time. It is my go to game when i dont know what to play.Usualy it is very relaxing, the game speed can be controlled and even paused.I cant tell you exactly what it is that i love, for me it hits all the right spots.Designing a base, manage all the goods, get tru a winter, raid or illnes.Than there is so much detail in everything, all the stuff that can be build and has a effect.And the in depth social system, yes you can ignore this and all is fine. But it it there and when the time is right you wil notice.This game could be a bit much at first, how do i build this, how do i place that, why does this work or not work.But there is a wonderfull community who can tell you everything. There is also YouTube with its hundreds of hours lets plays. Espacially Blitskriegsler has some good play vids.And there is always the pause button, So if you need to look something up or want the time to sort stuff out. This is the best of both real time and turn based.Never are two play thoughs the same, The creative proces of building and taking care of your collonists is amazing.But €30,- is that to much for such a game?Not for this game it is not, dare i say it, this game is diferent. This game is a product of vision and love, not making money. The game is practically bug free, it never crashes. All the little details are wel balanced. It runs on allmost any pc.And if you want a change you can start with a different scenario or put in a mod. The devoloper of this game love mods. He likes it that people like his game and develop for it.So give it a try and i hope you see the same magic sparkle that i see. A rare thing now a days, i'm 35 and have become a bit of a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games. All the games do the same and have the same things that make me go meh.			"

								Been playing since Alpha 2, and this ""early release"" is much farther along and very playable, unlike many others who hit Steam.Maybe you'll build your batteries outside. When they blow up in the rain, and you watch colonists die in the fire trying to put it out, or run screaming away only to return to desolation, you'll know what you did wrong.Maybe your colonists just aren't skilled enough to farm and mine basic subsistence, and you watch them slowly go mad as they refuse to do the work necessary to survive.Maybe you got too lax with the squirrels in your camp, and one goes rabid, biting your best medic, which is the last straw for her - what with the bedroom being too small and the food being too boring - and causes a psychotic break. In her rampage, she gives your best fighters concussions, and you couldn't get anyone to subdue her before they're all bleeding, dying, and the medic is passed out in the wilderness dying of stavation.Maybe a lightning strike happens to hit the one wire connecting your turret bank, right before a bandit assault. Or angry natives bring a rocket launcher, creating a hole in your defenses that you thought were solid. You survive the attack, but the lack of preperation, injuries and death, and loss of supplies are just too much for your colony to recover from.Maybe, maybe you'll lay the foundations for a thriving trade outpost. A Deadwood in space. A Babylon 5 on a planet's surface. A spot of stability in the messy frontier of space.Whatever happens, you will learn what went wrong, what detail you missed, what you can improve for next time, as you watch your colony wrestle survival and sanity, before closing their book and opening another.Difficulty and story style options, along with previewing and rerolling your colonist(s), helps you start off into the game you want to play.

								I have been playing this game for a while now, before it hit the greenlight, and what I can tell you for sure about Ludeon is that updates come frequently and they always have a ton of content.  It's clear that this game is going to be kept alive.  And to think that in it's Alpha stage it's already so hugely complex and fun, I can only imagine what the full title will be like.			"

								I have been playing this game off and on for years at this point, having dumped at least 1000+ hours into the game since it was first kickstarted. I can honestly say that this game is without a doubt one of the most painstakingly and lovingly built games I have ever seen, you can tell the devs really care about making this game the best that it could possibly be. I could spend hours describing the many reasons why I absolutely love this game, but I don't feel that anything that I could say could really describe how much of an impact this game has had on me over those years. It has become the basis on which I compare most games I purchase nowdays. In a time when most games are barely complete, we have rimworld, a game that could have been put on the market years ago but wasnt just so they could attempt to do the game the justice that it deserves.No amount of praise I give can really describe how much I appreciate this game.11/10			"

								Rimworld is a Colony survival / management game, with some incredibly deep and meaningful mechanic systems that mesh together to make a very very awesome game if you are into this genre.Ive played Rimworld easily for 100+ hours prior to it releasing on steam, and from the moment I started playing it when I first found out about the game (which at this point i dont remember how i found it, maybe kickstarter) every time you play the game, there are very good chances of you being put into an interesting situation where you have to make a decision that has implications down the road.It is always a pleasure to start a new colony as the new alpha versions get released since they are usually packed with new features and systems in an already complex yet simple game. Simply starting my colony in this steam release of alpha 14 show me something ive never encounted before, which makes for an interesting story. (my three colonists happen to be a mother and her 2 sons) I could go on and on about the game, but in the end, its your own personal journey through the game that will be very unique and hopefully you find interesting.There is base building, farming, combat, injury, trading, pets, disastors. seasons, temprature, reasearch, crafting, all woven together so elegantly!

								I've played this game for about a year and it's easily tied as my favorite colony sim with Gnomoria. If you have any imagination or tendency for headcanoning things, this is the game for you. Of all the colony sims I've played, this one is amongst the most user friendly and sufficiently detailed without being overwhelming. I look forward to more mods and content as time passes :DLet me now tell you the tale of the town of Hurra...Hurra started as a small crashsite wherin the only survivors were a planetary settler, someone's livein roommate, and the psychotic butcher. The butcher brought in loads of animals, each struck down with a single blow and chopped them into bits, the roommate cooked the bits and kept the settlement clean, and the settler did everything else.The colony grew steadily, marked only with one person of particular interest, a scoundrel by the name of Mickey 'Ye' Huang. Having been a minstrel most of his life, Mickey was drunk, lazy, and incapable of any meaningful labor. But, Mickey was good for a laugh and liked to carve statues from wood that rich people from other worlds liked to buy so Mickey pulled his considerable weight. One day Mickey carved a legendary statue of incredible realism that depicted the death of his fellow colonists and a great fire. Despite how beautiful the statue was, (or Mickey clamed it was anyway) the rest of the colony hated it and marked it for export as it seemed to be an expression of madness. An expression of madness... or prophetic vision?Hurra was a peaceful place, the peace only interrupted by the occasional wistless bandit taken captive and 'convinced' to join or be harvested for organs, and the infrequent mass boomalope chain explosion. Until one day 'it' arrived. It poisoned the land, killing crops and trees, and before the colonists could mobilize to deal with the metal monstrosity, another appeared, this time affecting their very minds. In assaulting the twin metal aberrations, many died, and those who were not killed were badly wounded. Immediately after the great calamity, the bandits whom had made Hurra rich and populous arrived in force, slaying with abandon, and burning that which could not be stolen. The sole survivor of this madness was a terribly old man afflicted with dementia, cataracts, and a bad back who had been welcomed by the colonists only a week prior as a means of trying to alleviate the guilt they had felt in inflicting attrocities upon even those who had meant them harm. For a day or two, the old man, kept it together and dug graves for the original settlers, unil overcome by grief, he beat his dog to death. Now with bleeding and infected wounds from his expired companion, he lay in the viscera covered hospital, slowly waiting to die. But before he could finish Mickey's prophecy, a wanderer came upon the colony and for reasons unknown even to him, he decided to join the colony. That man was former pirate captain, Tater Strahmn.Tater heard the stories of Hurra, buried the old man, and rebuilt. In the years that followed, he lost all of his natural limbs and eyes defending his belief for a brighter future. Now today Hurra is a safe place where most are welcome, where slavery and organ trafficing are illegal. Tater stands above it all as a watchful cybernetic god clad in power armor, armed to the teeth, and followed by a horde of huskies. The only remnants of the old Hurra in the Pax Tatus are the graveyard where many colonists now come for silent contemplation after work, history having been rewritten to make the fallen into heroes, and a slightly burnt but beautiful statue in the primary cafeteria made by a forgotten artist prophesying the end of the world.

								What a great little fun game. This has all the management you could want and it goes for realism. After a few failed games of my settlers dying to heatstroke, pirates, and starvation, I finally had the hang of it. I had one of my founding colonists get her jaw and leg shot off in a pirate raid, she was in bed for days, until I gave her a peg leg and a denture. Now she can walk again! Her husband is a little repulsed by her disfigurement, but at least she's alive. It's pretty difficult, even on the easier settings, but you learn quick how to survive. I'm growing hops to make beer to keep my people happier. You have to hoard food once you have a few extra people, it will go fast. Build a wooden storage room with 2 ACs. Keep it cold so it doesn't spoil. Power is important. There are many ways to generate it.I was finally able to get a leg up on the raiders by building a single Assult Rifle once I had the means. This rifle tore into these thugs like butter, in the right hands. I also had sandbags placed outside of my base to defend. I lost people and had a few injuries and scares, but I survived and expanded into a large compound with steel and stone walls. In addition to the assault rifle, I now had a shotgun, sniper rifle, incendiary weapon, pwd (smg?), plenty of pistols and shivs. Made a longsword for the guy who prefers brawling up close. I feel OK when 4-5 pirates come knocking on our doors.You forget this is an early access game because of how functional it is now. I'm sure they will work out the few kinks and bugs I've seen, but as it is, it's a hectic fun survival strategy game. For now, there is still more to do...			"

								I dont know how much hours i put in this game, it must be a few hundred.Rimworld has slowly become my favorite game of all time. It is my go to game when i dont know what to play.Usualy it is very relaxing, the game speed can be controlled and even paused.I cant tell you exactly what it is that i love, for me it hits all the right spots.Designing a base, manage all the goods, get tru a winter, raid or illnes.Than there is so much detail in everything, all the stuff that can be build and has a effect.And the in depth social system, yes you can ignore this and all is fine. But it it there and when the time is right you wil notice.This game could be a bit much at first, how do i build this, how do i place that, why does this work or not work.But there is a wonderfull community who can tell you everything. There is also YouTube with its hundreds of hours lets plays. Espacially Blitskriegsler has some good play vids.And there is always the pause button, So if you need to look something up or want the time to sort stuff out. This is the best of both real time and turn based.Never are two play thoughs the same, The creative proces of building and taking care of your collonists is amazing.But €30,- is that to much for such a game?Not for this game it is not, dare i say it, this game is diferent. This game is a product of vision and love, not making money. The game is practically bug free, it never crashes. All the little details are wel balanced. It runs on allmost any pc.And if you want a change you can start with a different scenario or put in a mod. The devoloper of this game love mods. He likes it that people like his game and develop for it.So give it a try and i hope you see the same magic sparkle that i see. A rare thing now a days, i'm 35 and have become a bit of a cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to games. All the games do the same and have the same things that make me go meh.			"

The russian dude was really usefull but he had a eating problem and the mother could only build and cook. After 3 days the son had a mental breakdown and was beaten to death by a lhama. The mother asked the russian for sex was rebuffed then had a mental breakdown because the russian wouldn't share the only bed and made her sleep on the ground. She attacked the closest rabbit and was nibbled to death. Right as all seemed to be lost a a russian female wanderer arrived and they both hit it off. Neither of them can do medical care though so it probably wont last long. 10/10 would watch a psychologist have a mental breakdown again.			"

Now today Hurra is a safe place where most are welcome, where slavery and organ trafficing are illegal. Tater stands above it all as a watchful cybernetic god clad in power armor, armed to the teeth, and followed by a horde of huskies. The only remnants of the old Hurra in the Pax Tatus are the graveyard where many colonists now come for silent contemplation after work, history having been rewritten to make the fallen into heroes, and a slightly burnt but beautiful statue in the primary cafeteria made by a forgotten artist prophesying the end of the world.

								I saw this game and read about three reviews before I bought it without hesitation.I started playing at around midnight, thinking, hey! I'll just play for a half an hour before I go to bed.What feels like 5 minutes later I look up from the screen only to realize the sun is coming up. I played for 5 hours without realizing. 10/10 would play again.			"

								I've been playing RimWorld off and on since September of 2014, this game scratches the Dwarf Fortress itch (that I've also put in countless hours into) but is very much a different game.  I can pick up RimWorld in 5 minutes, DF not so much.  Increasingly I find myself drawm more to RimWorld to waste a few hours with.  I'm looking forward to more content, but it's already a complete and enjoyable game if base building is your jam.			"

								Princess went bezerk because Sally had a nicer bedroom than her. A short-circuit set the farm on fire and starvation ensued (it was nearly harvest time). Desperate for food, Mike tried to hunt an elephant, triggering the whole herd to attack. After the dust settled, Princess was the sole survivor. She attempted to rebuild her life, in a cave, away from the elephants, and living on the corpses of her friends. She died of an infected foot two days later. 10/10 - buy this game.			"

								A tragic story of survival, friendship, and love on an unknown planet... Crash land on a flourishing landscape Begin the grueling task of gathering resources and building shelter Rescue multiple survivors of fallen rescue pods and convince them to join the cause Despite all the hard work, two survivors declare their love and are planning a wedding! A chapel is built specifically for the occassion The wedding night is upon us, and everyone gathers ALERT! Raiders are incoming! The bride, a skilled gun slinger, rushes off with the others to defend their home In a blur of gunfire and smoke, the bride takes a shotgun blow to the chest and is instantly DEAD! The dust settles and one of the raiders remains alive in the dirt, barely breathing The groom quietly walks up to the fallen raider and empties his gun, avenging his would-be wife I stare at my monitor and quietly exit the game - holy sh** what just happened?After only 20+ hours of gameplay, I thought this was just a basic build-n-survive type game. But you start to become attached to your survivors and then it becomes personal. Fiona (the bride) will not be forgotten!8/10 - No regrets buying this game. Will definitely play again! Looking forward to updates/patches that will enhance the game further. "

								The dev team described the game as ""Dwarf Fortess meets Firefly"" and after playing for several hours, I can agree.General Concept:Hands-off unit direction (You give them a task, and someone will get to it.. when they're ready!), as you try to achieve more goals, starting from basic survival, to escaping the planet by building a ship, and dealing with random events that can either help you survive, or make your life hell.Pros:- Random Gen World- Small to Large gameplay areas- Customizable challenge/gameplay settings- Easy Start/Hard to Master- A lot of control over the base building aspects of the game- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires that you need to account for.Cons:- No direct unit control (w/exception for combat)- Random Gen World doesn't always spawn with needed resources (you are limited by in-game trade rng)- Every character has it's own personality, wants, needs and desires, and will take care of them in the order they want, not the order that might make the most sense.- Maps are currently only a single 'layer'- Single PlayerGameplay Overview:Dwarf Fortress is a good example of how the game plays, and what you can generally expect.  If you're carfeul about how you assign tasks, you can 'force' the AI to do certain things first, but at the of the day, if the character wants to sit and watch the clouds more than cook their food.. they're going to go hungry while enjoying the view!Release 14 introduces new modes expending on the core game, often increasing the challenge to the game (one scenario has you start with 1 character, instead of the normal 3), but ultimately is just a variation on the core game.  14 also introduces intergrated Workshop support for custom scenarios you build, which allows for much easier sharing of the scanrio with others.Thoughts:Overall, a fun game to sit down and kill a bit of free time with, but with enough to do to occupy a larger block of time if you have it to spare.  While the maps have various playfield sizes you can choose from, it is still only a single layer map (at least form what I've been able to find - I might just be missing something in the UI/game), but never felt 'small' or confined.  The NPC events (even teh bad events) tend to be fun (or at least as much impact you allow them to be, and provide a very real sense of 'Aw crap, what happened this time'.One thing I'd like to eventually see in RimWorld would be a variation of the random NPC 'story' archive you get in Dwarf Fortress.  You don't really see the characters 'story' recorded in the development of your colony/camp, and given the nature of the game, I think that could draw you in to the lives of the characters a bit more while increasing your emotional investment in them.Recommend?If you enjoy 'god' games where you do more influencing than directly control gameplay - Yes!Gameplay Livestream Recording:

Early Access Review
								An astoundingly complex and deep game that suffers from a bit of early game difficulties.Please don't misunderstand me, this is one of my favourite games of the decade - before playing on Steam, I've played every Alpha adding up to hundreds of hours. If you're willing to put in some effort, the rewards of watching your little ♥♥♥♥ed up ant farm of colonists is exceptionally rewarding.But I would be remiss if I didn't point out how excruciatingly difficult it is to learn the early game of RimWorld. You start with very little (in the base version) and have to learn by constant trial and error what's necessary to survive past the first winter. ""Oh, I should probably dispense nutrient paste until I have a way to easily replenish stocks. And I'll need a lot of tuques and parkas if I want to get work done during the winter. And don't skimp on cleaning and hailing, or else you'll find a lot of carcasses go to waste and people go insane from their sorry surroundings (?!).""But I suppose that's also part of its charm, if you're willing to learn the hard lessons the game teaches you.Overall, this game is worth the praise by leaps and miles, but it still needs some fine tuning.

								I never could get into Dwarf Fortress. The graphics turned me off. After all, I'm not a 14 year old living in 1983 anymore! However, I was always intrigued by the stories I read about in Dwarf Fortress.RimWorld has sufficient graphics for me to get into the stories it generates. So far, the longest any of my colonies have survived is 115 days, with its population reaching six residents at its highest. Many of my colonies start off well, rising to a pinacle of progress that then crumbles under the accumulated weight of my colonists' mental breakdowns. They end with some tragedy, such as the last survivor starving to death, his eyes gouged out by another crazed colonist who succumbed to her injuries first. Or my last colonist lies in the dark, both feet shot off by the jailbreaking raider who then returned and set everything on fire, eventually incinerating the footless colonist.If you like community-building simulations, you should try this game. If you want to play this as a straight-up colony sim, I recommend adding the mods that include fully-equipped space marines so you aren't slaughtered early on. With that said, there is something for playing the unmodded game of shipwrecked random colonists.			"

								I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of this genre. I haven't played much dwarf fortress, games like Towns, Gnomoria and Craft The World usually elicit a single long playthrough that, though enjoyable, usually concludes my time with the game whenever I have everything unlocked.RimWorld has been pretty much the opposite. I've played about 5-6 times already, lost my colony to various things, whether it infection wiping out my people, raiders gunning down all but one of my colonists and leaving the surivor to wander around the compound with crippling depression or whatever...it doesn't matter. I just start up a new colony and go at it again.A little reccomendation: If you play games like Xcom or stuff like that with iron man off, don't do so with this game. Go in the way it's meant to be played, it's surprisingly easy to go through with restarting, and I haven't had any bugs so far. Honestly, I think the best thing this game does is remove character creation. Clicking random until you get people who generally fit what you need kinda detaches you from them, meaning that when they inevitably die, you're fine with just going again (at least for me). I still haven't had any playthroughs that I'm incredibly proud of, but so far, every loss has taught me something and I feel like I now have a really efficient method of starting thte game.One universal piece of advice: Build graves as soon as somebody on the map dies, friend or foe, and get all bodies buried ASAP. Just trust me.			"

								This game is simply amazing. Although in alpha this game is remarkable, the graphics are amazing and the way it runs is just brilliant. Rimworld is a survival game where you start with a 2 bandages, a rock and a torch, you then proceed to gather materials and make a house. As the game goes along it gets harder to make items which gives it a longer play time. The PvP aspect is amazing as a half naked man can run over a hill and demolish you which is pretty funny in my experience. I rate it 9/10 just as I feel the updates need to be a little faster.EDIT NEW RIMWORLDThis game just gets better not only are the devs dedicated enough to rework the game completely, they update it every week! The graphics are god like and the PvP is even better than before although a half naked man killing you, usually involves a bow or a spear and you end up crying in a corner. I rate it 10/10 Game Of The Year, Nice work Ludeon Studios	 :D			"

Unfortunately this was abruptly ended by a maneating rhino coming through killing a man and injuring 2 whilst the 4th member of the bunch lay in bed with his legs brocken unable to help and hence starving to death.All together a very enjoyable game.

								Ahh Rim World. Such beautiful stories you tell. You've earned my recommendation wholeheartedly. The following story is from my first playthrough. I’ve done about 5 now, each with their own beautiful character and story arcs, complete with social challenges. It’s amazing to watch it unfold and I’m excited for the future of RimWorld.Freedom Colony:It was a nice day in Freedom. Hammer the Oaf, freshly stranded had met up with a few lucky other colonists. Silver, the fiery, genetically grown combat medic was the first person he met on this god forsaken planet.. She was a after the war geneticist, and Hammer was in love with her. Unfortunately though, Hammer was ugly. Hammer loved people and animals the most out of anything in the world. His true love however, was Silver. He tried to talk to her almost every day, but his voice was so annoying and he was so ugly, that she became very irritated and would insult him. He felt bad so he went off to find an animal companion to cheer himself up. Hammer, the Oaf that he was, found a playful adult cougar. NOT THAT KIND OF COUGAR KEEP READING. He wanted to be best friends! But the cougar mauled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Hammer, and his right arm was shredded as ♥♥♥♥.   The other colonists tried to save his life, but because of the severe infection, it was deemed his right arm would have to be amputated. Silver the Combat Medic/Geneticist( and far over qualified to save Hammer), horrified by watching hammer be mauled and also already on the edge of mental breakdown due to Hammers repeated advances, finally snapped. She ran off into the night, leaving all her clothes behind. She took the pistol, however. Hammer the Oaf lay on the operating table. The operation was to be performed by the only person qualified to operate……. José.  José, the agriculture and architecture extraordinaire took it upon himself to save Hammers life. So he got to work. Hammer emerged from the operation to find that somehow his liver had been punctured (wtf José really???) and his torso was badly cut. He soon died, and the other colonists minds broke as well.  It was chaos and for one night, the were all…...free….…. Running off into the wilderness they somehow found themselves, lost out there, among the wildlife. I wept for Hammer. For Silver. For José, you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For the less important characters without names, many of whom died horrific deaths as they lost their minds snapped like twigs with the weight of the void pressing down on them.10/10 I didn’t know if it would be worth $30.It is.

								I liked the base game just fine, but similar to Minecraft - it is the mods that will give it longevity.With the mods I recreated my immediate family - me, the wife, and three kids.  Customized appearances, behavior, etc.We crashed and on the first day got to work surviving.While clearing a structure the ceiling caved in - wife lost her nose & daughter's left eye was crushed - her cat was killed.My daughter could no longer shoot straight, but we struggled on.Days later wild beavers entered our territory.My daughter and I went out to kill them.Shot my daughter in the arm by accident, but thankfully she still could use it.  Beavers all dead.Ignored a survivor in an escape pod, they died - oh well, they were psychotic.Then my dog died from a snake attack - sad day, but still had a pet warg.Daughter caught malaria, was doing good, and then we ran out of medicine and she took a turn for the worse...Visitors showed up, but they didn't have medicine, only malari-block - useless after the fact.Daughter died...Cursed the mods for allowing me to recreate my entire family, but struggled on.Warg died during a raid...Started up the save I made right when the game started - not without my warg dammit!

								Best game I've played in years. Tynan Sylvester is an inspired game designer who makes good decision after good decision. I've watched him improve a great-from-the-beginning RimWorld consistently with every Alpha Release and I've been on since Alpha 2. The best way to summarize what makes RimWorld great is this: emergent gameplay. You will be telling stories about what happened to your colonists to your friends. Crazy stories emerge from this game. After playing for 200 hours you'll find new, clever ways to use the game mechanics because the interactions are so intricate. It's well-designed. Immersive. Not flashy but rich. And frankly, this game is basically done. (Except I hope it's not because I can't wait to see what Tynan has in store for us next!)Finally, Tynan is super communicative with the community. He discusses ideas and takes feedback seriously. He has an army of modders and community organizers helping him. And from what I can tell from his protege Piotr, we're in for some great changes in the future.And then there's the modding. Oh the modding is done so well here. Mod support has basically been available from very early on and the community has produced a myriad of great ones. You won't run out of material, trust me.			"

It's absolutely wonderful and a must-have for your library, buy it, love it, play it.Also, there's an amazing modding community for the game too!			"

								I had been meaning to play Rimworld for awhile but never got a chance. A press key gave me the push to dive into the game I needed and man am I happy to have taken the plunge. While I might not have the experiance of veterans of the series, I still had a blast playing the game. I did a ~1 hour initial impressions of the alpha 14 version if you want to see it in action:

			Rimworld is a game about survival, adaptation and management where you take control of a colony on a distant world and try to survive against the odds.		

It has a fairly steep learning curve, but not nearly as steep as, say Dwarf Fortress. Playing through the early newbie stages is worth the time and effort to learn the game as it is a deep, rich and fun game full of emergent storytelling and gameplay. Highly reccomend this title and would pay full price for it even if the Devs didn't give me a press key.  "

								This is a great game, very funny too (doctor with cataracts in right eye and rat ate the left eye gave my other colonist a peg leg but ended up messing up a lung?) but it really feels like a great game, Great survival game and it's not even finished so I'm excited for what's comingPros- 1. CreativeAble to build however and whateverr you want with small limitations.2. Love the detailed information on each character 3. Pets, and wild animals as pets, who doesn't like bears?4. Gameplay as I said above the gameplay is smooth and feels like a survival game thats not too easy and not too hard 5. Emotions, I love how you can't easily just murder bandits for free meat or kill your starter pet for quick food since it effects your colonists mentally and them going on rampages is pretty scary since you can't stop themCons- (EARLY ACCESS GAMES NEED THIS SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO AND WHAT NOT TO FIX)1. CombatI'm sorry but the combat isn't..... good. My male with 12 in shooting ( which is super good) takes FOREVER to kill a bandit/wild animal with a good sniper rifle, guns are a nightmare to use since it seems they have no problem at all shooting an ally but takes minutes to land just ONE bullet on the enemy. Good reason why you should just build a bunch of turrets and hide home.2. Random wipesI know its early access but please... Don't wipe my 1 year base ;_; 3. Maps/ExplorationIt's kind of a let down when you generate a whole world and only see a small square. Just my humble opinionFor now I give this a 7.5/10 Great game.			"

								This game is 10/10 amazing. It's my favorite indie game and let me tell you why. This game can create such hilarious, tragic, or heroic stories. It is truly a great storytelling game. I would never hesitate for second to but this game. The developer is constantly working to add new content too. Just trust me and all the other hundreds of reviews and give this game a try! :D			"

								Friends said I'd love this game.  I watched many YouTube playthroughs but they seemed long and boring.  I was not impressed.  Eventually, peer pressure got the best of me so I bought it.  Though I don't have many steam hours, I probably have 300 hours having bought from Ludeon.   It is an excellent game rich with content.  While I enjoy building a strong base with traps and mazes for raiders, What I want to concentrate on in this review is the content.What the videos don't convey well to someone who has never played RimWorld before is the attachment you have for certain characters in the game.  You will rely on your favorites to keep your colony alive.  When the inevitable happens and one of them loses a leg or worse dies, it changes your whole strategy.  You may decide to scrap the game and start over.  You may try to bribe a prisoner to join your colony.  One colonist can mean the difference between success and failure.  As I said, there is content on top of content.  See a statue in a room?  Take a look at it, each one tells a different story.   And that's just a simple example.  Each character feels a certain way about all other characters and vice versa.  Think that doesn't matter?  It does.  What other video game have you ever played where you cared whether two characters hated each other or not?  In this game you will.  You'll celebrate the former enemies who mend fences.  You'll curse when a colonist loses his spouse.  That not enough?  Every action has a reaction.  Is one colonist highly skilled at medicine, but making many mistakes?  Have you checked to see if he's drinking on the job?  Many weapons have their own stories too.  And so do the tombstones.  Many are hilarious.  To conclude, if you are sitting on the fence about whether to buy or not.  I'd recommend it to people who like building games.  I don't know what games to compare it to.  It has alot of the traits of Craft the World, resource management like Sim City, Banished (though it's far more entertaining IMO) and maybe some Age of Empires.  I don't think the let's play videos can do it justice until you actually learn the game.			"

								I always wanted to play Dwarf Fortress but could never be bothered to learn the crazy and arcane interface. Rimworld allows me to play this emergent simulation style of game without having the UI getting in the way, and the end product is compelling. It's relaxing watching your colonists going about their jobs and interacting, slowly building up your facility. It's not so relaxing when your colonist has a mental break because of a squirrel bite and ends up shooting the doctor and setting fire to the stores.			"

								Although I doubt this game needs any more positive praise, I couldn't resist spreading the word just a little further. For those of you who adore games in the same vein as Age of Empires, Prison Architect and Dwarf Fortress, stick this on your wishlist.One particular event that stands out in my mind was the tale of Barry. Barry was a colonist who needed rescue early into the development of my settlement, and by coincidence he was the brother of an existing settler - how could I say no? But Barry, Barry was a nightmare. He hated everybody, caused fights, was greedy and spoilt, to the point that only a huge house of his own would sate him and keep his distance from the others, who spent most of their hours working to survive, while Barry wasted time on tantrums and alcohol.Then, a season down the line, Barry's sister was shot through the lung. Without good medical facilities, she was going to die, while Barry, the turd, would survive. Needless to say, anger took hold, and the next time Barry started a fight, I refused to tell my settlers to put their guns away.One dead Barry and a transplanted lung later, and everybody carried on happily as if nothing had happened. Even a Barry can have their uses on the Rim.Deeply challenging AI, sporadic and captivating story events and a character system that is just as frustrating as it is fulfilling, this game just burns the hours away.

								This game is amazing, i pieced this story together from my characters backstories. 3 people crashlanded on a unknown planet codenamed ""Italia"", these three were members of a military organization and were travelling on the same ship. Dmitri (male) the Mech War Veteran, it states that he fought in the great Mech War that recently ended (the ship was probably returing after the war). Dmitri was a soldier that fought in the frontlines in the 2nd Mech War, during his childhood he lost his entire family in the 1st Mech War (its called the mech war since it was robots against humans from what i can understand), this left him socially scarred, he didnt want to bond with anyone since they might die.Kim aka ""Kimmy"" (female) was the ships Doctor, she patched up the soldiers onboard this unknown militarry warship, she probably patched Dmitri up a few times but never caught his name, she was a ace student that was top of her class before joining the Research and Health Department of the Military Corp. (not much else is know about her).Ana (female) was one of the ships cooks aboard this unknown military warship before it crashed, her brother was also aboard the ship as a military engineer. she was an art student during her childhood and was born into a noble and wealthy family, it is unknown why she chose to be a cook, especially a military cook, but she too will share the same fate as these Dmitri and Kimmy.StrandedDay 1 The three woke up in wreckages of escape pods next to each other, they were surronded by money and steel and survival food packages, they quickly regrouped and Dmitri collected the the stuff and lead them into a destroyed alien ruin, there they spent the night sleeping on the floor.Day 2 The three started building up the ruins, patching up holes in the roof, building outwards with wood, they even managed to a bed room that they all shared, they spent the entire day building a bedroom and beds then sleeptDay 3 The three woke up and ate and started constructing a dining room aswell as a butchers room since Dmitri knew that they needed one.Day 4 Dmitri woke up early in the morning from nightmares from the 1st Mech war, he was restless so he went out hunting and shooting animals, he brought home a deer like looking creature, the three ate this deer.They lived like this for 4 more days before something happened...Day 8 While Dmitri was out hunting he spotted another man, he quickly ran to him and he introduced him self, his name was Vandeim and was the ships engineer and brother to Ana, he joined the crew and even created electricity, he made solar panels and wind turbines as well as batteries.Day 9 Kimmy started constructing a infirmary since she was scared Dmitri would wound himself.A few more days passed by...Day 17 Dmitri brought home another man while he was out hunting, it was Colten Volt aka Colt, Colt was one the ships pilots and confirmed that no other survived the crash since he traveled half the planet searching for us.Day 19 A band of native tribes started raiding the ""colony"" but it proved no match against Dmitri and Colts fire power, sticks and stones doesnt beat fire and steel.Day 27 A native was captured her name was Jude, Vadeim started educating her and learning her language.Day 31 Jude joins the merry band of survivors.Day 35 Jude and Vandeim marrys.For the past few months the survivors lived happily and propspred, they built into the mountains the ruins they where in, they built a farm in front of the ruins, they built a pool table where Dmitri, Vandeim and Colt spent their days, they built seperate rooms for everyone, thay had truly come far...Day 112 A man named Antonio was running away from a band of pirates, Dmitri took up arms and rushed out to protect him, he slauthered the pirates and the survivors fled and vowed to return... Antonio was apparently a Survivor of another crash, according to his backstory he was an explorer.Day 121/122 It seemed that pirates wouldnt return but they did... they returned and brought death and destruction with them, they built mortars behind the mountains and started besigeing the make shift base of operations inside the northern mountain, Vandeim, Colton, Jude and Dmitri went out to fight them... The fight was bloody and long, the battle lasted the entire night, the pirates all died but Vandeim was severly injured, Dmitri grapped him, and carried him to the infimrary.Day 124 Vandeim died from his injuries...Day 125 The colony is mourning and it hit Dmitri hardest, his memories of his childhood and the war returns...Day 128 While out hunting Dmitri froze and that nearly cost Colt his life.Day 131 Dmitri looks very bad... he stopped talking to the others...Day 135 Kimmy tried to calm Dmitri but he became angry and injured her. Antonio and Colt where forced to calm him down.Day 139 It looks very bad for Dmitri, he is getting worse and worse...As time passes more and more pirates and tribes started to raid and attack the survivors, Dmitri fights them off valiently and screames ""die you scum... THIS IS FOR VANDEIM!"".Day 157 Communications are up and Antonio has taken over as Engineer.As time passes the survivors start getting used to live this life, and accepts its not that bad, Dmitri gets worse and worse, and to stablize it he drinks and sleeps in the days... The only time he leaves his bed is to hunt or kill raiders. Hopefully the mood will improve amongst the surviviors. (this is how far i have come)This game is beautiful and very detailed, the start is harsh and fun, its randomized so its diffirent everytime, i would recommend this game to people that like survival games, management or strategy. If you like games like Prison Architect or Banish or Factorio or games like that then this is definetly for you!This game is in Alpha yet it is more complete then ever...			"

								The first time I booted this up I have to say it was really overwhelming, the tutorial didn't do much except show you how to use the basic camera movements and such. I would perhaps like a bit more hand holding so that you aren't left figuring things out by yourself.That said, once you get into it it's really fun and quite addictive.For an ""Early Access"" game, it looks and feels like a full release. Devs listen to the community and are constantly looking at things.Beware of flash storms!! It ruined my first colony :(			"

								I couldn't possibly know where to start when talking about this games tredmendous quality.  It is the best survival simulation I've seen and played.  If you liked Banished...this is better.  Basically, if you've ever played Oregon Trail on an Apple II and liked it,   buy this .  There are many degrees of difficulty incase you find yourself struggling to learn or if you grasp games like this well, then you can turn up the heat.  Every game (seed) is different.  Replay value is through the roof.  Spent 50 hours on the first week.  Not sure when the euphoric state of happiness from playing this game will wear off (1 season and 9 days...you will get the joke after you play it), but right now it's not going anywhere.  If I had to be critial, the tutorial is fairly short and leaves you not as informed as I think you should. Overall, this game is well worth the money and you could call this game more complete than some AAA titles already on shelves.			"

								This game is life.  It's one of the best Early Access games I've ever played. The Early Access tag is only there to signify that the dev is still working on this game, but it's got all the planned features done and it getting new stuff added pretty regularly.  But the best part, is the mods/workshop.  There is everything for everyone and it adds a lot to the replayability.  Each game and set up with vanilla is different and could take thousands of hours to play all the permutations, but with the workshop/mods that number grows exponentially.  There's a Mars Colony total converstion, a H.P. Lovecraft mod, and everything else.The game price has never been discounted and will likely be raised when it exits Early Access.  I put it off for a while but am so happy I finally bought it.			"

								A game that can only be described as a work of art.Rimworld is a stunning game that takes the familiar art style and ease of use of a game like Prison architect and blends it with a similar complexity and AI intelligence of a game like Dwarf fortress, All this and it also mixes it with the feeling of Firefly or a similar sci fi!. I initially brought into rimworld Febuary of 2014 and was stunned by the game playing it with and without awesome mods up until now, The dev has taken some of the best mods and ideas the community thrown at him and implemented them fantasticly. I have nothing but praise for this game and how far it has come, It's early access done right and is worth the money easy. The game already feels more complete and full then pretty much any other games of a similar genre ( other then the big daddy Dwarf Fortress ). I love the game.The dev has the communitys trust.if this is your sort of game then GO AND BUY IT!.Also buy it from the website as it will give you a steam key and give the Developers more money to support this project for longer.Thank you Tynan and co you guys ROCK!BUY THE GAME			"

There is one for each country!There are some different scenarios available.There is a different Storyteller with each of their own effect INCLUDING a difficulty settings.You are able to download Mods.About the game.You play with some colonists and you have to build buildings, supplies, generators, turrets and many other things. To make it short, you have to rebuild everything. You are able to research and learn better things, Like television or other things. Your colonists has random attributes and skills and you are able to order them around to build and work. They could be connected to someone else or a pet. If something bad happends to the person and it may die, then the colonist will get a penalty debuff. There are alot of ways to make the mood high and low. But whenever they are too low, they will go nuts and might end up killing your colonists or destroying things. You could get attacked by mad animals or raiders. The higher the wealth of your base, the stronger the raid will be. You have to gather food, getting resources defend and do whatever you can do to survive.You can put a Seed or choose a randomized Seed.You can change the size of the world.You can choose your starting location.You are able to name your own character.You are only able to randomize a character and you can't choose their perks.Very Addictive.Game has Random things. Events/world/seed/etcAble to pause at anytime you want and speed the game up by 3 times.Has Permadeath option.There are traders and you can take people prisoners.Winter/Summer Season and Day/Night Cyclus.Save and load game is available.Other things.I am not a huge fan of early access, In fact i do not buy a game really from the EA. But I have checked some videos and this game got my attention. They update and they are still active. This game has a huge potential and super entertaining and it is worth any penny. -------------------I Give this game a 9/10 "

An amateur's review of Rimworld      RimWorld is one of those games that can treat you right one moment then sucker punch you the next - but what makes it so good for me is that it doesn't always. It has three storytellers with their own pattern, and those each have their own difficulty. If you want casual play, there's Phoebe Chillax on Basebuilder difficulty; mistakes are easy to recover from. Or you can also choose Randy Random on Extreme Permadeath for a real challenge - What happens is random and once it's done, it's done. Good luck surviving a huge raid on day 3. RimWorld gives a rather strong range of control of challenge right from the start.     The real fun is in the gameplay. You manage a colony (or a tribe) of 1-5 colonists, or pawns, and are tasked with their survival and the ultimate goal of building a ship to leave the planet. Defend them from raiders, killer robots, insect infestations, blights, eachother, and yourself. (We all get fed up with that one pawn eventually.) These pawns each have different traits, skills, and backstories that change how they function, like nudists, psychopaths, optimists, medieval lords, medieval slaves. Injuries also play a big role. A sick colonist will have to spend time in bed recovering or risk death, and a colonist can have their hand, arm, head (yikes!), organs, and more removed and that will affect them adversely. (Who needs a head anyway?) Not to mention that where you choose to build will affect growing seasons, clothes needed to survive, and diseases.    One final feature of RimWorld is the modding scene, and it is huge. A large variety of mods exist on the Steam Workshop and are a click or two away from being in your game, and even more unique mods await you in the Ludeon forums. Just like games like Skyrim, mods can make you spend yet another day managing those wacky pawns. The developer is also active and still polishing and adding more to the game, pushing it bit by bit to its final, grand form.Final Thoughts     I didn't expect to love RimWorld as much as I did, and it was a bit of a hesitant buy. However, I fell in love with the game. I struggled to build my first functional colony. I waited on edge to see if my pawn would recover from disease. I felt unease from my first ancient danger. I swore when my pawn kept missing an easy shot. Every colony is a rollercoaster of emotions, and I love every second of it.			"

								How I didn't review this game is beyond me. It's not for everyone, big AAA titles are for everyone and because of that they're♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is for people who like any kind of builders / simulation games. I mean, did you enjoy Simcity 20 years ago? This is for you. Do you like The Sime? It's for you. You like some farming sim? Get it. XCOM? Yup. Anything that deals with people interacting? Get in here. Yo, do you like games that are well designed? Rimworld. Do you like devs that listen and don't mess up early access? Why not Rimworld? Do you like Canada? Who doesnt? Rimworld. Do you think that a married couple having to eat eachother to survive a wolf attack is fun? Well, here ya go!Do you have a sick sense of humour? YO! Rimworld is just for you!Do you like spending 20 minutes on a game just to find it was actually 4 days and you're not employed anymore? GET THIS!Do you feel like games are too easy? Go for Randy random extreme, you'll think otherwise.But for real, this is one of the best designed, full of new ideas game I've played since Black & White. If you don't know B&W, go download WinXP, install it, get B&W, play it for 4 weeks, get back here, and GET RIMWORLD. Yo, this game is worth $120, it's like two AAA games. AND! It's still evolving. And there's *really* good mods for it. And it's so damn well designed. Jeez.Btw, for those wondering, my play time does not include beta access while the game was off steam - I played weeks more of it, trust me. It's 100%, totally worth every penny and twice more, easily.			"

								I have less than 20 hours in this game and I can tell you that I really love it! It has taken me this long to start getting an understanding of what all I need to look for (and what to avoid) in potential colonist. That's the first step. The second thing is to use their abilities to build shelter and storage that they won't end up hating and eventually enjoy life.Some amazing things happen at random including my pet Warg bonding with a colonist, only to murder my entire colony when said colonist dies of a heart attack.One thing I can count on is that any character I start to depend on or really enjoy will die before anyone else to any number of reasons including an Alpha Beaver attack, revenge Deer attack, fire outbreak, etc.One final note for any beginners: When the game tells you there is an ancient evil behind a wall.... DON'T BREAK THAT WALL DOWN.			"

								Kyle wasn't having a very good day, well make that life.He crashed in the desert with 2 female companions. Kyle was never in a very good mood either. He was always being pessimistic, but he had low expectations so that was ok. One of the girls that landed with Kyle, Eu, caught his fancy.But Eu kept turning Kyle down... Kyle's rage built inside him.  He decided instead to friend one of the huskies native to the area. The husky was a good companion, but lacked the kind of affection and physical touch that Kyle longed for. Kyle continued to pursue Eu, but she kept saying no.One day a traveller from far away asked if he could stay and the group decided one more set of hands couln't hurt at all. Palt was a good man, he came naked with no tools or food, but he was a hard worker. Palt and Kyle became good friends. A few weeks later a group of jerks attacked the complex and Palt was tragically maimed and killed. Kyle buried Palt himself. Later that week Kyle's dog also died. Kyle was taking this especially hard.Perhaps it was love, but it was more than likely out of sympathy Eu finally decided maybe Kyle deserved a chance. Kyle and Eu were enamored with each other. Many other folks joined the group and now there were 6 of them. Kyle decided to propose and Eu said yes!Later that month another group of raiders came and Eu was killed while standing next to Kyle near a mining quarry while they defended the complex. Again Kyle buried her himself. Kyle was struggling to cope really. One day while Kyle was mining the stains of blood on the ground next to the mine Kyle lost it. He had had enough and he went into a psychotic rage, Kyle began shooting every person in the complex. He killed everyone and with the dogs the group had adopted attacking Kyle he finally had his peace.			"

								Im here to tell the TRUE, tragic tale of Family Uno, the greatest, most f*cked up family to have lived.It all started with a woman named Ryan, a man named Lyso, and a girl named AmarylzThey were a happy family. Ryan and Lyso watched over their daughter Amarylz well, and kept the family alive and happy. Ryan was prone to starting fires however, and Amarylz had serious mental issues. But Lyso didnt care. Even being shot 2 times by an old gun when he was young, he still cared for his abnormal family.So as the family is adjusting to their new life, a naked test subject comes wondering into the home of the Family Uno, named Feeb.Feeb is a great scientist, though she liked being naked, but no one really cared, except for Ryan. She was a jealous old woman. Amarylz was gay, so she loved it.Despite the ever occuring rades and house renovations, time moved on as it did.However one day, an 82 year old raider attempted to sack Family Uno's home all by himself. Ryan took her rifle and instantly downed him with a shot in his right lung. This unfortunately spelled disaster for the old geezer, so the family took him prisoner, removed his right lung, and patched him back up. You can't let an old man die! So two days go by, and it's announced that today is the ol' geezers birthday! Hooray! Not for the geezer, cause on the same day, he lost his hearing! The family decided that integrating him into the colony would spell nothing but trouble, so they let him off, wobbling to his demise.The days go on, with everything being nice and calm...oh no! Ryan has gotten into a beserk and started fires all around the house! Fear not, Lyso was used to this, and would easily pat them away behind her as she had her fun. As the days trudged forward, things were looking up! They had plenty of food and a ton of meds. But selfish amarlyz didnt like the fact that she didnt even have to work at ALL, being given Joy time 15/7. She went made, and started attacking Feeb! Feeb took a tumble and fell onto the ground, as Ryan and Lyso, guns in hand, hid inside the storage closet! She bursted in, and they opened fire, blowing her right leg clean off! Quickly after maiming their own daughter, they rushed her and Feeb to the med bay to stitch them back to health. Many days after the incident, the family partook in a game of chess, when suddenly, a woman by the name of Ladane came running into the house, trying to escape to murderous bandits following her! At the same time, the village of Cool Time Fishing were in the yard visiting. Seeing the raiders, they sprang into action, and killed them in a matter of seconds. Afterwards, Ladane joined their group as thanks.Ever since that day...things started to take a turn for the worst...constant diseases, thunderstorms, raids! No one was safe! It was so stressful on the family, that Lyso and Ryan got a divorce! Poor Amarylz! Then...one horrid night...it begun. The end of a life. Lyso sick as a dog, died in his bed from a horrid torso infection. Nothing was the same anymore. Being the only man and leader of the group, the girls had little motivation to work. Their mood was always poor, and they would constantly fight and bicker. And on a night like many other, a thunderstorm cursed the family greatly...only this time...it was the end times...a lightning bult struck the freezer that Feebs was in, and she was instantly incapacitated, and on fire! Amarylz, as quick as could be, joined with Ladane to put out the fire, but it was spreading too fast! They too have succumbed to its horrible fate, as they fell on the ground, hopelessly burning to death! Ryan could only watch, for being a pyromaniac, the sight was just too beautiful to destroy. Ryan had nothing left. No ex husband. No daughter. No naked friend. No clothed friend. Not even a working freezer room. She snapped! She lit sections of her house ablaze! Running behind a sandbag, she watched as the flames engulfed her entire house. She had no reason to continue...as she was exploring what was left of the world, she found an ancient temple. It was all or nothing! She only had this left for her as a saving grace! She slowly deconstructed one of the walls, two find two Cryogenic sleep chambers. What could be in them?! She walked over to the one nearest her, and slowly opened it up......Where ""Hobo Bob"" and ""Janitor Mary"" toating machine guns mowed her down.10/10 best family simulator "

								I don't know how I sunk so much time into this game.I guess I just got attached to the colonists I was playing.Gameplay is challenging and rewarding... It does lack variety.For an early release this is excellent.If you prefer more polished work, I will say wait.[edit] The AI story director lacks variety at the moment, the same / similar events keep happening. Same with world generation. Workshop integration gives this potential endless playability.			"

								One of the best early access games I've ever played. This game has kept my attention for over 140 hours so far, and I plan on sinking a lot more into it. Absolutely addicting and well worth the price. There are so many different ways this game can play out due to the variation of colonist skills and personalities, game type, starting biome, and a bunch of other things. The mods are top notch and the community are very helpful. A small story from my game: Decided to accept a pyromaniac with a very low breaking point and no skills to speak of into my colony - spent a while basically guarding her whilst she kept starting fires around my home place. After a while, I felt I had enough of her and locked her in a room with utterly nothing to her name (I had even taken the clothes off her back) and let her starve to death. I forgot to look at the colonist relationship screen before I did this. Turns out, she was the daughter of one of my hard-working colonists. The mother falls into a deep depression and can barely do any work before she breaks and binges on beer. She passes out and wakes up with a mammoth hangover, thus making her mood worse and breaking again. It decended into a vicious cycle, and I could no longer keep beer in my stockpile. The mother eventually recovered somewhat... but I didn't. I felt utterly awful, and now I try not to take in people who are mental and/or have a severe lack of skills, and check the relationships tab before I... uh.. ""let go"" of colonists.10/10, will be playing for at least another 140 hours.			"

								Best game I've played in years. Tynan Sylvester is an inspired game designer who makes good decision after good decision. I've watched him improve a great-from-the-beginning RimWorld consistently with every Alpha Release and I've been on since Alpha 2. The best way to summarize what makes RimWorld great is this: emergent gameplay. You will be telling stories about what happened to your colonists to your friends. Crazy stories emerge from this game. After playing for 200 hours you'll find new, clever ways to use the game mechanics because the interactions are so intricate. It's well-designed. Immersive. Not flashy but rich. And frankly, this game is basically done. (Except I hope it's not because I can't wait to see what Tynan has in store for us next!)Finally, Tynan is super communicative with the community. He discusses ideas and takes feedback seriously. He has an army of modders and community organizers helping him. And from what I can tell from his protege Piotr, we're in for some great changes in the future.And then there's the modding. Oh the modding is done so well here. Mod support has basically been available from very early on and the community has produced a myriad of great ones. You won't run out of material, trust me.			"

								Friends said I'd love this game.  I watched many YouTube playthroughs but they seemed long and boring.  I was not impressed.  Eventually, peer pressure got the best of me so I bought it.  Though I don't have many steam hours, I probably have 300 hours having bought from Ludeon.   It is an excellent game rich with content.  While I enjoy building a strong base with traps and mazes for raiders, What I want to concentrate on in this review is the content.What the videos don't convey well to someone who has never played RimWorld before is the attachment you have for certain characters in the game.  You will rely on your favorites to keep your colony alive.  When the inevitable happens and one of them loses a leg or worse dies, it changes your whole strategy.  You may decide to scrap the game and start over.  You may try to bribe a prisoner to join your colony.  One colonist can mean the difference between success and failure.  As I said, there is content on top of content.  See a statue in a room?  Take a look at it, each one tells a different story.   And that's just a simple example.  Each character feels a certain way about all other characters and vice versa.  Think that doesn't matter?  It does.  What other video game have you ever played where you cared whether two characters hated each other or not?  In this game you will.  You'll celebrate the former enemies who mend fences.  You'll curse when a colonist loses his spouse.  That not enough?  Every action has a reaction.  Is one colonist highly skilled at medicine, but making many mistakes?  Have you checked to see if he's drinking on the job?  Many weapons have their own stories too.  And so do the tombstones.  Many are hilarious.  To conclude, if you are sitting on the fence about whether to buy or not.  I'd recommend it to people who like building games.  I don't know what games to compare it to.  It has alot of the traits of Craft the World, resource management like Sim City, Banished (though it's far more entertaining IMO) and maybe some Age of Empires.  I don't think the let's play videos can do it justice until you actually learn the game.			"

								The game I broke my don't-buy-early-access-wait-until-they-release-the-full-deal-if-it's-dodgy-wait-and-see rule, and... I haven't regretted it. 20hours into a game I bought three days ago (since this review), and I'm not bored. What's more is, there's a dedicated developer behind this game, the community's well-established, and Rimworld itself has been in Early Access for supposedly three years with the polish of a post-EA game.If I had to describe the game to somebody, I'd say it's SimCity meets The Sims on steroids, with some healthy inspiration from Firefly and The Walking Dead. The graphics aren't anything special (apparently the models were bought from the devs over at Prison Architect), but the finer details - the management of practically everything in game - is as astonishing as it is complex. The way characters interact with one another, and the world they live in, from hunting to gathering to defending to building to socialising, is a micro-manager's wet dream.There's perma-death, if you're into things like that, to up the stakes; and three ""story-tellers"" with differing mechanics, which randomly (within the settings you establish pre-colony and sometimes mid-play) generate events for you to interact with. There's a wide variety of play-styles, from hunter-gatherer, lone star, to three mid-tech-level strandeds in a Castaway setting.But it's the game's longevity, combined with immense replay value, which affect me the most: The longer you play with the same colony and community of people, the more you get to know them, the more their stories unravel, and the harder it hits when something happens to them, or to all of them. You play more to find out more and risk more at the same time, never knowing what might or might not happen, AND THAT is why I keep coming back to play it.			"

								Amazing game wich is really not nice to you.Story:Simon was a surviver who crash landed with Elina and Marcus, Marcus was Simons little brother.This strange area was luckely warm and plesant, lots of trees to build a new home and lots of animals to feed them, they used most of the days by building and collecting resources. A nice warm morning a new survivor showed up, a pretty girl who wanted to join the colony. Perfect timing because its is hard work to build a new colony with only 3 people, they needed the help.they welcomed Julia to the colony with a party and a feast in the kitchen that night, we started bonding very quick, it was a good evening. But no one would have expected that raiders was coming the next morning to attack.We all gathered quick to try and protect our new home, Marcus picked up a gun and started shooting! But to late did he see Simon crossing in front of him and accidentally shot him in the back of the neck. He died instantly by brain shoot. Marcus had just killed his big brother and went crazy, dropped everything and just walked around in a trance.Julia and Elina got the raiders away after long fightings, all was wounded expect for Marcus who was wandering around, because of his very traumatic experiance he went crazy and one night attacked Elina, he stabbed her and sadly she died that night by her injuries.There was nothing else i could do than go to Marcus sick bed after and killing him in his sleep.Me Julia is now the only one left and i can hear the raiders are comming. i will say my goodbyes and share my friends short sad story, and hope you who find this story will do better. bye to all and thanks for reading.RECOMMENDED :-D			"

								This game really has me hooked. Not only that ... Whenever I manage to free me of it, I can be sure to get sucked again when the next version is released. It's a bit like crack cocaine, with the main differences being the reduced health risks, the lower price and the availability as a legal download on steam.What fascinates me most, personally, is the fundamental openness of the game's goal. In theory, you are expected to build up a colony that's capable of building a star ship using which you escape. In my current play-through (Alpha 15), which is the fourth one I'm doing since Alpha 13, I reached that point about 20 hours ago, but the ship just sits there and is ignored. I'm really more interested in more fine-tuning for my colony, a little expansion, just a little more trade and just seeing what happens to my colonists. It's like a fish tank, which also never get's boring. A fish tank full of crack cocaine.			"

								I personally enjoy this game a lot, have started a  new colony so many times and it's always a new experience. I usually end up getting a pyromancer in my colony that has a meltdown and burns everything down :( :D.The updates are nice so far, you can add mods with the steam workshop, there is some really nice addons out there ( Customization of the people, more food, more furniture....)! The design is special, like prison architect, but that is for me not important if the game is fun. What is a game that is no fun at all but has the best graphics , anyway? Also, keep in mind that is is ealy access, so the design might change.It is a little hard to get into, you will have to figure out how to make a good start etc. but there are a lot of guides that can help you :) I'd say it is worth the money!

								Currently at 170 hours.I only play Permadeath (no saves except on exit), Classic Storyteller, Some Challenge difficulty, Crashlanded Scenario (3 colonists basic scenario) and I accept every random choice they make for me (planet seed, starting location, colonist stats, etc) no matter how good or bad. This playstyle has given me so many wildly different narratives, stories of triumph, defeat, sadness, and unexpected joy. This is a game about the journey, not the finish line.I still have not had a successful colony to date. My most successful one lasted probably about 30-40 gameplay hours, which ultimately fell to an unchecked infestation while dealing with attrition and a seige. I sat in silence, respectfully released all my animals, and watched in abject detatchment as my legless prisoner eventually succumbed to simultaneous starvation and infection. He died alone, in extreme pain, and surrounded by the clattering claws of murderous bugs scraping his cell walls. I like to think his slip into unconciousness saved him from the horrific fate that awaited.The game looks basic, but the interactions between everything are masterfully crafted. You will find yourself having to make hard choices that will really make you question your own values in life. The AI is a masterful story-teller.I can't express this enough: the real enjoyment from this game comes from the meta story. It's a great colony builder, and you can micro-manage so much that it will really satisfy those OCD control issues, but you have to learn to accept losses. It's all about risk management, time management, and resource management. One of the most stressful, but satisfying gameplay experiences I've had in a long time.My only advice: learn to accept losses and failure.			"

								If you like this type of RTS/Survival type game (Dwarf Fortress, Banished, etc) GET THIS ONE. You will not be disappointed.Basically it's Dwarf Fortress with a far more intuitive interface, making it much easier to pick up and get into. Yes, the graphics are very simple but the gameplay is rich and I don't find the simple graphics to be a distraction.Unlike DF, this game does not have layers of levels. There's just the one. But don't fret over that -- you'll find there's plenty of space. You don't get nearly as many citizens (getting 1 new recruit in this game is a big deal) but your management of those people is far more intense and individual. The game also features different AI modes which give you a measure of control over the challenge, with the default being that it will challenge you without simply throwing totally random ""and now you're dead"" events at you (mostly...) So overall it's a lot more approachable than DF and I would argue it's actually superior overall -- very similar depth to the game, albeit not necessarily with the same focus, and better control and oversight.My one pro-tip: your #1 concern in this game is not food or combat, although those are very important and you will do a lot of that. The #1 concern is keeping your people happy and therefore sane. Pay attention to what makes people happy and unhappy. Enemies MIGHT kill you and starvation MIGHT wipe you out and a lack of body armor MIGHT be bad but colonist unhappiness will be what ends your colony most of the time. Manage that and you just...might....live. Longer.			"

								I highly recommend this game and you should get it, NOW! Pros: The game is EXTREMELY in-depth, your characters can lose each individual toe, finger, ear, anything, and it's amazing.You can actually get to know and love the characters.You can make custom scenarios, and there's already a lot out there!Weather systems actually play a HUGE part in this game, there are dry thunderstorms, toxic fallouts, snow-storms, and they can all be either very damaging or very helpful.The developers are active.Tynan actually talks to people, this is extremely rare with developers and I think it's cool.There are pretty much no bugs, even for an alpha game, I've never encountered them and I'm happy with how well-done this part is. -/+ There are Prison Architect graphics, you can like or dislike these, but personally, I like them. Cons: There's three small tips for a tutorial and that's it, I actually like this because most games have 90-minute long tutorials and this small of one lets you figure out the game for yourself.  TL:DR This game is amazing and you should get it NOW! If you don't then you are missing a life.			"

								Easily one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. Usually when it comes to indie games, specifically early access, 30$ is asking a lot, but this game is 100% worth the price. I've been watching the progress of this game for a couple years, and I've been waiting for the Steam release to pick it up. Now that it's finally here and I've played it, I can say that it's a very, very good game.			"

								One of the most accessible community management sims out there. Beginners to the genre can easily pick up this game and get into it without hours of watching youtube tutorials. The UI is mostly user-friendly and it shouldn't take long to really figure out what you're doing. Compared to other games of this type I find it hard to not recommend RimWorld over all the rest, and RimWorld is only in alpha! Despite the game being in ""alpha,"" it feels complete. I haven't encountered many (if any) bugs and there's loads of content to enjoy at this stage in its development. The story that you create for your colony can go in many different directions. You could have one colony thrive while another one is ravaged by a pack of man-eating rabbits. Tons of replayability and enjoyment!			"

								1. Crash land on planet with three colonists (one being Troy, a professional counselor).2. Troy goes about setting up a base camp with the other colonists.3. One day, Troy accidentally trips one of the defensive traps, surviving but requiring amputation of his left arm. He presses on.4. During a raider attack, a grenade explodes near him, shredding his right arm entirely off. He survives.5. Good thing he's a talker; with no arms he keeps busy monitoring the captured prisoner raiders and thinking up new technologies for the camp.6. One day, he's had enough of this life, and starts screaming and breaking things in the camp.7. Fellow colonist Svaad, who is a bit psychopathic with no patience for this sort of thing, beats Troy to death.8. Riker, the other colonist, walks in, loses his mind at the sight, drops his load of wood, and proceeds to attack Svaad. They beat eachother unconscious.9. While lying there unconscious, raiders come to the camp, kick down the door, see the two of them, and decide to kidnap them.10. Svaad and Riker are sold into slavery.10/10 would do it all over again.			"

If you love a challenge and the frustration of your colonists going berserk if you dont keep them happy this is the game for you.There are also a wide selction of mods available to keep the game fresh while waiting for updates.Watch out for manhunting packs of Boomalopes ;) "

								Year 12.  While hunting a wild boar, Sabine is gored in the torso.  This becomes infected.  After weeks of struggle and being a burden to the team, she dies.  Later, a starving crewmember gnaws on her frozen body, then goes on a berzerk rampage in which he kills the third crewmember in her sleep.His toes are infected and he has frostbite.  In the midst of his starving madness he's attacked by three bandits.  In desperation he blows a hole in the wall of an ancient building and giant insects come pouring out, killing the bandits.He later succumbs to his infection, and dies face down in the snow.  The base, now abandoned starts to deteriorate.  Raiders and vandals come, fires break out.  There is little left but a shell, metal debris and bones.  The walls and floors are spattered with blood.  Some time later, a lone spacer running from pirates finds the place and takes refuse.  Laying on the floor she finds the grenade satchel left by the murdered engineer.  She runs to the door and waits - and when the pirates arrive she throws the grenade at the door - blowing it open and killing two of them.  The third runs off in a panic.She strips the pirates looking for anything valuable, and heads to the back of the abandoned outpost.  Claiming one small storage room as her own, she sets up a desk, bed and candle - cleans the floors and repairs the door.  Fast forward 6 months.  She sports a peg leg from where her leg was shot off by friendly fire.   Her two main fighters are both snipers.  One of them got his ear shot off, the other one has a facial scar from a fight with a raging elephant, incredible as that might sound.  The doctor just finished cutting off the cook's toes to stop an infection from frostbite.   His wife has a shattered jaw, and can no longer speak.  Solar panels are up and working, and the radio is online.  Time to find out who else is out there, and what their angle is.10/10 - Would desperately hang on for my dear life again.			"

								My first nine hours into this game told me I'd be playing it for a great deal...My first two settlers, Lyn and Atlas got married and lived a wonderful life for several seasons only for tragedy to strike... While out mining a bit from the main settlement atlas ended up getting into a mining accident and dying leaving behind Lyn only for her to die to a raid a season later... The last of the original settlers named Roughchild was a friend to both and filled with sorrow upon there passing... I caught Roughchild sitting in a masterwork chair he made for both of them a great deal.The chair was simply called 'Atlas's Black' and it's description made me rather sad ""This Furniture is engraved with a depiction of Adam 'Atlas' La Pointe whispering sweet nothings into Vernalyn 'Lyn' Taganna's ear with few clothing in sight. Atlas is stylistically bonded with Lyn. The Style is dadaist with heartfelt elements. There is a municipality in the upper part of the image. This representation refers to to Atlas and Lyn becoming lovers on the 8th of summer 5500.""Suffice to say Roughchild ended up weathering the battering storms of loneliness for a while before finally passing himself to a brutal raid but not before taking several others with him.A toast for those lost... 10/10			"

								vs Minecraft: I just enjoy managing and building a base in the third person way more. There are incredibly more complicated and detailed gameplay you can accomplish with this camera shift and I love the increased depth.vs Factorio: The conveyor belt sim is mechanically deeper with a narrower focus, but Rimworld brings better theme, story progression, and broader gameplay experiences.vs Stardew Valley: Stardew is cute and loveable. RimWorld is nerdy and brutal (in a good way). Both are excellent games in two different subgenres.vs The Sims: I actually really enjoy the Maxis game. Rimworld is a more combat focused and survival themed simulation, built by nerds, so everyone gets cool guns. But I still care about social relations, food, and the decor of my building.on Difficulty complaints: There are gameplay mechanisms that address all the review complains I've seen. However, there is no tutorial nor easy way to discover them. For example, intelligent resource hauling can be managed with clever programming of the work priorities, but no one will ever tell you this.			"

								I only learned about this game a few days before Steam release. I watched a few youtube videos of others playing to learn the controls and basic fundamentals. I absolutely adored the concept and idea behind this game, and I have to say I am not disappointed.I love all the weird, sad, funny, violent, silly things that can happen to your colonists. I like how it is down to a more personel  level of play, being able to get to know each and every member of your little community. I've played many other games like this before, but really none of them I can say equal it in enjoyment.You'll get to love and hate your little pixel guys and girls. I purchased the game and in one day I had a 14 hour marathon. If that doesn't say how much I like it, nothing else can.100 hours played mark update: Yep, still love this game. And with mods, particularly things like Aparello, it gets kicked up to a new level of awesome. I am officially declaring this the best game on Steam.			"

								I am a senior in college. I have reports, research papers, and generally a lot of other writing assigments due at any given time. With that being said, I go out of my way to not have to type or write, unless it's for a grade. This is the exception. This game, if you want to reduce this masterpiece to that simple definition, made me break my golden rule, simply so I could give it the upmost praise and respect. The level of detail is astonishing, and I have yet to go a full half hour without laughing hysterically at the events that are unfolding on my screen. I firmly believe this game is the future of all sitcoms and comedic writings- people will simply play this game, and share stories of what whimsical fun your colonists got into that day. A depressed doctor who smokes drugs before surgery to calm his nerves, only to amputate off the wrong leg during the procedure (supposed to be adding a prosthetic, but hey, drugs)? Check. Neurotic cook who enjoys making meals for everyone else, but will only consume the flesh of dead colonists? Check. A squirrel who self-tames and becomes the sole protector of the colony after a catastrophic power failure (Explosion) kills the sherrif? Absolutely. To sum up, your life needs this in it.			"

While still in 'early' development, the game has a very polished feel and a well established group of players, modders, and fans alike that began during and after the kickstarter program. With over two and a half years of hard work, primarily by one person as the sole developer, the game has finally reached early access release for Steam and grown to two man development team and a large community of players/modders. A worth while investment for anyone who likes a mixture of survival and base building. Just remember, end game is still under development along with many other aspects of the game.

								So I've only really made a couple of colonies in easy mode so far..BUT oh man. I have watched a lot of hours of people streaming this game as I fell in love with the storytelling aspect! I don't normally like these kinds of games as I find them stressful, however, this is actually really enjoyable! The fact you can pause and adjust your strategy etc etc, adds an interesting element to the game. For an early access game, I have by far had more fun than some of the major release games (The Division comes to mind...). I appreciate for some, the pricetag is a little high, but you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this game for your money. The pace can be slow or fast, depending on what kind of story telling AI you choose. It can be a little intimidating to start as there is so much to do, but it reminds me of a cross between the sims and terraria! (I haven't played such games as Dwarf Fortress or Prison Architect that it gets compared to..).I'd recommend reading guides/watching videos/streams on this game before purchase as there isn't much of a tutorial in the game yet! I cannot wait to see more content added to the game. It'd be nice to have more things to craft etc, however there are many mods I haven't looked into yet, so I might find something there!TL;DR this is a really fun game, complex yet simple! The story building is excellent and very entertaining. Once you get a flow, it's quite addictive, waiting for the next disaster to occur and how best to tackle it!			"

The design is special, like prison architect, but that is for me not important if the game is fun. What is a game that is no fun at all but has the best graphics , anyway? Also, keep in mind that is is ealy access, so the design might change.It is a little hard to get into, you will have to figure out how to make a good start etc. but there are a lot of guides that can help you :) I'd say it is worth the money!

								I've played Rimworld for about 2 months now and finally beat it today, about 15 minutes ago. Rimworld is a colony manager where you make sure everybody is happy and doing their job. Some people will be better at farming, mining, crafting, hunting, shooting and researching. These people will have traits like being beautiful, which makes everyone happy and being lazy, which makes them perform their actions slower. The combat in this game is very fun. Combat plays out like a Real Time Strategy where you can micromanage and move units into flanking positions or cover. The game really likes to alter players combat stats by looking at how healthy they are and how injured their eyes, arms, legs are. Cover and Health really matter at the higher difficulties. I played this game with the crash landing mod which made the game very difficult. I loved it. It was a challenge at the Extreme Difficult and Harsh landing settings. I saw people survive and make it back into space and I saw others start eating their hands once they ran out of food. This game throws some gritty stuff at you and has some fun happy moments for your colonists. The best part is that this game can be left on in the background and if you have enough orders queued, you can essentially let it play itself with only minor input from you. Buy this game. It's Sci-Fi and fun. I don't think I'll go back to play it again for a while but it defintely has value. The modding community is great. If the zombies mod worked I'd come back for another game.			"

								RimWorld is a fantastic game. There's a lot of obvious surface similarities with Prison Architect, but that's no bad thing and it's also absolutely its own game doing its own things. Every game is different thanks to the complex relationships between colonists that range from hilarious to utterly tragic, and the random events that occur on your colony world provide a constant challenge, so there's a lot of replayability here. It's also very well supported and it is being actively developed and improved upon. I can definitely recommend it highly to anyone.			"

Basically, if you've ever played Oregon Trail on an Apple II and liked it,   buy this .  There are many degrees of difficulty incase you find yourself struggling to learn or if you grasp games like this well, then you can turn up the heat.  Every game (seed) is different.  Replay value is through the roof.  Spent 50 hours on the first week.  Not sure when the euphoric state of happiness from playing this game will wear off (1 season and 9 days...you will get the joke after you play it), but right now it's not going anywhere.  If I had to be critial, the tutorial is fairly short and leaves you not as informed as I think you should. Overall, this game is well worth the money and you could call this game more complete than some AAA titles already on shelves.			"

								God damn this game what to even say, By far my new favorite upcoming game. Such a fun time to have a game that isnt stressful or stupid or has a bad community. This game has great everything and can only get better. I been playin it since the day it came out and alot more now. Holy crap its gotten good. Besides that the community workshop and mods for this game are LIT. So many hours of random, mind blowing, crazy managing fun. 10/10 WOULD RECCOMEND!			"

								This is a great game, very funny too (doctor with cataracts in right eye and rat ate the left eye gave my other colonist a peg leg but ended up messing up a lung?) but it really feels like a great game, Great survival game and it's not even finished so I'm excited for what's comingPros- 1. CreativeAble to build however and whateverr you want with small limitations.2. Love the detailed information on each character 3. Pets, and wild animals as pets, who doesn't like bears?4. Gameplay as I said above the gameplay is smooth and feels like a survival game thats not too easy and not too hard 5. Emotions, I love how you can't easily just murder bandits for free meat or kill your starter pet for quick food since it effects your colonists mentally and them going on rampages is pretty scary since you can't stop themCons- (EARLY ACCESS GAMES NEED THIS SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO AND WHAT NOT TO FIX)1. CombatI'm sorry but the combat isn't..... good. My male with 12 in shooting ( which is super good) takes FOREVER to kill a bandit/wild animal with a good sniper rifle, guns are a nightmare to use since it seems they have no problem at all shooting an ally but takes minutes to land just ONE bullet on the enemy. Good reason why you should just build a bunch of turrets and hide home.2. Random wipesI know its early access but please... Don't wipe my 1 year base ;_; 3. Maps/ExplorationIt's kind of a let down when you generate a whole world and only see a small square. Just my humble opinionFor now I give this a 7.5/10 Great game.			"

								Rimworld is absolutely amazing, the in-game tutorial may not quite be enough to learn all the details, and there's definately some fiddly bits, but this game is far above the quality in raw game design than many triple-A titles.  It's absolutely wonderful and a must-have for your library, buy it, love it, play it.Also, there's an amazing modding community for the game too!			"

								This tale begins with a small colony of three as they start building their base. Within the first 20 days of their perilous journey they recieve a notification that a lone woman is nearby running away from some pirates and is looking for protection. Not only that, but she is the mother of Alice (one of the three colonists!). The colonists gladly accept her plea and valiantly give her solace in the base while they manage to fend off the pirates with their shoddy weapons.Alice is sent to tend to her mothers wounds hoping her mother will join the colony. As her mother wakes up she is startled and begins to run away. Alice begins chasing after her mother desperatley trying to convince her to stop but with no avail. In a last desperate effort to stop her mother from running away Alice attempts to arrest her mother and bring her back to the base. This breaks out into a fight and now Alice is fighting her mother with her bare hands. They exchange punches but Alice gets the better of her mother and gives her one last punch which ends up destroying Alice's middle finger. Her mother lies there...dead.Alice now finds it difficult to do any tasks which require her to use her hands... every time she does... she is reminded of the horrific tale which destroyed her finger.10/10 - would send Alice to arrest mother again.

								What a gem amongst the Early Access. Been playing long before its stream arrival... And NO this is not a Prison Architect clone (that however is also a good game check it out). Think more Dwarf Fortress.Build a colony after crash landing on a planet, with very limited provisions, AND SURVIVE. Theres so many aspects to this game - base building, tower defence, resource management, exploration... I'm really underselling it here, theres really not enough room to go into all the little intracacies and nuances that make this such a fabulous game. Some of the things your colonists will get up to will either make you cry or wet yourself laughing... like when Bob couldn't get any more luciferium so took it out on the other colonists by murdering them in their sleep and then going on a rampage against nature.... in the nude.. before getting mauled by a bear.*QUICK EDIT*I also forgot to mention the brilliant soundtrack - ear candy.

								When I saw this game for the first time, I was like ""How the f**k this game has 10/10 ratings on steam with over 4,5k votes"". I decided then, to download an illegal, pirate version of the game (yes, I commited a crime!) to check it out, because I thought it's impossible for this game to be worth 30$. Boooy, I was so wrong! I've spent over 8 hours straight playing old pirate version of that game, I've started my colonies several time, and everytime my colonies died, instead of being angry at the game, I was even more motivated to start over again from the beggining to create another ""unperfect"" colony that will die sooner or later. On the next day, I went to work and I was thinking about this game much more often, than I think about sex (and I do think about sex a LOT!). I came back from work, and I immidiately bought this game from Ludeon site, registered it on steam and started another 8-hour game session, leaving my naked girlfriend alone in bed...Conclusion: This game has stolen my life, it's by far best game I've played in 2016, it has literally unlimited potential and It's definitely worth 30$. I recommended this game to few of my friends at work, they've played pirate versions as demos, and on the next day they've also bought this game. So, if you're not convinced by the old school graphics, download older version, and If you like it, show some appreciation for developers and buy this game, because it's get better with every update!.

								This game is a great game. The best part? it only gets better as time goes by. The game was worth the price a year ago and the game is way beyond worth it now. It says that I've only put in 4 hours or whatever it says now that your reading it but I've probably put 100 hours in before I even got it on steam. It's so great when I can easily recomend a game to people. If you ever had fun playing The Sims, or an RTS or anything like prison architecht then you're gonna have a great time. It's complicated at first but the tutorial system is intuitive and gives you information on things that you obviously don't know about becuase you aren't doing them. Have fun!			"

								Great game.  Be prepared to invest some time into learning the mechanics.  Sure you could read a guide, but it is more enjoyable to stumble along and have your colonists die in horrible ways.The game designers have a perverse sense of humor.  I started one colony as the only male with two nubile female colonists - one of them a former sex slave.  Just as things are starting to warm up, my man-hating, ex-wife joins the colony and becomes good friends with the other two female colonists.  In the interests of restoring harmony, I send my ex-wife out hunting for food with a knife against large carnivores.  Ex-wife's body is found by the women and dragged back to the colony causing both to go into deep depression.  Thus begins a downward spiral that ends with the colony starving and then wiped out by raiders.Great game !   Would send my ex-wife out hunting carnivores with a knife again !			"

								The gameplay of Dwarf Fortress + the graphics of Prison Architect.  It's that simple.  Usually those kind of formulae are unfairly reductionist, but it fits RimWorld perfectly.  If you're one of those tortured souls who loves ""winning"" in DF and have been longing for a version with a slick UI and slightly-less-abstract graphics, stop reading and buy this now.  If you've never played DF but love minutiae and incredible flexibility in micromanagement as depicted by Colorforms, give this a shot.  It's less a game and more of a narrative simulator, but it's no less fun.  Everyone will die, brutally, repeatedly, and it will be fantastic.			"

								This game is perfect if you want to create your own story.I made this beautiful colony with four people in it. Everybody was doing their job, every now and then someone had a mental break down and ran around naked for a while - nothing major. But suddenly I lost control: In order to cool meat (and other food) I placed a fridge thingy in the wall, powered by my battery which is connected to the huge solar panel in the middle of the colony. It worked fine for days until suddenly the battery decided to blow up. Usually not a huge issue but the blast killed the dude sleeping next to it (he often had mental break downs so I placed his bed in the small room next to the battery).Now, because I like to live cheap I build most of my stuff with wood. Explosion + wood is not so good, as you probably know. So suddenly half my colony was burning to the ground while my other three colonists were sleeping peacefully in the only steel building I ever build.When they woke up in the morning the fire was gone - but so was my battery, solar panel, all of my supplies, workbenches and even my crops. ""Thank god I still have some potatos."" I thought. So I started some repairs and decided to bury that one guy who was sleeping next to the battery. The next day I get a message ""Heatwave incoming."". Now, because I had no steel left from the repairs I could not build the fridge thingy again and as a result my colonists had to work at ~55°C. Didn't take long until my best dude fainted. Then the other one. Followed by the elderly lady (who is the only one in that shi t hole who knows how to plant potatoes). One after another died - my precious work of was destroyed in a matter of minutes. If that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battery didn't blow up I could have saved everyone from the heat by putting them in my cooled storage room. But god wasn't on my side this time.Great.			"

								This game is amazing, i pieced this story together from my characters backstories. 3 people crashlanded on a unknown planet codenamed ""Italia"", these three were members of a military organization and were travelling on the same ship. Dmitri (male) the Mech War Veteran, it states that he fought in the great Mech War that recently ended (the ship was probably returing after the war). Dmitri was a soldier that fought in the frontlines in the 2nd Mech War, during his childhood he lost his entire family in the 1st Mech War (its called the mech war since it was robots against humans from what i can understand), this left him socially scarred, he didnt want to bond with anyone since they might die.Kim aka ""Kimmy"" (female) was the ships Doctor, she patched up the soldiers onboard this unknown militarry warship, she probably patched Dmitri up a few times but never caught his name, she was a ace student that was top of her class before joining the Research and Health Department of the Military Corp. (not much else is know about her).Ana (female) was one of the ships cooks aboard this unknown military warship before it crashed, her brother was also aboard the ship as a military engineer. she was an art student during her childhood and was born into a noble and wealthy family, it is unknown why she chose to be a cook, especially a military cook, but she too will share the same fate as these Dmitri and Kimmy.StrandedDay 1 The three woke up in wreckages of escape pods next to each other, they were surronded by money and steel and survival food packages, they quickly regrouped and Dmitri collected the the stuff and lead them into a destroyed alien ruin, there they spent the night sleeping on the floor.Day 2 The three started building up the ruins, patching up holes in the roof, building outwards with wood, they even managed to a bed room that they all shared, they spent the entire day building a bedroom and beds then sleeptDay 3 The three woke up and ate and started constructing a dining room aswell as a butchers room since Dmitri knew that they needed one.Day 4 Dmitri woke up early in the morning from nightmares from the 1st Mech war, he was restless so he went out hunting and shooting animals, he brought home a deer like looking creature, the three ate this deer.They lived like this for 4 more days before something happened...Day 8 While Dmitri was out hunting he spotted another man, he quickly ran to him and he introduced him self, his name was Vandeim and was the ships engineer and brother to Ana, he joined the crew and even created electricity, he made solar panels and wind turbines as well as batteries.Day 9 Kimmy started constructing a infirmary since she was scared Dmitri would wound himself.A few more days passed by...Day 17 Dmitri brought home another man while he was out hunting, it was Colten Volt aka Colt, Colt was one the ships pilots and confirmed that no other survived the crash since he traveled half the planet searching for us.Day 19 A band of native tribes started raiding the ""colony"" but it proved no match against Dmitri and Colts fire power, sticks and stones doesnt beat fire and steel.Day 27 A native was captured her name was Jude, Vadeim started educating her and learning her language.Day 31 Jude joins the merry band of survivors.Day 35 Jude and Vandeim marrys.For the past few months the survivors lived happily and propspred, they built into the mountains the ruins they where in, they built a farm in front of the ruins, they built a pool table where Dmitri, Vandeim and Colt spent their days, they built seperate rooms for everyone, thay had truly come far...Day 112 A man named Antonio was running away from a band of pirates, Dmitri took up arms and rushed out to protect him, he slauthered the pirates and the survivors fled and vowed to return... Antonio was apparently a Survivor of another crash, according to his backstory he was an explorer.Day 121/122 It seemed that pirates wouldnt return but they did... they returned and brought death and destruction with them, they built mortars behind the mountains and started besigeing the make shift base of operations inside the northern mountain, Vandeim, Colton, Jude and Dmitri went out to fight them... The fight was bloody and long, the battle lasted the entire night, the pirates all died but Vandeim was severly injured, Dmitri grapped him, and carried him to the infimrary.Day 124 Vandeim died from his injuries...Day 125 The colony is mourning and it hit Dmitri hardest, his memories of his childhood and the war returns...Day 128 While out hunting Dmitri froze and that nearly cost Colt his life.Day 131 Dmitri looks very bad... he stopped talking to the others...Day 135 Kimmy tried to calm Dmitri but he became angry and injured her. Antonio and Colt where forced to calm him down.Day 139 It looks very bad for Dmitri, he is getting worse and worse...As time passes more and more pirates and tribes started to raid and attack the survivors, Dmitri fights them off valiently and screames ""die you scum... THIS IS FOR VANDEIM!"".Day 157 Communications are up and Antonio has taken over as Engineer.As time passes the survivors start getting used to live this life, and accepts its not that bad, Dmitri gets worse and worse, and to stablize it he drinks and sleeps in the days... The only time he leaves his bed is to hunt or kill raiders. Hopefully the mood will improve amongst the surviviors. (this is how far i have come)This game is beautiful and very detailed, the start is harsh and fun, its randomized so its diffirent everytime, i would recommend this game to people that like survival games, management or strategy. If you like games like Prison Architect or Banish or Factorio or games like that then this is definetly for you!This game is in Alpha yet it is more complete then ever...			"

								Pavel Shal, a lone Orassan female only age sixteen has accidently ejected herself from the mothership during a game of hide and seek. Looks like the children will never find her. Landing on an unknown world she is forced to endure trials as she builds her base within an old pre-industrial ruin found in the side of a rock formation by the sea. At first it was peaceful, there was nothing to fear. Traders came, she freed two men from slavery, built a barracks and a hospital as they gathered supplies. But then came the Federation Remnants - Coming crashing down through the roof of her very home and began blasting everyone. Only Pavel and Limu servived, Garry was dead, they didn't even leave a body behind. By the end of the skirmish Limu was in critical condition and one of Pavel tamed arctic wolves were killed, while Garry's body was gone. While the Federation had lost due to her using their weapons against them, they were ill prepared. Their next meeting on the battle field, may be their last.I freakin' love this game man! So many mods to play with, debugging menu is even better. Starting large raids on small settlements and trying to see if you can get them to survive. Can't even mention the Zombie mod. Thought you were done killing all those tribes men and federation officers? No, you're wrong. Here they come, screaming like wild animals!I recommond this to any friend that loves base-building, supply running, tactics and above all Survival. As long as the content grows, I believe this game will grow. Though I wish you could start a community up directly next to another already made. Starting next to a pirate base in the same region, would be hilarious. Or have a choice to expand and start multiple settlements under the name of one colony, in various regions; even invading other colonies/tribes/etc.			"

								Although I doubt this game needs any more positive praise, I couldn't resist spreading the word just a little further. For those of you who adore games in the same vein as Age of Empires, Prison Architect and Dwarf Fortress, stick this on your wishlist.One particular event that stands out in my mind was the tale of Barry. Barry was a colonist who needed rescue early into the development of my settlement, and by coincidence he was the brother of an existing settler - how could I say no? But Barry, Barry was a nightmare. He hated everybody, caused fights, was greedy and spoilt, to the point that only a huge house of his own would sate him and keep his distance from the others, who spent most of their hours working to survive, while Barry wasted time on tantrums and alcohol.Then, a season down the line, Barry's sister was shot through the lung. Without good medical facilities, she was going to die, while Barry, the turd, would survive. Needless to say, anger took hold, and the next time Barry started a fight, I refused to tell my settlers to put their guns away.One dead Barry and a transplanted lung later, and everybody carried on happily as if nothing had happened. Even a Barry can have their uses on the Rim.Deeply challenging AI, sporadic and captivating story events and a character system that is just as frustrating as it is fulfilling, this game just burns the hours away.

								I always wanted to play Dwarf Fortress but could never be bothered to learn the crazy and arcane interface. Rimworld allows me to play this emergent simulation style of game without having the UI getting in the way, and the end product is compelling. It's relaxing watching your colonists going about their jobs and interacting, slowly building up your facility. It's not so relaxing when your colonist has a mental break because of a squirrel bite and ends up shooting the doctor and setting fire to the stores.			"

I have been playing this one on and off for about 4 months now and I am still learning new stuff. I feel like this is the start of new standard for gaming and I hope so because the depth of this game systems is far past 99 percent of anything else out there and I am getting spoiled real quick.Purchase and enjoy.9/10			"

What's more is, there's a dedicated developer behind this game, the community's well-established, and Rimworld itself has been in Early Access for supposedly three years with the polish of a post-EA game.If I had to describe the game to somebody, I'd say it's SimCity meets The Sims on steroids, with some healthy inspiration from Firefly and The Walking Dead. The graphics aren't anything special (apparently the models were bought from the devs over at Prison Architect), but the finer details - the management of practically everything in game - is as astonishing as it is complex. The way characters interact with one another, and the world they live in, from hunting to gathering to defending to building to socialising, is a micro-manager's wet dream.There's perma-death, if you're into things like that, to up the stakes; and three ""story-tellers"" with differing mechanics, which randomly (within the settings you establish pre-colony and sometimes mid-play) generate events for you to interact with. There's a wide variety of play-styles, from hunter-gatherer, lone star, to three mid-tech-level strandeds in a Castaway setting.But it's the game's longevity, combined with immense replay value, which affect me the most: The longer you play with the same colony and community of people, the more you get to know them, the more their stories unravel, and the harder it hits when something happens to them, or to all of them. You play more to find out more and risk more at the same time, never knowing what might or might not happen, AND THAT is why I keep coming back to play it.			"

								Amazing game wich is really not nice to you.Story:Simon was a surviver who crash landed with Elina and Marcus, Marcus was Simons little brother.This strange area was luckely warm and plesant, lots of trees to build a new home and lots of animals to feed them, they used most of the days by building and collecting resources. A nice warm morning a new survivor showed up, a pretty girl who wanted to join the colony. Perfect timing because its is hard work to build a new colony with only 3 people, they needed the help.they welcomed Julia to the colony with a party and a feast in the kitchen that night, we started bonding very quick, it was a good evening. But no one would have expected that raiders was coming the next morning to attack.We all gathered quick to try and protect our new home, Marcus picked up a gun and started shooting! But to late did he see Simon crossing in front of him and accidentally shot him in the back of the neck. He died instantly by brain shoot. Marcus had just killed his big brother and went crazy, dropped everything and just walked around in a trance.Julia and Elina got the raiders away after long fightings, all was wounded expect for Marcus who was wandering around, because of his very traumatic experiance he went crazy and one night attacked Elina, he stabbed her and sadly she died that night by her injuries.There was nothing else i could do than go to Marcus sick bed after and killing him in his sleep.Me Julia is now the only one left and i can hear the raiders are comming. i will say my goodbyes and share my friends short sad story, and hope you who find this story will do better. bye to all and thanks for reading.RECOMMENDED :-D			"

								Rimworld is both frustrating and fascinating.  I start with the 3 colonist, and currently play on the ""rough"" setting.  I can't make it past 40 to 50 in-game days.... yet.  I'm challenged by raiders, man hunting animals, thunder, electrical explosions, starvation, diseases, mentally broken settlers, hypothermia, and the list goes on and on.  In addition to the threats, and perhaps a bigger challenge, the work load of each settler must be carefully balanced or I risk having too many important task ignored.Here are a few tips and things I have learned that may help a complete newbie:1) A single settler with a knife should not be hunting boar by themselves.2) Make sure you roll settlers of whom at least one has a high skill in mining, growing, cooking, and/or research.  Both cooking and crop farming require a higher skill for some production.3) You want a good miner, because I recommend choosing a mountainous area and burrowing into the rock for shelter.4) Settle near a geyser for eventual geothermal power, but for now skip the solar and just build a fuel powered generator.5) Build walls around all of your areas where power is either generated, or used.  Keep powered appliances seperate from the living areas.  When fire erupts (and it will), The walls will keep the initial explosion contained.6) Firefoam poppers- BUILD THEM.7) Be careful not to choose settlers that lack basic skills such as firefighting or dumb labor.  If you do choose one, make sure the skill you are choosing them for is worth the trade off.8) Automated turrets are great for fighting raiders, but expect that they will break down often.  9) I perfer to melee all combat situations.  Shooting is a pain right now in this game.  If you choose to use a gun or bow, you must first send the settler to stand closer to the target if you want to be accurate.10) If a potential prisoner doesn't have any skills that will signifigantly help you, don't bother capturing them..... unless you want to wait for a slave trader to come buy them.There is a lot more I could think of, but thats just a few things off the top of my head.  This game rocks, it's a lot of fun.  Buy it if you like survival and resource management, you will not regret it.			"

								This game is perhaps the second greatest basebuilding RTS in excistance. The only thing that comes close to match it is Dwarf Fortress, however Rimworld's UI is much more friendly, and many of the different features are a bit more simplified. I bought this 2 weeks ago, and have not been able to put it down. The little stories it creates with your colonists, and the challenge that it presents is amazing. If you love base building rts style games like Dwarf Fortress, but don't like ASCII buy this now.			"

								I love this game, although anymore I play it with a lot of mods to add more content.  There's a lot about the game that you can tweak yourself too, similar to Xcom 2 it's pretty easy since all you have to do is edit some text files.  I would also say it's generally easier to understand than the Xcom 2 files too.  A lot of content for the base game is still coming and is released on a fairly regular basis.  I can say that because I've had the game for a long time before it was on Steam.  I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes Dwarf Fortress or Stonehearth.  The game can be something of a time sink, but you can definitely have a lot of fun with it without ever escaping the planet.			"

								So it starts off and your little band of randomized colonists crashland on a space-wild-west-frontier Rimworld, with few supplies and lots of problems. And you as they player plan out how these plucky colonists are going to try to survive. Different colonists have different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Exploit them, and have them each prioritize the work that they are best at to get everything done around the colony. Someone's gotta sow and reap crops. Someone's gotta hunt for meat and leather, and others have to cook, or tailor parkas for winter weather out of that leather. And when the enraged beasts come, or the pirate raiders & slavers come, somebody's gotta shoot them dead.    Build a sick colony and hope your colonists prosper. Hope they don't become addicted to drugs, or terribly depressed, or maimed and wounded and sick. Let them bond with their pets, let them marry each other and learn true joy and live in a beautiful place filled with art and billiards tables. And watch in horror as everything you built is crushed by the unforgiving Rimworld they live on. And then pick yourself back up, start a new colony, and do better next time. Don't let them starve. Prepare for winter. Have a plan that'll kill the raiders.    It's addictive as heck.			"

								vs Minecraft: I just enjoy managing and building a base in the third person way more. There are incredibly more complicated and detailed gameplay you can accomplish with this camera shift and I love the increased depth.vs Factorio: The conveyor belt sim is mechanically deeper with a narrower focus, but Rimworld brings better theme, story progression, and broader gameplay experiences.vs Stardew Valley: Stardew is cute and loveable. RimWorld is nerdy and brutal (in a good way). Both are excellent games in two different subgenres.vs The Sims: I actually really enjoy the Maxis game. Rimworld is a more combat focused and survival themed simulation, built by nerds, so everyone gets cool guns. But I still care about social relations, food, and the decor of my building.on Difficulty complaints: There are gameplay mechanisms that address all the review complains I've seen. However, there is no tutorial nor easy way to discover them. For example, intelligent resource hauling can be managed with clever programming of the work priorities, but no one will ever tell you this.			"

								I only learned about this game a few days before Steam release. I watched a few youtube videos of others playing to learn the controls and basic fundamentals. I absolutely adored the concept and idea behind this game, and I have to say I am not disappointed.I love all the weird, sad, funny, violent, silly things that can happen to your colonists. I like how it is down to a more personel  level of play, being able to get to know each and every member of your little community. I've played many other games like this before, but really none of them I can say equal it in enjoyment.You'll get to love and hate your little pixel guys and girls. I purchased the game and in one day I had a 14 hour marathon. If that doesn't say how much I like it, nothing else can.100 hours played mark update: Yep, still love this game. And with mods, particularly things like Aparello, it gets kicked up to a new level of awesome. I am officially declaring this the best game on Steam.			"

								Year 12.  While hunting a wild boar, Sabine is gored in the torso.  This becomes infected.  After weeks of struggle and being a burden to the team, she dies.  Later, a starving crewmember gnaws on her frozen body, then goes on a berzerk rampage in which he kills the third crewmember in her sleep.His toes are infected and he has frostbite.  In the midst of his starving madness he's attacked by three bandits.  In desperation he blows a hole in the wall of an ancient building and giant insects come pouring out, killing the bandits.He later succumbs to his infection, and dies face down in the snow.  The base, now abandoned starts to deteriorate.  Raiders and vandals come, fires break out.  There is little left but a shell, metal debris and bones.  The walls and floors are spattered with blood.  Some time later, a lone spacer running from pirates finds the place and takes refuse.  Laying on the floor she finds the grenade satchel left by the murdered engineer.  She runs to the door and waits - and when the pirates arrive she throws the grenade at the door - blowing it open and killing two of them.  The third runs off in a panic.She strips the pirates looking for anything valuable, and heads to the back of the abandoned outpost.  Claiming one small storage room as her own, she sets up a desk, bed and candle - cleans the floors and repairs the door.  Fast forward 6 months.  She sports a peg leg from where her leg was shot off by friendly fire.   Her two main fighters are both snipers.  One of them got his ear shot off, the other one has a facial scar from a fight with a raging elephant, incredible as that might sound.  The doctor just finished cutting off the cook's toes to stop an infection from frostbite.   His wife has a shattered jaw, and can no longer speak.  Solar panels are up and working, and the radio is online.  Time to find out who else is out there, and what their angle is.10/10 - Would desperately hang on for my dear life again.			"

								So after playing this game for quite some time now I decided I should write a review for it aswell, so here we go:In Rimworld you are controlling a small group of persons on a hostile plannet and your goal is it to greate a working settlement. The game will increase the difficulty over time, so you better waste not to much time.The Style is very nice in my eyes, but If your looking for HD hyperrealistic Textures this may not be the game for you.The game is often compared to Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architekt and it certainly can hold its ground against these great games.The game offfers a variety of diffrent Difficultys, so everyone can have Funn and its not gonna get boring because of a lack of challange. The Developers are adding an amazingly big amount of new stuff with every Update, and so far I never encountered a single bug or crash. (no hammering ALT F4 after killing my own mans by accident does not count here)There is a quite active Modding Community, with several diffrent Mods you can pick (the Lovecraftian Horror stuff could be worth a look for example)The Music is great and did not manage to go on my nerves so far.Just be warned, this is a game with many things to keep track of and you will fail often before you can build a working settlement. But it never feels like the Game is cheating you. (In the worst case hammer down ALT F4 if something unexpected happens and you are a whinny coward like me)One thing I wanna mention is the Humor of the game, it ma not be obvious at first but this is quite a commedy heavy game but in a very morbid and dark way.My personal Higliths are things like my Doctor getting utterly drunk before an operation and aputating the wrong leg, or things like giving shelter to someone who was chased by some tribals including his own Grandma.If you wanna see some gameplay I got some (oudated) Videos where you can see me utterly failing at building a good settelment:

								RimWorld is one of the best simulation games I've ever played on internet. You can choose between three scenarios and three AIs which allows A LOT of replay value. The AI is always throwing at you different events (positive and negative) which keeps you on your toes. It's one of those ""Let Me Play Another 5 Minutes"".It's one of the deepest games I've ever played in terms of simulation (take for example the electricity wiring). There is a lot of things to build, to craft and to do. Most of the times you don't have enough survivors to complete your To Do list, which is the whole point of this game: micro-management.I still think there is a lot more that can be added to Rimworld, but the dev made a super good (see those two adjectives? It means it's that great) job of this game. Although it's written EA, it's already a fully playable game which I strongly suggest for gamers who like games such as Prison Architect and  simulation / micro-management genres.There are a few Cons though. Even though you have a Learning Helper that shows you how to use your controls (you cannot tell your survivors what to do, they decide based on the priorities you've given them), it's quite difficult to assimilate everything in one go. Expect to be doing a lot of errors in the beginning (which is part of learning to play a game) and to go through several trials and errors. Guides found on Reddit / Steam and any other place will turn out to be quite helpful. Rimworld even has it's own proper wiki. When everything will have settled down, the real fun will begin!ALSO: It'd be awesome to add Steam Achievements, there are a lot of ways this could be implemented. I forgot to add that the Steam Workshop is worth a look. The modders in this community are insanely creative :)			"

								The trailers and screenshots of this game do not fully do it justice. What follows after the review is my experience with my first full game.The game is played very similarly to games like ""prison architect"" where the majority of your time is spent building infrastructure and economy with only minimal control over your autonomous denizens, only it adds multiple layers on top of the formula. The game is part base builder, part ""sim city"", part ""the sims"", and part ""factorio"" to compare to other games. Failing at any aspect of this game (villager happiness, resource management/logistics/crafting, combat, infrastructure) will end in the death of your settlement. Life holds on by such a thin thread that you might even say it's part roguelite. Add on top the concept of a ""digital AI storyteller"". Instead of the game throwing random disasters at your efforts, you choose a type of story teller that will progress your story with various events. These events are everything from visits from other villages, space ship parts falling from the sky, wanderers who join your village, to complete disasters. My experience:My three villagers landed on the planet, and were able to quickly build a small functioning village. Despite a few easily put down raids life was good. There was potatos, rice, fresh turkies, and hobbs was a gourmet chef. One day Eryl noticed a steel wall and felt it was dangerous, thanks for the heads up Eryl! As the fledgling colony grew so did its power requirements, and the villagers ran out of steel building a powerline to the freshly constructed walk in freezer. Well, there wasn't much steel on the map, but that ominous steel wall had plenty. The villages were dressed like cowboys, high on smokeleaf joints, and had an assortment of guns and maces, what's the worst that could happen? Senthia went down to the steel wall to deconstruct a chunk VWORP VWORP, immediately exposed and enabled were three ancient war robots. First they killed Senthia, then they started making their way to the village. The bullets fired on them did no good and were no match.  As the villagers fall one by one, a pirate raid happens at the same time. The pirates rush in with torches to set the village ablaze until they see the ancient robots. The ancient robots kill one of the pirates and the rest of the pirates flee. The village is in flames, the villagers scattered on the ground. The game ends with robots destroying every chunk of the settlement chunk by chunk.This game is amazing. 10/10. Would suffer sci-fi apacolypse again.			"

								What a gem amongst the Early Access. Been playing long before its stream arrival... And NO this is not a Prison Architect clone (that however is also a good game check it out). Think more Dwarf Fortress.Build a colony after crash landing on a planet, with very limited provisions, AND SURVIVE. Theres so many aspects to this game - base building, tower defence, resource management, exploration... I'm really underselling it here, theres really not enough room to go into all the little intracacies and nuances that make this such a fabulous game. Some of the things your colonists will get up to will either make you cry or wet yourself laughing... like when Bob couldn't get any more luciferium so took it out on the other colonists by murdering them in their sleep and then going on a rampage against nature.... in the nude.. before getting mauled by a bear.*QUICK EDIT*I also forgot to mention the brilliant soundtrack - ear candy.

The ways that you can build your Colony('s)/Base('s) is endless, weather you want to tunnle into Mountains like Dwarves or build a Village surounded by walls.

Rimworld is just for you!Do you like spending 20 minutes on a game just to find it was actually 4 days and you're not employed anymore? GET THIS!Do you feel like games are too easy? Go for Randy random extreme, you'll think otherwise.But for real, this is one of the best designed, full of new ideas game I've played since Black & White. If you don't know B&W, go download WinXP, install it, get B&W, play it for 4 weeks, get back here, and GET RIMWORLD. Yo, this game is worth $120, it's like two AAA games. AND! It's still evolving. And there's *really* good mods for it. And it's so damn well designed. Jeez.Btw, for those wondering, my play time does not include beta access while the game was off steam - I played weeks more of it, trust me. It's 100%, totally worth every penny and twice more, easily.			"

An amateur's review of Rimworld      RimWorld is one of those games that can treat you right one moment then sucker punch you the next - but what makes it so good for me is that it doesn't always. It has three storytellers with their own pattern, and those each have their own difficulty. If you want casual play, there's Phoebe Chillax on Basebuilder difficulty; mistakes are easy to recover from. Or you can also choose Randy Random on Extreme Permadeath for a real challenge - What happens is random and once it's done, it's done. Good luck surviving a huge raid on day 3. RimWorld gives a rather strong range of control of challenge right from the start.     The real fun is in the gameplay. You manage a colony (or a tribe) of 1-5 colonists, or pawns, and are tasked with their survival and the ultimate goal of building a ship to leave the planet. Defend them from raiders, killer robots, insect infestations, blights, eachother, and yourself. (We all get fed up with that one pawn eventually.) These pawns each have different traits, skills, and backstories that change how they function, like nudists, psychopaths, optimists, medieval lords, medieval slaves. Injuries also play a big role. A sick colonist will have to spend time in bed recovering or risk death, and a colonist can have their hand, arm, head (yikes!), organs, and more removed and that will affect them adversely. (Who needs a head anyway?) Not to mention that where you choose to build will affect growing seasons, clothes needed to survive, and diseases.    One final feature of RimWorld is the modding scene, and it is huge. A large variety of mods exist on the Steam Workshop and are a click or two away from being in your game, and even more unique mods await you in the Ludeon forums. Just like games like Skyrim, mods can make you spend yet another day managing those wacky pawns. The developer is also active and still polishing and adding more to the game, pushing it bit by bit to its final, grand form.Final Thoughts     I didn't expect to love RimWorld as much as I did, and it was a bit of a hesitant buy. However, I fell in love with the game. I struggled to build my first functional colony. I waited on edge to see if my pawn would recover from disease. I felt unease from my first ancient danger. I swore when my pawn kept missing an easy shot. Every colony is a rollercoaster of emotions, and I love every second of it.			"

								Kyle wasn't having a very good day, well make that life.He crashed in the desert with 2 female companions. Kyle was never in a very good mood either. He was always being pessimistic, but he had low expectations so that was ok. One of the girls that landed with Kyle, Eu, caught his fancy.But Eu kept turning Kyle down... Kyle's rage built inside him.  He decided instead to friend one of the huskies native to the area. The husky was a good companion, but lacked the kind of affection and physical touch that Kyle longed for. Kyle continued to pursue Eu, but she kept saying no.One day a traveller from far away asked if he could stay and the group decided one more set of hands couln't hurt at all. Palt was a good man, he came naked with no tools or food, but he was a hard worker. Palt and Kyle became good friends. A few weeks later a group of jerks attacked the complex and Palt was tragically maimed and killed. Kyle buried Palt himself. Later that week Kyle's dog also died. Kyle was taking this especially hard.Perhaps it was love, but it was more than likely out of sympathy Eu finally decided maybe Kyle deserved a chance. Kyle and Eu were enamored with each other. Many other folks joined the group and now there were 6 of them. Kyle decided to propose and Eu said yes!Later that month another group of raiders came and Eu was killed while standing next to Kyle near a mining quarry while they defended the complex. Again Kyle buried her himself. Kyle was struggling to cope really. One day while Kyle was mining the stains of blood on the ground next to the mine Kyle lost it. He had had enough and he went into a psychotic rage, Kyle began shooting every person in the complex. He killed everyone and with the dogs the group had adopted attacking Kyle he finally had his peace.			"

Early Access Review
								I started building my base in a forest biome. Easy access to wood made it simple to get a proper base up and running. Each person had their own room. The colony mood was good and my traps had finished off lots of raiders so I had a good inventory of guns. When winter came a pack of boomalope manhunters attacked my settlement and even though I finished them off easily the explosions set fire to the part of my base where I had my batteries. The fire made the batteries explode in a chain reaction spreading the fire further and killing people in sickbeds on the inside. Once the fire was out there were massive holes in the base, I had no source of eletricity since the fires also destroyed the solar panels and only two of my settlers were still standing. One of them was hurt and went to the sickbed. With the other settler I setup a campfire in his room and traded food and medicine with a trader but it wasnt enough. Hypothermia had already put the hurt settler into a dying state. When he passed away the last guy went to bed next to the fireplace and slowly died due to an infection spreading in his burned hands.This game is very similar to Dwarf Fortress so if you enjoyed Dwarf Fortress you will most likely like this game. There's a lot of mods on the workshop to alter the gameplay and updates are quite frequent. TL DRIt's a real time strategy/survival game that can be paused. It's a sci-fi themed game in 2D top down view. You will most likely fail every single time it's just a question of seeing your ""story"" come to an end.			"

								This tale begins with a small colony of three as they start building their base. Within the first 20 days of their perilous journey they recieve a notification that a lone woman is nearby running away from some pirates and is looking for protection. Not only that, but she is the mother of Alice (one of the three colonists!). The colonists gladly accept her plea and valiantly give her solace in the base while they manage to fend off the pirates with their shoddy weapons.Alice is sent to tend to her mothers wounds hoping her mother will join the colony. As her mother wakes up she is startled and begins to run away. Alice begins chasing after her mother desperatley trying to convince her to stop but with no avail. In a last desperate effort to stop her mother from running away Alice attempts to arrest her mother and bring her back to the base. This breaks out into a fight and now Alice is fighting her mother with her bare hands. They exchange punches but Alice gets the better of her mother and gives her one last punch which ends up destroying Alice's middle finger. Her mother lies there...dead.Alice now finds it difficult to do any tasks which require her to use her hands... every time she does... she is reminded of the horrific tale which destroyed her finger.10/10 - would send Alice to arrest mother again.

								This is the fastest 100h in game I've ever got.At first I wasn't sure if I'm going to like this kind of game. I'm not a strategy or management gamer. I wondered so long, watched some streams and still wasn't sure. Then I just bought it and despite all the doubt I had, it was the best purchase I could ever make.Now what I love this game for:First of all - everything is random. Every event (there's good amount of them) can happen at every second of your playthrough, which creates hundreds of different possibilities and even after playing a while you still might be surprised. These events further create different problems you encounter - from starvation, diseases and raids to freezing to death or simply your colonists fighting against each other, cutting their legs off and not being able to harvest that rice from a field and that's only the top of the iceberg.You also have to take care of your colonists needs, which can be a tricky thing early on, depending on a nature of each one of them. Like I said - there's a ton of things to do and you can set everything the way you like - It's kind of a sandbox, where you play the way you enjoy the most.The best thing is that it's early access. The game is pretty much completed at this stage, but it will still get couple (?) more updates adding more to already big Rimworld. There's also even better thing than early access: There's a fantastic modding community and it literally can change your game a little or make it brand new game: Lots of overhauls or simple mods and it's still growing. This adds another hundreds of hours to play and trust me you're going to spend at least dozen of them learning the game.Later on, when you know a bit about the game it gets much easier with a bit of luck in your random playthough, but still you can set the game pretty much the way you like and still create a challenge for yourself.Well, this review got quite chaotic, but it's hard to explain the possibilities you get playing this so basically to summarize:Rimworld in current state (EA) - 100h+, then whenever it gets an update - probably another 100h+ and last but not least: Mods - 1000h (?)Worth every cent and if you enjoy this, you should try free Dwarf Fortress, which is way more complex game.Good luck and may Randy be merciful for you :)			"

								I started out with 3 ship survivors. Spider, my chef and construction worker, Lumi, my hunter, and Carry, my paramedic. A monkey names Angus also came with them. Life was good for a time. Everyone was happy, a raid came from time to time with little to no affect on colony. A nurse called Dawson comes, who hates violence. Another adventurer comes, (can't remember his name, we'll just call him Bill) being chased by pirates. I fight them off easily with no casualties on my side. Bill, it turns out, was not worth it. He was totally worthless in everything. But that didn't matter, I already had a colony with 4 good pawns and a monkey, so I was good.Boy was I wrong.Eventually a raid comes, with 3 pirates. But what is one of them holding? What do I spy in one of their hands? A mother ♥♥♥♥ing molotov. I sent 4 of my pawns to stand ready to go and fight them (Dawson was just doing his own thing). We kill 2 of  the pirates before they know what hit them, but who survives? The mother ♥♥♥♥ing guy with the molotovs. He snuck up behind Bill and set fire to everything. Bill was set on fire, Dawson too, all of my colonists were set in flames. Molotov man decides this is enough and heads off. Carney stops, drops and rolls and rescues everyone but Lumi and Argus, who go with the flames. All because of motha♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Bill. But fate decided ""Ya know what, lets just keep being a ♥♥♥♥♥ to this guy"" so another pirate raid comes by. Luckily with no molotovs. Spider, who is bedridden, also decides to go insane at this time and to eat anyone she sees. The fight was intense, but we won in the end, and are still thriving.But pirates burned my god damn monkey.11/10 would hate Bill again. "

								One of the best early access games I've ever played. This game has kept my attention for over 140 hours so far, and I plan on sinking a lot more into it. Absolutely addicting and well worth the price. There are so many different ways this game can play out due to the variation of colonist skills and personalities, game type, starting biome, and a bunch of other things. The mods are top notch and the community are very helpful. A small story from my game: Decided to accept a pyromaniac with a very low breaking point and no skills to speak of into my colony - spent a while basically guarding her whilst she kept starting fires around my home place. After a while, I felt I had enough of her and locked her in a room with utterly nothing to her name (I had even taken the clothes off her back) and let her starve to death. I forgot to look at the colonist relationship screen before I did this. Turns out, she was the daughter of one of my hard-working colonists. The mother falls into a deep depression and can barely do any work before she breaks and binges on beer. She passes out and wakes up with a mammoth hangover, thus making her mood worse and breaking again. It decended into a vicious cycle, and I could no longer keep beer in my stockpile. The mother eventually recovered somewhat... but I didn't. I felt utterly awful, and now I try not to take in people who are mental and/or have a severe lack of skills, and check the relationships tab before I... uh.. ""let go"" of colonists.10/10, will be playing for at least another 140 hours.			"

Rimworld: Mastering the art of getting screwed over big time by either yourself or the storyteller-AI. Or as the community likes to put it: Losing is fun.Oh the drama, oh the suspense! One wouldn't necessarily expect that from a scifi colony simulator, but it's all (over-)delivered. Due to their behavior and individual quirks, your pawns easily become more than moving spreadsheets with a bubbly avatar (No feet or hands, adorable potato-people!). I guarantee you will experience SOME sort of story when you pick up this game: It could be a soap-opera with pillaging space-pirates or something explicitly more dark than getting afraid that your stocked up food will last through the winter. -One of my first colonists was mauled to death by a hungry bear, because she was wandering around in the wilderness -naked, during a blizzard- in a psychotic haze that was triggered by her former lover cheating on her... And I was actually quite upset, a lot more than any given time a colonist died in Banished (which is an awesome game aswell, don't get me wrong). Not to mention the feeling of accomplishment once you launch your finished spaceship and reach the ending screen with credits-Even though it is a lot more about the journey than the take-off, admittedly.5 difficulty settings, 3 so-called ""storytellers"" and editable aswell as creatable scenarios offer a custom-tailored experience catering to (almost?) everybody. The new tutorial makes the game much more accessible, but leaves out enough stuff for own discoveries of the nuanced mechanics.The game also features an elaborate drugs systems, but since an addiction-mechanic is present and intoxication comes with side-effects, I cannot see it as ""glorifying"" drug use in any way. ...Looking at the sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad events unfolding during or after a binge, it might be even realistic in a simplified way... A huge plus for this pre-release is the lead developer Tynan Sylvester being very active in, and engaging with the community (on reddit, too). It happened more than once, that a former mod-only mechanic was implemented into the core game. So, indeed a game the community helps to develop :)All in all I can recommend this game very much! 10/10			"

								I have played this game from way before the steam release, it is the greatest game ever and even better if your a cold hearted♥♥♥♥♥who will kill his 15 cats to feed that guy on a food binge I once had a colony where everything was perfect and somehow everyone started re!ationships with each other and I was like ""great that will be good for social"" until after 2 days of no progression I realized the only thing anyone ever did was **** each other and then a day later a raid came by and I found that 4 of my 5 colonists were incapable of violence against a 7 person raid, I had no gun turrets and no defences, I was using a self made mod that allowed anyone coming to the colony to join if they felt our place was better, half of their team joined us and slaughtered their friends for me, 3 days later no more progress once again, the new recruits have joined the sex fest, 7 days of watching horny AIs running around doing nothing one had a mental break and ended up burning the entire map to the ground . . . . . . people are not wrong when they say this is not a game for a tryhard because no matter what, your gonna die, also if your one of those sentimental people that get attached to fake animals and people, try doing a cannibal only colony you'll it (evil laugh)Alright alright I'll do an actual review for those people wanting oneRimworld is a colony simulator that has an AI story teller that unlike traditional games it calculates your situation and gives you an event based on that situation such as a raid, or trade group visit, it has many MANY traits and characteristics that tell what a character is good at and what their incapable of, thier is also a very in-depth social system that allows marriages, break ups, and even MURDER over simply being insulted, along side that their is THE MOST in-depth health system you will ever find, you can get cut , shot , infected , hurt , anywhere on the body, I once had my best colonist get his kidney shot, spine shattered, and both eyes GONE after a single unlucky raid, you can also take organs out of colonists and put them into another, missing a leg?, give them a peg leg or a prosthetic leg and if you got the money give them a bionic leg and they will be the fastest runner in the galaxy, and all those features without even mentioning the slightly more in depth combat system, it allows for colonists to duck around corners and shoot, sand bags and rubble can be used as cover and if the enemy is laying down their harder to hit, everything in a battle is calculated to where the shot hits, and if it even does, if your shooter is missing an eye they won't shoot as good as they did, give them a bionic eye and they'll be deadeyed, the game has an amazing building system that allows for beuty of the room they are in to affect colonists mood, give them a big room with slate tile completely clean and a few grand sculptures and they will love it, give them a 4x4 with rock rubble, steel ore walls and no floor, they might go on a murder spree over it.I have no idea if I missed anything but I assure you this game is the GREATEST thing you can buy, but I recommend going to their website and buying it because steam gets a massive cut and buying it from ludeons website gives them it all and helps further development making the game even more enjoyable.What are you waiting for STOPREADIN AND GET TO BUYINGstill reading are we?

								I spend three hours carefully crafting the perfect set of six psychotic colonists. Two of them died when they crash landed, and another two suffered extreme injuries. Well, I have to make do with what I have now. I begin by finding a nice valley and nudge them to settle in it. Easily defendable, good resources, even some local wildlife to keep them fed. One of the injured colonists dies on his way there. Oh well. I'm not even five minutes into the game, and three of my six colonists are dead. I'm left with my cannibal Chef, cyborg Engineer, and extremely bloodthirsty Mercenary. This should be fun.Time goes on; they start carving into the mountain and making an underground base. Before long, a visitor from one of the other settlements comes by! Big mistake. The Mercenary immediately sets out for her. She realizes he doesn't look friendly and tries to run away, but he shoots her in the legs. She helplessly tries to crawl away as he approaches and butchers her. Poor girl. Before long the Chef has come and collected her body and made tonight's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast. Time passes, and they recruit a few more psychos to their group, slowly form a Prison, and start selling organs and slaves to traders. All was well...until a massive flash storm struck in the middle of the night. Too hot and spreading too fast, they were trapped inside their mountain as the fire roared towards them. My entire colony is burning as I sit there and watch them desperately try to extinguish the flames.*Save and quit to Main Menu**New Colony*I backed this game a little over two years ago. It's progressed so well since then. The scenario above is just one way to play this game. Do you want to run a psychotic prison colony that sells it's prisoner's organs? Or maybe you want to start a small animal ranch and make peace with the surrounding settlements? Perhaps, you just want to be an old miner living the rest of his days deep inside a mountain? It's completely up to the player how they play. When creating your colony, you are given the choice (without mods) of three different AI story-tellers and starting scenarios. Each of them chooses how they trigger events differently. Cassandra slowly ramps up the difficulty over time, starting with a crazy squirrel or similar and ending with something like a raid of 20 bandits in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm. It's interesting. Phoebe is very easy going and tries not to harass you too much while you build up. Randy, however, rolls the dice constantly and is very random with his events. You can go hours without anything happening or five minutes of pure chaos. After you've chosen a storyteller, you create your world and decide where to settle. Each biome and area of the world have different temperatures and growing seasons, and the terrain varies as well. Flat land won't have much ore or hills, where as Mountainous is filled with both. This step is pretty simple.Finally, you get to roll your colonists. You can roll them as many times you want until you find a set you like and can start with them. Depending on which scenario you picked, you'll be given some different colonists that start with different gear and research. From here you start your story, and the rest is up to you.			"

A chapel is built specifically for the occassion The wedding night is upon us, and everyone gathers ALERT! Raiders are incoming! The bride, a skilled gun slinger, rushes off with the others to defend their home In a blur of gunfire and smoke, the bride takes a shotgun blow to the chest and is instantly DEAD! The dust settles and one of the raiders remains alive in the dirt, barely breathing The groom quietly walks up to the fallen raider and empties his gun, avenging his would-be wife I stare at my monitor and quietly exit the game - holy sh** what just happened?After only 20+ hours of gameplay, I thought this was just a basic build-n-survive type game. But you start to become attached to your survivors and then it becomes personal. Fiona (the bride) will not be forgotten!8/10 - No regrets buying this game. Will definitely play again!

								Not sure if im going to appropriately describe this game or not, I dont know anything about Dwarf Fortress (which is what alot of people compare it to)  but heres a shot :Great time burner. Reletively simple to get the grasp of the games basic mechanics down and expand on them to complex work orders when you get comfortable with it.The building and overall layout of the game is IMO highly related to how Prison Architect worked and felt.   Drag and place walls, objects, etc and your colonists will travel to zones or rooms you have determined for stockpiling resources to gather materials and bring them to the construction project. Allocate jobs as needed using a work order panel and your colonists will get to them as you determine priority for the task if other tasks are available. For me, what I felt was quite a hefty amount of Under-the-hood mechanics and status descriptions akin to that of NEO Scavenger for certain events or situations. Despite the lack of eye candy, dose the game justice by painting the situation in detail leaving the most detailed picture being one you form in your head.  From socializing to insults and fights, character ""profiles"", their needs and requirements and their health... all have descriptive status marks that despite making colonists look like little avatar graphics give them still alot of flesh to envision. I also love how it dose seem to have an endgame scenario of escaping the planet should you decide to go that route.  Whereas most survival games are just about you going and going and going, with the endgame being open ended wether you wanted it to be or not.  Weather events, seasonal conditions, raids, rabid animals, etc  all bring a sense of ""If this dosent happen, then THIS probably will"" to the paranoia of trying to keep your colonists healthy, comfortable and safe... else they'll loose their minds on one another.Plenty of mods as well to change the base game as you desire it, both in and outside of the steam workshop.

Game Gist --- Space western theme. Random planet. You get unit(s). Build a settlement. Manage your units' tasks. Gather resources. Survive. Gameplay: 9/10 ---  Good balanced game. It has a lot of options for difficulty. So, you can play a nice casual game, or an intense strategic game. There are also some options that somehwat affect the pacing of the game. So, you can play at a moderate pace, and focus more on base building. Or, you can play at a pace where you have to deal with more events occurring.There is a general progression to the game: Gather resources, build settlement, defend settlement. Despite that, each new game has potential for subtle differences in strategies mainly because the events and units you get are random.Learning Curve: Average ---  My first run was on an easier setting, and lasted 10 - 15 minutes before I restarted. My second run was about the same. I figured out the game mechanics (not necessarily strategy) by the third run.Graphics: 5/10 --- The game doesn't focus on visual. But, it is good enough to get you engaged in the world.Audio: 7/10 --- The music is nice, calm, and appropriate for the space western theme. Sound effects are cool--nothing special.Personal Note: I've seen a few people commenting about how the community sucks, and is full of ""fanbois"". I don't know much about that. But, this is a single-player game. So, the community may not be the biggest thing to factor in your purchase unless you care about forums.			"

								Well, I started good... I watched some tutorials and knew how to play the game. However a Chemical fire had spewed its contents onto my colony. Where almost everyone had died. I started over with the same process. In the end my colony was big as 1/4 of the map (in a mountain) but my colonits had ultimately died by the plague, hunger, volcanic winter, chemical spills, (DUMB) raiders (WHO KIDNAPPED MY COLONISTS), broken down machinery, diseases, and the average squrrel who manges to kill armed colonists... 10/10 best game ever (starting a new colony on easy now).

								Started Tribe game with 5 Settlers and 3 dogs, made a nice base in a mountain that I hollowed out, started collecting food for the winter and growing crops.Tamed a buck from within a herd of deer and went back and tried to tame a doe, it failed and they all became enraged charging straight for my camp, plowing through all of my people and dogs and either killing or incapacitating everyone in my group within seconds. They waited outside my base for days for the buck that had joined us to finally come out of the mountain to get food from the store room and then they mowed him down too. As everyone in the group lay on the floor bleeding out, a large group of raiders came towards my base, thinking that they could steal our stuff since no one was in the base... They were dead in seconds.			"

								I have played and loved this game since alpha 7 (thanks Sips!) There is so much drama around every corner! One moment you're building up your colony, the next you're in a full-fledged fire fight with some a-holes who don't know who they're messing with. And you grow so attached to your colonists; you learn their strengths and fears and they become part of your family... until they are lobotomized by a stray bullet fired from another colonist out hunting... I mean damn son, yell or something before you get hit.Final note - if someone loses a leg, be sure to install a peg leg on the CORRECT leg. No reason to amputate the other one accidentally and install a peg leg there. Rimworld is definitely worth every cent.			"

								Played the heck out of previous versions of this game.   Very happy that it has arrived on steam for you all to pick up and play.Over a year ago it was better than many 'released' games.  It's not perfect today, but the developer has been steadily improving it.   If you don't mind the game evolving and changing every few months and like the survival / base building kind of game do pick this one up.   As a gamer I don't like early access, but I have strongly recommended this game to my friends.. and to you also :)			"

								Shot an Alpaca, all it's Alpaca friends got angry and swarmed the hunter, knocking him out. They then knocked out 2 out of the 3 remaining colonists, took over my entire base called it home. My last survivor was holed up in a doorway slowly picking them off one by one with a shotgun. After a while she remembered a colonist who died a few days previously, went berserk and decided to instead punch the alpacas to death, which backfired when they quickly killed her. The other survivors still couldn't walk so it was game over.Reloading a autosave from 10 minutes earlier, I avoided the Alpacas and had my first colony relationship. Almost immeadiatly raiders came, gun fire was exchanged and one of the couple was hit in the head and killed instantly.I cri evri tim </3			"

								Dwarf Fortress was a game I played a few years back, and one I would like to play again when it 'eventually' gets closer to completion. RimWorld helps to scratch that itch of managing a colony though, and it does it well. As of this review, I have been playing the game during Alpha 15. I can safely say that this is an excellent game that I've poured several hours already without fully mastering all RimWorld's content.For what its worth, RimWorld is a fantastic game in the colony builder genre. Compared to Dwarf Fortress it perhaps dumbs down some things - like having you mine steel out of walls instead of mining iron and working it into steel first. However if you can get past some of the simplification there is still quite a bit of depth in the game. There is a still caring and managing of your different colonists through assigning them all different work tasks and ensuring they are fed and happy; and while you probably won't have failure due to tantrum spirals, you still have to watch out for the safety of your colonists - be it from dangerous predators, roving raiders, infectious diseases, and rather 'fickle' weather.Something to bring up as well is that if you are coming from Dwarf Fortress, or just picking up a colony builder game for the first time, you won't be spending a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to play. The game features a very basic tutorial - and even without the tutorial the game has a sweet user interface which makes it very easy to actually sit down and just play the game.I certainly encourage buying this game, even in Early Access. It does indeed play quite well without much in the ways of irritating bugs, and the developer seems quite busy in continuing to add new content to the game as well. Check It Out.			"

								I've played this game for quite a while, and i've loved every minute of it. What really impresses me with this game is it's attention to detail. For the ability to tell what each room you built is used for and labling it as such, to the description of the artwork your mooks create that's based on real game events. Plus the ability for shananagins is pretty good too. You built a stripe mine and it's now full of deadly bugs now? crank those heaters up to 11 and wait for the bugs to pass out from heat stroke then light their lairs on fire. Then watch in horror as the fire spreads to your base and you pray your fire suppresion devices are placed in a good enough possition to stop the damage. not to mention that the sound track is awesome.Hands down the BEST early access game i've ever played.

Whether you wanna micro manage your colony or just laugh at the ridiculous stories that unfold while playing, Rimworld is worth the purchase.			"

								Incredible game. At times it's survival drama where you lose days to sickness, lose animals to predators, limbs to explosions and your companions to attacking tribes. At other times survival horror, executing prisoners while sealing off excavated caves filled with ancient dangers who want to end your time on their Rimworld. Then sometimes it's survival fun, everything is working, your crops are growing and the five people who tried to raid you are lying naked in your courtyard while you consider whether or not to feed them to your pack of Yorkshire terriers or harvest their organs to sell to orbital traders.Menu heavy, and slight learning curve. However the narratives that play out everytime among my survivors in this alpha game are amazing and at times rival AAA storytelling.Randomly generated everything means tons of content and reasons to build another base and keep trying.Perma death is a nice option, and my preferred playstyle. But there is always the option to not turn it on.			"

								""Chapter 8 - The Tale of Banastra, Former Chief of the Borne of Owl TribeAfter a couple failed raid attempts on my colony we were going strong and I decided we didn't need anymore people, but I didn't know what to do with the living but incapacitated attackers, so I built an organized prison.Eventually the prison became a dungeon.Eventually the dungeon became an execution chamberEventually the execution chamber became a torture chamber for my colonist, Veniamin, that liked to kill. No one was allowed in the chamber except for him and myself, and the chamber was purposefully kept uncleaned.After murdering so many Borne of Owl warriors, I started looking more into their lives, one in particulr was married to Banastra, a chief in the Borne of Owl tribe. I started to wonder what my motive was for caring about these savages before having Veniamin horrifically remove all of the organs from the spouse of Banastra I had held captive in my private chamber.Many moons pass, and we happen to be raided again...One of the raiders seemed familiar...His name was Banastra, male chief of the Borne of Owl tribe.As a smile grows across my face, I surmise that Veniamin, should he survive, will be quite happy later tonight.As expected, we repel the raiders with ease and minimal injuries, thanks to my turrent and wall system. I organize the collection of the spoils of war currently lying on the ground and clear Veniamin's schedule for the rest of the night, as he will have some work to do.After collecting the remaining live raiders and escorting them to what would be their grave, I call for Veniamin to begin his twisted ritual.Veniamin slowly works his way down the line of the Borne of Owl members, making sure to leave Banastra untouched as he will be our special guest of the evening. After brutally murdering all of the remaining Borne of Owl members, only one remains. I am sure by now he recognizes the corpse of his previous wife, Camisa. I decide to allow the sole survivor time to collect himself, as we will need him to be in a conscious state of mind for the dark ritual to have merit or meaning. Early that morning, I wake Veniamin from his peacefull slumber a bit earlier than normal, but I can tell he knows why. He was probably dreaming about this moment.I know I was.By now Banastra was a shell of his former self, cowering in his corner of my special chamber. Retrieving him was easy, but having Veniamin resist the urge to kill him wasn't.No, by now Banastra was very special to me. Killing him outright wouldn't suffice.Instead, I simply had Veniamin remove his legs and arms, without the use of anesthetics or blood-clotting medicine. He would surely bleed to death within an hour, if even that. I then had Veniam bring Banastra to the corpse of his deceased wife, Camisa and leave him there to bleed. I then sent Veniamin on his way and turned off the lights. He wouldn't be coming back for a while now.I finally took a break from my duties, my self-appointed quest and ritual now complete, and I realized something:Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I just did that.Have I become a monster? Even if they're my enemies in this kill or be killed world, I had just done something terrible that took considerable effort to do.This world, it changes people...""-Excerpt from ""The Story of The Survivor's Following, A Colony""			"

								I spend three hours carefully crafting the perfect set of six psychotic colonists. Two of them died when they crash landed, and another two suffered extreme injuries. Well, I have to make do with what I have now. I begin by finding a nice valley and nudge them to settle in it. Easily defendable, good resources, even some local wildlife to keep them fed. One of the injured colonists dies on his way there. Oh well. I'm not even five minutes into the game, and three of my six colonists are dead. I'm left with my cannibal Chef, cyborg Engineer, and extremely bloodthirsty Mercenary. This should be fun.Time goes on; they start carving into the mountain and making an underground base. Before long, a visitor from one of the other settlements comes by! Big mistake. The Mercenary immediately sets out for her. She realizes he doesn't look friendly and tries to run away, but he shoots her in the legs. She helplessly tries to crawl away as he approaches and butchers her. Poor girl. Before long the Chef has come and collected her body and made tonight's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast. Time passes, and they recruit a few more psychos to their group, slowly form a Prison, and start selling organs and slaves to traders. All was well...until a massive flash storm struck in the middle of the night. Too hot and spreading too fast, they were trapped inside their mountain as the fire roared towards them. My entire colony is burning as I sit there and watch them desperately try to extinguish the flames.*Save and quit to Main Menu**New Colony*I backed this game a little over two years ago. It's progressed so well since then. The scenario above is just one way to play this game. Do you want to run a psychotic prison colony that sells it's prisoner's organs? Or maybe you want to start a small animal ranch and make peace with the surrounding settlements? Perhaps, you just want to be an old miner living the rest of his days deep inside a mountain? It's completely up to the player how they play. When creating your colony, you are given the choice (without mods) of three different AI story-tellers and starting scenarios. Each of them chooses how they trigger events differently. Cassandra slowly ramps up the difficulty over time, starting with a crazy squirrel or similar and ending with something like a raid of 20 bandits in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm. It's interesting. Phoebe is very easy going and tries not to harass you too much while you build up. Randy, however, rolls the dice constantly and is very random with his events. You can go hours without anything happening or five minutes of pure chaos. After you've chosen a storyteller, you create your world and decide where to settle. Each biome and area of the world have different temperatures and growing seasons, and the terrain varies as well. Flat land won't have much ore or hills, where as Mountainous is filled with both. This step is pretty simple.Finally, you get to roll your colonists. You can roll them as many times you want until you find a set you like and can start with them. Depending on which scenario you picked, you'll be given some different colonists that start with different gear and research. From here you start your story, and the rest is up to you.			"

								I don't often write reviews for games but this game derserves a review. This game is best described as a colony building survival game with a similar play style to Prison Architect. Its great. It's unforgiving on ironman mode which is what many games lack these days. Most games baby you through and let you just go back and fix your mistakes with no consequences. You will have to start again multiple times, you will rage and swear to never play again but you will always be back. This is the most unique in depth survival game i have played with endless playablity. Unpredictable weather or events (raids , solar flares) keeps you on your toes. There is so much to talk about with this game but ill let you discover the awesome experience for yourself. Easily worth the 30USD and id imagine itll go on sale this xmas, if for anything less than $30 , its a must have for anyone into stratergy, survival and RTS games. Many updates, tweaks and fixes. Workshop capability. 9/10 would watch my colony burn to the ground again.			"

								I always wanted to play Dwarf Fortress but could never be bothered to learn the crazy and arcane interface. Rimworld allows me to play this emergent simulation style of game without having the UI getting in the way, and the end product is compelling. It's relaxing watching your colonists going about their jobs and interacting, slowly building up your facility. It's not so relaxing when your colonist has a mental break because of a squirrel bite and ends up shooting the doctor and setting fire to the stores.			"

My favorate part of the newest update, the Wanderlust update, would have to be the abillaty to look at the world in a Circler form/3d instead of a Flat form/2d, and the ability to now form Caravans to attack or trade with your Neighbors. The ways that you can build your Colony('s)/Base('s) is endless, weather you want to tunnle into Mountains like Dwarves or build a Village surounded by walls. Would recomend this to anyone who has a Creative spirit and or wants to make digital life suffer.-Catmaster09			"

								One of the best early access games I've ever played. This game has kept my attention for over 140 hours so far, and I plan on sinking a lot more into it. Absolutely addicting and well worth the price. There are so many different ways this game can play out due to the variation of colonist skills and personalities, game type, starting biome, and a bunch of other things. The mods are top notch and the community are very helpful. A small story from my game: Decided to accept a pyromaniac with a very low breaking point and no skills to speak of into my colony - spent a while basically guarding her whilst she kept starting fires around my home place. After a while, I felt I had enough of her and locked her in a room with utterly nothing to her name (I had even taken the clothes off her back) and let her starve to death. I forgot to look at the colonist relationship screen before I did this. Turns out, she was the daughter of one of my hard-working colonists. The mother falls into a deep depression and can barely do any work before she breaks and binges on beer. She passes out and wakes up with a mammoth hangover, thus making her mood worse and breaking again. It decended into a vicious cycle, and I could no longer keep beer in my stockpile. The mother eventually recovered somewhat... but I didn't. I felt utterly awful, and now I try not to take in people who are mental and/or have a severe lack of skills, and check the relationships tab before I... uh.. ""let go"" of colonists.10/10, will be playing for at least another 140 hours.			"

								Currently at 170 hours.I only play Permadeath (no saves except on exit), Classic Storyteller, Some Challenge difficulty, Crashlanded Scenario (3 colonists basic scenario) and I accept every random choice they make for me (planet seed, starting location, colonist stats, etc) no matter how good or bad. This playstyle has given me so many wildly different narratives, stories of triumph, defeat, sadness, and unexpected joy. This is a game about the journey, not the finish line.I still have not had a successful colony to date. My most successful one lasted probably about 30-40 gameplay hours, which ultimately fell to an unchecked infestation while dealing with attrition and a seige. I sat in silence, respectfully released all my animals, and watched in abject detatchment as my legless prisoner eventually succumbed to simultaneous starvation and infection. He died alone, in extreme pain, and surrounded by the clattering claws of murderous bugs scraping his cell walls. I like to think his slip into unconciousness saved him from the horrific fate that awaited.The game looks basic, but the interactions between everything are masterfully crafted. You will find yourself having to make hard choices that will really make you question your own values in life. The AI is a masterful story-teller.I can't express this enough: the real enjoyment from this game comes from the meta story. It's a great colony builder, and you can micro-manage so much that it will really satisfy those OCD control issues, but you have to learn to accept losses. It's all about risk management, time management, and resource management. One of the most stressful, but satisfying gameplay experiences I've had in a long time.My only advice: learn to accept losses and failure.			"

								A somewhat simplified take on the Dwarf Fortress genre of game, Rimworld allows you to make decisions that most rational human beings should never have to make.  For example: Cannibalism; yea or nay; as one of the lighter decisions.I've been playing this every once in awhile when I get word of an update, and it has yet to disappoint.			"

								This game really has me hooked. Not only that ... Whenever I manage to free me of it, I can be sure to get sucked again when the next version is released. It's a bit like crack cocaine, with the main differences being the reduced health risks, the lower price and the availability as a legal download on steam.What fascinates me most, personally, is the fundamental openness of the game's goal. In theory, you are expected to build up a colony that's capable of building a star ship using which you escape. In my current play-through (Alpha 15), which is the fourth one I'm doing since Alpha 13, I reached that point about 20 hours ago, but the ship just sits there and is ignored. I'm really more interested in more fine-tuning for my colony, a little expansion, just a little more trade and just seeing what happens to my colonists. It's like a fish tank, which also never get's boring. A fish tank full of crack cocaine.			"

								How I didn't review this game is beyond me. It's not for everyone, big AAA titles are for everyone and because of that they're♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is for people who like any kind of builders / simulation games. I mean, did you enjoy Simcity 20 years ago? This is for you. Do you like The Sime? It's for you. You like some farming sim? Get it. XCOM? Yup. Anything that deals with people interacting? Get in here. Yo, do you like games that are well designed? Rimworld. Do you like devs that listen and don't mess up early access? Why not Rimworld? Do you like Canada? Who doesnt? Rimworld. Do you think that a married couple having to eat eachother to survive a wolf attack is fun? Well, here ya go!Do you have a sick sense of humour? YO! Rimworld is just for you!Do you like spending 20 minutes on a game just to find it was actually 4 days and you're not employed anymore? GET THIS!Do you feel like games are too easy? Go for Randy random extreme, you'll think otherwise.But for real, this is one of the best designed, full of new ideas game I've played since Black & White. If you don't know B&W, go download WinXP, install it, get B&W, play it for 4 weeks, get back here, and GET RIMWORLD. Yo, this game is worth $120, it's like two AAA games. AND! It's still evolving. And there's *really* good mods for it. And it's so damn well designed. Jeez.Btw, for those wondering, my play time does not include beta access while the game was off steam - I played weeks more of it, trust me. It's 100%, totally worth every penny and twice more, easily.			"

Early Access Review
An amateur's review of Rimworld      RimWorld is one of those games that can treat you right one moment then sucker punch you the next - but what makes it so good for me is that it doesn't always. It has three storytellers with their own pattern, and those each have their own difficulty. If you want casual play, there's Phoebe Chillax on Basebuilder difficulty; mistakes are easy to recover from. Or you can also choose Randy Random on Extreme Permadeath for a real challenge - What happens is random and once it's done, it's done. Good luck surviving a huge raid on day 3. RimWorld gives a rather strong range of control of challenge right from the start.     The real fun is in the gameplay. You manage a colony (or a tribe) of 1-5 colonists, or pawns, and are tasked with their survival and the ultimate goal of building a ship to leave the planet. Defend them from raiders, killer robots, insect infestations, blights, eachother, and yourself. (We all get fed up with that one pawn eventually.) These pawns each have different traits, skills, and backstories that change how they function, like nudists, psychopaths, optimists, medieval lords, medieval slaves. Injuries also play a big role. A sick colonist will have to spend time in bed recovering or risk death, and a colonist can have their hand, arm, head (yikes!), organs, and more removed and that will affect them adversely. (Who needs a head anyway?) Not to mention that where you choose to build will affect growing seasons, clothes needed to survive, and diseases.    One final feature of RimWorld is the modding scene, and it is huge. A large variety of mods exist on the Steam Workshop and are a click or two away from being in your game, and even more unique mods await you in the Ludeon forums. Just like games like Skyrim, mods can make you spend yet another day managing those wacky pawns. The developer is also active and still polishing and adding more to the game, pushing it bit by bit to its final, grand form.Final Thoughts     I didn't expect to love RimWorld as much as I did, and it was a bit of a hesitant buy. However, I fell in love with the game. I struggled to build my first functional colony. I waited on edge to see if my pawn would recover from disease. I felt unease from my first ancient danger. I swore when my pawn kept missing an easy shot. Every colony is a rollercoaster of emotions, and I love every second of it.			"

								I used to play rimworld before it came out on steam, since a very early alpha i believe. When i was browsing the steam community, and saw a rimworld review, i immediately dashed to my PC, and got busy working on obtaining the steam key.It was a little drama obtaining the steam key due to the huge amount of traffic on the devs' servers, and i found myself frustrated a couple of times, but after a long time of doing, i finally got it. This wont affect my review though.Rimworld is an extraordinary colony management sim, which combines PA and dwarf fortress. The game is frequently updated (credits to u ty), and such theres something to explore most of the time.As mentioned in the huge list below, rimworld is a sci-fi, albeit realistically aimed simulator, and succesfully lives up to type with the amount of features it haves. The features all together make it very realistic-like, but thats not the end. The devs will continue on this game for a while (hopefully), and new features will arise.In any case, this really is a recommender, since its lives up to the features it promises, unlike the big AAA games everyone talks about.

								I broke my personal rule about not buying early access games to get RimWorld, and very glad I did.Zero crashes, and not noticed any bugs in first ~50 hours playing (and many long nights!), far more polished than most final released games.One of the overall top rated games on Steam for very good reasons - intuitive interface, easy to get started, lots of fun surprises. At the easiest level its pretty much a sandbox to build your favorite base, but anything harder than the easiest setting it becomes quite challenging to survive all the surprises and can snowball quite quickly into a disaster.I'm too wimpy to survive the harder difficulty settings yet!

								3 survivors crash landed on an uncharted planet. Among these survivors was a man named Hudson, and his pet cat, Groucho. Hudson was very antisocial, and spent most of his time in solitude with Groucho. after 2 weeks, something horrible happened. A rapid bunny attacked Hudson, breaking both of his legs and giving him a slight infection. Hudson spent the next few weeks in his bed, being unable to walk. The entire time, Groucho was right there in his room, never leaving his side. Unfortunately, his condition only got worse, despite the doctor's best efforts. After using most of their food and medical supplies trying to heal Hudson, with no progress, the remaining survivors made the difficult decision to put Hudson out of his misery. As the doctor carved into Hudsons, chest with a rusty knife, Groucho, Hudson's beloved companion, snapped and killed the doctor in a matter of seconds. After eating part of the body, Groucho went after the other survivors, killing them with ease. In a matter of minutes, an entire colony was wiped out by one housecat with a thirst for vengance.      10/10			"

Early Access Review
								To anybody who is reading this, it will be a long review. I will try to focus on both good and bad things (also ""neutral"" ones). Since this game costs quite a lot and doesn't have best graphics or any demo, it might be hard to know what is really behind this Early Access Game. My review is based on both positive, negative reviews and especially on my own experience in the game. Don't mind my relatively low play-time, I have also watched hours of gameplay and was able to see main issues (which were confirmed when I played by myself too). And yeah, I will try to keep it spoiler-free. So, let's start with positive points:+ Addictive and fun. The game can easily get an award of ""Let me play 5 more minutes"". There is a lot to do in this game (since it is a sandbox), which makes it a lot of fun. RimWorld can be very addictive, because you always want to do 1 more thing, before going to sleep/work etc. I personally always want to come back to my colony, to do one more thing.+ Low amount of bugs. Without mods, this game is pretty stable. I didn't have any issues and didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs. Small bugs exist, but they exist in any game.+ Optimization. I played the game on Windows PC, which can run heavy games (such as Crysis 3). So RimWorld had high fps. However, after trying this game on Mac (small Mac, without a good videocard or cooling system), I found out that it runs pretty smooth. It is not 60 fps, but my Mac didn't overheat, even without charging. If I zoomed out, the game started to have lower fps, but in general, it was possible to get 30 fps no problem.+ Depth. The game is pretty deep. I was heavily surprised by the health system alone. There are many parts of the body, which can be damaged (legs, arms, torso, head, eyes, ears, mouth/jaw, fingers/toes, heart, lungs, liver and some more). Each of them can be damaged individually (during combat) and most of them can have different diseases and problems (infections, cataracts, hearing loss, scars, heart-pumping problems, asthma etc.). On top of that, there are many different random diseases, both lethal (such as plague) and non-lethal (such as muscle parasites). Most of them can be healed or obtained during the game. Surgeries also play a big part of the game. So installing bionic eyes or peg legs can get pretty common. There are also tons of faction, a whole planet to explore (not that you will do that, but you can do that). Many different weapons, skills, traits and backstories (which determine your colonists). The game is deep. I have to give a tip of my hat to that.+ Your moral choices. Do you want to harvest organs from prisoners to sell them? Or do you want to recruit and save everybody you can? You decide how you answer these questions. And you decide whether you value more life of a prisoner or heart condition of your colonist.+ Different difficulty levels. There are 3 ""AI storytellers"" (about them later), each with his/her own difficulty levels. So you can decide whether you want raids full of people (making it harder) or base-builder difficulty (just for fun).+ Music and sounds. The music and sounds are amazing. Not perfect, but I really enjoy them. I often listen to OST of the game, personally I like it very much.Neutral points, which can be good for some people and bad for others:+/- Mods. The game supports mods. There are a lot of mods, which add or change the game. They make combat more real, surgeries more fun or even add Cthulhu. However, mods mean instability. And each game update will result in waiting for mods to update. Once, my save got corrupted because of mods. This doesn't happen very often (according to Google), but keep that in mind.+/- Learning curve. The game requires lots of time to play and learn. If you can only spend 1-2 hours a week, this game might simply be bad for you. However, if you are willing to learn the game and willing to play it a lot, you will have lots of fun.+/- Requires creativity. The game is not a game with a plot. YOU make the plot by yourself, dependent on random events by AI storytellers (about them later). If you are not ready to use imagination or just wanna build a big colony without having any attitude towards any specific person...then the game might simply get boring to you.+/- Micromanagement. The game is all about micromanagement. It means that even though colonist do the jobs you told them to do (you can assign each colonist a specific job, dependent on their skills), you will often have to manually say ""hunt these animals"" or ""cut these trees, don't you see, you don't have any left at home"". This doesn't change as game progresses. It doesn't become automatic (this is not Factorio), unless you install mods. But this can be fun if you enjoy micromanagement. If you don't, then the game is definitely not for you.And negative points. If you are okay with them, then you definitively should buy the game. Otherwise...depends on you.- ""AI storyteller"". The game has this description about storytellers: ""RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax."" However, there is no story generation. Each storyteller is not an ""Artificial Intelligence"". Each of the storytellers is basically the set of initial values, which define how random events are generated. Storytellers don't decide that ""because there was a raid, neighbour factions sent free stuff with drop-pods"". They simply randomly generate raid and then randomly generate drop-pods. Storytellers NEVER say a word and you only remember them when you choose your difficulty. As I said before, if you don't have creativity, you won't get any story in this game. However, if you do, then you will have very fun experience.- RNG (basically randomness of the game). The game is heavily dependent on random events (see AI storyteller). And each action has a random chance of being successful or fail. It leads to those moments, when you scream at your dying colonist, who was killed by a low-skilled raider with a bow, who just got a lucky shot. However, it works both ways. I think the game is way too random at times. As of A16, surgery is very random. ""Minor failure"" of installing a peg leg can lead to death. This is stupid, and sometimes frustrating. Even though surgery is planned to be changed, as of now, consider that sometimes it might be a bit strange. - Graphics. Yeah, they a bit bad. Looks like prisoner architect, though it is not one. I think that is not a really big dropback, but if you are the graphics-person, then you won't like the graphics.- UI. UI is confusing at times. It is not bad, but requires some clicking to learn. Moreover, some parts of the game can require mods. For example, I had to install ""Medical tab"", so that my doctors wouldn't use best medicine on scratches. So you can use mods to fix the UI...- Lack of demo. The game lacks demo and it is bad. That is why people are unable to try it before buying. 2 hours are not enough to taste the game fully. So if you are unsure, WATCH gameplay. Definitely do that before buying, if you are really unsure. But if you don't mind RNG, micromanagement and can spend lots of time, then you can easily buy it.As conclusion, the game has ""96% positive"" on Steam. It doesn't mean that YOU will like the game. There are some problems with it. However, I personally enjoy it a lot. If unsure, ask questions in comments. Thank you!			"

Early Access Review
								I love this game so much I'm going to write my first review on it.Lag: There was no framedrops through the entire game and I played on large maps and had a 10v10 + allies&animals battle. It's like a mix of Dwarf Fortress and Towns with it's own twist. They do a really good job of achieving what you want to do, for example: you can have prioritized storages, so they will fill up one storage before the other, there is a storage for specifics so you can have stuff you want to feed animals in 1 place, and food for you people in the other. You can prioritize each individuals work from 1-4 (with empty being not worked). This allows for optimization of their skills and jobs.The most brutal and realistic part is the vitals+combat (and is my favorite). When in firefights your colonists can take cover behind trees, walls, rubble, and pretty much anything that can block a bullet. If one of your colonists get injured, most likely it can be healed, but there is the chance they lose limbs or organs from the fight (damaged beyond repair). Better medicine can lead to better healing (as well as the doctor's skill). Colonists have a large list of vital signs that need to be monitored including, but not limited to: blood filtration, blood level, consciousness, sight, hearing, moving, eating, etc. Losing organs or body parts can lower these, and getting injured and not patching up can lead your colonist to bleed to the point where they pass out and eventually die. Every organism in the game has this vital recognition, everything from a mechanoid to a squirrel.On top of all of this survial realism pazzaz, there is tons of story to be told. Like the story of the 5 townspeople plagued by the 2 months of Volcanic Winter only to be followed by 2 weeks of Toxic Fallout (probably the ash). Not only did all of the plants and animals die, but we had to eat all of the barn animals. Sadly though, while out to retrieve the barn animals, one of our people developed dementia, and two developed Carcinoma. After they were gone, starvation started to sit in again, so we prayed in the Rec room. Right as we thought it was all over the toxic fallout ended, and a trade caravan from ""Patience's Cliff"" (an outlander town) came, we bought all the food we could to last us. Animals almost immediately started flooding back into the area along with the regrowing grass. We continued farming and restocked our freezer. We recovered mostly, but the 2 people with Carcinoma still have it (one is stable, the other has recession), and the person with dementia still has it, all they do is walk around cleaning, and then forgetting what they're doing and wander around aimlessly. A good thing that came of this though, the 2 people with Carcinoma got married.The one con I have with this game so far:The world map is only useful for choosing where you want to settle. It would be really cool if you can use that Pemmican (preserved food), and go travel to other faction areas (like the ones that are near you via Comms Console), nefarious deeds, or friendly negotiation would be up to you. (But seriously I would love to raid those people that tried to sell me human leather, and released a pack of manhunting muffalo [long story])In conclusion: If you're in to rather difficult strategy survival games, this is the game for you.WARNING: If you don't like a challenge don't buy this game, it gets really boring with no events and the events are BRUTAL (mostly)			"

Overview: Rimworld is a prison architect esk game with matching art and design concepts, but with a ♥♥♥♥ tone more gameplay elements and game mechanics....What makes Rimworld stand out from the crowd is the sheer amount of customization before actually starting your save and during your time through the game. When making a new save (Starting a new colony) you can choose between a huge amount of options which will in return determine how easy, hard, balanced, fun, boring, interesting, dull, your overall game will be.To list a few things:Traits, stat multipliers, in game events, starting items, researched projects, starting location, AID (artificial intelligence director), amount of people you begin with, type of settlement, time of year, size of overall explorable map, and much-much-much more.....One of the biggest selling points of Rimworld is the ""artificial intelligence director"". There are 3 AID's to choose from, the carefully-paced Cassandra Classic, the slower-paced, building-oriented Phoebe Chillax, and the totally unpredictable Randy Random.Each AID will oversee your game and will make choices based on your performance, like when to start a random event, type of weather, severity of each raid, overall mood of NPC's, and yet again... Much-much-much more.On top of the AID's themselves, you may also choose the play style of them too. (Basically difficulty of each AID) Pro's: Very addictive. I've not stopped playing since I got this game. I even skipped my doctors appointment today and told them I'll be there tomorrow instead. - I waited 2 weeks for this appointment. Unique and well throughout characterized artificial intelligence directors which really do spice up the game andkeep it interesting each new save.Lovely looking art concept which fits the theme of ""Rimworld"" and the type of game. Massive customization Mods!Con's:Heatwaves are basically GG. The only way I found to counter them if you haven't got coolers and electric is to strip all NPC's of their clothes and turn on Dev console, then force a thunderstorm which only slighty reduces the heat.Even with the above I still normally failed to counter it and all NPC's died. (Please ♥♥♥♥ing fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥dev's, we beg of you.)Thing's go from bad, to worse, to hell real ♥♥♥♥ing quick here in Rimworld.    With my latest Tribe I was around one hour in and suddenly a psychic drone (Some really bad thing off the map which you have no control over) started to make all my people unhappy extremely badly.  10 mins later it crashes to the ground and lands on all my crops, completely wipping out all my food, then begins to freeze the land stopping my from growing anything, to which I'm given a message that  I must attack and destory it before it freezes the land more + makes everyone even more unhappy.     I tell my people to attack it when suddely 3 ""AI"" climb out with lazers & shields and begin attacking my 4 tribes men with clubs.  2 die instantly, and then third goes mental and begins attacking the forth. Only for the AI to then make all animals go mental and begin attacking everything else alive. Oh and a thunderstorm struck lightning too, burning what was left of my village and surrounding forest.This kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥happened in every save of my so far, but not quite of that scale tho the above is a true story. The base game lacks content.... Kinda. For the amount of time it's been out and for a price tag of £20 there is a lack of  (At least early game) content. Tribe/Colony managementis quite awful. I'd say learn Crusader kings 2 is easier then dealing with your ♥♥♥♥ing people. Lacks basic simple features  which are not game breaking but is a basic concept and should be already implemented.Conclusion: To answer the question you'll all asking.... Yes... It is worth £20.In time this game will be 100x better then it's current state ( Which is already at a high standard )  "

Early Access Review
								(Note: Don't let the play time fool you. I, like many others, play the non-steam version. I have tons of hours of gametime.)This game is amazing. I've played others like it - Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Towns, Timber & Stone, and others, and they all pale in comparison. (Ok, Dwarf Fortress has more complexity, but, honestly, who could every play it with the horrible interface?)It's similar to other colony-management games, but much more interesting. The basic premise is that your people crashland on sparsely-habited planet on a rim world, and have to survive, and eventually build a spaceship to escape. (The new scenario editor opens up other options, but this is the premise of the basic game.) You will battle hunger, disease, injury, hostile enemies, random events, and even interpersonal relationships.The game features three different 'storytellers' which control how often events occur and how dangerous they can be. You can play a relatively safe colony-building game, or a 'This planet hates me' game. It's your choice.The interface works well, and while there is a bit of a learning curve, it's part of the fun, and the game never gets tedious or overly complex.Features:Colonists with different skills and quirks. (Nudist artistic cannibals? You bet!)ResearchFriendly villages and traders that you can barter goods withEnemies in the form of villagers, pirates, mechanoids, giant bugs, and rabid animals.Farming and goods production that is easy to automate.Well-modelled injury and disease system, including limb loss.You can capture enemies and convince them to join your colony, or sell them into slavery.Prosthetics and organ transplants. (Yes, you can harvest a lung from a prisoner.)Tons of different animals, all of which can be tamed and trained.Several different biomes to choose from (forest, jungle, tundra, desert, ice). Each presents its own challenges.Colonist have a mood rating which is affected by many different things, including hunger, temperature, joy (fun), pain, etc. A colonist that has too low of a mood can actually go berserk.Lots of random events that keep things interesting.Cons:Some people may not care for the art style, but I love it. Similar to prison architect.Only one level (i.e., you can't dig down.) You can mine into the sides of mountains, which carries its own benefits and risks.Winning the game is a bit anti-climatic, being nothing but a short blurb, but this may get addressed in the future. Remeber, it's still early access.The best thing about this game is the stories it generates, just through normal gameplay. Some of my favorite game moments:Having everyone in my first game die of disease except for one lone person, who went berserk and lost a melee fight with an alpha-beaver. Watching a thrumbo (really big animal) wander into the middle of a firefight between me and pirates. It took a hit, got mad, and killed all of us.Having half of my colony die from heatstroke when a solar eclipse knocked out my power during a heat wave.Watching my colonist feed a dead raider to my dog who was injured in the fight with the raider. (Karma)Harvesting a lung from a captured raider to replace the one that was destroyed in my colonist by that raider. (More Karma)Having an entire herd of boomalopes die from their own explosions because one of them suffered a fatal heart attack in the middle of the night. (Boomalopes explode when they die.)Watching two of my people get into a fistfight over an insult, and have to spend time in the infirmary together afterwards.Recently, having one of my people go berserk and attack a group of visitors from a friendly tribe. They and their four panthers killed four of my six colonists before leaving.I really can't recommend this game enough. Go buy it. "

Early Access Review
									Definitely a quirky little game.  The first 5 times i looked at the screenshots for this game I had a little trouble believing it could be engaging.  You read that right, 5 times, if not more, because it would continually show up on my recommendations list.  I would scrutinize the screenshots in complete disbelief.  Would these little larva like bobble things elicit the kind of excitement one feels for a game that keeps them coming back the way armor sets in WOW keep people paying a monthly fee?  Obviously i was skeptical.  As it is with many things in life the only real decision can be made once you have a little skin in the game.  So i bought it. Discounted.  I'm a sucker for pretty faces and getting' something for a little less than I could have a week ago.	Because bullet points are basically the end-all be-all of human existence, here is my bulleted list of impressions of this game.  NOTE: 27 hours of beer infused, ""to hell with my week end obligations"", playing at the time of this writing.- Limited tech tree, in the sense that it doesn't really go anywhere.  Escalation is not game depth.  Admittedly I've not fully dug deep into this tech tree, but you kind of intuit it after about hour 16.  Well it took me that long at least.  I'm a slow learner.  Still, there are neat little surprises that a lot of games fail to deliver.  Like a television?  It took me two weeks to carve a sculpture out of stone but i had a T.V. in a day or two.  What the F are they watching?  It could not have been good, as evidenced by the depression that set in pretty quickly for the prisoners i had been feeding the flesh of their fallen compatriots.  Ok, maybe no amount of T.V. was gonna keep morale up under those circumstances.- YOU CAN EAT PEOPLE!!!!! So cool.  And along those lines your peeps will get bummed out if there are too many corpses around.  Somehow this sweet and sour contrast is heartening, but also provides an interesting kind of challenge that i haven't seen in a measurable degree in other games i've played.  Your little dudes get wigged out but stuff that happens in the game.  ""Bob, I'm really sorry bandits killed you pet llama.  We'll make them eat their friends.  Promise.""  It definitely endears you to the game and draws you closer to the little, pistol carrying, sometimes drug and alcohol abusing, larva people you're managing.  Or not managing.  The AI let's you do more or less or less or more or a little less then a lot more. You can manage and prioritize where and what they do, much like the SIMs but you can't control how they feel about it.  The little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, regardless of what you do will sometimes just flip each other off.  BTW, bob hates ninja7.  I had nothing to do with that.  I just needed a wall built.- You can't explore other areas even though when a new game starts, a huge map is generated.  It's not clear to a new player what the relevance is of this giant game map is meant to communicate other than, ""Look.  You can go to all these cool places."" Nope.  This is, BTW the complete same level of disappointment experienced by ""No Man's Sky"" players except the reasons are completely inverted.  If you play ""No Man's Sky"" you'll know what I mean.- The great beaver attack of 2016.  ""Bob, the colony recognises your service.  You sir are a hero.  You lost your nose, and toes.  You now walk with a limp and are a bit slower on the draw then you used to be, but, we promise, when the deer run out, and the turkeys and the crops have iced over, we will eat you last.""  Yes beavers started eating all of the trees in the area.  The colony depended on the lumber from those trees.  I as the leader of the colony had to make the hard decision.  With a  heavy heart, making sure i had a recent saved game, I sent out my finest larva people, armed to the teeth, and <snuffle> ... I'm sorry, it's still very hard to talk about, we lost two.  Once engaged, their true evil was unleashed.  Belligerent, rabid, hungry for wood and human flesh.  <snuffle>, this is very difficult, neither Bob or our colony will ever be the same.	In conclusion, lot's of weird stuff can go wrong in this game, and that I guess is it's big sell and real home run.  It's not an expansive game but it's deep in it's own way.  I referred to the SIMs and I think that's a really good comparison.  A little RTS on a very small scale, a little RPG and a little SIMs.  Overall for it's scope I think this is a pretty fun game.  Definitely more fun and engaging than my initial impressions of the screen shots would have led me to believe or expect.  I can only imagine this game expanding it's scope and becoming truly all encompassing.  The mechanics are solid, UI is crude but 100% what you need for this kind of management style game, and the AI nuances make it, on a small scale as engaging as a well written and heavily scripted game like Baldur's gate.  Pretty amazing for a game that relies so much on AI. "

I torreted the game after hearing about DRM free and within 1 hour I purchased on steam. This game featurers a random generated scenario in which you must try and thrive against all odds. Everytime you play its different. Only makes you wonder... whats going to happen to these people next :O *EVIL LAUGH* ""SENDS TRIBE TO MELEE JAGUARS.*			"

Overview: Rimworld is a prison architect esk game with matching art and design concepts, but with a ♥♥♥♥ tone more gameplay elements and game mechanics....What makes Rimworld stand out from the crowd is the sheer amount of customization before actually starting your save and during your time through the game. When making a new save (Starting a new colony) you can choose between a huge amount of options which will in return determine how easy, hard, balanced, fun, boring, interesting, dull, your overall game will be.To list a few things:Traits, stat multipliers, in game events, starting items, researched projects, starting location, AID (artificial intelligence director), amount of people you begin with, type of settlement, time of year, size of overall explorable map, and much-much-much more.....One of the biggest selling points of Rimworld is the ""artificial intelligence director"". There are 3 AID's to choose from, the carefully-paced Cassandra Classic, the slower-paced, building-oriented Phoebe Chillax, and the totally unpredictable Randy Random.Each AID will oversee your game and will make choices based on your performance, like when to start a random event, type of weather, severity of each raid, overall mood of NPC's, and yet again... Much-much-much more.On top of the AID's themselves, you may also choose the play style of them too. (Basically difficulty of each AID) Pro's: Very addictive. I've not stopped playing since I got this game. I even skipped my doctors appointment today and told them I'll be there tomorrow instead. - I waited 2 weeks for this appointment. Unique and well throughout characterized artificial intelligence directors which really do spice up the game andkeep it interesting each new save.Lovely looking art concept which fits the theme of ""Rimworld"" and the type of game. Massive customization Mods!Con's:Heatwaves are basically GG. The only way I found to counter them if you haven't got coolers and electric is to strip all NPC's of their clothes and turn on Dev console, then force a thunderstorm which only slighty reduces the heat.Even with the above I still normally failed to counter it and all NPC's died. (Please ♥♥♥♥ing fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥dev's, we beg of you.)Thing's go from bad, to worse, to hell real ♥♥♥♥ing quick here in Rimworld.    With my latest Tribe I was around one hour in and suddenly a psychic drone (Some really bad thing off the map which you have no control over) started to make all my people unhappy extremely badly.  10 mins later it crashes to the ground and lands on all my crops, completely wipping out all my food, then begins to freeze the land stopping my from growing anything, to which I'm given a message that  I must attack and destory it before it freezes the land more + makes everyone even more unhappy.     I tell my people to attack it when suddely 3 ""AI"" climb out with lazers & shields and begin attacking my 4 tribes men with clubs.  2 die instantly, and then third goes mental and begins attacking the forth. Only for the AI to then make all animals go mental and begin attacking everything else alive. Oh and a thunderstorm struck lightning too, burning what was left of my village and surrounding forest.This kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥happened in every save of my so far, but not quite of that scale tho the above is a true story. The base game lacks content.... Kinda. For the amount of time it's been out and for a price tag of £20 there is a lack of  (At least early game) content. Tribe/Colony managementis quite awful. I'd say learn Crusader kings 2 is easier then dealing with your ♥♥♥♥ing people. Lacks basic simple features  which are not game breaking but is a basic concept and should be already implemented.Conclusion: To answer the question you'll all asking.... Yes... It is worth £20.In time this game will be 100x better then it's current state ( Which is already at a high standard )  "

								I love this game so much I'm going to write my first review on it.Lag: There was no framedrops through the entire game and I played on large maps and had a 10v10 + allies&animals battle. It's like a mix of Dwarf Fortress and Towns with it's own twist. They do a really good job of achieving what you want to do, for example: you can have prioritized storages, so they will fill up one storage before the other, there is a storage for specifics so you can have stuff you want to feed animals in 1 place, and food for you people in the other. You can prioritize each individuals work from 1-4 (with empty being not worked). This allows for optimization of their skills and jobs.The most brutal and realistic part is the vitals+combat (and is my favorite). When in firefights your colonists can take cover behind trees, walls, rubble, and pretty much anything that can block a bullet. If one of your colonists get injured, most likely it can be healed, but there is the chance they lose limbs or organs from the fight (damaged beyond repair). Better medicine can lead to better healing (as well as the doctor's skill). Colonists have a large list of vital signs that need to be monitored including, but not limited to: blood filtration, blood level, consciousness, sight, hearing, moving, eating, etc. Losing organs or body parts can lower these, and getting injured and not patching up can lead your colonist to bleed to the point where they pass out and eventually die. Every organism in the game has this vital recognition, everything from a mechanoid to a squirrel.On top of all of this survial realism pazzaz, there is tons of story to be told. Like the story of the 5 townspeople plagued by the 2 months of Volcanic Winter only to be followed by 2 weeks of Toxic Fallout (probably the ash). Not only did all of the plants and animals die, but we had to eat all of the barn animals. Sadly though, while out to retrieve the barn animals, one of our people developed dementia, and two developed Carcinoma. After they were gone, starvation started to sit in again, so we prayed in the Rec room. Right as we thought it was all over the toxic fallout ended, and a trade caravan from ""Patience's Cliff"" (an outlander town) came, we bought all the food we could to last us. Animals almost immediately started flooding back into the area along with the regrowing grass. We continued farming and restocked our freezer. We recovered mostly, but the 2 people with Carcinoma still have it (one is stable, the other has recession), and the person with dementia still has it, all they do is walk around cleaning, and then forgetting what they're doing and wander around aimlessly. A good thing that came of this though, the 2 people with Carcinoma got married.The one con I have with this game so far:The world map is only useful for choosing where you want to settle. It would be really cool if you can use that Pemmican (preserved food), and go travel to other faction areas (like the ones that are near you via Comms Console), nefarious deeds, or friendly negotiation would be up to you. (But seriously I would love to raid those people that tried to sell me human leather, and released a pack of manhunting muffalo [long story])In conclusion: If you're in to rather difficult strategy survival games, this is the game for you.WARNING: If you don't like a challenge don't buy this game, it gets really boring with no events and the events are BRUTAL (mostly)			"

It started rather bad with my guy tried to flirt with my wife and was constantly turned down until she got a mental breakdown and shot him.

Early Access Review
								(Note: Don't let the play time fool you. I, like many others, play the non-steam version. I have tons of hours of gametime.)This game is amazing. I've played others like it - Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Towns, Timber & Stone, and others, and they all pale in comparison. (Ok, Dwarf Fortress has more complexity, but, honestly, who could every play it with the horrible interface?)It's similar to other colony-management games, but much more interesting. The basic premise is that your people crashland on sparsely-habited planet on a rim world, and have to survive, and eventually build a spaceship to escape. (The new scenario editor opens up other options, but this is the premise of the basic game.) You will battle hunger, disease, injury, hostile enemies, random events, and even interpersonal relationships.The game features three different 'storytellers' which control how often events occur and how dangerous they can be. You can play a relatively safe colony-building game, or a 'This planet hates me' game. It's your choice.The interface works well, and while there is a bit of a learning curve, it's part of the fun, and the game never gets tedious or overly complex.Features:Colonists with different skills and quirks. (Nudist artistic cannibals? You bet!)ResearchFriendly villages and traders that you can barter goods withEnemies in the form of villagers, pirates, mechanoids, giant bugs, and rabid animals.Farming and goods production that is easy to automate.Well-modelled injury and disease system, including limb loss.You can capture enemies and convince them to join your colony, or sell them into slavery.Prosthetics and organ transplants. (Yes, you can harvest a lung from a prisoner.)Tons of different animals, all of which can be tamed and trained.Several different biomes to choose from (forest, jungle, tundra, desert, ice). Each presents its own challenges.Colonist have a mood rating which is affected by many different things, including hunger, temperature, joy (fun), pain, etc. A colonist that has too low of a mood can actually go berserk.Lots of random events that keep things interesting.Cons:Some people may not care for the art style, but I love it. Similar to prison architect.Only one level (i.e., you can't dig down.) You can mine into the sides of mountains, which carries its own benefits and risks.Winning the game is a bit anti-climatic, being nothing but a short blurb, but this may get addressed in the future. Remeber, it's still early access.The best thing about this game is the stories it generates, just through normal gameplay. Some of my favorite game moments:Having everyone in my first game die of disease except for one lone person, who went berserk and lost a melee fight with an alpha-beaver. Watching a thrumbo (really big animal) wander into the middle of a firefight between me and pirates. It took a hit, got mad, and killed all of us.Having half of my colony die from heatstroke when a solar eclipse knocked out my power during a heat wave.Watching my colonist feed a dead raider to my dog who was injured in the fight with the raider. (Karma)Harvesting a lung from a captured raider to replace the one that was destroyed in my colonist by that raider. (More Karma)Having an entire herd of boomalopes die from their own explosions because one of them suffered a fatal heart attack in the middle of the night. (Boomalopes explode when they die.)Watching two of my people get into a fistfight over an insult, and have to spend time in the infirmary together afterwards.Recently, having one of my people go berserk and attack a group of visitors from a friendly tribe. They and their four panthers killed four of my six colonists before leaving.I really can't recommend this game enough. Go buy it. "

Early Access Review
								To anybody who is reading this, it will be a long review. I will try to focus on both good and bad things (also ""neutral"" ones). Since this game costs quite a lot and doesn't have best graphics or any demo, it might be hard to know what is really behind this Early Access Game. My review is based on both positive, negative reviews and especially on my own experience in the game. Don't mind my relatively low play-time, I have also watched hours of gameplay and was able to see main issues (which were confirmed when I played by myself too). And yeah, I will try to keep it spoiler-free. So, let's start with positive points:+ Addictive and fun. The game can easily get an award of ""Let me play 5 more minutes"". There is a lot to do in this game (since it is a sandbox), which makes it a lot of fun. RimWorld can be very addictive, because you always want to do 1 more thing, before going to sleep/work etc. I personally always want to come back to my colony, to do one more thing.+ Low amount of bugs. Without mods, this game is pretty stable. I didn't have any issues and didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs. Small bugs exist, but they exist in any game.+ Optimization. I played the game on Windows PC, which can run heavy games (such as Crysis 3). So RimWorld had high fps. However, after trying this game on Mac (small Mac, without a good videocard or cooling system), I found out that it runs pretty smooth. It is not 60 fps, but my Mac didn't overheat, even without charging. If I zoomed out, the game started to have lower fps, but in general, it was possible to get 30 fps no problem.+ Depth. The game is pretty deep. I was heavily surprised by the health system alone. There are many parts of the body, which can be damaged (legs, arms, torso, head, eyes, ears, mouth/jaw, fingers/toes, heart, lungs, liver and some more). Each of them can be damaged individually (during combat) and most of them can have different diseases and problems (infections, cataracts, hearing loss, scars, heart-pumping problems, asthma etc.). On top of that, there are many different random diseases, both lethal (such as plague) and non-lethal (such as muscle parasites). Most of them can be healed or obtained during the game. Surgeries also play a big part of the game. So installing bionic eyes or peg legs can get pretty common. There are also tons of faction, a whole planet to explore (not that you will do that, but you can do that). Many different weapons, skills, traits and backstories (which determine your colonists). The game is deep. I have to give a tip of my hat to that.+ Your moral choices. Do you want to harvest organs from prisoners to sell them? Or do you want to recruit and save everybody you can? You decide how you answer these questions. And you decide whether you value more life of a prisoner or heart condition of your colonist.+ Different difficulty levels. There are 3 ""AI storytellers"" (about them later), each with his/her own difficulty levels. So you can decide whether you want raids full of people (making it harder) or base-builder difficulty (just for fun).+ Music and sounds. The music and sounds are amazing. Not perfect, but I really enjoy them. I often listen to OST of the game, personally I like it very much.Neutral points, which can be good for some people and bad for others:+/- Mods. The game supports mods. There are a lot of mods, which add or change the game. They make combat more real, surgeries more fun or even add Cthulhu. However, mods mean instability. And each game update will result in waiting for mods to update. Once, my save got corrupted because of mods. This doesn't happen very often (according to Google), but keep that in mind.+/- Learning curve. The game requires lots of time to play and learn. If you can only spend 1-2 hours a week, this game might simply be bad for you. However, if you are willing to learn the game and willing to play it a lot, you will have lots of fun.+/- Requires creativity. The game is not a game with a plot. YOU make the plot by yourself, dependent on random events by AI storytellers (about them later). If you are not ready to use imagination or just wanna build a big colony without having any attitude towards any specific person...then the game might simply get boring to you.+/- Micromanagement. The game is all about micromanagement. It means that even though colonist do the jobs you told them to do (you can assign each colonist a specific job, dependent on their skills), you will often have to manually say ""hunt these animals"" or ""cut these trees, don't you see, you don't have any left at home"". This doesn't change as game progresses. It doesn't become automatic (this is not Factorio), unless you install mods. But this can be fun if you enjoy micromanagement. If you don't, then the game is definitely not for you.And negative points. If you are okay with them, then you definitively should buy the game. Otherwise...depends on you.- ""AI storyteller"". The game has this description about storytellers: ""RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax."" However, there is no story generation. Each storyteller is not an ""Artificial Intelligence"". Each of the storytellers is basically the set of initial values, which define how random events are generated. Storytellers don't decide that ""because there was a raid, neighbour factions sent free stuff with drop-pods"". They simply randomly generate raid and then randomly generate drop-pods. Storytellers NEVER say a word and you only remember them when you choose your difficulty. As I said before, if you don't have creativity, you won't get any story in this game. However, if you do, then you will have very fun experience.- RNG (basically randomness of the game). The game is heavily dependent on random events (see AI storyteller). And each action has a random chance of being successful or fail. It leads to those moments, when you scream at your dying colonist, who was killed by a low-skilled raider with a bow, who just got a lucky shot. However, it works both ways. I think the game is way too random at times. As of A16, surgery is very random. ""Minor failure"" of installing a peg leg can lead to death. This is stupid, and sometimes frustrating. Even though surgery is planned to be changed, as of now, consider that sometimes it might be a bit strange. - Graphics. Yeah, they a bit bad. Looks like prisoner architect, though it is not one. I think that is not a really big dropback, but if you are the graphics-person, then you won't like the graphics.- UI. UI is confusing at times. It is not bad, but requires some clicking to learn. Moreover, some parts of the game can require mods. For example, I had to install ""Medical tab"", so that my doctors wouldn't use best medicine on scratches. So you can use mods to fix the UI...- Lack of demo. The game lacks demo and it is bad. That is why people are unable to try it before buying. 2 hours are not enough to taste the game fully. So if you are unsure, WATCH gameplay. Definitely do that before buying, if you are really unsure. But if you don't mind RNG, micromanagement and can spend lots of time, then you can easily buy it.As conclusion, the game has ""96% positive"" on Steam. It doesn't mean that YOU will like the game. There are some problems with it. However, I personally enjoy it a lot. If unsure, ask questions in comments. Thank you!			"

								A friend suggested this game to me; since paying full price for it I've gotten more than my money's worth out of it.It's basically a fully-skinned (ui) of that ridiculous dwarf fortress game you could never get into because every modded skin you tried was just as horrible as the last.People compare the graphics/mechanics to prison architect but ♥♥♥♥ prison architect, that game's asthetic/plot is just awful (I literally wouldn't, and didnt, pay ~5$ for it, when it was on humble bundle).The game is extremely pause friendly and has never ever crashed on me before (only lag if you use certain worldsize settings). Play at whatever speed you like, the more you micromanage the more efficent your colony will be.The base game has plenty of content, but still leaves some to be desired (like more unique enemies, guns, buildings etc.); from what I see, all of the can be accomplished through mods...still havn't gotten there yet though! I really hope this developer takes hints and integrates much of what mods offer into the game c:I definately wouldn't pass this one up if it looks interesting at-first-glance. "

Joe walks into the hallway where his buddy Bob is having 'nam flashbacks, beating to death a fourth Yorkie with his bare hands, the half-asleep Joe pulls out his survival rifle upon witnessing this, and proceeds to pump his psychotic bestfriend Bob with enough bullets to incapacitate him. Then Joe drags his half-dead friend Bob across the floor to a medical bed, patches him up the best he can, and then tries to give him proper medical care; but Bob dies of his wounds (an infection).

								I have been following the game pre-Steam for quite some time now. Without going into particulars of rights and wrongs, goods and bads, dev schedule, bugs, etc., all I can say is that it’s worth its current price tag. Every single penny of it. The game progressed significantly and judging from what I have read about dev plans there is plenty more to come. It plays well and provides many hours of solid fun. The moding community is robust and they frequently conjure up incredible stuff that makes the game more fun and/or worth returning to and rediscovering anew. It. Is. Good. Plain and simple Fun, even in its current unfinished/semi-finished state (which makes me all the more excited about the final product) :) "

The community is awesome and the mods available are excellent.I'm so happy that the developer gets to see their work hit #1 globally, it's a very fitting and well deserved reward. Here's to RimWorld continuing for many years to come. Now, back to finish removing various body parts before I send these people home.			"

								This game is unequivocally the most I have ever played any game, hands down. I must have 500+ hours playing it and have had the Kickstarter and beyond versions since initial pre-alpha release. The roleplay that you create when you have your characters is just like that feeling you had when you were a kid playing with toys. Each of them had a personality and you fought them and had them get along. It really brings the wonder of just letting fun happen organically right back to me as if I were 5 again.If you like sci-fi, basebuilding, and/or, most clearly inspired, Firefly, then you need to get this game. I promise you you wont be disappointed. the complexity of the game may seem daunting at first but I know that within an hours or two you will have a good hang of how to get around and the fun will just start to flow like water.Edit: formatting and clarity			"

								So tried this out, looked interesting and I've been wanting to play this sort of game for a while.  Starting out and have no idea what the controls are or anything so look up a guide. Next thing I know I've realized I've failed when colonists start going berzerk and I have no food.9/10, will fail againEDIT: After a bit more play, it's not quite what I want. Characters are very random, and can be unfortunate. Like having your strongest fighter also be the only person that can do doctoring, and they get incapacitated, and you watch them die because no one else can figure out to drag them to a bed at least. There isn't that much to in the game, but it's here because dev wants to add more, and it seems to have active modders. Also a very micro-management heavy game. I can see how some people would like it though, so keeps the positive review :)			"

								If you want to step up your casual gaming from The Sims series to something more extreme, RimWorld is it. It's as difficult as Dwarf Fortress, but there are easier difficulties (and three different 'storytellers' that control what happens) that you could pretend like you're playing The Sims. Plus, there's no household cap of 8! Anyone that survives, crashing into your colony - or enemies you capture from a raid - you can *convince* them to join your colony and become a part of the family. :)  Once you're comfortable with observing your Sims, I mean, colonists get cozy - bump up the difficulty for hordes of your neighbors, space pirates, and even space alien robots. No one could make fun of you for that. Yes, sure, you can make people into hats.			"

								TL:DR = build a colony, watch your colonists die, repeat.I bought this game way back in Alpha 4 I believe. It's been years in development but with every update comes a deeper, more refined game.Like many people are saying Rimworld is an unholy union of Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, set in a Fireflyesc universe.In the game you build and manage a group of stranded settlers. Watch as you settlement grows; your colonists develop, interact and eventually die. That last part is something you'll have to get used to as this game can be brutal.Due to this undeniable fact of Rimworld the health system for a game like this is pretty complex with various body parts and effects being simulated. If your colonist gets a toe or two shot off his movement speed will be affective, if he catches a cold his conciousness is affected..  over time your veteran colonists will more than likely loose most of their appendages and require prosthetics.. one of my colonists has none of her original organs as well as having cybernetic limbs and eyes...""she's more machine now than man"".That is just one small aspect of the game however. There are others to worry about too, such as; seasons, temperature, colonist schedules, research, trading, diplomacy, to name a few.This is to say Rimworld hasn't got it flaws, but with all honesty they are usually addressed pretty quickly. At the moment the AI pathfinding can be a bit iffy but chances are this will be fixed in the next update, a sign of a good developer is that they address the underlying flaws in their game before adding new features. An example ot this was the trade caravans and raiders attacking in extreme temperature regions in the previous alpha version. with Alpha 14 they no long do this... so you won't have a trail of corpses leading to your colony after an especially cold winter or hot summer.Overall If your a fan of base builders or managment games then I would wholly recommend this game, even at the current pricetag. It is a game I always play at some point, and it's replayablity is probably one of it's strongest assets, due to it's procedual nature.So please have a go, build a colony and watch it eventually been thrown into chaos either by famine, fire or intergalactic robots.

								This is a great strategy and base building game that has so much to offer. The core game is great, but the mod community makes the game even better. I have been using mods to create massive bases and have raids against dozens of raiders and it is a blast. I also have a barebones game where I am struggling with few resources on hand. There is a lot going on this game and the documentation is alright, but I learned a lot by trial and error and watching youtube videos. The events in the game like diseases and toxic fallouts keep you on your toes. It can be really intense as you struggle to keep everything in working order. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys base building games. I can't wait to see what the final product looks like as the development team seems to really know what they are doing. I would be shocked if they fell into the rut that many game developers do where the alpha is good but they make changes that seem to make no sense and upset the players. 9/10 would harvest organs of prisoners again			"

								I was one of the original backers of this on kickstarter, along with many other positive reviewers here, but don't let that fool you into thinking I won't criticise the game.This game's UI is a little lacking sometimes, there's basically no tutorial. Most basic stuff is easy to work out but some things are a little frustrating and you might have to do some googling, even then you might not get a straight answer. You'll get killed a lot. I've been playing for over a year and I still play on the friendly AI setting (it will still kill you). You'll be ♥♥♥♥ed by diseases out of nowhere. Your colonists will all be sad because the base is looking♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then there'll be a solar flare and without power they'll break and go crazy. You'll have awful luck.But ♥♥♥♥ I like building bases, and after all the♥♥♥♥♥♥this game's put me through I still love coming back to it, starting new colonies, and trying to get somewhere because once you learn to not get ♥♥♥♥ed right off the bat, this is a great game that's making and has made real progress.The issues this game has are outweighed by the enjoyment I've gotten from it.9/10 would crash land again "

								As a rule I generally don't write reviews; not out of some arbitrary reasoning, but out of fear that I don't have insight to either advising picking up a game or steering clear of it.This is not the case with Rimworld.Rimworld is arguably one of the finest crafted games ever released for the colony/survival genre. Boasting a huge range of character traits, a complex relationship system between characters and a potentially harsh or easy world to survive in. The game is entirely fantastic in it's ability to tailor your experience from a relatively easy adventure through a lush, temperate forest; all the way up to a ball-crushing torture fest of surviving in the harsh, arctic tundra, or the equally terrifying super dry deserts.If you have even the slightest interest in this game, please do yourself the favour and pick it up. Whilst it's only just come out on Steam, I have well over 500 hours of gameplay prior to it's release: and I've loved every single second of it. You will not regret this purchase, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

								This is the closest thing I've come to Dwarf Fortress.  One of my guys (let's call him Derp) was out hunting and was shooting at a turkey.  He missed and killed the dog.  The owner of the dog was the doctor and very saddened by this.  Later, Derp went out hunting a rabbit.  He missed again and shot a wolf.  The wolf ran up and messed him up, tearing his middle finger from his hand.  After he was treated, the hand developed an infection that got worse and worse.  It got so bad that we needed to amputate the hand.  The doctor (whose dog was killed by Derp) began to operate, and ended up cutting Derp's lung and his leg.  The surgery went poorly and Derp eventually died from the wound to his lung.  The doctor buried him, but I couldn't help but wonder if the sugery went bad on purpose...Even still, the doctor was the only person to visit his grave.  I wonder if he was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on it...10/10  Would experience the whole thing again.  And screw Derp.  That dude deserved what he got.			"

								It is a good game but patch A16 really blew my mind and I'm really exited what further patches will bring.You can literally play this game forever which I always love if a game has a high replay-value plus it has mods too.But it can't use multiples cores (Character 1 wouldn't know what Character 2 is doing and so on), it will use only one core so you will have little fps problems in the late game if you zoom completely out & fast forward but it isn't too bad.Still an amazing game and worth the price.(If you don't care about Steam stats and all that buy it on rimworldgame.com to support Ludeon Studios even more.)

								Let me tell you a story about a woman named Turtle.Turtle lived in a thriving colony. She shared this colony with 11 other human souls, but to be honest she prefered her animals. Spending her days in the wilderness surrounded by her animal friends Turtle was at peace. She did not care much for her fellow humans. Well, perhaps that is an understatement. In fact, Turtle would celebrate each time a fellow colonist died. She giggled when Jim rotted away from Plague. She smiled when her rival Gray was mauled by an elephant. No, She did not have many human friends. ANY, human friends.Her fellow colonists did not much care for her either. She was always bickering and insulting them when forced to work inside the camp. But one day duty called. Perhaps it was in fear for her flock that she faced the raiders, perhaps it was her sense of duty to protect the nearly complete spacecraft. Whatever it was, she grabbed her knife and went to her post. So did Fluffy.Fluffy did not exactly live up to his name. As a wild boar he was anything but. What he was though was loyal to his master. His God. His Turtle. Fluffy the boar fell defending her from a peg legged raider equipped with an assault rifle.It was too much for Turtle to take. She sustained critical wounds. But the only pain she felt was the loss of Fluffy.Days in the hospital bed as despair and anguish crept in. Surrounded by these... humans. Holes from the bullets still fresh in her torso. But none as fresh and deep as the hole that Fluffy left. And now these humans celebrated their victory. But Fluffy was gone. They would all pay.The raiders came again quickly. Turtle was still recovering. The colony all rushed to their posts to make another stand. Turtle broke. Turtle found her knife. She slipped in quietly behind her ""friends.""This is for Fluffy.The raiders smashed their front skirmish line. Turtle did her bloody work from the rear. The colony fell.Turtle lay dying in the cold mud. Blood seeping from her head, and from her knife still clutched in her hand. Blackness closed in on her. But in those last few moments, peering up at an alien sky, she thought she saw him there. Twinkling in the abyss, Fluffy smiled down on her one last time. All went black. "

								Incredibly addicting. You aren't discouraged by failure in this game, rather, you feel the need to try again and fix what issues your previous colony might have had. You slowly learn techniques from playing, and are able to handle harder difficulties and situations.For an early access game, this game has a massive amount of content.			"

								I was one of the original backers of this on kickstarter, along with many other positive reviewers here, but don't let that fool you into thinking I won't criticise the game.This game's UI is a little lacking sometimes, there's basically no tutorial. Most basic stuff is easy to work out but some things are a little frustrating and you might have to do some googling, even then you might not get a straight answer. You'll get killed a lot. I've been playing for over a year and I still play on the friendly AI setting (it will still kill you). You'll be ♥♥♥♥ed by diseases out of nowhere. Your colonists will all be sad because the base is looking♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then there'll be a solar flare and without power they'll break and go crazy. You'll have awful luck.But ♥♥♥♥ I like building bases, and after all the♥♥♥♥♥♥this game's put me through I still love coming back to it, starting new colonies, and trying to get somewhere because once you learn to not get ♥♥♥♥ed right off the bat, this is a great game that's making and has made real progress.The issues this game has are outweighed by the enjoyment I've gotten from it.9/10 would crash land again "

								As a rule I generally don't write reviews; not out of some arbitrary reasoning, but out of fear that I don't have insight to either advising picking up a game or steering clear of it.This is not the case with Rimworld.Rimworld is arguably one of the finest crafted games ever released for the colony/survival genre. Boasting a huge range of character traits, a complex relationship system between characters and a potentially harsh or easy world to survive in. The game is entirely fantastic in it's ability to tailor your experience from a relatively easy adventure through a lush, temperate forest; all the way up to a ball-crushing torture fest of surviving in the harsh, arctic tundra, or the equally terrifying super dry deserts.If you have even the slightest interest in this game, please do yourself the favour and pick it up. Whilst it's only just come out on Steam, I have well over 500 hours of gameplay prior to it's release: and I've loved every single second of it. You will not regret this purchase, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

I've probably put in atleast a couple hundred hours easily, it's very easy to get into and each update increasing changes the entire game dynamic and the upcoming one being more of a mobile presence of the world will hopefully help create a solution to trading, exploring or the end game stagnation that is of current.

								I've been playing this game since A10, I think - dabbled with it on and off before that but not enough to really pay attention to versions or the like, I kickstarted it because the concept seemed interesting and I wanted to see if the dev could deliver.Simply put: They delivered. It's fantastic. This game will eat your free time. If you're into colony management type games, if you've ever wanted to play Dwarf Fortress with an actually functional GUI, this is almost certainly going to scratch that itch for you.There's minor annoyances, like with any management game - the lack of any easy way to prioritize jobs by area is a bit irritating, but I recall a mod for that in A12 and I'm sure it'll find its way to A14 sooner rather than later. Simply put, anything that bothers you, you'll probably be able to mod out or adjust to your liking.Pick it up if you're looking for something to sink hours into.			"

								Very good experiance so far and I really really like the dwarf fortress influence. Im a Dwarf Fortress player myself so this game just feels right at home but obviously it has its own unique charm and such. The soundtrack is particularly good and gets me in the mood. Only real complaint but it may just be my luck is that events seem to happen a bit too frequently with Cassandra. And something that is obviously not essential or anything but would be cool would be a Dwarf Fortress esque adventure mode.Oh! And the thing I would absolutely love to see the most is Z levels, Specifically focused on caves and not so much above ground but that is ay' ok as well!			"

I finally understand some of the basics. I get back home and say to myself, I'll play for a half hour and get the refund, I doubt the game is worth $30. 3 hours laters I was laughing my a$$ off when my hunter while Racoon hunting faced off against and manhunting 215 year old tortoise and lost his eye.

								I'm so happy this is on Steam, I have played it for hundreds of hours over the last couple of years.Rimwold is a colony creating sim and addictive as hell. It also lets you do some rather sadistic things :)Example: Two of my colonists, Hammer & Doc were fighting and arguing a lot. Then suddenly an escape pod crashes to the planet, its Docs mother. Hammer has a blocker artery, but is an amazing grower. Doc is an amazing doctor, but also a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥who argues with everyone. To teach him a lesson, i commanded him to capture his injured mother and take her to the brig. Once there i then commanded him to extract her heart whilst she is still alive. After the extraction (and her obvious death) Doc was very upset, but he still hadn't learnt his lesson. So i then commanded him to transplant his dead mothers heart into his bitter rival, giving him a new lease on life. By now Doc was in a terrible mood, and was taking it out on the other settlers. He snapped and set fire to infirmary, but the settlers managed to calm him down. In penance, i commanded him to go and eat his own dead mothers body raw. This was the last straw for ol' Doc, he turned hostile and started to gun down the other settlers. I commanded the rest of the colony to beat the crap out of him, and drag him to the brig where i amputated his arms and legs, then removed his kidneys.10/10 serial killer sim, highly reccomended.

								I've never wrote a review for a game so that might say something.I'm a long time civilaztion series player and was a bit skeptical when a buddy referred me to this game.  This game was smoothly addicting right off the bat and the stories I've witnessed have been amazing.  My first playthrough ended hilariously.  I captured a raider and threw him in a cell.  Shortly thereafter a heat wave hit.  All 4 of my colonists got severe heatstroke.....and promptly went to their beds unresponsive.  The prisoner must have sensed his opportunity.  He beat down the prison door and was loose in my base.  I was mortified that he'd destroy everything but he went for the front door & beat it down for his freedom.....awww sigh of relief.  But no wait- not so fast!!! On the way out he decided to set fire to a power line. Again not terrible because the line was pretty far away from my wooden walls.  He then ran into an angry tortoise.  The tortoise bit him.....he fell back with surprise and stumbled into his own fire. He wandered into my wooden walls panicked & ablaze - fell down next to them with his last breath. He promptly burnt to a crisp.  The walls caught fire from his burning corpse. Every poor colonist laying unconsious in their beds ended in fire that day on the rim.Rip my little dudes....ripYou can't make this stuff up.  Buy it now- this game will not disappoint			"

Perfect for strategy lovers and tycoon esque gamers alike, with many comparing the game to space Dwarf Fortress. Now with Steam Workshop integration modding is even easier with it now being just a few clicks to install and get your custom RimWorld experience going.

								This game is honestly really wonderful if you have the patience for it. It can be really slow sometimes, and a little difficult to get into it at first, but once you're in, you are HOOKED. So much weird and zany and interesting things happen all the time. It's definitely worth the try! Though sometimes the intelligence of the pawns is lacking, and they sometimes do dumb things, it makes for a good story. It's a REALLY good aid to writing a story. And the mod community is really active! A lot of the ""problems"" people have with it, I think will get solved at a later time. And there's much more to be added to the game.30 bucks SEEMS like a lot, but I feel like it will be worth it. If you really want, you can wait for a sale, but the devs honestly deserve that money. (ALSO, BUY IT OFF THE WEBSITE AND GET THE STEAM KEY! It supports the devs more and you can get a lil extra stuff!)			"

								There is absolute no word on how good this game is and how good the developers are to their own game. This game has already swallowed 120 hours of my life and I am STILL seeing newer and newer content the more I play. And don't get me on the updates, the recent update (A16) added planetary exploration. This update tells you a lot of the developers. It's sad that A15 saves are not compatible, but this is one of the rare games that I don't mind restarting to try something new. For example: One of my first games I settled in a summer area without knowing, because of this there was never winter. When I started a new game however, I saw snow in this game for the first time. Choosing an area to live is really dependant on how you will survive and requires different planning per session. And fk me the game is long and enjoyable, and this game has an amazing mod support allowing tons of modders to change the way the game is played. This is one of the greatest survival games I have ever played, I do hope that in the future we will get more mind blowing updates like the one we had on A16.			"

								First 14 days.hu what am i doing ?oh this is how i build and harvest things.trader came, ignored them.few days later bandits came and i survived.Found out I could build prison room, so I captured an injured bandit.Look at bandits skills and had the impression he would soon pass away due to his injurys.Well what to do, i harvest his organs and put them in the fridge in case my own people need them or sell for profit  hmmmmm  ;-)A story from my colony.At some point a general and his mercenarys show up building some kind of defensive outpost, and i thought i better do a fast strike with my sniper... to my surprise some of his people had heavy machine guns and i lost 2 of my 5 people.. An next the started throwing handgranate that set fire to the grass and almost half of the map burned due to the dry inviroment and i had to spend allot of time stopping it from burning my base... It was a masacre and most of the wild life in the area died. .. But also the injured people from the battle cought fire , but i managed to caputre the general and put him in my prison but lost some cool gear and friends in the fire.. Now im trying to save the rest of my crews life by amputating legs and arms it is not easy since my best surgeon went up in flames on the battlefield and the other one I dont really think is a qualified doctor but faked his medical papers. A guy had his foot shot off so I give him a woodden leg, but i dont know if he will survie since he have a nasty infection, question is should i harvest organs now before he die ?Anyway my attention again turn towards the captured enemy and i thought should i convert him to help me, but realized he was a bad man who would create trouble, so I stole his organs... or maybe I should say i tried, since my surgeon failed again and again and he bleed to death. At the moment I have a good solid base with electricty and tons of food, but it might soon be almost empty due to infections and loos of people.But who need people anyway, I also have a few pets that breed  ;-)   In another new game my base again was attacked by pirates and they throw grenades that set fire to my fields and my house since it was build of wood. To make the story short i tried to put out the fire, but lost most of my people. One reason where the solar batterys started burning and exploded, another reason was they simply could not take the heat and lack of oxygen. But maybe the most fun thing happned when my last survior tried ran from the fire and tried to hide inside my mine. In there I also had my pets, 2x black panters that I was hoping would breed more panters so i could have my own panter army i could use to kill pirates with... Anyway i run in there and hide for the fire, however in this very moment i realized i forgot one very important thing... I forgot to let them out so they could hunt food, so they where very hungry.. so they jumped me from behind and that was the end of my life..   but at least I could see their small room started to burn at the time my life flashed before my eyes. (Revenge).Nice game ;-)			"

								I've been playing this game since about Alpha 8 or 9, which was about a year and a half ago, and the game is still fun today. You probably already know what the game is, but you're basically trying to have as much control as you can over a survival situation for a group of colonists, even if you sometimes have no control. The game has so much replayability, because there are several different biomes, events and scenarios which call for different responses.The most amusing end of a colony I've had is when a power conduit blew up, causing a giant fire which exposed all of my indoor areas. As soon as the fire got put out, a giant herd of boomrats (rats that explode when they die) entered the area, looking for blood. My colonists had nowhere to run, and ended up blowing themselves up or getting mobbed by explosive rats if they tried to run. While I was somewhat dissapointed in the timing of the situation, I couldn't help chuckle at what had just conspired.However, I have had a problem for a while, and that's getting past much more than a year. While occasionaly it's due to something along the lines of the aforementioned scenario, it often happens because colonists tend to break down way to often, over things that can't be helped. Whenever this happens they won't eat, and during the most common breakdown they'll strip off their clothes (which doesn't make a lot of sense). This often means my colonists will starve or die of hypothermia if I don't do anything, but the only existing option is to arrest them. This doesn't make sense, as it means I have to take the colonist to a prisoner bed and they won't rejoin the colony until a warden successfully recruits them. This can often take more than a season (15 in game days) depending on your luck. You will be unable to use that colonist for that entire time, which could cripple your colony if that colonist was vital to the whole operation. There needs to be something to do other than arresting them, because the whole ordeal makes no sense (why wouldn't my colonist just automatically rejoin the colony after coming to their senses?) and there's not a whole lot you can do in the first year to prevent all causes of negative mood. That's not to mention that a scratch scar will cause the slightest bit of pain, and give the colonist a negative feeling. The game is still fun from time to time, but it's getting old because I keep having to start a new colony when my previous one dies from the above issue. I play on permadeath so I won't attempt to go back to an autosave to revert any of the bad things that happen, but the amount of times I have to arrest my colonists to keep them from dying of starvation is ridiculous.

								I tend to avoid Early Access games these days, but I already bought this in 2013 ... and I'm happy to see the game has matured quite a bit and there's plenty of content now and the gameplay doesn't feel linear anymore.I'm finding the greatest aspect of Dwarf Fortress exists here as well - losing is fun! Your colony will fall and you will realize what you could've done differently ... and then you'll die another way next time. It's been fun so far, although getting the entire colony killed off by a pack of angry deer feels wrong and frustrating - even though I did provoke them and sure deserved the outcome :)Quite enjoyable in its current state, although a bit rough in many ways.

								I purchased this before it was live in Steam--when you could only buy it from the Ludeon website.Loveitloveitloveitloveit. If you liked Banished, it's like that--except with more... spirit, and a certain space western vibe.It's one of those, uh, little builders where you can't really control the person, but you can dictate that ""stuff needs to be built,"" or ""this needs to be harvested."" And they'll do that. Add it to a little priority queue. And this one'll be lazy. And that one will prefer working at night. And that one will want to marry the other. But the other is married to a third. And then a radiation storm rolls over your colony--and suddenly it's no longer safe to go outside, but that's where your crops are, so you pray that you have enough food in storage.And then the worms break through the cave walls!The music is pretty good, too. ;)Beyond all of that, my only real complaint--even now, having played it as long as I have--is that the UI is a little difficult to navigate. The buttons down at the bottom of the screen, that is. If you're not sure what you're doing, it's not entirely obvious, and it takes some getting used to.			"

								This game is absolutely ridiculous and ridiculously hard.  I love it.The commands are largely simple, but the interactions and complexity are huge-- reminiscent of NetHack, Dwarf Fortress, or the like, but much more approachable.  The game is HARD.  Progress is hugely satisfying, but defeat is frequent (and often hilarious).I recommend getting the ""Prepare Carefully"" mod, and that's it.  Even WITH ""Prepare Carefully"", the game is really hard, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable challenge.The ""Narrator AI"" gimmick is a neat approach, and it works really well.  It's most fun to use the slacky relaxed settings until you have a big♥♥♥♥♥colony, then switch it over to something harder.  Oh, the chaos and mayhem.The backstory engine is surprising, too!  Your colonists will surprise you, and will actually be interesting.  Well, except for the graphics, but you get used to that pretty quick.Great work, guys!  Keep bolting on!PS:  Oh, yes-- if you ever feel your colony has become invincible:1. Buy 250 fertilized chicken eggs.2. Wait.3. Laugh at little chicks everywhere.4. Several minutes of business as usual.5. Starve.6. Realize that chickens need to eat-- and they did.			"

Highly recommend for its ease of playability, level of control, enjoyment, and originality. Its far more than just a game that is similar to Dwarf Fortress. With mod support, it just adds even more ways of enjoying the game. I honestly can not think of a negative aspect to the game. Some may be concerned that its ""Early Access,"" but Tynan Sylvester the developer, has regular monthly updates and is very active with communiating what to expect with a new update, and goes over what has been added which always adds to the game, instead of taking away.

								I have been playing this game now for some time, and backed it on Kickstarter in 2013.  Since this time the game has continued to grow and develop at a great pace.  This review is based on Alpha 14, the last version before Steam release.  I estimate that I have approximately 200 hours of play.The setting for this game is a group of people in a sci-fi frontier backdrop (Firefly) trying to survive.  Rimworld is described as a ""Sci-fi Colony Sim"" by the creators, whilst accurate it is a rather dull description of what is a very fun and exciting game.  This game has the depth of Dwarf Fortress with the aesthetics and visual style of Prison Architect.  Throw in a great 'western' (as in cowboy) soundtrack and you have something pretty special.  This is a niche game, it is not for people who prefer form over function, but after watching the trailer you will know if that is you or not.This game is hard on its default / average settings.  Your colonists will get sick and die, you will run out of food, wildlife and raiders will attack, colonists will freeze to death or go mad, and natural phenomenon will thwart best laid plans.  Luckily, the amount of customisation available is huge.  You really can tweak most options in the game, by changing your starting climates, picking your storyteller type and difficulty and selecting custom rules.  You can select a random group of survivors or re-roll them as many times as you like.  Options that are not changeable in game are often mod-able.  The Ludeon Studios forum has hundreds of mods available, although many will likely require updating to be compatible with the Steam release.  I would like to thank the creator of “EdB Prepare Carefully” for making a mod that I find it hard to play the game without.The sandbox in this game is rather large.  If you wish to build a small cannibalistic tribe (yes, you really can) that live in wooden huts in a jungle, you can.  If you want to build into a mountainside for the true Dwarf Fortress feel, you can.  Want to tame animals to attack hostile entities or help with hauling, guess what, you can.The story progresses nicely at a pace determined by the storyteller options you selected at the start.  A typical playthrough will have you rushing at the start to get shelter, and food.  As you expand and more colonists join you will look towards researching new technology, and upgrading security measures.  After a source of electricity is constructed, you can really start to grow.  All the while you will have a number of challenges, some brutal, some comical.  I recall one raid that followed after a solar flareMy only criticism of the game is that at the time of writing this, you cannot visit other colonies on the world map to raid or trade with them.  I would not be surprised however if this changes in the future.EDIT: Regarding the only criticism above, it has now been added!			"

Its top down like Prison Achitect but more base building.  There are huge micromanagement options should you want to play that way.  Am always reloading post raid as the colony folk tend to die a lot with me at the helm. Anyway, great game. Cant wait to see how it evolves (fingers crossed nicer UI).			"

								This story came from a friend on his first time playing the game.  I bought it for him as a gift just to hear what kind of stories he would experience in the world.""My first party on normal ironman mode consisted of an Asian shop keeper with a fear of currency and an albino sweedish girl from a medieval world warzone who tended to burn victims and, because of this, developed a phobia of fires.  They were siblings.  I also had a vat-grown clone trooper who spent most of his adult life as a body guard.Things went well.  I ignored the tutorial to just jump right in and got most of it down patt.  I built a storage shed, I covered a walled-in fire pit and had a barracks.  Things were going well enough until an iriate squirrel attacked my camp.  It entered the barracks and attacked the albino.  Her trained war husky just kind of watched as her face was mauled.Then it got a sniff of supple clone flesh and eons of evolution took over as it hounded my veteran soldier.  He freaked out and ran for the hills.  The squirrel gave chase.He ran for about thirty miles until he reached the ocean where he swam out to sea to get away.  The squirrel swam after him.  This continued until I figured out I had to militia my people to get them to defend themselves.  By the time he got back to camp he had to get a finger amputated and he developed a life long phobia of squirrels.  We live in a forest so he spends about a third of the day crying in the corner of the barracks as squirrels get too close to camp.As of right now, a pack of Timber Wolves has moved in to my camp because they liked my fire shed.""I approve of this game.

								I have had rimworld since i first discovered it kickstarter page, back when it was a janky pre-alpha. It showed so much promise, and by the gods has it delivered. Yes its early access, but in its current stage of alpha 14 it has so much to offer. It is amazing how much this game has grown. Some people think its to highly priced, but is worth that price and more and when its finished, when ever that is, it will be worth so much more. Now some might say this game is developed slowly, and yes that is true, but the dev team is dedicated. They have worked so hard to get the game where it is today. The updates are not insignificant either, so slow they may come but stacked with new content they will be. Not once have I looked at rimworld and regretted purchasing it, or felt like I wasted money. This game is makes early access worth having around, despite the issues seen in other EA games.Now for some things you might do in this game. Build a colony. Grow food. Make clothes, guns and stabby sticks. Get attacked by raiders. Kill Raiders. Capture survivors.Get attacked by robot bugs.Watch brave colonist draw robot bug's fire.Be awed by brave colonist's bullet dodging skills.Cry as a second unfortunate colonist takes one to the brain.They lived!Nope, unfortunate colonist is brain dead. End they're life with mercy. "

Me personaly this game is a godsend, I would highly reccomend this game to those who played PA (Prison Architect). The gameplay is a 10/9 due to the incompletion of the game and the fact that it could use a bit more content (But thats what mods are for). There is one thing I would like to change about the game is recruitment encouters, Say the (This person has joined your colony shabang) I hate the fact that half the time these people simply murder my dudes hanging on to dear life due to the fact I live on hydroponics and my gaint horde of wolf babies eat EVERYTHING in my tiny little unground bunker. There should be a option to uhh.. How would you say stop the ""Breeding Proccess"" Between two tamed animals of the same type and diffrent gender.

								I read a lot of reviews before buying this, and I had a few qualms about it, but decided to give it a try anyway.1. A lot of people describe how god-awful difficult this is, and how you can easily forget one thing that screws over your entire colony you've poured over 10 hours into. Well, it really depends on the difficulty you play it on. Those players must've been playing on the hardest difficulty to screw themselves over so hard. I played on medium difficulty with little problems. Not to mention the load/save system. 2. Some people talked about getting a massive bug that destroys your colony, or makes it unable to load, or something that makes it so you have to restart from scratch. I played over 30 hours, 3 different colonies, using several mods and didn't run into one of these bugs. For early access, that's amazing, and very rare.3. I heard some talk about how mid to late game is boring. I'm not sure what they're talking about. I found it thrilling, finally able to deal with everything that comes my way, not on the verge of starving, or dying to disease. It was awesome! Of course, I was using several mods.4. This game looks extremely similar to Prison Architect. Lemme tell ya, it's nothing like that game at all. It's in the same genre, management, sure, but that's it. They have completey different takes on it. Prison Architect is about having massive amounts of nameless drones carry out the work for you while you manage everything. This game, on the other hand, is about having just a few people, and leveling up their skills, while they have intense inter-personal relationships. It's about managing a few peoples' time effeciently. Also, Prison Architect, from beta to launch to this day, is buggy as all hell. This game far out-strips it in that category. Overall, this game is absolutely worth it. I haven't ""completed"" a colony yet, but I've had fun getting to it.			"

								After 75 hours I finally beat the game after 4 attemps!Ok lets try to describe this game for others:The game is a mix between an random generated world, mixed with base building like in Prison Architect, Unique ""Characters"" that are somekind randomized.I know it really sounds simple - in the core it is - but in my opinion it's hard to master!There are random event that can change everything...Your colony is up and running?Dry Thunderstorm which spreads 4 fires at once over the whole map and all trees start burning and your only have 4 colonists who will die in the flames... Next round i thought about cutting all the trees near my building so the fire can't spread that fast!Srsly I love this game it gave me sooooo much joy! I'll keep this game in my mind.Although the game doesn't really have a real story, but all the random events and encounters telling their own story - despite the fact that the story will develop in you mind!Pro:+ Unique Gameplay+ Good Mix of Genres+ High Replayability+ Random Events*Cons:- Random events*- Sometimes not enough options for certain mechanics*Sometimes those Random Events are unbalanced, therefore it can be a Pro/Con.

								It took me 43 hours of game time to get a wonderful base going. I thought this was a good time to start raiding the pirates. I got my three best snipers in a line ready to fire. I killed about 5 of the pirates before they started shooting back. My fragger threw a grenade, right next to two of my guys. Surprise, surprise they didn't die. After the raid was over I found one of my guys with a shredded leg. I got him back to base and prepared to replace the leg with a robotic one. After a day I saw a little red box with the word ""ridiculous"". I looked at my guys heath and he had two broken arms with brain damage. I thought he would be fine. Until a week later he went crazy and gunned down my entire base after picking up my only minigun. ""9/10 would ruined my life with more video games again""			"

This game was smoothly addicting right off the bat and the stories I've witnessed have been amazing.  My first playthrough ended hilariously.  I captured a raider and threw him in a cell.  Shortly thereafter a heat wave hit.  All 4 of my colonists got severe heatstroke.....and promptly went to their beds unresponsive.  The prisoner must have sensed his opportunity.  He beat down the prison door and was loose in my base.  I was mortified that he'd destroy everything but he went for the front door & beat it down for his freedom.....awww sigh of relief.  But no wait- not so fast!!! On the way out he decided to set fire to a power line. Again not terrible because the line was pretty far away from my wooden walls.  He then ran into an angry tortoise.  The tortoise bit him.....he fell back with surprise and stumbled into his own fire. He wandered into my wooden walls panicked & ablaze - fell down next to them with his last breath. He promptly burnt to a crisp.  The walls caught fire from his burning corpse. Every poor colonist laying unconsious in their beds ended in fire that day on the rim.Rip my little dudes....ripYou can't make this stuff up.  Buy it now- this game will not disappoint			"

								This is one of those career-wrecking games you should only buy if you have decent discipline and self-control and if you can make yourself go to bed each night. I will say RimWorld still needs polish and content but it's amazing how playable and detailed it already is at Alpha 16 and I have faith in the developer. It all comes together so well I don't think I could sum it up properly even if I wrote a lengthy review. Steep learning curve and lots of opportunities to mess up but I think that's just how you're supposed to experience it.To get a feel for RimWorld, just imagine if in the original Alien Ripley had rolled something like ""incapable of scary, violent, hauling"" and then went off to play horseshoes while everyone else got killed.

								When I decided to give this game a try, I was expecting a simple and fun little base builder, but I couldn't have been more wrong. For an early access game, Rimworld is packed with content that will last your for a long time. With a charming artstyle, addictive gameplay, great music, devoted development team, and massive modding community, this game is sure to be a success. Like I said, this game doesn't feel like an early access game at all. It has enough content to be released now and still get great reviews, which is always a good thing when buying a game. And even when you feel like your done with the game, take a look at the steam workshop, because the modding community is one of the most passionant I've ever seen. For the $15 price, I would definintely recommend this game, however that doesn't mean it's perfect.My first playthrough, I had no idea what I was doing, and my colony immediately crashed and burned, and even after my 10th playthrough, I'm still learning new things you can do in this game, and it's also not easy what so ever. That being said, this game is much more complicated that it looks, and the learning curve can be kinda frightening.However, if you're a fan of building games, management games, strategy games, or top down combat games, you're sure to like this game, and spend a lot of time with it.

								Advice: USE MODs. There's a MOD to configure your starting party, so you don't have to roll and reroll and reroll again and again just trying to start a good game. Also there's a developer mode, and it can be used in relax to ""cheat"". So, the difficulty in the game can be very flexible in the early-mid game. Once you learn the way the game and each storyteller behave, start again and again in more complex situations. Recommendation?: Totally, BUY THE GAME!. Even if you get it from other source... BUY IT. =)			"

								Rimworld: A game of Drama! Intensity! Love! Now, I do not like to review games on steam, but I feel as if this game needs this thumbs up. It is a strategic colony builder in which i LOVE. It is in alpha, but it feels as if it is a full game. The modding helps the game even more. The people who create mods for this game are good at it and their mods make the game more complete than it is already is. To sum up all my thoughts because I am bad at writing reviews: Get the game, try it, if you like it consider helping the developers even more by buying the backstory in game or the pirate king update.

								First colony, going well, probably making some mistakes, no big deal, still learning. Colonist joins, make her some clothes. Summer comes along and all of a sudden she's setting fires and burning the whole colony down. Turns out she had the pyromaniac trait. Lesson learned! Next colony, I learned that when a deer gets mad at you, ALL the deer get mad at you. Turns out antlers are very well suited to their purpose. Lesson learned! Third colony, going well, get a request for help from a potential colonist. Sounds good, I'll help you! Let's see what you know how to do...Pyromaniac trait. Close game without saving. 10/10 would fail horribly again.			"

								When i first saw this game on upcoming early access games it just seemed like a ordinary ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ea game that devs had already abandoned, i was not interested in it until release. Overwhelmingly positive reviews, interesting gameplay and fairly original idea got me buying the game, gotta say i am not disappointed at all. The game has incredibly high replayability value since there are so many different events and the map is randomly generated. What in my opinion makes Rimworld really unique are the colonists everyone has their own traits, skills and weaknesses. Mood meter for every colonist keeps the game interesting since you can't just build a huge inpenetrable wall that has nothing but farms inside of it, that would only lead to breakdowns and insanity, raiders would eventually get trough because everyone is losing their mind and are unable to repair the walls. There is just the right amount of complexity to not make playing boring. Overall amzing game 10/10 m8			"

								Well,after all this time,I don't remember a good enough story to tell. But,there was this one time where I led a group of tribals,and gave the leader an A.I chip,Bionic arms and legs,all Synthetic organs... Hell,if I saw that guy,I'd run and tell my faction to worship him. Besides,everyone who fought him ended up casually persuaded to join or shot to death by powerful,futuristic weapons.EDIT:New story! After seeing chapter one of Rock Paper Shotgun's ""Bogdan's Rest"" I made Big Boss Hotel. With a LOT of mods,including Glittertech and more furniture,fashionrimsta,and MORE,I built a massive hotel in a Boreal Forest inside of a hotel. We had Kevin ""Boss"" Lewis,with great social skills,Craig Boone,who keeps talking about how his wife is dead,but then shoots millions more to death,and Shauna ""Food"" Gray,who makes food. We quickly made a grand entrance hall,and right above the entrance,we made a massive power room.  To the left,we dug further into the corner and built our rec center,where our first infestation was. Boss beat some bugs to death with his baton,but Boone came in and killed the rest in around one shot while Food ran outside and hid behind a tree. We then dug below the rec room,and expanded to the rooms. The first 2 were guest rooms,and the next 2 were for staff. Staff rooms were larger and had colours based on the personality and name of the character. We dug so far down,and then came our first visitors! They were a group of Outlanders and had some good stuff to trade. They all went into thier rooms. One guy brought some drugs,he began smoking flake,then died. He overdosed or something. We happily took his stuff,and when Boone was wearing his jacket,noone suspected a thing. After a while,they left,and were so amazed they turned over the rest of thier drugs to us! Remember kids,don't do drugs,give them to random strangers!1 season LaterARK! GET AT THE DOOR! BOONE! GRAB THE RIFLE! COOKE! GET OUT THERE!Fourty Rhinoceri outside,bashing at the doors,invading Teh Coive (Our stockpile) and bashing our Enmergency Exit. Boone one shots them all,until they blindly run away to maul a caribous. Cooke charges out there and shoots the legs off of 3 of the beasts. They fall over as Ark guards the entrance,blindly firing her assault rifle at the monsters. Our turrets finally regain power from the solar flare,and mow down the rhinos. As the others begin to wander off,as they've gotten bored of death,we all rush back in and go to the hospital. Down below,a prison break occurs. The Pirate Leader we captured has decided enough is enough. With his useless Lackey,Justin,they break out and grab some wood from a nearby room,under construction. Boss rushes to deal with them,as he is our noble warden. He whacks Maker on his head,and as Justin draws near,Boss flees upward to get more reinforcements. Our pregant,and brave dog,Taffy,charges forth. She bites Maker's arm,and he whacks her tail and legs with his wood. Maker,in a smidge of pain,takes a bow from an equipment locker in a room,and shoots Taffy. She dies in one hit. Her middle-stage fetus,is never shown the beauty of this world. In a fit of rage,Boss charges Maker and beats him senseless. He knocks him over,he falls in pain. Justin,in fear that his beloved boss was struck down,rushes back to his cell. Later,we put Taffy in a Sarcophagus. Maker recovers and stays in his cell,as the hated Dog-Killer. Our colony mourns the death of Taffy still. The save continues on to this day.     Get RimWorld today for many great stories and tales of drama,action,bloodshed,and Romance!			"

								Incredible, Gave me many hours of enjoyment and many hours of entertainment and anger.This game is extremely unforgiving when it comes to making mistakes, you have little room for mistakes. Due to the fact that the disater system is random, it could seem like you never get a break in between each problem, or too far apart. So it makes you prepare ahead for anything. There are a few crashes here and there, but the game is easy to load up again so it is not a big deal.You get very attached to your colonists, so when one of them may die, it kind of breaks your heart.Anyway, I ended up beating the game and shipping my colonists off to find a glitterworld planet or even onto another planet to start all over again. So now I am sad that they are all gone and wont be playing for a little while :(			"

								I was hesitant about this game at first because of the clunky looking low-res graphics.This is an Incredible game, and I highly reccomend it.With so many mods, scenarios, geographical options and characters replayability is as close to unlimited as it gets.  Sorry, gotta go.  My herd of alpacas needs hay and my surgeon needs to harvest the livers and hearts from the summunabiches we captured who attacked my beloved base.  By the way, you're looking kinda haggard, lemme craft you a few advanced bionic limbs and organs and get you a better gun and armor...  Maybe you need a brain stimulator with a luciferium rib- implant if you're not smart enough to try this game out right now.			"

								Literally about as close as you can get to an acessable Dwarf Fortress. If that doesn't get your attention then let me expand upon that statement: this is a game of survival. With the new scenario system you have many options to set the starting parameters but what this game is really about is surviving in a colony that you have made from scratch. You will manage your colonists to gather materials, construct structures and furniture, defend your base, farm and hunt food and research. How will you do this? You often will not; you will fail and it will be fun. But when you do and manage to not only survive but thrive the sense of accomplishment is strong. Check out videos if you are still wondering if this is for you but this is one of my favourite games and it isn't even finished.			"

								Surprisingly good - this is the best way of describing RimWorld.  The last time I played an indie game with as much potential for replayability was FTL.  If you liked FTL, I'll take a leap here and say you will like RimWorld.  Very different in its concept, but similar in it's addictiveness and replayability which for me is really important.Each time you start a new colony the experience is slightly different.  Obviously there are similarities between games which have had me sighing a little when a colony goes wrong and I have start a new one, but on a whole its quite fresh each time a new game is started.  You build a base from scratch and collect resources, but the little people you start with have real vices and personalities, some are hard workers, some lazy, some hate each other, some spawn new little people if they get together!  Pets can be trained if you have a animal friendly little person too, and they can help fight off attackers or fetch resources.  This can sound gimmicky and a little micro-management heavy, and I was a little sceptical when I read about the AI story teller, but actually it really does work and is fun and balanced.If you're like me and prefer a permadeath game RimWorld comes with that option, and its great, knowing if something goes wrong (and it often does) you just have to keep going till your team recover or all is lost, and that makes the experience deeper, because sometimes you start to feel the journey with your characters, particularly if some get killed or maimed.  I actually got properly sad once when one character died and then his pet dog died defending him afterwards, I ended that game, and that was the end of that story.  The beauty is, you can then start again with new people and have another 'largely' unique adventure.Give it a go, it’s worth it just for the experience, it’s quite a unique game.			"

								Well here is the story of my most recent colony:  A sea ice oneLanded with three colonists. Mason,  Farrukh, and JaydenJayden was my crack shot great against raidersMason was a great researcher and constructer Farrukh grew food and cookedI get a survival shelter up, got power and a heater get up a research bench even individual bedrooms for my people.  An electric stove.On day 6 I recieve an alert ""Manhunter Pack"".  It is only three Muffalo I thought I could handle it.To say the least we had to leave behind Mason's foot and Jayden's eye. I didn't even have enough resources to build a butcher table. 3 raids later I still have my colonists and then I get the alert ""Siege""  I grab my sniper rifles and head out. Half of my base is destroyed before hep arives including my power so hello ""slept in the cold"".  By now I am worried abot my numbers.  So accept the person who causes my demise.He was Table a young man a great colonist by my standards.  But the raid that comes is 10 pirates with 4 personal shields.  I grab my guns and hope for the best. I do ok utill the person with the doomsday launcher comes The only one who remains is Mason who is also, inconvienintly my Brawler. He dies in the next raidBut the game decides to troll me and gives me another colonist so I pack my bags with all my food and leave for the tundra.  After a fight with a hungry fox and an infection the game over screen popped upAfter playing 1,500 hours of this game I can easily give it 100/10 and say it is my favorite game.

Manage to build a base and defend against countless attacks from raiders with assault rifles, grenades, and sniper rifles using nothing but spears and bows.  Manage to tame 10 alpacas and traded for high tech military gear using the never ending supply of crafted clothes from my alpacas. Poison fallout spread throughout the land, where we rescued a couple alpacas yet to be tamed before they would die to the poison.

								Don't let the lack of time played fool you, I've played this game for probably a hundred hours before its release on steam. This is a game I love and keep coming back to, each game is different and with the inclusions Alpha 14 have added make the game even more awesome! I can see this game becoming quiet the gem once it's fully released. Each playthrough has its ups and downs, you find yourself attached to certain characters, you swear when a swarm of aliens spawn inside your base and kill everyone and you relish at the thought of capturing prisoners and harvesting their body parts to sell on the black market. This really is an awesome game, highly recommended!			"

								Let me tell you a love story about Angus(M) and Pitts(F).After  establishing what I consider to be a 'OK' base I realize Angus is starting to have a lot of breakdowns. The caring and loving man that I am I find out Angus is getting rejected by Pitts for marriage. Poor guy, so I make him a completely seperate house so he never has to see that who**res face again as Pitts shows no remorse for her actions. After one of his constant breakdowns (I still don't know if he was asking her everyday or what) he goes nuts, not about Pitts but BECAUSE HE ATE FOOD WITHOUT A TABLE! So after my hunter smashes his face in I decide Angus is too much trouble for his worth and let him die as a horrible infection spread throughout his body.Now for the happy ending, I decide because Pitts thought it was cool to play hard to get she has to eat Angus's flesh which turns her crazy (she was 'sad' Angus died, lying dou**che). Hunter (I think his name was Lester?) smashes her face too, and then strips down and starts walking around because he wasn't a big fan of being used as a modern day executioner. I think this game has a pretty accurate outlook on modern day relationships, best dating sim 2016.			"

								This is a drama generator disguised as a game. You could just go through the motions and play this challenging survival game. Or you could take a few moments to actually read about the characters you are playing with and watch the story unfold.In one game, an overweight male cook crash lands on a RimWorld with two naked female sex slaves. The women are constantly frustrated at their lack of clothes. Mr. Cook is constantly hitting on the girls and trying to get lucky, and is constantly rejected. The girls who have the necessary survival skills between them (except cooking) ignore the cook's advances. The cook eventually goes insane and runs around in a crazy stupor until he eventually starves to death. The girls who cannot cook eventually get depressed over having to eat the corpses of animals they hunted raw and end up fighting. The one with medical skills is knocked out. The survivor has no medical or hunting skills. They both starve to death...In another game a family consisting of a daughter who is a researcher with some medical skills, her mother the botanist, and the ex husband/father who was a soldier, crash land near the pole with their pet Husky. The botanist can't do anything without a hydroponic set up as nothing grows in the cold and ice. The mother can also cook. The daughter can hunt and cook. And the father can build a shelter. They manage to build a small, heated space and have plans to create an indoor hydroponic set up to feed themselves as there are very few things to hunt out on the ice.Then the daughter is attacked by a polar bear while hunting a rabbit. The father rescues her. While she is in bed recovering, the father and mother can't take the stress of being in such close company anymore and start fighting. The mother is injured. The father has no medical skills. The daughter gets an infection which can't be treated and gets gradually worse. There's a short in the battery room and power is knocked out - with no power there's no heat. Mother - with some medical skills - gets hypothermia. Father can't repair the battery as there's no metal left, and the daughter had the mining skills. Besides - the polar bears are still out there...Eventually food runs out - the daughter dies of her infection. The mother dies of hypothermia. The father can't bear to eat the corpses of his family and starves to death. The dog survives by eating their corpses. Eventually, a wanderer stumbles upon the settlement. He figures he could just live there, mine some metal and fix the hydroponic set up. There's no food, but he has no problem with eating this frozen human protein lying around. He survives for days, repairs the battery compartment, and is re-buidling the hydroponics.A few days later an escape pod crashes near the shelter. The old man rescues the young woman - the girl of his dreams! He locks her in a room while she recovers, hoping to woo her and convince her to stay with him, that cannibalism isn't all that bad and that people are actually quite tasty. But she rejects him. Eventually he goes insane from digging up the frozen corpses and butchering them, and in his madness he attacks the dog. The dog incapacitates him outside the shelter, and the old man - unable to get back inside - freezes to death. The young woman locked in her cell starves to death...10/10 would turn cannibal and abduct women again!			"

								Amazingly fun colony management game that combines the pleasure of designing a colony for security and efficiency with an awesome sci-fi world that feels incredibly fleshed out down to the relationships your colonists have with other npcs and the other groups that inhabit the world. If you want to make an incredibly secure base that can out last any siege or create a safe haven for your colonists to live, work, and get married, or barely survive in a barren ice sheet by cannibalizing everyone that visits, then you will love rimworld. (Very little time played on steam but I have hundreds of hours before it came out on steam)			"

If the video and concept look even slightly interesting to you, but this game, you won't be dissapointed.  Be prepared for a learning curve though, and check out the mod collections.			"

								RimWorld is simple in concept (survive and build your colony), but in its execution it's unfathomably deep, to the point where it's actually imtimidating when you start a colony for the first time. Once you ease into it though, you'll be hooked. The fact that its early access is only a good thing in this case, because it means more free content will be added to a game that already feels entirely finished and polished. Unless you hate 2-D games or the survival genre, play this. 10/10.			"

I have 100+ games of various types, but none of them are like Rimworld.   Some of the reviews have gone to some length to explain why its a great game, but I would suggest you won't know you like - ok THOROUGHLY ENJOY this game until you just buy it.  ( did I mention you should buy Rimworld? )Probably the only short coming has to do with the interface and how you are walked through the initial learning curve of the game.  This, by no means, makes it a bad game but would definitely be my suggestion for improving.			"

								Had this game for awhile now, and really happy they brought it over to steam.  Right off the bat you will notice how the art style and UI are very similar to the prison architect, which is a good thing becuase that game is amazing as well.  One of my all time favorite game generes is building.  Games like sim city, ceasar, prison architect, civ city rome, ect.  It's so refreshing to have a new game to play that brings all kinds of awesome elements to the city building genere.  The storytelling AI is cool, in the fact that it creates some cool situtations that brake up boring day to day operations.  It's rewarding to see your colonists strive, get married, survive a raid, and rescue surviovrs.  +City Builder+Storytelling AI+Gameplay+Unique Characters-No Multiplayer			"

								Love, love this game. Been playing for a couple alphas now (since 12) and watching Let's Play videos before that. And it just keeps getting better and better, And the best part of that is that it started out great. This game has been super stable, the only thing ever really causing any issues that I have seen is mods interfering with each other, which is purely an issue with operator error (yes, me, the fool poking at the keyboard.)Other Early Access games need to be stacked up next to this one for comparison. They will nearly all come up very sadly lacking. This game is a masterpiece. Even without the awesome mods this game is great. Many will say ""well the mods are what make it really great"" and while they are certainly correct, the reasons the mods are so good is that the dev planned and coded for those mods to be able to be made from very early on in this game and it shows!

								Rimworld is, frankly, one of the best games I've played all year. Its a great mix of roguelike/permadeath, survival, and mangament games. Each of your colonists has a unique set of traits and skills, making them better or worse at a variety of activities. You gotta manage your base, the moods and needs of your colonists, all while slowly teching up and building a spaceship so your colonists can continue the cycle of traveling the stars and seeding rimworlds. Each playthrough is unique. There are a variety of different random events, some good: like getting a herd of puppies to self tame themselves to your colony, and some are bad, like getting attacked by an army of space pirates. There are a lot of details that make the game very in depth, despite its highly cyclical nature. Even good, talented players will likely fail their first half a dozen playthroughs, I know I've come nowhere close to victory after all the hours I've put in. Honestly, it doesn't seem to matter, I have fun each time, and every time its a little different.			"

Jack fires just one shot - BAM; and Fred is dead.Horrified that Jack killed his brother Jim kicks Jack out of his bedroom and refuses to have anything to with any of them.Meanwhile Sally, the one straight female character here,has been trying to reconcile all these guys, finally snaps and refuses to leave her room even to eat.Seriously the amazing stories that are organically grown out of the randomness that this game provides are amazing.Or my other run;Things were going strong into winter.When toxic fallout hit.As it his a lone wander joined, running through the toxic gas.Everyone was safe, we had heaps of food, we just need to sit still till things are safe.But no, the newbie who joined is a pyromaniac. He starts burning things, he runs outside and start smashing my solar panels (the only thing from keeping everyone from freezing to death), He attacks the other colonists and generally threatens everything. In the end he had to go, he was shoot trying to destroy our batteries. The fires are out, then suddenly we are attacked by 8 dudes with rocketlaunchers and frag grenades.ripping open my base (in the middle of toxic fallout). The run in, its a mess but somehow we fight them off.The rest of the winter is a fight, but we make it, half way through spring the toxic fallout finishes, my hapines fades as I then get hit by a cold snap and an infestation.Stories like this are what elevates this beyond other management games.

								This game even though it is in early access is more polished then many games at release. So if you're typically staying away from early access due to lack of content and polish then you might want to make an exception for this game.As the game description says one could call it Dwarf Fortress with a pretty interface, but that would be selling this game short. While it shares many traits with dwarf fortress it also has many of it's own special things. But in any case be prepared to lose several nights to this game by just ""finishing this one thing"".What is really refreshing is that this is doing survival right, it's always a struggle, and not unlike many other survival games a walk in the park once you get over a certain hurdle. The storyteller will always find something new to throw at you to see if you can handle it.			"

								Sawyer looked after every one. Her last two friends ultimately succumbed to their wounds in their beds while she desperately tended to their dying needs. Overcome with grief, she decided to exact revenge on the prisoner they kept in the holding cell. She quickly executed the prisoner and left the corpse where it was.For the next few days she was dead to the world as she slept to heal from the wound incurred from the last raid. Unbeknownst to her, a basket of berries had kept the cold storage room door ajar and the last of her food had spoilt. Though she could have resolved to start over and rebuild, she said ""$&# it"" and headed to the prisoner's cell.A few days later, this message:Sawyer, Doctor has gone berserk! The final straw was: Ate corpse.Sawyer was last seen running into the woods, engaging in melee combat with a boomalope.I hate/love this game.			"

								If you like any kind of strategy / sim / survival (hell, even space) games, BUY RIMWORLD ! It is amazing how much ""game"" you get for the money.. And it is done by one dude ! Tywin Lannister ! (Or something like that). And big kudos for that ! It is amazingly detailed, but still very easy to get right. Especially with the new tutorial and learner in v.0.15.  And yes you maybe think its just Prison Architect in space... But after 10 min. of playing you quickly see, that Rimworld is very different from PA... But don't buy it for the graphics.. It its nice to look at and there are no glitches or bugs, but you dont play the game because of beautiful graphics.. You play because there is just soooo much stuff you can do !Oh and... Install some mods for it ! It only makes the game better and more enjoyable. Worth every penny ! 9 / 10			"

								One of the best resource management games that also generates a story in real time from the deep mechanics. First game: incompetent hunter with rifle gets bitten in the right eye by a tortoise and becomes unconscious, rescued but forever disfigured. Other colonists will be disgusted by the hunters looks and thus have a negative relationship with him that will lead to a negative downward trend that spirals out of control leading to ultimate doom.

								<h1>In space no one can hear you do horrible things in the name of survival.</h1>I don't recall exactly when I purchased this game, but I do remember it was durring the kickstarter period. Pretty sure it's been two years since then and I'll admit that at first I didn't play it all that much. The game was pretty barebones, hit 'start' and next thing you know your given three colonists, and a small handful of supplies. You were to survive as long as possible and it was fun for a time, but then I stopped. Time passed, and I got an email about an update and picked it up again. Stockpiles were tweaked to make things a bit more interesting and eventually I gave up and moved on again. More time passed, another email, and more new features. More boredom, dropped it again, more time, another email. And while that seems bad, it's probably one of the best things about this game.Most 'early access' games I've bought were, frankly trainwrecks. But Rimworld is diffrent, yes the updates are a touch spread out but in that time nothing but good has come from them. Every new feature was something that improved my experience as a player. I've yet to see an update that made things worse and to be frank I don't think I ever will. This is probably one of the best regularly updated games you could grab on steam so what I'm saying here is, don't let ""early access"" scare you away.Combat in the game is kinda difficult, but in the way that ""Realistic"" difficulty in a first person shooter is challanging but not ""impossible"" if you catch my meaning. Throwing a skilled melee weapons user at someone with practically no experience in firearms who's carrying a shotgun ends rather poorly for the person with the knife but in a way, it's to be expected. The game will throw increasingly challnging threats at you as your colony gets more 'Impressive' so if you're worried about getting overwhelemed quickly try to avoid gathering up materials that are valueable and hold little to no combat use and you have no need for. (Gold, Silver, Jade... These are things to avoid.) But perhaps the most impressive feature of the game, is how easy it is to mod. Don't like that concreete is classified as ""ugly"" neither do I! Single line to change, throws off the balance a bit but not too much. Wanna use Fallout themed weapons and armor? There's a mod for that. Want to get access to more and better bionics for your colonists outside the basic ones? There's a mod for that. There's a mod for just about everything in this game and if there isn't most of the game is rather easy to learn how to mod for. However, there is a downside; the game is constantly changing which can make modding rather tedious. The jump to steam alone changed so many varriables that I've had to restart a couple of mods I'd planned on and one I'd released from the ground up.All in all, the game plays like a simplified Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly. If your looking for that experience look no further. Just don't expect to find aliens in the base game (But I'm sure there's a mod for that somewhere.)			"

								This game is a ton of fun.  I've been playing since Alpha 9, and wow this game has come a long way since then.  It was fun then, but the game has a ton of deep and rich features that should please any base/city building fan.  Customizable pretty much to your heart's content, this game can be a wonderful relaxing experience or it can be a high-stakes thrill if you're up for the challenge.  The learning curve may be a bit steep with all the systems in the game right now, but once you have the basics down (food and shelter, primarily) the rest of the game opens up with a huge amount of content to explore and master.

 Totally Recomment this game	 ""But why you say this already?""	I had the pleasure to play RimWorld before it went to steam and since the first day it was playable i already felt deep in love with the game but why is that?Let me tell you why it is for me and yes i know it doesnt look much but the devil lies deep down in the detailsYou can make games really simple and still extremly complex i only know Space Station 13 thats more complex then RimWorld what is a simliar game even if the goal in both games are different but we talk about the complex depth in this games.So why is it so good already? and why i recomment it while its still at this price?Cause it already has alot content in it lots of it and the best even mods and if you fall once in love with this game i will say its totally addicting i never regret the buy of it, neverWith the steam release it also got alot new stuff like the scenario system that makes the game even more interesting to playa last word i will say to this game: ""Some storys will never be forgotten and this games writes books of storys be it dramatic, funny or brutal neither or less you will recall those storys in your heart""	 "

								Amazingly fun colony management game that combines the pleasure of designing a colony for security and efficiency with an awesome sci-fi world that feels incredibly fleshed out down to the relationships your colonists have with other npcs and the other groups that inhabit the world. If you want to make an incredibly secure base that can out last any siege or create a safe haven for your colonists to live, work, and get married, or barely survive in a barren ice sheet by cannibalizing everyone that visits, then you will love rimworld.

								First of all, I already bought the game about 1.5 years before steam launch which explains the low amount of hrs on record!In my opinion Rimworld is incredibly well made. It is both a challenging and fun game which offers a lot of variation with many interesting surprises throughout the gameplay. Quite frequently I just had to smile about the creativity of the developers, when getting challenged by different situations. But most of all I love the atmosphere! The vibe of Rimworld is very unique and makes the whole gameplay really enjoyable. Furthermore, the developers are fantastic. When I purchased the game there was a daily log everyone could follow, which showed what the devs had been working with on a daily basis. Generally, it feels like the project is taken seriously, with regular updates and good development transparency. Also, although early access this game gives more a feel of a finished game in terms of content and replay value.I can only recommend the game and think the price is absolutely decent for what you get.

								I had RimWorld since Alpha12 and, just as it advertises, it's already fully playable, balanced, and free of bugs.This game is great for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a story that they're writing, where the characters are their own colonists who have intense and relevant needs, social interactions, and feelings.It's great for anyone who wants a tough and gritty but exciting experience.For you, i'd reccomened this game, 100%.You may not like this game if you want to make a max-efficiency production machine. This game is more about caring for your colonists and the stories of fights, disease outbreaks, and generally bad weather then it is about being able to wall yourself in and produce masterwork parkas until you get bored.For you, i'd reccomened Dwarf Fortress or Factorio.My apologies if it's badly worded or hard to read, i'm not a very good writer I find.

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

								I won' t lie to you : I've never managed to get my colonists to hop on the ship and lift-off... Yet, I've been slaughtered in so many different fun ways, that I can't refrain from trying again and again :)RimWorld shows a very robust gameplay, and lots of potential. Don't get me wrong : The current alpha release maybe is more stable than most of 'Release Candidate' AAA titles on day-1 (not to mention the mandatory 6Gb patch ;) ).I've spent a few months on Alpha13, and had the most refreshing experience playing a game since a really looong time.Thanks to you Tynan (and Team) for such a great game, best wishes for the final product!Regards.

								Don't be fooled by the prison architect style graphics this game is NOT PA.I bought this game almost 2 years ago through Ludeon's website.I played the game for a few months on and off back when I bought it. Just picked it up the other day when it hit Steam. And holy **** this game has improved immensely! Literally every aspect of the game has been imporived drasdtically since I last played.I have emailed them 2-3 in the past when I had a poblem getting the game working on Linux and 2 days ago when I couldn't get my steam key. They have replied to my emails within 1-2 hours every time. Not only is this an amazing game that I'm extremely excited is finally on Steam, but the main man behind it is geniuinely a great guy.Head over to the Ludeon forums if you want to see what I'm talking about.

Early Access Review
								Although Steam tells you something different, I have bought this game soon after it's Kickstarter campaign and easily collected over 100 hours of playtime in the past three years. I can say that this was literally the game I waited for without knowing it when I first saw it. While it has an excellent presentation it gives you the complete freedom of choice how to develop your colony on the one hand, but also an ultimate goal, building a spaceship, on the other.Before you keep on reading a word to the few negative reviews from new players: Yes, this is a complex game. As someone said on the discussions: ""It's not a FPS where you start on heroic difficulty becasue you know shooters."" It's a game with many mechanics you will have to learn before beeing good at it, I recommend enableing the adaptive tutorial to learn the basic systems. It's also a very slow paced game with eventual peaks in form of raids or such. The two hours you have to decide if you want to refund are not nearly enough to see all the facades of the game and get a complete picture of it. Now on to the positives.Wether you want to build an underground complex or a large fortress, all stragtegies are viable and have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you need to hold a large base you will have lots of walls which you need to defend and the enemy may break through at different locations. But while you can keep your entry small and defendable if you go underground, you eventually will have to fight bug hives which can spread sub-surface and enemies which are equipped with granades and pickaxes in order to dig their way to you.The incredible amount of replayability also thrives from the different biomes and the recently added scenario system. Each of the eight climatic environments has unique weather, animals, diseases and challenges. The scenarios give you the ability to never play twice with the same starting condition, may it be the number of colonists, items and conditions of the map or forced cannibalism.There is also an active mod community which has specialised on vanilla- and lore friendly mods that truely expand the game to it's full potential. Every veteran will be able to give you a list of some length with mods that he/she considers necessary to play the game. Of course it's not unplayable without mods but they do add many quality-of-life improvements which make playing the game easier.Many people ask why they should pay 30$ for an early access title. Bear in mind that the early access is there to indicate that the game is still beeing worked on. However it has met all his goals, is polished, optimized and generally bug-free. You are basically looking at a finished game which will get expanded in the future and thus is marked as an early access. The developer, Tynan Sylvester, who made this game almost on his own, usually releases new mayor builds every three to four months, introducing new and basic game mechanics, like the scenario system, but we will have to see how steam dynamic will change this. If there are bugs which survived the extensive testing phase, you can count on a hotfix beeing published within days.RimWorld is what it says: a story generator. Usually I'm very suspicious about games who claim that, but in this case it is totally correct. Stories on the forums range from prisoners getting torn apart in order to sell their organs to colonists which give their lives in a heroic last stand to save the colony. If you're not sure, head over to the  stories forum [ludeon.com] and read one or two to a glass of your favourite relaxing drink.Anyone who has an interest in strategy, building and/or science fiction should buy this game and probably wont be disappointed.

								I almost never write reviews, despite having hundreds of hours in many games on Steam. Yet I feel that I must write a review for RimWorld. RimWorld is nothing like you think it will be, period. It is an infinite canvas of stories, experiences, horros, trauma, victories, and more. I have many passions in life and yet I have been craving RimWorld non stop for the last few weeks, I have yet to burn myself out from it. This game is the perfect mixture of ""society simulatory"" and survival game. I love survival games and I've been looking for one like RimWorld for ages. It's far more intimate and content rich than Dwarf Fortress and the community behind the workshop for this game is out of this world good. And best of all the lead dev is super involved in the community, incredibly reasonable, adaptable, and industrious as hell. The active development of this game is incredibly exciting. It's just insane to me that a game in its Alpha stage could be better and more fleshed out than more than half of the games still in Beta/Early Access on Steam. I deeply apologize for pirating the game for the first few days I played this. Once it became apparent to me that nothing could possibly entertain me more than this game, I immediately bought it on Steam.This game is easily worth more than $30 so the game is worth more than every penny. Now I will return to my Lovecraftian horror story as I watch my colonists get eaten alive by crazed bears and angry cannibals.			"

								My first game play I got very lucky with a bunch of steel that came out of no where. Until my whole colony died due to a beaver attack and they were all ""downed"" and could not rescue each other. My second game play I tried to get a little more fancy and learned all about the wonders of wood and wood powered stuff. It was pretty cool until all my animals went crazy. RIP.My third play through was by far my best with a whole house layout and everything, until the rabbits had too many babies and they ate all my crops, so now my people are eat raw meat with no crops and are slowly starving. And my most recent play though I thought was going to be fun, until my character couldn't fight and was being attacked by a mad rat. Needless to say he is still running away from the rat.Feels bad man, 10/10 would harvest their prisoners organs and sell them off to other tribes.** Update**I have finally made a great colony who only feasts on corn and rice because we don't hunt pandas, I have saved a loved one from being stolen by shooting at them both and killing one while cripling the other, gave him a new leg, and have a nice love triangle.Still love this game!

								This is the story of the badass Barkeeper. 3  pods crashed to the surface of a Rimworld. One of them was known as Clark Hendrix, or as I like to call him, ""The bad♥♥♥♥♥Barkeep"". Along with him was Lu, a former servant, and  Watson, a Vatgrown Solider. They started a colony. One day, as everything was going smoothly, Hendrix attempted to woo Lu. lu rejected him, and he was hurt. Now, let me tell you something about Hendrix. What he wants, he gets. So, maybe a day passes, and he's at it again, trying to woo Lu. This time, he succeeds. A few days pass, and a man by the name of Thompson comes to live in the colony. Thompson was... A simple man. very simple. A hard worker, and he absouloutly despised technology. But, he was nonetheless an important part of the colony. In the end, though, Thompson died of an infection. The reason behinde this was probably because of that cut he had gotten in a recent skirmish with the wildlife, beavers to be more presise. He was honored, and placed in a sarcaufugus. Hendrix made it himself, considering he was Thompsons closest friend. Some more days pass, and a ship crashs, and a non-vilonet man named Scizo or something is found in a crash. Though he's completly irrelevant because even though he was saved he ultimatley left without giving two ♥♥♥♥s about the resources these people had used in hopes of him joining them. But, yet another pod crashed, and this one carrying the most useless person anyone could have ever met. A man by the name of Isov. Isov had a weird entitlement about him. he felt he didn't need to do ANY LABOR AT ALL. So occaitionaly he would help Watson with reasearch, and help train Raymond, the pet warg. But when it came down to it, Isov was the most useless human being in existance. Though, that didn't stop Hendrix from befriending him anyways. Hendrix was, by any means, a people person. He was a hunter too. And a fighter when the colony needed him to be. Now, a new day begins, and there is a woman on the comms channel, a criminal surgeon by the name of Toni. She needed some help getting away from a local tribe by the name of ""The Orange Plain Nation"". So Hendrix had her come, for he knew they were in desperate need of a medical practitioner. Her attackers, a male warrior, and a lesbian who absouloutly despised men. Hendrix, getting everyone into formation, repels the attackers. He bravly shoots down warrior, while the lesbian attacks the colony's solar pannel. She flees, when she realizes that her scum partner is dead. Hendrix leads the charge and scares her off for good. In the time after that, Hendrix found himself doing more for the colony, such as building a heater for Toni's room, and growing crops. But then, one day, a herd of angry boar enter the area. Hendrix knows what he must do. He gathers Watson and Lu, who are the only other two in the colony with guns, and they fight off the boar. When Hendrix realized that his, at this time, fiance'a(However you spell that) Lu was going to be killed by a boar, he bravely swooped in and meleed the boar to death, while 2 more boar fight him. He managed to knock one unconsiouns, but the other boar, oh, that ♥♥♥♥ing other boar, killed Hendrix. Watson, in complete rage killed the boar and all other boars in the area. In the days afterwards, a steel sarcophagus was made to honor Hendrix, and all his contributions to the colony. Without him, the colony may very well have died. Though it isn't a happy ending for anyone, especially Lu, who finnaly broke after Hendrix died. She went on a fire starting spree, but before she could, Watson arrested her. Now shes gone insane in that prison, and people wander if she'll ever get better. As for Watson and Isov, they have contracted some sort of disease, and it is feared they may very well die from it, leaving Toni to a colony full of bad memories, and an insane woman who may never recover.So, that's my story after playing ""Rimworld"". I am still playing on that save, still kind of want to see is Watson and Isov will pull through or not, but I doubt it. Heck, maybe I'll get lucky and Watson will live while Isov dies a very painful death, and he can refelct on how being a self-entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turns out in the end. Hope you enjoyed reading, I am having and will continue to have, a great time with this game, and I hope you might to, if you decide to get the game!			"

What they need to work on is simplifying the user interface for the normal user but still have the complicated options as options. This game can and will eat up a lot of time. One thing I would definetly add is the ability to change the scenario difficulty mid-game so you could theoretically build up a strong base and then see how you can survive against the worst things the game has to throw at you.All up this game comes highly recommended for fans of city builders and/or sci-fi who arent afraid of playing something that requires a bit of patience to start off with.

With the amazing mods available the gameplay is even deeper and more rewarding! The only con is the game does have horrid memory issues depending on your system after 8-12 in game years performance lags and it is very noticable. However alpha 17 is supposed to adress this!

								As a rule I generally don't write reviews; not out of some arbitrary reasoning, but out of fear that I don't have insight to either advising picking up a game or steering clear of it.This is not the case with Rimworld.Rimworld is arguably one of the finest crafted games ever released for the colony/survival genre. Boasting a huge range of character traits, a complex relationship system between characters and a potentially harsh or easy world to survive in. The game is entirely fantastic in it's ability to tailor your experience from a relatively easy adventure through a lush, temperate forest; all the way up to a ball-crushing torture fest of surviving in the harsh, arctic tundra, or the equally terrifying super dry deserts.If you have even the slightest interest in this game, please do yourself the favour and pick it up. Whilst it's only just come out on Steam, I have well over 500 hours of gameplay prior to it's release: and I've loved every single second of it. You will not regret this purchase, it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic!			"

I've probably put in atleast a couple hundred hours easily, it's very easy to get into and each update increasing changes the entire game dynamic and the upcoming one being more of a mobile presence of the world will hopefully help create a solution to trading, exploring or the end game stagnation that is of current.

								This is the game I've been dreaming of, for many years, and even better than my previous favorite game SimAnt, however, I have to delete RimWorld for a while. Why? If your charactors in RimWorld become addicted to something and delayed all the work, and got everyone and animals starving, what would you do? Same here. My mouse clicks the ""play"" button automatically, and doesn't listen to me. I'll reinstall it later when I finished my job.			"

								Well,after all this time,I don't remember a good enough story to tell. But,there was this one time where I led a group of tribals,and gave the leader an A.I chip,Bionic arms and legs,all Synthetic organs... Hell,if I saw that guy,I'd run and tell my faction to worship him. Besides,everyone who fought him ended up casually persuaded to join or shot to death by powerful,futuristic weapons.EDIT:New story! After seeing chapter one of Rock Paper Shotgun's ""Bogdan's Rest"" I made Big Boss Hotel. With a LOT of mods,including Glittertech and more furniture,fashionrimsta,and MORE,I built a massive hotel in a Boreal Forest inside of a hotel. We had Kevin ""Boss"" Lewis,with great social skills,Craig Boone,who keeps talking about how his wife is dead,but then shoots millions more to death,and Shauna ""Food"" Gray,who makes food. We quickly made a grand entrance hall,and right above the entrance,we made a massive power room.  To the left,we dug further into the corner and built our rec center,where our first infestation was. Boss beat some bugs to death with his baton,but Boone came in and killed the rest in around one shot while Food ran outside and hid behind a tree. We then dug below the rec room,and expanded to the rooms. The first 2 were guest rooms,and the next 2 were for staff. Staff rooms were larger and had colours based on the personality and name of the character. We dug so far down,and then came our first visitors! They were a group of Outlanders and had some good stuff to trade. They all went into thier rooms. One guy brought some drugs,he began smoking flake,then died. He overdosed or something. We happily took his stuff,and when Boone was wearing his jacket,noone suspected a thing. After a while,they left,and were so amazed they turned over the rest of thier drugs to us! Remember kids,don't do drugs,give them to random strangers!1 season LaterARK! GET AT THE DOOR! BOONE! GRAB THE RIFLE! COOKE! GET OUT THERE!Fourty Rhinoceri outside,bashing at the doors,invading Teh Coive (Our stockpile) and bashing our Enmergency Exit. Boone one shots them all,until they blindly run away to maul a caribous. Cooke charges out there and shoots the legs off of 3 of the beasts. They fall over as Ark guards the entrance,blindly firing her assault rifle at the monsters. Our turrets finally regain power from the solar flare,and mow down the rhinos. As the others begin to wander off,as they've gotten bored of death,we all rush back in and go to the hospital. Down below,a prison break occurs. The Pirate Leader we captured has decided enough is enough. With his useless Lackey,Justin,they break out and grab some wood from a nearby room,under construction. Boss rushes to deal with them,as he is our noble warden. He whacks Maker on his head,and as Justin draws near,Boss flees upward to get more reinforcements. Our pregant,and brave dog,Taffy,charges forth. She bites Maker's arm,and he whacks her tail and legs with his wood. Maker,in a smidge of pain,takes a bow from an equipment locker in a room,and shoots Taffy. She dies in one hit. Her middle-stage fetus,is never shown the beauty of this world. In a fit of rage,Boss charges Maker and beats him senseless. He knocks him over,he falls in pain. Justin,in fear that his beloved boss was struck down,rushes back to his cell. Later,we put Taffy in a Sarcophagus. Maker recovers and stays in his cell,as the hated Dog-Killer. Our colony mourns the death of Taffy still. The save continues on to this day.     Get RimWorld today for many great stories and tales of drama,action,bloodshed,and Romance!			"

								It took me 43 hours of game time to get a wonderful base going. I thought this was a good time to start raiding the pirates. I got my three best snipers in a line ready to fire. I killed about 5 of the pirates before they started shooting back. My fragger threw a grenade, right next to two of my guys. Surprise, surprise they didn't die. After the raid was over I found one of my guys with a shredded leg. I got him back to base and prepared to replace the leg with a robotic one. After a day I saw a little red box with the word ""ridiculous"". I looked at my guys heath and he had two broken arms with brain damage. I thought he would be fine. Until a week later he went crazy and gunned down my entire base after picking up my only minigun. ""9/10 would ruined my life with more video games again""			"

								It's finally out, go get it!  Really though, if you enjoy ant farms, building, seting up things to fail/succeed..then this is the game for you.I have been involved with Rimworld as far back as October 2013, back when it was a REALLY barren world. Watching and and being involved with the game over the past 3 years has made this game feel like a family member you watched grow into a successful young adult.   Game notes: A smart AI lays out a story for you, either the traditional 3 colonists, 5 club wielding/ backwards tech colonists, or the challenging 1 colonist. All of which can be speced to your personal choices.  TONS of REPLAYABILITY   -A sandbox, with countless stories to tell.   -A refreshing sense of humor is laced in.   -Incredible Mod support built in.   -Easy to learn, hard to master   -Great ablility to indirectley control your colonists   -Epic battles, strategy, resources   -Play intense pirate over-run worlds, or peaceful sim-cities   -Tech Tree   -Survival   -Colonists interact, get married, party, fight..it's all here   -Good Soudtrack   -A great deal for what you pay.  So if you enjoy the above then Rimworld is for you. A game I have played for 3 years, and I still love it!			"

								RimWorld has caused me to have no grasp on what time it is in reality. RimWorld is fun, aggravating, addicting, and hilarious all at once. Whether a colonist is going crazy and wants to kill everything and everyone, or everyone is sick except for the one who refuses to handle medicine and they all die out, it is hilariously unfortunate. I've only put about 20 hours so far since I've owned it, but I know many more will be added to that number soon. Great game, 10/10 :) Also, when all your characters die out except one, beware: you may end up having 11 yorkshire terriers randomly join your colony.			"

								I've played RimWorld for years. It's a fascinating, and grueling simulator that inspires a true connection between the player, the colonists and their environment. It's an effective time sink and you can easily loose hours to the old ""just one more thing"" mentality. My initial reaction to the game was how it looked, seemingly simple, but you soon find yourself marveling at its quiet complexity. Way back when I started playing this game (before steam), it was a fantastic and some might say seemingly complete game, but the developer has pushed on, adding more content and a better play experience. It truely is a work of genious, and I thoroughly expect great new things in RimWorld. It is punishing though, hours into a build, you have perfectly happy colonists with epic rooms and houses, stout defences, and farms stretching for miles. Then all of a sudden a sequence of unrelenting rage quit events occur. a) A pack of man hunting wildboars descend during a solarflare or eclipse, your turrets are out and you have to fend the beasts away yourself. b) Shortly after the Glorious Pirate Mongoose's decide to raid bringing with them a flurry of submachine guns and molotovs. c) Your farms are soon torched, and old Wilson is being mauled by an embittered boar near the mysterious building. The pirates have stormed the living quarters, overpowering your colonists, and stealing the women. Then the rains come dowsing the fires, the solar flare passes and power returns. Your defences kick in and Old Wilson killed the boar with his prosthetic leg Peggy. Can you reclaim your once great colony? Alex get's wilson to bed and starts treatment. The few remaining colonists quickly replant the fields and repair the damage... but whats this TOXIC FALLOUT and aliens.... fml... Wilson timet to get Peggy out again!You've got to love RimWorld!

								This game is awesome!I've been playing since the early Alphas and boy it has evolved into such a great game. It does not have all the complexity of Dwarf Fortress which it is obviously based on, but it is no pushover either. The mod support is great and the only thing I really find to be missing is the possibility to play on multiple Z-Levels. That being said, I simply adore this game and, though I do tire of it from time to time, I continually find myself coming back to it when looking for a good fun game to play. I don't think I will ever stop playing this game.Though the price right now may seem a little steep at first when you look at the store page, know that if you want a Dwarf fortress-like game that doesn't dissapoint you, this is probably one of your best bets and worth the price.TL:DR I love this this game and recommend it to anyone that likes prison architect and/or Dwarf Fortress.

								Rimworld is easily one of my favorite games. Vanilla RW is polished, engaging, full-featured, and grim. The community is ranked among the best: friendly, helpful, and industrious. Choose from hundreds of mods to greatly expand on the gameplay, enhancing complexity and QoL, and adding more of everything! It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content. This is in my opinion the correct relationship for small or one-man development teams. This will without any doubt be a game I will be playing for many years to come. And it isn't even complete yet!			"

								I HIGHLY recommend you play on permadeath, as it will make the stories all the more meaningful when every action matters and can't just be rewinded or a previous save loaded.To summarize what it is like playing:Game deals you a handful of cards.""What the hell? These cards are♥♥♥♥♥♥ they literally hate each other and one of them can't even lift anything.""The game stares you dead in the eyes, and says ""Deal with it.""And so you do, you overcome challenges and face problems that if given the choice you never would have ended up in the first place having known the game systems and how it works.In a non-permadeath video game, when I miss-click and accidentally have my doctor amputate the wrong arm on someone, I would reload the save. Here I don't have the option, I instead get to experience the story of what happens when things go wrong, and get to feel the joy of having won despite mistakes or suffer the real crushing feeling of failure when every action matters and there is no rewind. It's a classic sense of 'you made this bed, now you have to sleep in it.'.Mind you sometimes the game deals you great cards, and when it does, it feels EVEN better because that hand could have been bad, but it wasn't, and every hand counts.

								I've owned RimWorld pre Steam release and for me it's one of the most solid early access purchases I've ever made. Very few bugs coupled with intuitive mechanics make the game a pleasure to play and extremely replayable. The modding scene is alive and the community is active in discussion with reachable devs.But now for something less serious, storytime!:One of my favourite playthroughs I did was on the far north of the world on an ice sheet, nothing grows, there are no animals to hunt.After getting attacked by raiders I turned my colonists into my new unwilling cannibals and began eating everyone who attacked me.Even after getting hydroponics set up I continued eating my foes, ""It will make my people strong!""By the end of the game I was crafting the leather from the raiders into armchairs in my rec room and had a fridge full of human meat.All in all this game allowed me to scar 3 colonists by forcing them to eat human flesh for 2 years, worth every penny!

								I played this game already for countless hours before the steam release and I'm still doing so.it won't get boring, one of the advantages of a large and very good modding community. You will alway find new challenges to master. Make sure to visit the forums though, you won't find all the good mods on steam.In general, I can highly recommend this to any player who likes base building games, with a lot of strategic decisions mixed with the strong survival aspect of the game.As most of the reviews mentioned, there are a many similarities to ""Prison Architect"", due to the angled top down view and the the building system ( single blocks, put together to build your desired colony / prison ).I played some Prison Architect, but I never really enjoyed it, so I can say I like RimWorld a lot better!You can play your colony simply as a base builder, recruit people and have a prospering place to live. Or you can go hardcore, fight against nature and hostile factions. There is surely a setup you will enjoy. From basebuilder to real struggle to survive is everything included. This game offers you a real challenge if you are up to it!Theres is a lot of detail to the game and your colonists. Social interactions with other colonists, ranging from hate to marriage. A health system where you can lose and replace limbs and organs. Individual traits for the colonists making them a super soldier, doc or that guy who is always on the edge to a mental break.The combat system is divided into melee and ranged and you can get into big and epic firefights when 20 pirates start to raid your colony and you have to defend against them. You can set up your defensive system over the whole map and generate a new layout never seen before.Set up a big prison wing to keep all the prisoners, captured during enemy raids and convince them to join you.There are not only human threats, but also mechanoids, advanced killing machines, which can be the end to an unprepared colony. Nature itself can make it a struggle to feed everybody, when the sun is covered for months during a volcanic winter. Or a solar flare disables your heaters when its -60°C outside.A lot can happen and there is enough material for a very good story.This can make your first start a bit tricky, but over the course of time you will learn to deal with each situation and I'm sure at some point, there will be another great colony somewhere in the endless vastness of space ... There are complaints about the lack of multiplayer, but I think they are unjustified. There is no real need for it. However, I can agree that I would enjoy to visit or raid other colonies, AI or not. It goes hand in hand with the fact, that you are currently restricted to the piece of land where you start. There is no possibility to take a few colonist and wander off to start another colony on the same planet ( a generated map from where you can choose your start biome ). This would allow you to trade and do all the interactional stuff and I would love to see that.Always keep in mind that this is still an Alpha version and that there is a lot of time to implement mechanics into the game.I give a lot of credit to the developer, he keeps every new version perfectly playable. With each update there is new content to explore.If you are still not sure whether you should buy this game, there are a lot of videos about it. I already made several Let's Plays myself with various setups. You can check out the newest one here:

								RimWorld is a unique story driven game, every play through will be different then the last, with different twists and turns. Described as a mixture of dwarf fortress and prison architect, Rimworld really is a great game. I have been playing this gem since its early stages of life on rimworld.com. Each update has brought something new and interesting to the table, enough that Rimworld  has become my favorite game, and a game that I can't stop playing. I can't recommend RimWorld enough.Big thanks to Tynan Sylvester for creating such a great game, I look forward to the future of Rimworld.			"

								I've been playing this game for the last year and a half and absolutely love it! Probably clocked up more than 1000 hours. Its one of those games that pushes you to make very hard decisions, like should I recruit the prisoners I have or release or execute them or sell them to slave traders or harvest and sell their organs? One of the things I particularly love about Rimworld is the ability to choose a play style for every colony - for example, you could choose to have the storyteller that takes it easy on you and then choose to play mainly for base/colony building, giving yourself a very chilled experience. Then on your next colony you can change these choices in the game setup to ensure you're going to have an experience that is going to kick you firmly up the a$$!I played so many colonies but can remember things from all of them, such fond memories, and I am going to continue to make those fond memories.If you are thinking about buying this, which I assume you probably are as you are reading reviews...STOP THINKING! Get your wallet out and buy it! You won't regret it!			"

								Well here is the story of my most recent colony:  A sea ice oneLanded with three colonists. Mason,  Farrukh, and JaydenJayden was my crack shot great against raidersMason was a great researcher and constructer Farrukh grew food and cookedI get a survival shelter up, got power and a heater get up a research bench even individual bedrooms for my people.  An electric stove.On day 6 I recieve an alert ""Manhunter Pack"".  It is only three Muffalo I thought I could handle it.To say the least we had to leave behind Mason's foot and Jayden's eye. I didn't even have enough resources to build a butcher table. 3 raids later I still have my colonists and then I get the alert ""Siege""  I grab my sniper rifles and head out. Half of my base is destroyed before hep arives including my power so hello ""slept in the cold"".  By now I am worried abot my numbers.  So accept the person who causes my demise.He was Table a young man a great colonist by my standards.  But the raid that comes is 10 pirates with 4 personal shields.  I grab my guns and hope for the best. I do ok utill the person with the doomsday launcher comes The only one who remains is Mason who is also, inconvienintly my Brawler. He dies in the next raidBut the game decides to troll me and gives me another colonist so I pack my bags with all my food and leave for the tundra.  After a fight with a hungry fox and an infection the game over screen popped upAfter playing 1,500 hours of this game I can easily give it 100/10 and say it is my favorite game.  And it is still in development!!			"

								Started out with five random settlers with nothing but primitive technology and spears. Manage to build a base and defend against countless attacks from raiders with assault rifles, grenades, and sniper rifles using nothing but spears and bows.  Manage to tame 10 alpacas and traded for high tech military gear using the never ending supply of crafted clothes from my alpacas. Poison fallout spread throughout the land, where we rescued a couple alpacas yet to be tamed before they would die to the poison. Surviving that, bear-sized, man-eating insects spawned in the middle of my base. My settlers fought these insects, without a single person dying. My war torn people finally had a nice streak of peace to clean up and fix our colony. Until everyone died to heatstoke.			"

								This is probably my favorite colony simulation game. The music is great, the art style is neat and the gameplay sucks you in for hours and hours at a time.Almost every game I've played winds up in disaster as killer robots invade, someone has a mental break and sets everything on fire or everyone drops dead from sickness after the only doctor is mauled to death by angry beavers during a hunting accident. But that's part of the joy. Seeing how your colonists will interact,  what the AI will throw at you next and how (or should that be if) you'll handle it.It's a game that's better in the early access stage than a lot of games are after years of post release support.

								Yes buy it.It still has very minor issues in the day to day gameplay.  It has a good balance between planning and execution, with random events taking place provided by which storyteller you choose.  I.e. the storyteller (apparently) provides the non-deterministic events in the world, which can range from pirate raids or lunar eclipses to the wildlife going crazy.It seems to play like a D20 game.The Good:- Characters have to sleep each day - which usually means hitting fast forward.  This provides a casual feeling to the game - the game is not rushed.- It might even be the most casual ""chill"" game I can remember.  You can pause the clock at any moment or revert to an old save.  So even when things are getting heavy you can think through what needs to happen.- The game setting is living in the wild and pulling together a survival plan in the midst of the storyteller generating random events.  It's very easy-going this way -- not like Prison Architect which was too heavy and dark for me.- Grizzly bears seem to just eat berries.  Now you know storyteller will make them go crazy at any moment - so try to figure out a way to deal with them.The Bad:- The price feels high before you buy it.  So it might take longer before many people try this game.  - The game could provide more pointers.  ""Just look it up on the Wiki.""  I suppose if you're hardcore you will want to figure everything out - but this is the blurry line between gameplay-based enjoyment and arbitrary recipe search-space Easter Egg hunting.- There's no demo.  You can watch youtube videos all day - you'll think this is a Dwarf fortress thing like I did, but it's not, and all the videos don't do the game justice.  A demo would have helped me get over the price hump.As it is this game is easily worth the asking price.  Listen - you have 2 hours to figure it out - if you still want a refund, you'll know after first hour.			"

								I enjoyed the hours i played but I have 3 main issues with the game1. You cant leave your spawning area. Hopefully in the future you will be able to leave your starting area and be able to attack other villages/pirate camps in the future, but i dont see that happening anytime soon.2. Once you build your colony up enough and set up a decent killzone for the raiders to walk blindly into, the game gets repetitive and there isnt much else for you to do. I understand it is early access but there is basically no endgame except building a ship which just means the game ends and you win.3. Honestly i feel like the mental breaks are a bit over the top, I understand its a gameplay mechanic but the fact is if a tribe has to sleep on the floor and their pet dies, then they just go crazy and start killing all their friends? Pet animals are a hinderence and just get teamkilled instantly. The game is still a decent fun game, but I would say its probably worth waiting for a sale.			"

								This has been my favorite game for two years now. I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing this game long before it was on steam. First off, Tynan is a god among men, this game is his baby, and it's the best simulator around (except dwarf fortress but most people can't stand that game.... including myself). As of a year ago, I would have considered this game complete. He keeps adding awesome stuff left and right. None of it is gamebreaking (except those nasty underground bugs from the previous release.... but he fixed that right up). This game is challenging, addicting, fun, funny, gross, cute, morally wrong (like cannibalism, yay!), and did I mention addicting? We have all played games where you think to yourself ""oh, I'll play for just a minute,"" and then it's three hours later and you are wondering where the time went. This game, it's not a few hours, it can be days. No joke. It's a game for all people. Create a nice, calm scenario that you can take your time in with basebuilder Phoebe. Or you can smash your head against the wall and scream at your significant for inturrupting during the endless raids and horrible events with Randy Random on his hardest settings. Personally, I like classic on rough or harder, depending on my mood.Play with a cannibalistic horde in the ice sheets, or a tribe in the woodlands. The game is great for all people for whatever challenge or story you want to play. This game had over 100k downloads before it went on steam - and for a good reason. All y'all are late to the party. If I see another steam ♥♥♥♥♥ complain about this being another ""$30 for an early access game"", I will use my psychic ai bots to blow your brain apart (Rimworld joke). Just bite the bullet and give them the money they deserve - which is a lot more than what they are asking for.And congrats to Tynan and the rest of Ludeon for such a successful game and for getting your game on steam :) BTW, all y'all Steamers are lucky - at one point he didn't even want his game on Steam. He was making plenty of dough before he even got here.  "

								One of the best resource management games that also generates a story in real time from the deep mechanics. First game: incompetent hunter with rifle gets bitten in the right eye by a tortoise and becomes unconscious, rescued but forever disfigured. Other colonists will be disgusted by the hunters looks and thus have a negative relationship with him that will lead to a negative downward trend that spirals out of control leading to ultimate doom.

								<h1>In space no one can hear you do horrible things in the name of survival.</h1>I don't recall exactly when I purchased this game, but I do remember it was durring the kickstarter period. Pretty sure it's been two years since then and I'll admit that at first I didn't play it all that much. The game was pretty barebones, hit 'start' and next thing you know your given three colonists, and a small handful of supplies. You were to survive as long as possible and it was fun for a time, but then I stopped. Time passed, and I got an email about an update and picked it up again. Stockpiles were tweaked to make things a bit more interesting and eventually I gave up and moved on again. More time passed, another email, and more new features. More boredom, dropped it again, more time, another email. And while that seems bad, it's probably one of the best things about this game.Most 'early access' games I've bought were, frankly trainwrecks. But Rimworld is diffrent, yes the updates are a touch spread out but in that time nothing but good has come from them. Every new feature was something that improved my experience as a player. I've yet to see an update that made things worse and to be frank I don't think I ever will. This is probably one of the best regularly updated games you could grab on steam so what I'm saying here is, don't let ""early access"" scare you away.Combat in the game is kinda difficult, but in the way that ""Realistic"" difficulty in a first person shooter is challanging but not ""impossible"" if you catch my meaning. Throwing a skilled melee weapons user at someone with practically no experience in firearms who's carrying a shotgun ends rather poorly for the person with the knife but in a way, it's to be expected. The game will throw increasingly challnging threats at you as your colony gets more 'Impressive' so if you're worried about getting overwhelemed quickly try to avoid gathering up materials that are valueable and hold little to no combat use and you have no need for. (Gold, Silver, Jade... These are things to avoid.) But perhaps the most impressive feature of the game, is how easy it is to mod. Don't like that concreete is classified as ""ugly"" neither do I! Single line to change, throws off the balance a bit but not too much. Wanna use Fallout themed weapons and armor? There's a mod for that. Want to get access to more and better bionics for your colonists outside the basic ones? There's a mod for that. There's a mod for just about everything in this game and if there isn't most of the game is rather easy to learn how to mod for. However, there is a downside; the game is constantly changing which can make modding rather tedious. The jump to steam alone changed so many varriables that I've had to restart a couple of mods I'd planned on and one I'd released from the ground up.All in all, the game plays like a simplified Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly. If your looking for that experience look no further. Just don't expect to find aliens in the base game (But I'm sure there's a mod for that somewhere.)			"

Customizable pretty much to your heart's content, this game can be a wonderful relaxing experience or it can be a high-stakes thrill if you're up for the challenge.  The learning curve may be a bit steep with all the systems in the game right now, but once you have the basics down (food and shelter, primarily) the rest of the game opens up with a huge amount of content to explore and master.

								First off let me say that although this game says early access, it in no way feels like an early access game. I've rarely, if ever, ran into a bug that greatly affected gameplay or anything like that.I'm always amazed at the amount of detail put into this game every time I play it. From some colonists missing a middle toe to someone having a jaw injury due to their background as a soldier which impairs their ability to talk and trade with others.Every colony really is truly different because of the randomly generated worlds and all the unique combinations of skills you can get on a colonist. Theres also the many random events that can take place such as anything from a small raid by a local tribe to a nuclear fallout which forces everyone indoors until it subsides.I've never had a boring experience playing this game and it's always fun trying to figure out how I will get past the next challenge, I highly reccommend this game :^)			"

Then the raiders returned and stabbed my mercenary to death. It was just Fields and a hurt Mia left. Mia might have had a chance, but seeing all the bloodshed caused something in Fields to snap and she killed Mia before going on a killing rampage against helpless forest creatures. After taking a nap in the same bed where her dead friend still laid, she went on another rampage before a fox took vengeance for all his furry friends.

								Dwarf Fortress Lite with a UI. For those who haven't played DF, it is a top-down colony management sim where you set goals for your colonists and they carry them out. I really enjoyed this game and easily got my $30 worth. There's a lot of priorities to balance and different paths to success. One thing I like about it over DF is that there is an actual end-game goal (which you can prioritize or ignore at your leisure). There are various difficulty levels from trivial basebuilder paradise to really hard ones where you are essentially under siege from all sides. Despite being a much simpler game than DF, I still felt that the combat was implemented better. Economy is simpler but still complex enough to keep you busy. Highly recommended, you will lose a weekend to this.			"

								10/10 - loving the game more and more!!!- saw the game for 2 minutes, then immediately decided to get it- installed, started new world, didn't know anything about the game, except that it's a colony simulator- explored controls and GUI ingame and with a little help of the wiki, really no need for a tutorial, everything very easy to learn- 3 colonists, easy buildings- 1st raid, destroyed a wall and got into my area, 1 colonist was firing at them- after some shooting, 1 of my colonist was dead, 1 heavyly wounded, but 2 intruders were still left- then the intruders decided to run away- on the way they kidnapped my wounded colonist- the last colonist alive ran to catch them, shooting at them- intruders left my wounded colonist behind and run without him- survived 1st raid, also the second, but not the third- started new colony, used what I had learned and builded a big and working colony- played the game already before Steam, couple of hundred hours, played 5-6 colonies so far, so much fun!AWESOME! For me, it's definitely the GAME OF THE DECADE!I would say, it's even worth the 30$! Get's new content constantly + awesome 1 guy main developer			"

								RimWorld is a unique story driven game, every play through will be different then the last, with different twists and turns. Described as a mixture of dwarf fortress and prison architect, Rimworld really is a great game. I have been playing this gem since its early stages of life on rimworld.com. Each update has brought something new and interesting to the table, enough that Rimworld  has become my favorite game, and a game that I can't stop playing. I can't recommend RimWorld enough.Big thanks to Tynan Sylvester for creating such a great game, I look forward to the future of Rimworld.			"

								Avoid what is strong, attack what is weak! ( and capture them and treat their infections until they join you)I've been playing this game for such a long time. It's great to  see it on steam. It's one of the best games ever. I like the new scenarios and I love the new tweaks to the animal system/crops but honestly this was awesome since alpha 13. I can't possibly imagine what's in store for more updates and mods.Btw, you MUST get the hospitality mod that let's you receive guests from other tribes/towns so you can raise your relationship and pick some of the guests to remain in your colony.

								Definitely a game of stories. It is what makes this game so amazing. Here is my favorite so far.Ricky and Anna were 2 of 3 crash survivors. Anna was a medic, and Ricky could build practically anything. Together they built a life on Rimworld, and made the most of a bad situation. They found solace in each other after many hardships, and eventually they moved in and spent a couple of seasons bunked up. Things were looking up. Progress on their community was moving at an incredible speed with Ricky's engineering background. Anna kept everyone happy and healthy through the random raids. But new settlers arrived, and everything changed. One was a slimmer fellow by the name of Alpha (fitting). Anna took a liking to Alpha, but Ricky had no idea. He was in love with Anna and asked her to marry him. She turned him down, and shortly after, Ricky found out she was cheating on him with Alpha. This broke Ricky's heart. He built his own home, and watched as Anna and Alpha moved in together. This ate at him. Each day his mood became darker and darker until eventually he could take it no more. He caught Anna alone outside of the perimeter and attacked her with a knife, cut her right ear off, and stabbed her numerous times. She fell to the ground bleeding profusely. One of the guards showed up and subdued Ricky, locking him up with other prisoners. Alpha, with a bit of medical background, was able to save Anna, and nurse her back to health. He also helped Ricky recover...a mistake that would almost destroy the community.Even after healing up, Ricky had become highly unstable. Nothing could sate his rage. The community needed him for his building skills, but every time he seemed to improve, madness would overcome him, and he would have to be subdued by a guard or warden before he could do more harm. The community made a mistake keeping Ricky and the other prisoners in wooden rooms. Trying to earn their trust, perhaps welcoming them into the colony one day. Ricky took advantage of this. He, with two other prisoners, staged a prison break. While the other two prisoners went to dig their way out of a back room, Ricky began rampaging through the colony. He was finally shot and killed by a guard with a shotgun. Ricky had gone too far. The other two prisoners managed to escape, never to be seen again. Thankfully Anna had recovered by the time of the prison break, and with Alpha's help, they nursed the injured community members back to health. They all visit his grave from time to time and give what thanks they can to this troubled man who almost single handedly built their community, and almost tore it apart. A season later and Anna and Alpha are getting married come summer. After surviving a toxic fallout winter, and other hardships, apparently they grew closer together. Anna also just passed her 54 birthday, and as a gift, the gods gave her Carcinoma.			"

There have even been many a day where i am playing for what feels like a short time, but has been hours of just trying to make people survive in that harsh wilderness. Is it perfect?

								Tynan is one of the most transparent developers I have ever spoken to. Now more than ever, you have to be very careful about buying into an early access game. Many early access games have faded into obscurity or failed to deliver on any of their promise. RimWorld is not one of those games. The modding community for this game is already great, and will be made even better with workshop support. Whether you're a masochist that doesn't mind your entire colony being decimated every other day or a casual base builder, the game and the modding community has something to enhance your experience. Every update comes with a ton of new features to try out.If you like Prison Architect, this game is probably right up your alley. You have to manage all aspects of your colonist's lives: their joy, moods, health, food, living spaces...I recommend checking out the Twitch community for RimWorld if you are debating whether or not to get the game. Sacriel is probably one of the biggest streamers that plays. However, an entire other community has evolved for the game as well. There is a group that does speed running for the game (you can launch a ship to escape the world) to see who can get off the planet first. These streamers (ZeebosZone, disnof, spartyon7) play at the highest difficulty and often with storytellers that can send multiple raids each day. They also do other fun challenges, such as the Ice Sheet challenge (starting off on the coldest map seed and trying to survive), or the Cannibalism Only challenge. The fact that there are so many different challenges and restrictions you can make for yourself is one of the greatest things about this game and ensures for a ton of replayability. "

								(Review written on Rimworld Alpha 14 Steam Release)This game doesn't grant me a single hour of sleep. Horrors, nightmares, constant fear of stuff breaking down and colonists going berserk.You want an example:- New colony, 3 ppl, going on well, spring looking good.- Base building up fine, new folks coming in.- Lots of hunting and growing for the winter.- 7. of fall, manhunting pack of 18 wild boars tearing through my wooden base doors, killing my only meele guy, his dog goes berserk, eating the prisoners whilst the boars kill and eat my colonists.- Colony up for over half a game year. A wire in a wall had a short circuit, ignited the oven in the fridge, that ignited the food.- Temperatures went over 300°C in minutes, killing 2 colonists who tried to put out the fire through a heatstroke.- ALL food and all medicine burned, no animals around because it was winter.- Colony starved to death in days.Haven't had this much fun since Minecraft. Rimworld has the same addictive potential.Full mod support via Steam Workshop3 different storyteller AI with additional difficulty settings, can be changed ingame at any time.Scenario editor: Adjust existing scenarios or create your very own colony conditions:- Constant eclipse so solar cells and growing plants won't work? As you please.- Tribesman colony with cannibals on the ice shelf of the south pole? No problem.- A thunderstorm all the time with colonists exploding on death? Well, here it is, have fun.Constant updates, bugfixes and balancing adjustments.Good combat system.If you like pain, colony macromanagement and combat micromanagement I absolutely recommand this game to you.11/10!

								As a kickstarter backer, I've been playing this game for a long time, probably putting in 30+hrs per alpha.   I can't recommend it enough, Rimworld is fantastic.Every playthrough is different. The unique combinations of who your colonists are, the enviroment they start in, and the story and events that unfold ensure that you won't ever have the same experience twice.  Every new alpha adds more depth to that experience, and the wonderful modding community continues to enrich it.  It's a game that is constantly being tweaked and upgraded to find that perfect balance of challenge and reward.If you're on the fence, go for it.  You won't be disappointed. "

								I would warmly recommend Rimworld, despite its unforgiving gameplay.The game itself is a survival simulator, with a similar concept as Dwarf Fortress. You are a group of people that have crashed on a planet and your goal is to survive and return to space, or even remain -  depending on your preference.You create your own sanctuary (or lack thereof), trying to fend of wildlife and other villages/tribes of neerdowells, trying to get it to thrive.I bought this game a few years ago, and it was stable then, so this early access is a very immersive and complete game. The developers keeps adding to it, and there is a large and thriving modding community, so no game is the same.Verdict: 10/10 - would lose another sanctuary again.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't think I could possibly say enough about this game.  It definitely earns its Overwhelmingly Positive rating in my books.Don't be fooled by its simplistic 2D look.  There's surprisingly a lot that is hidden under the hood.  For a survival colony simulator, this one has an enormous amount of detail.  Also, don't let the Early Access tag throw you off of buying now.  This game is surpisingly mature even now and is remarkably complete despite being in Early Access.It covers all of the bases when it comes to basic survival against nature... climate (whether it be too hot or cold, or even uninhabitable due to some other factor like toxic fallout), hunting and growing food, finding sources of power, heat, and refrigeration for food storage, etc.  Then it throws in the added things like raider attacks, or attacks by mechanoids, among a huge list of other possible events.  But part of the additional appeal is that this game manages to simulate the personalities and mental states of every living creature on the map.  Not only do you have to worry about keeping your colonists well fed, happy, living together peacefully, and from going nuts, but there's also the chance that you may, at some point have to defend yourself from one or more animals that suddenly go mad (like a herd of squirrels... I'm not joking).The game does such a good job emulating the personalities of the individual colonists, I actually found I was getting attached to my colonists.  I cheered them on as they developed relationships among each other, some of which eventually led to marriages.  I would sometimes curse at them when they didn't do what I expected.  I was always leery of any newcomers.... like the pyromaniac girl I saved who was going through drug withdrawal symptoms who kept going nuts and starting fires all over the place.  But I nursed her through her rough time and she became one of the leading members of my colony.But besides all of that, it also allows you to run your colony how you like to.  If you're fed up with running a colony based on the morals/laws of current society, and would rather have a colony entirely made up of nudist cannibals, then go for it!  I know I used to run a pretty straight forward colony except that if I were attacked by raiders and survived, I would patch up any surviving raiders and sell them off as slaves and butcher the dead ones to feed to my livestock.  That is, of course, if the cannibals among the members of my colony could keep their hands off the human meat long enough for me to turn it into kibble.All in all, I generally have a hard time really getting into a game and sticking with it for a long time, but with this one I've put over 300 hours of game play (as of the time I write this) into this game so far.  It was extremely easy to become addicted.  Every day brought new events and new adventures.Extreme thumbs up for this one!			"

								I absolutely recommend this game. It is simply fantastic for many reasons. Below is just a brief summary/story of what just happened in my last attempt at getting a colony on the go. This is my main reason for recommending the game....the sheer fun of watching a story unfold right before your eyes, with you as the master and commander  (sort of).....................................................................................................................................................................................I started out as the solo rich guy on Cassandra/perm death (Can't remember exact name) and was happily setting up structures and planning ahead. Got my first trade visitor followed by my next colony member and things were looking good. Had power in place, plenty of rooms and the colony was taking off in the nice woodland biome.The weather changed to rain and my solar panel burst into flames. Manabu sorted those flames out straight away, but the flames broke out 3 times in a row. Manabu to the rescue once again....all is well. I sped the game up and watched things unfold for a little while....RAID!First raid was just a single noob like pirate. He got close to the colony where i had Manabu and Engie bunkered down ready to shoot. Manabu took the enemy out in 2 shots at distance before going back to business. Next raid happens and there are 3 of these filthy invaders. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s killed my pet Yorky called WAR and Manabu was f***d right off! -10 to mood! Manabu was firing rounds off at the enemy and they were shooting spears right back. I thought I'd be smart and try flank those dirty.....this resulted in Engie taking a hit and falling to the floor, but still alive.Manabu had to retreat and take cover, managing to peek round the corner of a wall and kill them all. He ran back to rescue Engie and placed her in the medical bed. Checking her health revealed she had a shattered spine and now confined to a damn bed! I kissed her cooking-14 stats goodbye and had Manabu tend to her needs daily. The room often full of puke and Manabu now looking like Super Nanny rather than Rambo! This went on for days and days.Manabu was like ""F this sh*t happening to me"" and laid down some turrets on either side for future battles. This proved to be a wise choice against the next 2 raids and made life easier. Winter was coming and so Manabu was hunting as much as he could to stockpile animals in the cooler for meal preperation. He got cocky and targeted half a dozen Gazelle. Those hairy and horny killers ganged up and charged at Manabu in a pack of 10+ easily. Manabu hit the dirt.....nobody there to rescue him and tuck him in to a medical bed. Engie puked her ring in bed obviously wondering when her hero was going to tend to her needs again. Her hero died to extreme hypothermia, covered in bruises and lying in a pool of his own blood. If Manabu had known how to turf Engie out on her ♥♥♥, he might still be alive =(.....................................................................................................................................................................................I have made several attempts at this, and each time the story/events were different. It was hilarious, frustrating, funny, sad...you name it. I will update this as I rack up more time, but do yourself a favour and get the game. Lots of micro managing, trial and error (unless you want to spoil things a little by using guides) and a whole lot of dying. Imagine if the great powers that be said ""I'm going to give you some power to pick and chose what you want these people to do, but I am also going ot throw many obstacles in your way to see how you all do""...well welcome to Rimworld.

								I have played 22 hours in 3 days. Game feels very polished for an Alpha, no bugs or glitches so far.The game itself is extremely rewarding to anyone who would enjoy Prison Architect, a simpler Dwarf Fortress, Unreal World. The stories and interactions that arise between your characters makes the game consistently fresh and exciting.My sculptor had a mental break and killed all of the boars in my camp. Had to have her elderly sister beat her into submission with a gladius before she would calm down.10/10.

								I usually dont write any reviews because I simply don't feel the need. I must say though this is one of the few games I would recomend for the simple fun of the gameplay. If anything you see or hear sparks any kind of interest then do yourself a favor and check this game out. Already in what the dev. is dubbing as the ""Early Access"" phase the game is more than playable, and in comparison to others in the same cycle it has content in spades. As time goes on more things are polished and added in to an already enjoyable experience.			"

								I have backed this game since at least Alpha 9 and have only seen it grow better and better in the probably 200 hours I have put into it. Even in Early Access there is more than enough content there to keep anyone busy for hours on end. There have even been many a day where i am playing for what feels like a short time, but has been hours of just trying to make people survive in that harsh wilderness. Is it perfect? No there are things that need to be improved upon, but they don't take anything away from this game.			"

								- Started up a decent colony that had a mountain base.- Had a brawler named Mitch that wielded a steel shield and a masterworks long sword.- Toxic fallout happened so I got everyone to stay inside the mountain for a couple of days. (Thought it would be a piece of cake)- Halfway way through the fallout, those stupid gaint ants started breeding again and have taken over my half of my mountain base.- Ordered all of my colonists to get rid of them, everyone got severely injured but they managed to clear them out. (thanks to the brawler I had)- Fallout is almost over and all of my colonists are extremely joy deprived and have cabin fever.- Mitch (brawler) decided to go savage and started killing everyone with the damn shield and sword they made for him?!?!- He killed all of my colonists and the last colonist that tried to stop him got his left hand cut off and his head sliced open.♥♥♥♥ you Mitch, and thanks for ruining my colonyGreat game I would totally recommend it, if you like seeing your colony go to♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								(Review written on Rimworld Alpha 14 Steam Release)This game doesn't grant me a single hour of sleep. Horrors, nightmares, constant fear of stuff breaking down and colonists going berserk.You want an example:- New colony, 3 ppl, going on well, spring looking good.- Base building up fine, new folks coming in.- Lots of hunting and growing for the winter.- 7. of fall, manhunting pack of 18 wild boars tearing through my wooden base doors, killing my only meele guy, his dog goes berserk, eating the prisoners whilst the boars kill and eat my colonists.- Colony up for over half a game year. A wire in a wall had a short circuit, ignited the oven in the fridge, that ignited the food.- Temperatures went over 300°C in minutes, killing 2 colonists who tried to put out the fire through a heatstroke.- ALL food and all medicine burned, no animals around because it was winter.- Colony starved to death in days.Haven't had this much fun since Minecraft. Rimworld has the same addictive potential.Full mod support via Steam Workshop3 different storyteller AI with additional difficulty settings, can be changed ingame at any time.Scenario editor: Adjust existing scenarios or create your very own colony conditions:- Constant eclipse so solar cells and growing plants won't work? As you please.- Tribesman colony with cannibals on the ice shelf of the south pole? No problem.- A thunderstorm all the time with colonists exploding on death? Well, here it is, have fun.Constant updates, bugfixes and balancing adjustments.Good combat system.If you like pain, colony macromanagement and combat micromanagement I absolutely recommand this game to you.11/10!

								I enjoyed the hours i played but I have 3 main issues with the game1. You cant leave your spawning area. Hopefully in the future you will be able to leave your starting area and be able to attack other villages/pirate camps in the future, but i dont see that happening anytime soon.2. Once you build your colony up enough and set up a decent killzone for the raiders to walk blindly into, the game gets repetitive and there isnt much else for you to do. I understand it is early access but there is basically no endgame except building a ship which just means the game ends and you win.3. Honestly i feel like the mental breaks are a bit over the top, I understand its a gameplay mechanic but the fact is if a tribe has to sleep on the floor and their pet dies, then they just go crazy and start killing all their friends? Pet animals are a hinderence and just get teamkilled instantly. The game is still a decent fun game, but I would say its probably worth waiting for a sale.			"

								This has been my favorite game for two years now. I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing this game long before it was on steam. First off, Tynan is a god among men, this game is his baby, and it's the best simulator around (except dwarf fortress but most people can't stand that game.... including myself). As of a year ago, I would have considered this game complete. He keeps adding awesome stuff left and right. None of it is gamebreaking (except those nasty underground bugs from the previous release.... but he fixed that right up). This game is challenging, addicting, fun, funny, gross, cute, morally wrong (like cannibalism, yay!), and did I mention addicting? We have all played games where you think to yourself ""oh, I'll play for just a minute,"" and then it's three hours later and you are wondering where the time went. This game, it's not a few hours, it can be days. No joke. It's a game for all people. Create a nice, calm scenario that you can take your time in with basebuilder Phoebe. Or you can smash your head against the wall and scream at your significant for inturrupting during the endless raids and horrible events with Randy Random on his hardest settings. Personally, I like classic on rough or harder, depending on my mood.Play with a cannibalistic horde in the ice sheets, or a tribe in the woodlands. The game is great for all people for whatever challenge or story you want to play. This game had over 100k downloads before it went on steam - and for a good reason. All y'all are late to the party. If I see another steam ♥♥♥♥♥ complain about this being another ""$30 for an early access game"", I will use my psychic ai bots to blow your brain apart (Rimworld joke). Just bite the bullet and give them the money they deserve - which is a lot more than what they are asking for.And congrats to Tynan and the rest of Ludeon for such a successful game and for getting your game on steam :) BTW, all y'all Steamers are lucky - at one point he didn't even want his game on Steam. He was making plenty of dough before he even got here.  "

								<h1>In space no one can hear you do horrible things in the name of survival.</h1>I don't recall exactly when I purchased this game, but I do remember it was durring the kickstarter period. Pretty sure it's been two years since then and I'll admit that at first I didn't play it all that much. The game was pretty barebones, hit 'start' and next thing you know your given three colonists, and a small handful of supplies. You were to survive as long as possible and it was fun for a time, but then I stopped. Time passed, and I got an email about an update and picked it up again. Stockpiles were tweaked to make things a bit more interesting and eventually I gave up and moved on again. More time passed, another email, and more new features. More boredom, dropped it again, more time, another email. And while that seems bad, it's probably one of the best things about this game.Most 'early access' games I've bought were, frankly trainwrecks. But Rimworld is diffrent, yes the updates are a touch spread out but in that time nothing but good has come from them. Every new feature was something that improved my experience as a player. I've yet to see an update that made things worse and to be frank I don't think I ever will. This is probably one of the best regularly updated games you could grab on steam so what I'm saying here is, don't let ""early access"" scare you away.Combat in the game is kinda difficult, but in the way that ""Realistic"" difficulty in a first person shooter is challanging but not ""impossible"" if you catch my meaning. Throwing a skilled melee weapons user at someone with practically no experience in firearms who's carrying a shotgun ends rather poorly for the person with the knife but in a way, it's to be expected. The game will throw increasingly challnging threats at you as your colony gets more 'Impressive' so if you're worried about getting overwhelemed quickly try to avoid gathering up materials that are valueable and hold little to no combat use and you have no need for. (Gold, Silver, Jade... These are things to avoid.) But perhaps the most impressive feature of the game, is how easy it is to mod. Don't like that concreete is classified as ""ugly"" neither do I! Single line to change, throws off the balance a bit but not too much. Wanna use Fallout themed weapons and armor? There's a mod for that. Want to get access to more and better bionics for your colonists outside the basic ones? There's a mod for that. There's a mod for just about everything in this game and if there isn't most of the game is rather easy to learn how to mod for. However, there is a downside; the game is constantly changing which can make modding rather tedious. The jump to steam alone changed so many varriables that I've had to restart a couple of mods I'd planned on and one I'd released from the ground up.All in all, the game plays like a simplified Dwarf Fortress meets Firefly. If your looking for that experience look no further. Just don't expect to find aliens in the base game (But I'm sure there's a mod for that somewhere.)			"

								One of the best resource management games that also generates a story in real time from the deep mechanics. First game: incompetent hunter with rifle gets bitten in the right eye by a tortoise and becomes unconscious, rescued but forever disfigured. Other colonists will be disgusted by the hunters looks and thus have a negative relationship with him that will lead to a negative downward trend that spirals out of control leading to ultimate doom.

								This game is a ton of fun.  I've been playing since Alpha 9, and wow this game has come a long way since then.  It was fun then, but the game has a ton of deep and rich features that should please any base/city building fan.  Customizable pretty much to your heart's content, this game can be a wonderful relaxing experience or it can be a high-stakes thrill if you're up for the challenge.  The learning curve may be a bit steep with all the systems in the game right now, but once you have the basics down (food and shelter, primarily) the rest of the game opens up with a huge amount of content to explore and master.

 Totally Recomment this game	 ""But why you say this already?""	I had the pleasure to play RimWorld before it went to steam and since the first day it was playable i already felt deep in love with the game but why is that?Let me tell you why it is for me and yes i know it doesnt look much but the devil lies deep down in the detailsYou can make games really simple and still extremly complex i only know Space Station 13 thats more complex then RimWorld what is a simliar game even if the goal in both games are different but we talk about the complex depth in this games.So why is it so good already? and why i recomment it while its still at this price?Cause it already has alot content in it lots of it and the best even mods and if you fall once in love with this game i will say its totally addicting i never regret the buy of it, neverWith the steam release it also got alot new stuff like the scenario system that makes the game even more interesting to playa last word i will say to this game: ""Some storys will never be forgotten and this games writes books of storys be it dramatic, funny or brutal neither or less you will recall those storys in your heart""	 "

								Love, love this game. Been playing for a couple alphas now (since 12) and watching Let's Play videos before that. And it just keeps getting better and better, And the best part of that is that it started out great. This game has been super stable, the only thing ever really causing any issues that I have seen is mods interfering with each other, which is purely an issue with operator error (yes, me, the fool poking at the keyboard.)Other Early Access games need to be stacked up next to this one for comparison. They will nearly all come up very sadly lacking. This game is a masterpiece. Even without the awesome mods this game is great. Many will say ""well the mods are what make it really great"" and while they are certainly correct, the reasons the mods are so good is that the dev planned and coded for those mods to be able to be made from very early on in this game and it shows!

								Tthe thing with rimworld though is it's not a ""game"" persay. It's a story, which is why suddenly and out of nowhere your entire colony is brutally slaughtered by some terrible event. You have 3 different story tellers. One of them, Randy Random can literally drop a giant pirate raid very soon after you crashland, your colony is dead and your story ends. Or you could survive for a little while, or you could survive long enough for you to build a new starship and escape the planet. Rimworld is a story, of survival and hardship. Your colonists suffer ilnesses, infections, injuries. They can lose limbs, eyes etc. They can get dementia, a bad back. A brain injury. Missing eyes. They can also fall in love, get married. Then you have families, a raiding part might attack and one the raiders if the brother of one of your colonists. Then there are rivaleries, just like in the realy world people don't always get along. Say a colonist dies, now a couple other colonist might've been good friends so they'll get a massive hit their mood, as a close friend died but another colonists hated them and now they're dead they're happy and have a spring in their step. Every colonist has traits and backstorys that are randomly generated. Some may be pyromaniacs, others may be cold tolerant, again others might be alcholics, drug addicts, hard works and the list goes on. For bakcstories, they may have been surgeons, builders, bounty hunters, royality and the list goes on. It's a very deep game and immensely satisfying. Unlike other random colony or city builders you get very attached to these colonists because of how deep this game is. "

								Give it a try! It seemed pricey at first, but so far I've enjoyed it a lot.Rimworld has: Interesting characters and relationships. Good inventory and task system. Good (if ugly) interface and controls. Challenging or casual, you choose.The best I can say for it is that it keeps you interested...after quite a bit of time playing I feel like i'm still learning it and coming back for more. It needs some improvement in a couple of areas, mainly art, so I hope the dev keeps adding to it.Note: This game caught my eye because of its graphical similarity with Prison Architect (resemblance is uncanny), but luckily that's where it ends, Rimworld is a much, much better game.

								Fun, Replayable, and still more stuff to come.from the hours i've pumped into this i think this ""management"" type of game is very fun.The replay value on this game is crazy good, you will never have 2 of the exact same advantures due to the random events.There are things i would personally would like to see changed but that personal opinions i might mod these things myself.Sadly.. the downside is the engine.i'm not sure if the engine isn't optimized but when i play these types of games i tend to go into the extreme.currently sitting on 500+ chickens 40+ arctic wolfs and some 10+ pigs.the game starts to stutters badly.at having i would assume about 100 pets? maybe 150? it will start.Overall my verdict 7/10Get this during summer/winter sale its well worth it.

								So I've got a nice village of eight going and everythings fine and dandy until two of my hunters go off to kill an alpacca or two. The alpaccas revolt, taking down both hunters, and rush off to my villiage to take down everyone else. Two of them survive tha alpacca onslaught, I send one around to rescue everyone while a psychic drone drives the other remaining villager to madness. So she's shooting the cat while the other's trying to tend to the wounded.. and.. well.. yeah I think everyone's going to die.Don't hunt the alpaccas. They will murder your people.For real though spend the 30 dollars, you wont be dissappointed. Whoever says this game is in early access is lying in the best of ways.			"

								-Spent first few playthroughs ending via one colonist having mental breakdowns and going on a killing rampage.->figured out how to keep people at a reasonable level of happiness, this is good. Progress. -Next playthrough had a pack of wargs come and maul my mere 3 survivors. Stood little chance with my lack of defenses and guns.->Figured out that I would have more chance against raids and these attacks if I arranged walls better defensively and used better micro. This is good. Progress.-Following playthrough had better guns and defenses, but was hit with fire spread from both sides of my settlement while being raided.->Turns out I should have cut firebreak zones around my settlement. (Also dont build walls with wood!?)10/10 Would get rekt (and learn via mistakes) again.			"

								Well, despite being early access and in alpha, this game is in many ways more polished and complete than many games when they leave beta.  As a Dwarf Fortress lover, this game is a no-brainer.  While DF has the bigger world, the more compelling narrative engine, and candy, Rimworld holds its own by giving you a much smaller sandbox with a much greater amount of control, packaged with a far more intuitive UI.And the cherry on top?  This game is, considering the developer and the fan base, probably only going to get better and deeper.  If you're not really into building/management games, or don't like games where one character's emotional state stands between a thriving colony and a slaughter-house, still get this game...just wait until it's on sale.  If you are a fan of those types of games, then I recommend that you buy it at full price, because it's more than worth it, and the developer having more money will probably end up translating to quicker updates.

Early Access Review
								I first played this game at a friends house, where I quickly became an addict. It's you against everything in an effort to survive challenges that vary from a blight that might wipe out your crops, to a toxic fallout which can kill off all of the animals, and leave you relying on whatever food you have stored and can manage to grow without dying from the poison yourself until it is over. Alien insect infestations, Ancient Aliens who have suddely awoken to eat your face, a random npc colony a little ways over who decides they want to take your things.... All those and more await you in this game.The game is in early access, but I'll be honest, I've paid more for games and not gotten near the amount of enjoyment as I have from this game. There is so much customization for your scenarios, as well as even AI levels, so as to adjust the difficulty. Mods are plentiful for this game, covering everything from aesthics to enemies, from types of food, to synthetic gel that you can grow and refine into resources... This game has something that I feel appeals to anyone and everyone. It has that nice sim feel of base building and management, the strategy aspect as to facing your challenges, as well as that survival aspect. Depending on your creativity, you can even do your own little roleplay in it as well between your colonists, as they tend to be fickle creatures. Some will get married, some will cheat, break up, fight... the possibilities are endless. Give it a go, you won't regret it.			"

								An early access game that WORKS? What is this contraption?Well, Rimworld is the perfect example of early access, an extremely treacherous and shady service, done SO ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT! You can almost not notice the ""Alpha"" stamp on the game. Exceptionally few bugs. Now, story-wise, the game has nothing. These ""Story tellers"" are actually just difficulty parameters  (Randy Random is the best). Furthermore, when ACTUALLY selecting the real difficulty, there's no ""normal"", the closest you can get is ""some challenge"" or ""Rough"".Action-wise, the game is satisfying and what normal gamer would call ""realistic"" (the right word being ""authentic""). Your settlers will often times miss, even ones with high shooting skills. Melee is definetly the way to go at CQC.You can even capture injured attackers, patch them up, and SELL THEM TO PIRATES, WOOOO! Become a slave-tycoon! Or, through the stockholm syndrome, recruit your enemies to work for you! Or just leave them for dead, to bleed out from their missing limbs, explained below.Characters can even lose bodyparts; Arms, legs, eyes, destroyed stomachs, lungs. These can be replaced with either organic replacements (only for intestence), simple prosthetics or even bionic bodyparts which are better than your pathetic orgnic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or simply dismissed. I have had several one-legged, armed or eyed guys. Even some One-lunged or one-kidney(ed?) ones too.The simplistic Prison Architect-ish art style fits perfectly into this amazing experience.Did i mention that you can create your own scenarios? Customize your starting gear, exposition and characters! Even starting animals!Final verdict: For being Early Access: 9/10, needs more story, things to do, goals. As a normal game: 8/10, same comment.			"

								So my crew of 3 crashed their escape pods into a open area and I started to build a basic base / shelter.  Shortly after getting started an outsider contacted my crew and asked for help.  But in accepting I had to fight off two angry and naked pirates who where chasing her.  After I saved her she joined my small crew on.  But that was just a a heat wave hit which drove everyone mad and caused them to wonder aimlessly.  Then an angry rabbit attacked and killed everyone off hince ending my short and sad first game.  LOVEN IT!This game has hit my most loved drivers for a game head on.  Survival & base building.  I am enjoying the ability to generate the same world to explore different starting spots.  The character creation is spot on providing both pro's and con's to each doomed castaway.  I am really having a hard time getting enough time to play this game.			"

Some pirates decide to attack, but get wiped out. Then I see that a colonist needs treatment even though the raiders were running. I click on the alert and find Justin is missing not one but both of his legs due to being hit by a sniper rifle. Only one person on the map had a sniper rifle, which was Samantha Von Aachen. Luckily we got a very skilled surgeon who installed bionic legs, shortly after Samantha and Justin fell in love and got married. Life is confusing and wonderful in Rimworld.			"

								I give this game an A-.  It is entertaining and one of the few must buys for simulation and rts fans.Strengths:1-It is easy to get to know and care for your digital folk--and to hate them.2-The tactics are surprisingly rich.  I was suprised that by the variables that are considered, and that the AI doesn't just straight out cheat.3-The game is beautifully complex.4-The developer adds material to the game regularly.Weaknesses:1-The research system is basically a placeholder designed to introduce the delay of tech into the system.2-While pathfinding isn't bugged, it is cumbersome.  The mods seems to correct alot of that.3-The Late Game is weak.  I find that the end game, where you blast of planet, when you regularly ship stuff back and forth with spacefaring traders, to be foolish.  You could leave with those traders or book fare at any time.  Considering that the game is story driven, it is enough to pull you out of the story.Wishlist--The ability to trade tech, and research rare tech trees would be useful.  Artifact tech would also give this part of the system a boost.  Adding risk to the tech process (e.g. insanity, drawing corp strikes, mood mods) would spice it up too.The limit on area definitions needs to be raised dramatically.  Pathing can be compensated for with more areas, but the 5 for animals is far too low.More endings.			"

								Simple recommendation... Ever since I first played Dwarf Fortress 8 years ago, Ive longed for a game that at least mirrored the kind of story telling and complexity that it offered, but with a much better graphical representation and something that attempted to be user friendly. To be fair, probably nothing will ever achieve the level of deep simulation Dwarf Fortress offers, but I can see this game coming close enough in the end product. Each update on this game is like an expansion that draws me into it for another week non stop. It's beautiful, it has heart, and it's fun.			"

								I have been playing this game for a good number of hours and I must say, every minute has been a blast. Constantly waiting for that one event that will turn your well oiled machine to chaos. To give you an example I'll tell a little story about one of my latest endavours on one of these unforgiving Rimworlds.Quellin was a happy place, tucked away in a little alcove with a plenty of food, clothing and weaponry. Most of the colonists were as happy as they'd ever be. Fred and Marcia were enjoying the company of their Yorkshire terriers and their collegues all had their duties in and around the little settlement.One day, Fred went out hunting and had set his eyes on the white-wooled Muffalo, as he'd seen a large herd the day before, at least eleven of them, not too far to the south. He set out with his trusty greatbow and managed to get a hit in but then disaster struck, the Muffalos turned on him and before he even managed to turn around he was getting swarmed by five of them while the rest was making their way north, towards the settlement. Most of the people there were still unsuspecting of any danger and even though a few archers had been set out as sentries, the town was soon overrun. Fred's body was nothing more than a meaty pulp and along the way Martin, who had a bad back, was overrun by the wooly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, knocking him out cold and leaving him to die as the set out for more violence. Bashing down the front door of my main recreational space and catching yet another colonist off-guard. The two Terriers weren't afraid of these brutes and they charged in, biting at the bovine's ankles but apart from spilling a few drops of blood it was to no avail, both of them became scraps on the muffalo's hooves long before the first one fell to a well placed arrow by an enraged Marcia, losing her husband was the first blow and the loss of her favorite furry friend pushed her over the edge. She charged out and managed to take down one of the invaders but soon joined her husband in the afterlife.The remaining inhabitants were hiding in the cooler, plenty of food and double doors would keep them happy for a while, at least, if the bloodthirsty herbivores would ever leave. I let time run by for a few days but the beasts were unforgiving and were dead-set on wiping out the hunters, in retribution to the death of their kin I suppose.How gruesome all of this may seem, I enjoyed every second of it and reminded me that this game is relentless.I love it.

Early Access Review
								I give this game an A-.  It is entertaining and one of the few must buys for simulation and rts fans.Strengths:1-It is easy to get to know and care for your digital folk--and to hate them.2-The tactics are surprisingly rich.  I was suprised that by the variables that are considered, and that the AI doesn't just straight out cheat.3-The game is beautifully complex.4-The developer adds material to the game regularly.Weaknesses:1-The research system is basically a placeholder designed to introduce the delay of tech into the system.2-While pathfinding isn't bugged, it is cumbersome.  The mods seems to correct alot of that.3-The Late Game is weak.  I find that the end game, where you blast of planet, when you regularly ship stuff back and forth with spacefaring traders, to be foolish.  You could leave with those traders or book fare at any time.  Considering that the game is story driven, it is enough to pull you out of the story.Wishlist--The ability to trade tech, and research rare tech trees would be useful.  Artifact tech would also give this part of the system a boost.  Adding risk to the tech process (e.g. insanity, drawing corp strikes, mood mods) would spice it up too.The limit on area definitions needs to be raised dramatically.  Pathing can be compensated for with more areas, but the 5 for animals is far too low.More endings.			"

								Rimworld is a awesome game, I definetly recommend it. Rimworld is a colony-managing game where you start with one or more colonists, you do not get tutorials or anything so you have to play the game without any tutorials. Another thing is the combat. I like the idea where colonists and other NPCs will take cover behind walls and sandbags to reduce injury, which is pretty cool. The game is awesome. You can build your colony however you want it to be. And your colonists will live there. Pretty awesome game!			"

								Started out with five random settlers with nothing but primitive technology and spears. Manage to build a base and defend against countless attacks from raiders with assault rifles, grenades, and sniper rifles using nothing but spears and bows.  Manage to tame 10 alpacas and traded for high tech military gear using the never ending supply of crafted clothes from my alpacas. Poison fallout spread throughout the land, where we rescued a couple alpacas yet to be tamed before they would die to the poison. Surviving that, bear-sized, man-eating insects spawned in the middle of my base. My settlers fought these insects, without a single person dying. My war torn people finally had a nice streak of peace to clean up and fix our colony. Until everyone died to heatstoke.			"

								I've been playing this game on and off since I bought it in 2014. I do really enjoy this game and if you like games like it, I'm sure you will enjoy this game. I like how you are able to create your own difficulity in the game, depending on which storyteller you choose, how the storyteller tells the story and where you settle. It can also depend on how you decide to interact with the tribes and different cities that are scattered on the world map (which sadly you can't visist in the current state, not sure if it will ever come). If you try to live peacefully or if you enslave them and sell to the next pirate ship your trade comm station picks up. Coming from Dwarf Fortress earlier in the genre I'd say this game isn't as complex as it, but I don't think it strives to be it. And even though it isn't as complex, it can be as difficult sometimes when random disaster strikes. I highly recommend the game for anyone who like the concept of the game, which is what got me sold on it in the first place. But as it says in the game description, only buy it if you like what you see now and not what it could become.			"

								My first group of colonists starved to death.  I hadn't counted on a crop blight...every season...right as my crops were ready to harvest...My second group were too busy harvesting the crops a little bit early to research air conditioning before a heat wave struck.  The dogs managed to drag them all back to their beds, where they died.My third group decided to try and hunt the valuable thrumbos for their horns, not realizing that the thrumbos could kill them all in one hit.But my fourth group, my fourth group got lucky with lots of wanderers and raiders willing to join the colony.  I begged, bartered, and stole for enough materials, and after 4 years was able to launch and escape.I now have a deep empathy for the dictators of the world, whose peasant followers couldn't be content with the plenty of food, heat, and shelter.  ""Loyal"" followers who insisted on ever nicer clothing and luxuries, and when they get everything they want they still get in fights and smash the arms off of the only doctor I have.  Who bond with animals they lack the skill to handle, and then go on murderous rampages when I won't ""give"" them the animal.There isn't a single colonist I wouldn't intentionally strand out in the cold as a sacrafice to the bears and the wolves.Is the colony in desperate need of that food hauled 4 feet into the freezer?  Sure, go for a walk or stare at the clouds instead!  That'd be great!This game is amazing.  I would like some three dimensionality, even two story living quarters would be helpful.  Or at least a guard tower so I can ""man the walls.""I'd also like to be able to turn off certain elements.  I find the constant onslaught of rabid animals to be an unwelcome distraction.			"

								Surprisingly good - this is the best way of describing RimWorld.  The last time I played an indie game with as much potential for replayability was FTL.  If you liked FTL, I'll take a leap here and say you will like RimWorld.  Very different in its concept, but similar in it's addictiveness and replayability which for me is really important.Each time you start a new colony the experience is slightly different.  Obviously there are similarities between games which have had me sighing a little when a colony goes wrong and I have start a new one, but on a whole its quite fresh each time a new game is started.  You build a base from scratch and collect resources, but the little people you start with have real vices and personalities, some are hard workers, some lazy, some hate each other, some spawn new little people if they get together!  Pets can be trained if you have a animal friendly little person too, and they can help fight off attackers or fetch resources.  This can sound gimmicky and a little micro-management heavy, and I was a little sceptical when I read about the AI story teller, but actually it really does work and is fun and balanced.If you're like me and prefer a permadeath game RimWorld comes with that option, and its great, knowing if something goes wrong (and it often does) you just have to keep going till your team recover or all is lost, and that makes the experience deeper, because sometimes you start to feel the journey with your characters, particularly if some get killed or maimed.  I actually got properly sad once when one character died and then his pet dog died defending him afterwards, I ended that game, and that was the end of that story.  The beauty is, you can then start again with new people and have another 'largely' unique adventure.Give it a go, it’s worth it just for the experience, it’s quite a unique game.			"

								Rimworld is easily one of my favorite games. Vanilla RW is polished, engaging, full-featured, and grim. The community is ranked among the best: friendly, helpful, and industrious. Choose from hundreds of mods to greatly expand on the gameplay, enhancing complexity and QoL, and adding more of everything! It feels like the dev works on enhancements to the framework of the game, while the mod community handles filling out the content. This is in my opinion the correct relationship for small or one-man development teams. This will without any doubt be a game I will be playing for many years to come.

								I've been playing RimWorld since Jan 2014 and I can't recommend it enough. It's like playing a top down version of the Sims only 100x better. :) You start out with a few colonists and start building up the colony from there. You will be utilizing various different types of people, which don't always get along.Each playthrough is a unique story and you'll likely be relating the story to people around you. My friend and I have swapped RimWorld stories over lunch at Taco Bell many many times. The stories are created by you, but also by the story telling AI. It keeps an eye on everything you're doing and throws little curves your way to bring you down a bit or help you a long if you are struggling. There are various different types of story tellers and various difficulties in each style you choose. With the steam release and Steam Workshop integration, using Mods and shared scenarios will be easier than ever.  I honestly can't recommend this game enough. If you like base building or management games you'll love RimWorld.			"

Very few bugs coupled with intuitive mechanics make the game a pleasure to play and extremely replayable. The modding scene is alive and the community is active in discussion with reachable devs.But now for something less serious, storytime!:One of my favourite playthroughs I did was on the far north of the world on an ice sheet, nothing grows, there are no animals to hunt.After getting attacked by raiders I turned my colonists into my new unwilling cannibals and began eating everyone who attacked me.Even after getting hydroponics set up I continued eating my foes, ""It will make my people strong!""By the end of the game I was crafting the leather from the raiders into armchairs in my rec room and had a fridge full of human meat.All in all this game allowed me to scar 3 colonists by forcing them to eat human flesh for 2 years, worth every penny!

								I've been playing RimWorld for a very long time. Way before it came out on Steam, I probably have close to 500 hours in the game already off Steam. Personally I think the game is already great and it just keeps getting better and better as more updates come out. I very rarely encounter any bugs and when I do they barely have an effect on the gameplay. The modding community is great, people are constantly hard at work to create bigger and better mods. From what I've seen the staff is fantastic as well. If you're worried this game is going to be another one of those early access games that take all your money and then cease development don't be.

								This game even though it is in early access is more polished then many games at release. So if you're typically staying away from early access due to lack of content and polish then you might want to make an exception for this game.As the game description says one could call it Dwarf Fortress with a pretty interface, but that would be selling this game short. While it shares many traits with dwarf fortress it also has many of it's own special things. But in any case be prepared to lose several nights to this game by just ""finishing this one thing"".What is really refreshing is that this is doing survival right, it's always a struggle, and not unlike many other survival games a walk in the park once you get over a certain hurdle. The storyteller will always find something new to throw at you to see if you can handle it.			"

Overcome with grief, she decided to exact revenge on the prisoner they kept in the holding cell. She quickly executed the prisoner and left the corpse where it was.For the next few days she was dead to the world as she slept to heal from the wound incurred from the last raid. Unbeknownst to her, a basket of berries had kept the cold storage room door ajar and the last of her food had spoilt. Though she could have resolved to start over and rebuild, she said ""$&# it"" and headed to the prisoner's cell.A few days later, this message:Sawyer, Doctor has gone berserk!

								If you like any kind of strategy / sim / survival (hell, even space) games, BUY RIMWORLD ! It is amazing how much ""game"" you get for the money.. And it is done by one dude ! Tywin Lannister ! (Or something like that). And big kudos for that ! It is amazingly detailed, but still very easy to get right. Especially with the new tutorial and learner in v.0.15.  And yes you maybe think its just Prison Architect in space... But after 10 min. of playing you quickly see, that Rimworld is very different from PA... But don't buy it for the graphics.. It its nice to look at and there are no glitches or bugs, but you dont play the game because of beautiful graphics.. You play because there is just soooo much stuff you can do !Oh and... Install some mods for it ! It only makes the game better and more enjoyable. Worth every penny ! 9 / 10			"

								One of my top 5 games ever. Absolutely wonderful in all respects. Huge mod community, updated all the time, beutifully realistic. The game does take alot of practice to get to the point where you can play without dying in the first hour, but hey! Thats realism for you. Espeacially amazing for being a one Dev game.			"

								I've put a solid 50 hours into this game pre-Steam.  It's an excellent dwarflike with intuitive controls, grade A tactical combat, and a challenging difficulty curve.  I'd say it's well worth the price now, but it's still a little skeletal in terms of content variety.  If you're on a tight budget wait a couple more releases for it to really get fleshed out.			"

								Simple recommendation... Ever since I first played Dwarf Fortress 8 years ago, Ive longed for a game that at least mirrored the kind of story telling and complexity that it offered, but with a much better graphical representation and something that attempted to be user friendly. To be fair, probably nothing will ever achieve the level of deep simulation Dwarf Fortress offers, but I can see this game coming close enough in the end product. Each update on this game is like an expansion that draws me into it for another week non stop. It's beautiful, it has heart, and it's fun.			"

								I dont review games often, but ♥♥♥♥ this one is good. Was hooked when my protagonists father moved in and developed an infatuation for the protaganists wife. The father was fat and didnt have any skills, but he loved to make his statues. He would tire away day after day making statues depicting his sons wife and himself coiled in embrace or watching the sunset.Then, one day after being rebuffed by the wife once again, the father went on a rampage and smashed my dogs head in. He had to be taken prisoner, would refuse to rejoin the colony, and died alone in his cell. That folks, is the meaning of true love.			"

								The base game is completely worth the price for the amount of entertainment you can get, and with the available mods, endless replayability. Despite being 'alpha', it plays much better than many 'released' games. The dev is also very active in addressing feedback. If you like sim games, you will love this. If you do not like sim games, you probably still will enjoy this game.			"

								Buy it.  If this game interests  you at all - do it.I read the reviews - one after the other positive, and I was like ""no way...""  But Oh Yes!  I have 100+ games of various types, but none of them are like Rimworld.   Some of the reviews have gone to some length to explain why its a great game, but I would suggest you won't know you like - ok THOROUGHLY ENJOY this game until you just buy it.  ( did I mention you should buy Rimworld? )Probably the only short coming has to do with the interface and how you are walked through the initial learning curve of the game.  This, by no means, makes it a bad game but would definitely be my suggestion for improving.			"

								Had this game for awhile now, and really happy they brought it over to steam.  Right off the bat you will notice how the art style and UI are very similar to the prison architect, which is a good thing becuase that game is amazing as well.  One of my all time favorite game generes is building.  Games like sim city, ceasar, prison architect, civ city rome, ect.  It's so refreshing to have a new game to play that brings all kinds of awesome elements to the city building genere.  The storytelling AI is cool, in the fact that it creates some cool situtations that brake up boring day to day operations.  It's rewarding to see your colonists strive, get married, survive a raid, and rescue surviovrs.  +City Builder+Storytelling AI+Gameplay+Unique Characters-No Multiplayer			"

								Played this game a fair bit a long time before it was released on steam. It's recieved regular updates so there's always something new when you go back, and so far it looks like an early access game done right. Also has a vast array of mods already available to really deepen the experience.In summary it's basically Dwarf Fortress gameplay with a Prison Architect interface set on a suspiciously earth like alien planet. It can really be quite the timesink as you spend hours upon hours building your base up perfectly only to have it destroyed by some mechanoids dropping in or a doomstack of enemy pirates or even an epidemic of malaria.Highly recommended and it's only going to get better as time goes on.

Just picked it up the other day when it hit Steam. And holy **** this game has improved immensely! Literally every aspect of the game has been imporived drasdtically since I last played.I have emailed them 2-3 in the past when I had a poblem getting the game working on Linux and 2 days ago when I couldn't get my steam key. They have replied to my emails within 1-2 hours every time. Not only is this an amazing game that I'm extremely excited is finally on Steam, but the main man behind it is geniuinely a great guy.Head over to the Ludeon forums if you want to see what I'm talking about.

								After around half a year of playing Rimworld i can definitely say that RimWorld is one of the best if not the best strategy game there is. For a alpha game RimWorld has a deep system of building, crafting and fighting that can hold you for hours without any breaks. There is always jobs your colonists need to do till you hit the point where you can finaly leave the planet. Since Rimworld is randomly generated with different biomes, difficultys and events that makes every Colony completely different.			"

								My partner bought this game and I decided to give it a shot and was immediatley hooked.I have just around 6 hours and I have decided to tab out of my game to write this review on why i believe you should buy this gmae. The following harrowing tale has just taken place in the space of about 15 minutes irl time and nothing i am about to recount has been made up. It has all just unfolded in front of my eyes and i just had to share the experience before i forget all the minor details.It is the 6th of summer. After being banished from their previous tribe this band of plucky cavemen and women set out to start a new.After a month of toil and food all but run out. Today is the day of the big harvest, at least, it was supposed to be.It is a chilly morning. 3 degrees c but the sun has risen and its warming up niceley. Everyone is ready to take in the harvest when V3trox spies some raiders to the north. Fortunatley we have prepared for this. The tribe is all skilled in the use of bows and our recent addition ""toad"" has been working hard to equip everyone with a bow.V3trox calls the whole tribe to arms but leaves toad behind as she is an outsider and has no place fighting for the tribe and is left to perform the cleaning duties.3 radiers come into sight. One armed with a shotgun, another with an smg and the last with a pistol. 3 against 5. We may have more men, but they have gunpowder. V3trox takes the head of the group. Velaniel, Mantis, Berro and Hawk stand behind him. The bows out range the guns, but not by much, enough to to get a wave of arrows in befor the enemy come in range.The first withering hail of arrows is released in a catastrophic failure, All 5 arrows completley miss, the tone of the battle is set. The first raider, armed with an smg opens up with a burst of shots. The group of tribesmen is peppered but mostly superficial wounds. A leg is shot here, an arm there but the tribesmen hold their ground and let loose another round of arrows. A couple hit but the damage is superficial. All 3 raiders are in range.The tribesmen are quickly mowed down in a merciless shower of leaded death. V3trox is the first to fall. A shotgun sweeps across him. His torso shredded, a hole in his stomach, damage to his left leg, his left foot is nowhere to be seen and in its place just a bloodied stump. Mantis is decimated. Smg rounds in every part of his body including his spine.Berro takes two full shotgun blasts. Blood pooling beneath herHawk takes the worst. Every raider scores a good hit on poor Hawk with both kidneys sporting nasty bullet holes.At this point all the tribesmen are still alive, albiet downed in pools of blood and vicera. Some concious and unable to walk. Others plain unconciousVelaniel retreats to the safety of the camp and to seek aid from Toad but all is not lost. One of the raiders is downed under the pouring stream of arrows. The  remaining 2 raiders, satisfied with the damage they have caused proceed to try and take a prisoner each and proceed to pick up Hawk and V3trox but a stray arrow landing on the floor forces one raider to drop v3trox on the ground. The raider turns around to see Toad screeming at the top of her lungs brandishing a spear. He gets hit, somewhere in the torso. The raider lashes out. A flurry of punches knocks Toad to the ground giving the raider time to flee. Toad is down and out. The final raider, a blonde female, runs with v3trox over her shoulder. Who knows what these raiders want but she was desperate to get v3trox back to her camp.Velaniel is trying to chase but struggles to breath. A stray bullet from the initial engagment has punctured her lung. Thats not going to stop her though. She continues the chase, launching arrows at the final raider. Each one lands a hit, each arrow slowing the raider to a bloodied stop. The fight is over, Velaniel gasping for air refuses to give in. The future of her tribe is at stake. She cannot afford to simply lay down and give up. She grabs v3trox and takes him back to the camp. She does the same to the rest of the downed tribesmen. Bleeding and gasping for breath she gets them all home. Velaniel stares at her dying tribe. No one will survive, they have all lost to much blood, had to many damaged organs. Only one person will survive. She walkes up to toads bed. What a ♥♥♥♥♥. A few punches and she was on the ground unconcious. This outsider. With only a few cuts and bruises. Velaniel tries to patch up some of the cuts whilst all the tribesmen she worked so hard to rescue all bleedout in their beds.Velaniel applies the final bandage before passing out on the floor, air failing to fill one lung. Toad awakes to see her saviour lying on the floor and carries her to her bed and applies whatever medical care she can muster...Will she survive without meds.This was too good for me not to share. I could restart with a new game or i could struggle to survive with just one survivor, maybe two but its unlikely			"

Early Access Review
								Although Steam tells you something different, I have bought this game soon after it's Kickstarter campaign and easily collected over 100 hours of playtime in the past three years. I can say that this was literally the game I waited for without knowing it when I first saw it. While it has an excellent presentation it gives you the complete freedom of choice how to develop your colony on the one hand, but also an ultimate goal, building a spaceship, on the other.Before you keep on reading a word to the few negative reviews from new players: Yes, this is a complex game. As someone said on the discussions: ""It's not a FPS where you start on heroic difficulty becasue you know shooters."" It's a game with many mechanics you will have to learn before beeing good at it, I recommend enableing the adaptive tutorial to learn the basic systems. It's also a very slow paced game with eventual peaks in form of raids or such. The two hours you have to decide if you want to refund are not nearly enough to see all the facades of the game and get a complete picture of it. Now on to the positives.Wether you want to build an underground complex or a large fortress, all stragtegies are viable and have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you need to hold a large base you will have lots of walls which you need to defend and the enemy may break through at different locations. But while you can keep your entry small and defendable if you go underground, you eventually will have to fight bug hives which can spread sub-surface and enemies which are equipped with granades and pickaxes in order to dig their way to you.The incredible amount of replayability also thrives from the different biomes and the recently added scenario system. Each of the eight climatic environments has unique weather, animals, diseases and challenges. The scenarios give you the ability to never play twice with the same starting condition, may it be the number of colonists, items and conditions of the map or forced cannibalism.There is also an active mod community which has specialised on vanilla- and lore friendly mods that truely expand the game to it's full potential. Every veteran will be able to give you a list of some length with mods that he/she considers necessary to play the game. Of course it's not unplayable without mods but they do add many quality-of-life improvements which make playing the game easier.Many people ask why they should pay 30$ for an early access title. Bear in mind that the early access is there to indicate that the game is still beeing worked on. However it has met all his goals, is polished, optimized and generally bug-free. You are basically looking at a finished game which will get expanded in the future and thus is marked as an early access. The developer, Tynan Sylvester, who made this game almost on his own, usually releases new mayor builds every three to four months, introducing new and basic game mechanics, like the scenario system, but we will have to see how steam dynamic will change this. If there are bugs which survived the extensive testing phase, you can count on a hotfix beeing published within days.RimWorld is what it says: a story generator. Usually I'm very suspicious about games who claim that, but in this case it is totally correct. Stories on the forums range from prisoners getting torn apart in order to sell their organs to colonists which give their lives in a heroic last stand to save the colony. If you're not sure, head over to the  stories forum [ludeon.com] and read one or two to a glass of your favourite relaxing drink.Anyone who has an interest in strategy, building and/or science fiction should buy this game and probably wont be disappointed.

								I bought this game at the end of 2014 and have been in love with it ever since.It is a truly remarkable basebuilder. It accomplishes this by mixing a few geners into it. It is part basebuilder, part RPG, part survival and part towerdefense.Playing the game feels like being in a constant crisis, death is ALWAYS looming for your colonists. It will take a long while before you can relax a couple of minutes, there is just too much that HAS to be done. Maybe you could also call the game a crisis management simulator.Other things i like:Good balance between micro and macroYou can designate global tasks for your settlers but can also give them a specific tasks if neededCrisp graphicsAlthough simple and 2d, the graphics are very crisp and clean.Decent interfaceHardly any bugsGood modding supportCool soundtrackGood replayabilityI usually don't play games after i finished it once but i have with rimworld. The different biomes and difficulty settings allow for very different experiences. "

								I’ve been playing RImWorld for well over a year now. It is a cross between unrelenting frustration and exquisite joy. This game makes most micromanagement games look weak. You micromanage your micromanaging. Which can be a bit frustrating of course. From setting up schedules to making sure someone is working on research of some kind. Protecting yourself from attacks and building a rocket to escape the planet, everything needs to be planned and then planned again. When you learn how to do something, win a siege or build that rocket, there is a sense of accomplishment. Now that it is on Steam perhaps others will have a chance to hear about it and give it a try. It’s a real lot of fun, and the mods for it….wow. The community long before it found its way here to Steam was outstanding. Some of the mods were incorporated into the game in the past. The team that works on RimWorld really listened to us in the past, and I do not see that changing anytime soon. Worth the price and then some Don’t let “Early Access” fool you, this is a well-polished game and then some.  "

								Only been playing since Alpha 13, but I've played a LOT of RimWorld since then.  Now that it's on steam, I'm scared of seeing where my playtime ends up.  This game is really, really, incredibly amazing.  If you like colony builders, it's difficult to do better than RimWorld.			"

								i've been plaing this game since alpha 7. In that time I have had to kill, and eat my dog to not starve, tasted the flesh of man, taken the lung from a old decrepid colonist to save my most skilled colonst with a bad infection....and it was the most fun i've had playing a game.			"

								I've had this game since build number 5. In the last 9 builds it has almost completely transformed. The game used to be a simple matter of putting your solar panels near enough to your turrets and building a lot of hydroponics farms. Now it simulates temperature, multiple biome types, an absolute ton of wildlife, robot centipedes, tribes of natives, advanced relationships, mineral variety and, apparently, swarms of killer alien insects buried deep in the mountains. I found all of these things out the hard way, and loved every second of it.Its also one of my favorite games to play with my little sister. She names all the characters, tells me what equipment they should have and laughs maniacally as they are all gruesomely killed off and driven insane.Its Dwarf Fortress, but with a UI you can actually understand, in a firefly-esque setting. And while it is still being added to, updated,and expanded, whats here is already a blast to play, and well worth the money.Five boomrats out of Five.			"

								No one ever thinks they’ll stoop to cannibalism.  But, then again, you don’t normally expect a bandit raid, 20 man strong, to storm your base in the dead of night while bunkered down for the winter.  12 colonists dead, 20 bandits laying frozen in the snow outside, and it’s just Cythia left to keep the joint running.Well… Cythia and Sam.  But Sam has never quite been the same after taking that bullet to the head and somehow surviving.  He used to be head of research but… he can’t keep up with much anymore.  Most he can do is push a broom around the joint, and even that doesn’t convince me I shouldn't just gut him for parts and be done with him.“You dolt.  You didn’t store anything in the walk-in storage?”Well… I did.  But the fire that broke out during the raid gutted my stores.And Cythia can’t run this joint on her own.  Which, really, she pretty much is.And there are all these perfectly good, frozen, man-shaped bags of meat just… sitting there… right outside my door.Like I said.  You don’t start off thinking you’ll have to eat someone but….====Don’t let the hours fool ya.  I backed this a couple years back direct from the developer and have been playing dev build after dev build, watching it grow in complexity.  I’m excited to see it out on Steam now, and can’t wait to see what the community does for the game through the Steam Workshop.It is a FANTASTIC game that has kept me occupied for countless hours.  One of the best parts, especially after you get your friends hooked in a few secessions of their own, is telling the stories of what was.Some damn brutal stories of survival, triumph… and a lot of failure.

								I have put about 60 hours into this game over the last few years of alpha.Rimworld has an amazing ability to draw you into creating your own story and getting attached to your colonists. The depth of the game allows some amazing, catastrophic, and absolutely hilarous things to happen. The developers release timely, extremely significant updates that take a strong foundation and keep improving it. This game can already be considered a full game with a huge amount of replayability. They also seem to be extremely nice people that care about makig a great game more than making a profit, which can be seen in the trust they give players regarding DRM. I hope that they can eventually make both of the above.Couldn't recommend this game more. (And it seems at this point out of 316 reviews, 316 are positive, so we are a strong majority haha!)			"

If you want to love dwarf fortress but cant get past its GUI (or lack thereof) this is the game for you! while in its current build it lacks some of the depth and scope of DF, it makes up for it with its solid ui and gameplay features making this an enjoyable little adventure. Update 14 adds customized starting options to further tailor your playstyle as well. TLDR if youre a fan of Sims i highly recommend this game. its one of the best there is.as with most people reviewing the game about now most of my hours in game are outside of steam "

								This review is for those who think is alpha worth it? Is the price right? Is game playable?This is propably the best game i have played this year. consept is brilliant. Something i always wanted from a game. Littlebit of everything. And oh loord how it is deep in gameplay. Every colony is different. Every character (pawn) is different. You get deep stories from game mechanics that randomize most things and that is rare thing in gamingworld.First time you play, don't read guides. just play. Learn. It gets dramatic. Try to survive. Trade, fight pirates, make awesome base, tame rare animals, have pets, aaaand the list goes on and on.Game is very playable at this state, and i don't get feeling that its missing something. It's solid build.Worth your penny? well ive been playing it now nonstop for days. And i promise, you will too.EDIT: ive played earlier builds, hence low hours.Stories: - My colony doctor got his leg blown off. Other pawns tries to keep him fed and safe with bad doctoring skills. Choices had to be made. He is not contributing to colony anymore. what to do? Lays in bed for months. Desperatly tried to find trader that sells prostetic leg to us. did'nt find one. Some butchering took place. -Main hero, ex military, alcoholic. No social skills, does'nt mind blood and is damn good fighter. Wounds all over his body. Has constant pains. Always in bad mood. Some colonists start fighting each other and in chainreaction people get bit berzerk. Main man Mr. Darkwood slaugthers them all in kitchen area. After that sits down and start eating lunch like a BAWS he is.-Main research dude Mr.reid is old with mad research skills, is hard working. Also have frekking dementia!! Constantly forget who he is and gets mental state. Always wandering around the map just staring stuff XD			"

								The state that Rimworld is currently in (and frankly the last year or so) is barely worthy of the term ""early access"". It is more fully-featured, stable and has a better community than many of the triple A titles I've seen in recent years which all depend on pushing out a bare-bones base game ASAP and then leech users with endless expansions (I'm looking at you EA).I've put hundreds of hours into Rimworld pre-steam and I look forward to doubling that now that it's on steam!

Despite the level of detail that the makers have put into the game it remains very approachable and entertianing leadingme to always go that extra day and lose another hours sleep. It can also be unforgiving...thought that you had a handle on everyhthing after beating back the strongest raid yet and only having one colonist hurt badly....well an insect hive just opened up in the refrigerator  containing your food supply, a solar flare went off knocking out electricity and your best fighter is in a hospital bed while one of your few totally healthy colonists is a pacifist and refuses to harm another creature. Too bad it is still winter and those crops will not be growing for another season....			"

								My colony was going swell until the AI decided that it was going too well and subsequently hit me with a massive raid... One of my colonists took a bullet to the lung during the battle, his friends took cover behind the sandbags we just constructed at the front gate, they fought hard until eventually all of the raiders fled,they survived, but we won.The injured colonist was rushed to the hospital, unfortunately without supplies there wasn't much our doctor could do for him. Daniel fought for days to stay alive, hanging on by a thread, until by sheer luck a trade caravan came to our colony. It was clear to all what had to be done...Our group took up arms and slaughtered every last trader and merc guarding them, no tears were shed, no remorse was felt. Instead, the healthiest looking member of the trade caravan was immediately hauled away for surgery, Dr. Watkins got to work as fast as she could and a few hours later, Daniel was resting peacefully, allowing his body to adjust to it's new lung. A full recovery was made.Instead of going the pro vs con way, I decided to write up a little story of an experience I had in a recent save game, just to show you a small scope of the details that exist in this amazing title.

								Have a colonist named Samantha Von Aachen. She's the best shot in the colony. Only person other person who can shoot is named Justin. Everyone else can't shoot, but one can melee. Some pirates decide to attack, but get wiped out. Then I see that a colonist needs treatment even though the raiders were running. I click on the alert and find Justin is missing not one but both of his legs due to being hit by a sniper rifle. Only one person on the map had a sniper rifle, which was Samantha Von Aachen. Luckily we got a very skilled surgeon who installed bionic legs, shortly after Samantha and Justin fell in love and got married. Life is confusing and wonderful in Rimworld.			"

Yet, I've been slaughtered in so many different fun ways, that I can't refrain from trying again and again :)RimWorld shows a very robust gameplay, and lots of potential. Don't get me wrong : The current alpha release maybe is more stable than most of 'Release Candidate' AAA titles on day-1 (not to mention the mandatory 6Gb patch ;) ).I've spent a few months on Alpha13, and had the most refreshing experience playing a game since a really looong time.Thanks to you Tynan (and Team) for such a great game, best wishes for the final product!Regards.

								This is a drama generator disguised as a game. You could just go through the motions and play this challenging survival game. Or you could take a few moments to actually read about the characters you are playing with and watch the story unfold.In one game, an overweight male cook crash lands on a RimWorld with two naked female sex slaves. The women are constantly frustrated at their lack of clothes. Mr. Cook is constantly hitting on the girls and trying to get lucky, and is constantly rejected. The girls who have the necessary survival skills between them (except cooking) ignore the cook's advances. The cook eventually goes insane and runs around in a crazy stupor until he eventually starves to death. The girls who cannot cook eventually get depressed over having to eat the corpses of animals they hunted raw and end up fighting. The one with medical skills is knocked out. The survivor has no medical or hunting skills. They both starve to death...In another game a family consisting of a daughter who is a researcher with some medical skills, her mother the botanist, and the ex husband/father who was a soldier, crash land near the pole with their pet Husky. The botanist can't do anything without a hydroponic set up as nothing grows in the cold and ice. The mother can also cook. The daughter can hunt and cook. And the father can build a shelter. They manage to build a small, heated space and have plans to create an indoor hydroponic set up to feed themselves as there are very few things to hunt out on the ice.Then the daughter is attacked by a polar bear while hunting a rabbit. The father rescues her. While she is in bed recovering, the father and mother can't take the stress of being in such close company anymore and start fighting. The mother is injured. The father has no medical skills. The daughter gets an infection which can't be treated and gets gradually worse. There's a short in the battery room and power is knocked out - with no power there's no heat. Mother - with some medical skills - gets hypothermia. Father can't repair the battery as there's no metal left, and the daughter had the mining skills. Besides - the polar bears are still out there...Eventually food runs out - the daughter dies of her infection. The mother dies of hypothermia. The father can't bear to eat the corpses of his family and starves to death. The dog survives by eating their corpses. Eventually, a wanderer stumbles upon the settlement. He figures he could just live there, mine some metal and fix the hydroponic set up. There's no food, but he has no problem with eating this frozen human protein lying around. He survives for days, repairs the battery compartment, and is re-buidling the hydroponics.A few days later an escape pod crashes near the shelter. The old man rescues the young woman - the girl of his dreams! He locks her in a room while she recovers, hoping to woo her and convince her to stay with him, that cannibalism isn't all that bad and that people are actually quite tasty. But she rejects him. Eventually he goes insane from digging up the frozen corpses and butchering them, and in his madness he attacks the dog. The dog incapacitates him outside the shelter, and the old man - unable to get back inside - freezes to death. The young woman locked in her cell starves to death...10/10 would turn cannibal and abduct women again!			"

Overcome with grief, she decided to exact revenge on the prisoner they kept in the holding cell. She quickly executed the prisoner and left the corpse where it was.For the next few days she was dead to the world as she slept to heal from the wound incurred from the last raid. Unbeknownst to her, a basket of berries had kept the cold storage room door ajar and the last of her food had spoilt. Though she could have resolved to start over and rebuild, she said ""$&# it"" and headed to the prisoner's cell.A few days later, this message:Sawyer, Doctor has gone berserk!

								If you like any kind of strategy / sim / survival (hell, even space) games, BUY RIMWORLD ! It is amazing how much ""game"" you get for the money.. And it is done by one dude ! Tywin Lannister ! (Or something like that). And big kudos for that ! It is amazingly detailed, but still very easy to get right. Especially with the new tutorial and learner in v.0.15.  And yes you maybe think its just Prison Architect in space... But after 10 min. of playing you quickly see, that Rimworld is very different from PA... But don't buy it for the graphics.. It its nice to look at and there are no glitches or bugs, but you dont play the game because of beautiful graphics.. You play because there is just soooo much stuff you can do !Oh and... Install some mods for it ! It only makes the game better and more enjoyable. Worth every penny ! 9 / 10			"

								I don't think I could possibly say enough about this game.  It definitely earns its Overwhelmingly Positive rating in my books.Don't be fooled by its simplistic 2D look.  There's surprisingly a lot that is hidden under the hood.  For a survival colony simulator, this one has an enormous amount of detail.  Also, don't let the Early Access tag throw you off of buying now.  This game is surpisingly mature even now and is remarkably complete despite being in Early Access.It covers all of the bases when it comes to basic survival against nature... climate (whether it be too hot or cold, or even uninhabitable due to some other factor like toxic fallout), hunting and growing food, finding sources of power, heat, and refrigeration for food storage, etc.  Then it throws in the added things like raider attacks, or attacks by mechanoids, among a huge list of other possible events.  But part of the additional appeal is that this game manages to simulate the personalities and mental states of every living creature on the map.  Not only do you have to worry about keeping your colonists well fed, happy, living together peacefully, and from going nuts, but there's also the chance that you may, at some point have to defend yourself from one or more animals that suddenly go mad (like a herd of squirrels... I'm not joking).The game does such a good job emulating the personalities of the individual colonists, I actually found I was getting attached to my colonists.  I cheered them on as they developed relationships among each other, some of which eventually led to marriages.  I would sometimes curse at them when they didn't do what I expected.  I was always leery of any newcomers.... like the pyromaniac girl I saved who was going through drug withdrawal symptoms who kept going nuts and starting fires all over the place.  But I nursed her through her rough time and she became one of the leading members of my colony.But besides all of that, it also allows you to run your colony how you like to.  If you're fed up with running a colony based on the morals/laws of current society, and would rather have a colony entirely made up of nudist cannibals, then go for it!  I know I used to run a pretty straight forward colony except that if I were attacked by raiders and survived, I would patch up any surviving raiders and sell them off as slaves and butcher the dead ones to feed to my livestock.  That is, of course, if the cannibals among the members of my colony could keep their hands off the human meat long enough for me to turn it into kibble.All in all, I generally have a hard time really getting into a game and sticking with it for a long time, but with this one I've put over 300 hours of game play (as of the time I write this) into this game so far.  It was extremely easy to become addicted.  Every day brought new events and new adventures.Extreme thumbs up for this one!			"

								Rimworld is exceptional because the developers have had their ear to the community of players for 14 alpha releases.The actual experience can be described as ""story of woe generator"" because each game you play turns into an epic drama of survival and hardship, usually progressing to tragedy.  Yes, you can play the easy basebuilder mode and just learn how to create a mega colony, but thats not where your best hours will be in this game.Check out Ludeon's forums where players tell stories of how their colonists had to resort to cannibalism to survive an epic cold snap that wiped out their crops.  How they captured raiding tribesmen, and harvested their organs to save a sick member of the colony.  How a small herd of Alpacas went mad and attacked a fledgling colony, ultimately burning it to the ground.  My most recent game included a pair of colonists who were madly in love with each other.  However, one of the lovers had a crazy sister.  Social time was a little awkward up until the wedding.  The Ceremony was beautiful and the attendees went to bed with a large buff to their mood.   Then, the sister went mad with rage and set the colony on fire while everyone else was sleeping.  10/10 will bring popcorn to the next episode of ""What insane way will my colony fail today?""			"

								RimWorld is simple in concept (survive and build your colony), but in its execution it's unfathomably deep, to the point where it's actually imtimidating when you start a colony for the first time. Once you ease into it though, you'll be hooked. The fact that its early access is only a good thing in this case, because it means more free content will be added to a game that already feels entirely finished and polished. Unless you hate 2-D games or the survival genre, play this. 10/10.			"

								In a day an age most games bore me and I don't have the love I once had for games....Rimworld makes me love again. No game plays the same. You can do so much to help the colony thrive or a character could be useless. This is a game you can keep coming back to and enjoy, when the game of the week gets boring.			"

								I bought this game a few months back and I'm so glad I did. This game is awesome if you like basebuilding and survival in a micromanagement setup, where each individual in your colony have certain trades that makes them faster at learning certain things. And then there are the quircks of each one, making each of the crewmembers you make absolutely unique. On a side note, yes it's expensive, but there is so much content for an early access titel, with everything running smoothly (haven't encountered any bugs at all since I bought it). So yes, while it is expensive, it's worth every penny			"

								Rimworl has been on my wishlist for about 6 months and when I finally got it I was familiar with how to command AI since I played prison architect before which is very similar graphic and mechanic wise. I put 12 hours into this game keep in mind I had school as well as homework to do! This game is so addcitive and you want your colonists to thrive and you grow attached it is hard to see your favorite die haha. Overall this game is awesome I was able to..-Save people and habve them join me-Keep prisoners and do surgeries on them which was cool-See my colonists fight-Fixed broken limbs colonists have gotten due to fights-Traveled in caravans across the rimworld(different seed for each world so the world generates randomly)And so much more!I recommend to this game to anybody who is ddepluy into games such as prison architect, sims, etc. and they should give this a try because it is a awesome game. I cannot wait to see what updates they have for us in the future to make the game EVEN BETTER than it alreayd is!			"

								Literally about as close as you can get to an acessable Dwarf Fortress. If that doesn't get your attention then let me expand upon that statement: this is a game of survival. With the new scenario system you have many options to set the starting parameters but what this game is really about is surviving in a colony that you have made from scratch. You will manage your colonists to gather materials, construct structures and furniture, defend your base, farm and hunt food and research. How will you do this? You often will not; you will fail and it will be fun. But when you do and manage to not only survive but thrive the sense of accomplishment is strong. Check out videos if you are still wondering if this is for you but this is one of my favourite games and it isn't even finished.			"

If you want to name all your colonists off spongebob characters you can, and sooner or later you'll find patrick getting malaria, spongebob and plankton getting married, and sandy going into a mental daze, running outside in the middle of winter naked and proceeding to fight a bear with nothing but her bare hands. That all happened to me in this game, and is why i love it. Every new start i made has a new adventure which i can't describe. If you want to see your favourite cartoon characters being mauled by bears, fighting diseases and falling in love, get this game, because its awesome.			"

								I absolutely recommend this game. It is simply fantastic for many reasons. Below is just a brief summary/story of what just happened in my last attempt at getting a colony on the go. This is my main reason for recommending the game....the sheer fun of watching a story unfold right before your eyes, with you as the master and commander  (sort of).....................................................................................................................................................................................I started out as the solo rich guy on Cassandra/perm death (Can't remember exact name) and was happily setting up structures and planning ahead. Got my first trade visitor followed by my next colony member and things were looking good. Had power in place, plenty of rooms and the colony was taking off in the nice woodland biome.The weather changed to rain and my solar panel burst into flames. Manabu sorted those flames out straight away, but the flames broke out 3 times in a row. Manabu to the rescue once again....all is well. I sped the game up and watched things unfold for a little while....RAID!First raid was just a single noob like pirate. He got close to the colony where i had Manabu and Engie bunkered down ready to shoot. Manabu took the enemy out in 2 shots at distance before going back to business. Next raid happens and there are 3 of these filthy invaders. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s killed my pet Yorky called WAR and Manabu was f***d right off! -10 to mood! Manabu was firing rounds off at the enemy and they were shooting spears right back. I thought I'd be smart and try flank those dirty.....this resulted in Engie taking a hit and falling to the floor, but still alive.Manabu had to retreat and take cover, managing to peek round the corner of a wall and kill them all. He ran back to rescue Engie and placed her in the medical bed. Checking her health revealed she had a shattered spine and now confined to a damn bed! I kissed her cooking-14 stats goodbye and had Manabu tend to her needs daily. The room often full of puke and Manabu now looking like Super Nanny rather than Rambo! This went on for days and days.Manabu was like ""F this sh*t happening to me"" and laid down some turrets on either side for future battles. This proved to be a wise choice against the next 2 raids and made life easier. Winter was coming and so Manabu was hunting as much as he could to stockpile animals in the cooler for meal preperation. He got cocky and targeted half a dozen Gazelle. Those hairy and horny killers ganged up and charged at Manabu in a pack of 10+ easily. Manabu hit the dirt.....nobody there to rescue him and tuck him in to a medical bed. Engie puked her ring in bed obviously wondering when her hero was going to tend to her needs again. Her hero died to extreme hypothermia, covered in bruises and lying in a pool of his own blood. If Manabu had known how to turf Engie out on her ♥♥♥, he might still be alive =(.....................................................................................................................................................................................I have made several attempts at this, and each time the story/events were different. It was hilarious, frustrating, funny, sad...you name it. I will update this as I rack up more time, but do yourself a favour and get the game. Lots of micro managing, trial and error (unless you want to spoil things a little by using guides) and a whole lot of dying. Imagine if the great powers that be said ""I'm going to give you some power to pick and chose what you want these people to do, but I am also going ot throw many obstacles in your way to see how you all do""...well welcome to Rimworld.

								Great game with a lot of potential, its a alpha so it isnt finished.Cons: Ai is not alwyas the brightest, could use some more varied endagame scenario's.Pro's: Great colony survival simulator with plenty of options and treaths. You can have a extremely easy or a very hard start. Thins i would love to see: Have a AI controlled colony setup in the same map as you (bigger) with relatively smart AI. That you can either friend or foe.So ill keep it short. Depending on your difficulty you can have a base builder, or a OMG please give me peace game.Tl'dr - Make a base, get raided.

								The state that Rimworld is currently in (and frankly the last year or so) is barely worthy of the term ""early access"". It is more fully-featured, stable and has a better community than many of the triple A titles I've seen in recent years which all depend on pushing out a bare-bones base game ASAP and then leech users with endless expansions (I'm looking at you EA).I've put hundreds of hours into Rimworld pre-steam and I look forward to doubling that now that it's on steam!

If you're a fan of city builders, or survival games, and you can deal with the graphics, this game will give you hours of fun.My longest colony went on for about nearly 8 years, all of the original members still kicking. I sent out 4 of my colonists in a caravan and a day later was attacked by a large raid and all but 2 people were wiped out, leaving 1 a vegetable. Turned my caravan back in hopes I could salvage what was left, only to get swarmed by a manhunter pack leaving noone alive. My last ""good"" colonist went into on alcohol binge and we were hit by another raid a couple days later.I had been playing this colony for 2 weeks, and they died in less than an hour. 10/10 would get f*cked up again.

								Surpisingly fun and addictive! Having bought this game on a whim, I had little to no expectations going forward, now I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Rimworld provides a unique approach to city management, resource management, building, and simulation / strategy genres while remaining simple enough in gameplay to quickly pick up and run with it. Though simple in design, there are enough random elements and variables within the characters and maps to make for a true infinite possibility of gameplay, true re-playability at its finest. If you've been on the fence about this game make the leap, you'll be sorry you didn't do it sooner! Worth it at full price (truthfully worth more than the full price)Pros:Simple, engaging, and addicitive (maybe that's a con)Controls, UI, and time management make this easy to play on any system with any amount of time availableInfinite replayability and random aspects of gameplay, no two games will ever be the sameCons:Some of the more complex gameplay features are a little hard to deduce the first time throughStill in development; until full release it's hard to give a true 100% review.Worth it at full price, a must buy when on sale! 4.5 / 5			"

								I have been playing RimWorld since very early alpha, about 2 years now. This is the best colony simulator I have ever played, and I have played them all up to now.If you are worried about this being Alpha, don't be. The game is updated regularly and with tons of new cool features every time. Also the modding community is massive and the game changes dramatically (harder / easier, more realistic / hundreds of new options) whichever you prefer based on what mods you use. Before Steam release I used about 30 mods, and they work well together. I imagine modding will be even better (if possible) on steam.Graphics are awesome (kind of like Prison Architect) gameplay is incredible and depth of immersion is fantastic.I can't give this game less than a 10 out of 10.If you love colony type games (DF, Gnomoria, etc...) You will love RimWorld! Buy it now! You will not be burned by ""early access"" on this one. The game is already 100% playable.			"

								This is a fantastically enjoyable game for the obsessively detail oriented; you are building a community, but stuff happens; a mid-fall cold snap cripples the winter food supply, and you have to decide whether to eat the dogs, or hold out just a little longer waiting for that caravan you called for, hoping you have enough silver to get through til spring.Spring comes, everyone survived, even the dogs, then eight raider from a nearly tribe invade, killing half the dogs and paralyzing one of your original colonists, who helped you build everything from day one.She now sits in a hospital bed, waiting for someone to feed and talk to her, while her friends and lovers die, and are replaced by new, strange faces, living in the homes she built, her home slowly moving on without her. This game creates stories that actually make you feel things, rather than ""press x to throw the baseball at the racist"".			"

								There is blood from wall to wall. Pickles and his cat have been literally torn to pieces. Steve the turkey? Shot 35 times. He bled to death in the corner of the room.I bought Rimworld more than two years before its release on Steam and have put hundreds of hours into it since then. Although updates are usually only released every one or two months, they are generally substantial additions. Prepare carefully is the best mod right now.			"

								I've put a solid 50 hours into this game pre-Steam.  It's an excellent dwarflike with intuitive controls, grade A tactical combat, and a challenging difficulty curve.  I'd say it's well worth the price now, but it's still a little skeletal in terms of content variety.  If you're on a tight budget wait a couple more releases for it to really get fleshed out.			"

								This game is incredible. If you're a fan of city builders, or survival games, and you can deal with the graphics, this game will give you hours of fun.My longest colony went on for about nearly 8 years, all of the original members still kicking. I sent out 4 of my colonists in a caravan and a day later was attacked by a large raid and all but 2 people were wiped out, leaving 1 a vegetable. Turned my caravan back in hopes I could salvage what was left, only to get swarmed by a manhunter pack leaving noone alive. My last ""good"" colonist went into on alcohol binge and we were hit by another raid a couple days later.I had been playing this colony for 2 weeks, and they died in less than an hour. 10/10 would get f*cked up again.

								Surpisingly fun and addictive! Having bought this game on a whim, I had little to no expectations going forward, now I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Rimworld provides a unique approach to city management, resource management, building, and simulation / strategy genres while remaining simple enough in gameplay to quickly pick up and run with it. Though simple in design, there are enough random elements and variables within the characters and maps to make for a true infinite possibility of gameplay, true re-playability at its finest. If you've been on the fence about this game make the leap, you'll be sorry you didn't do it sooner! Worth it at full price (truthfully worth more than the full price)Pros:Simple, engaging, and addicitive (maybe that's a con)Controls, UI, and time management make this easy to play on any system with any amount of time availableInfinite replayability and random aspects of gameplay, no two games will ever be the sameCons:Some of the more complex gameplay features are a little hard to deduce the first time throughStill in development; until full release it's hard to give a true 100% review.Worth it at full price, a must buy when on sale! 4.5 / 5			"

								I have been playing RimWorld since very early alpha, about 2 years now. This is the best colony simulator I have ever played, and I have played them all up to now.If you are worried about this being Alpha, don't be. The game is updated regularly and with tons of new cool features every time. Also the modding community is massive and the game changes dramatically (harder / easier, more realistic / hundreds of new options) whichever you prefer based on what mods you use. Before Steam release I used about 30 mods, and they work well together. I imagine modding will be even better (if possible) on steam.Graphics are awesome (kind of like Prison Architect) gameplay is incredible and depth of immersion is fantastic.I can't give this game less than a 10 out of 10.If you love colony type games (DF, Gnomoria, etc...) You will love RimWorld! Buy it now! You will not be burned by ""early access"" on this one. The game is already 100% playable.			"

								tl:dr - Do try this game.  Don't get attached to your colonists. Kill all the cougars.There were five of us.Daniel ""Dan""Olesya ""Lalande""Theodore ""Seraph""his brother, TanIvanand Flora, our retriever.We started out with a modest farm, built into the mountain, slept out in the cold.  Things weren't easy but there were livable.  Tan was getting over his Flake addiction by taking up sculpting, Dan trained Flora and they were inseperable. Lalande and Seraph hooked up on day one.  Ivan was Ivan.We managed to get up a solar panel, a battery, and a freezer within just a few days.  Next task was working on living quarters.  However before too long a pair of raiders came hunting us down.  We killed one and knocked out the other one.  Threw him in a makeshift cell and learned his name at least. Finn wasn't so bad.  Ivan sort of befriended him.  A day after that a woman ran into camp to hide from some local tribe.  Her name was Carson.  We took care of the pair of tribesmen rather quickly.  Things couldn't be going better.  It was only a matter of time before something happened.A cougar, of all things.  Started huntin Flora.  It was by far the better predator and killed our dog.  Daniel lost her leg to that thing before we managed to put it down.  The damage was done.  So we made a tomb for Flora, and set Daniel in bed.  We had used up all our medicine so we couldn't do much about a prosthetic.  Sometime after that, Seraph and Lalande got engaged, Ivan convinced Finn to join us, then started dating Carson.  I guess Ivan isn't so odd after all.  A drop pod got us some medication so Daniel could get the medical procedure she needed to walk again.Then we hit a dry spell.  Nothing happened for days.  We built rooms for everyone. Celebrated the Wedding of Seraph and Lalande, and even Ivan ended up proposing.  Everything went to hell so fast.  Middle of the night, a battery overloaded and started a fire in the freezer.  All our food went up in flames.  Ivan and Carson died trying to put out the fire.  They never got to get married.  The rest of them waited outside as the fire died down. Our farms survived.  We had four stable crops that gave a steady supply almost daily.  So we started rebuilding.  What would you know another damn cougar shows up and takes down Daniel.  Finn tried to lay some cover fire, and Lalande grabbed a knife.  Sadly they weren't quick enough.  Daniel died that day.  It took her arm this time, and even chewed off a bit of Lalande's toe.  Finn started cowering and Tan finished it off before it could get more of Lalande.So now there's four of us.  And I still can't stop playing despite the pain and suffering.  I can't help but cheer on the survivors, and hope for the best.  At least I've got Tan, Seraph, and Lalande.			"

								Fun and addicting game. Primely features town simulation and survival.I lost a lot of sleep when I first started this game.What I like about this developer is that he is always participating on his own forums too.And Rimworld doesn't really count as Early Access any more.Now. Surviving on a Rimworld...A colonist gets their foot and arm shot off, or cut off by the assorted wildlife and invaders.This makes them very innefficient, and I notice how bad this was after watching the injured colonist hunt elephants one handed, and limp away very slowly.I luckily have a prisoner that I kidnapped from a recent raid.I chop them up for spare body parts.Transplant those onto my injured colonist.Good as new!Now the rest of the colony is horrified towards what was done on the prisoner.But they had a fun party recently, which calms them down. One colonist was a beautiful woman, but after losing a hand and an eyeball, nobody in the colony likes looking at her any more.Fixed this by inserting an eyeball made out of solid gold and giving her a wooden hook hand.Now they think she's beautiful again.Another pirate gets a lucky shot and shoots a colonist in the head. Damaging her brain so bad she becomes a vegetable.Colonists have to deliver her food each day to keep her alive.Have to find a brain implant to fix her.An orbital trader eventually comes along and has one.It's more expensive than the rest of my colony combined.Food stores are getting low, and I now really have to consider whether it's worth it to keep this vegetable colonist alive.Surgeryworld.

Messi knocks one of the bandits out and Vlad shoots another in the head. Order Vlad to then execute the knocked out bandit. The girl joins the colony and starts researching new stuff.Winter comes. Think I have enough crops to last me. I was seriously wrong. Now Vlad and Sarah resort to hunting every day while Holly cooks simple meals non-stop. Messi gets his leg torn off by a rabid fox and is bed-ridden.See a herd of Muffalos and go to hunt them all. They get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and trample Sarah while Vlad runs for his life.♥♥♥♥♥♥ they've found our colony and aren't leaving, attacking everytime someone steps outside.

								It's always been my rule that I won't buy any game if I don't think I'll get at least one half hour of entertainment for every dollar I spend on it. Thus, I was a little hestiant to spend the $30 on Rimworld. Would I really get 15 hours out of what looked like a fairly simple little colony builder? Hoo boy. I'm at 40 hours into it right now, and I've only just scraatched the surface of what I want to do with this game. I spent my first campaign, like most people, getting utterly destroyed by my own hubris when I started on regular mode for my first try and pirates wrecked my camp within an hour. The second and third tries lasted a bit longer, difficulties reduced and strategies improved. The fourth and current attempt I started with a small tribe of five instead of the crashed three. I'm sad when colonists get killed or kidnapped, exaltant every time they acheive something amazing. Each individual has their own personalities, which causes all kinds of trouble and hilarity as they climb their way up the technological tree into the future.You can also feel, as you go along, where the developer will be putting new things in the future. There are un- or underutilized pieces of the game, like the factions, that will pretty obviously be expanded later. The highly accessbile mods already created by the community fill a lot of these gaps already.Long story short: buy this game. If you have ever liked any game that involves building, organizing, or complex strategy like the Civilization games, you will get every bit of your money's worth out of it. Take my advice though: start on Freeplay, in the mountains, and where the growing season is year-round. You'll thank me for it later.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game now for some time, and backed it on Kickstarter in 2013.  Since this time the game has continued to grow and develop at a great pace.  This review is based on Alpha 14, the last version before Steam release.  I estimate that I have approximately 200 hours of play.The setting for this game is a group of people in a sci-fi frontier backdrop (Firefly) trying to survive.  Rimworld is described as a ""Sci-fi Colony Sim"" by the creators, whilst accurate it is a rather dull description of what is a very fun and exciting game.  This game has the depth of Dwarf Fortress with the aesthetics and visual style of Prison Architect.  Throw in a great 'western' (as in cowboy) soundtrack and you have something pretty special.  This is a niche game, it is not for people who prefer form over function, but after watching the trailer you will know if that is you or not.This game is hard on its default / average settings.  Your colonists will get sick and die, you will run out of food, wildlife and raiders will attack, colonists will freeze to death or go mad, and natural phenomenon will thwart best laid plans.  Luckily, the amount of customisation available is huge.  You really can tweak most options in the game, by changing your starting climates, picking your storyteller type and difficulty and selecting custom rules.  You can select a random group of survivors or re-roll them as many times as you like.  Options that are not changeable in game are often mod-able.  The Ludeon Studios forum has hundreds of mods available, although many will likely require updating to be compatible with the Steam release.  I would like to thank the creator of “EdB Prepare Carefully” for making a mod that I find it hard to play the game without.The sandbox in this game is rather large.  If you wish to build a small cannibalistic tribe (yes, you really can) that live in wooden huts in a jungle, you can.  If you want to build into a mountainside for the true Dwarf Fortress feel, you can.  Want to tame animals to attack hostile entities or help with hauling, guess what, you can.The story progresses nicely at a pace determined by the storyteller options you selected at the start.  A typical playthrough will have you rushing at the start to get shelter, and food.  As you expand and more colonists join you will look towards researching new technology, and upgrading security measures.  After a source of electricity is constructed, you can really start to grow.  All the while you will have a number of challenges, some brutal, some comical.  I recall one raid that followed after a solar flareMy only criticism of the game is that at the time of writing this, you cannot visit other colonies on the world map to raid or trade with them.  I would not be surprised however if this changes in the future.EDIT: Regarding the only criticism above, it has now been added!			"

								I purchased this before it was live in Steam--when you could only buy it from the Ludeon website.Loveitloveitloveitloveit. If you liked Banished, it's like that--except with more... spirit, and a certain space western vibe.It's one of those, uh, little builders where you can't really control the person, but you can dictate that ""stuff needs to be built,"" or ""this needs to be harvested."" And they'll do that. Add it to a little priority queue. And this one'll be lazy. And that one will prefer working at night. And that one will want to marry the other. But the other is married to a third. And then a radiation storm rolls over your colony--and suddenly it's no longer safe to go outside, but that's where your crops are, so you pray that you have enough food in storage.And then the worms break through the cave walls!The music is pretty good, too. ;)Beyond all of that, my only real complaint--even now, having played it as long as I have--is that the UI is a little difficult to navigate. The buttons down at the bottom of the screen, that is. If you're not sure what you're doing, it's not entirely obvious, and it takes some getting used to.			"

								This game is absolutely ridiculous and ridiculously hard.  I love it.The commands are largely simple, but the interactions and complexity are huge-- reminiscent of NetHack, Dwarf Fortress, or the like, but much more approachable.  The game is HARD.  Progress is hugely satisfying, but defeat is frequent (and often hilarious).I recommend getting the ""Prepare Carefully"" mod, and that's it.  Even WITH ""Prepare Carefully"", the game is really hard, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable challenge.The ""Narrator AI"" gimmick is a neat approach, and it works really well.  It's most fun to use the slacky relaxed settings until you have a big♥♥♥♥♥colony, then switch it over to something harder.  Oh, the chaos and mayhem.The backstory engine is surprising, too!  Your colonists will surprise you, and will actually be interesting.  Well, except for the graphics, but you get used to that pretty quick.Great work, guys!  Keep bolting on!PS:  Oh, yes-- if you ever feel your colony has become invincible:1. Buy 250 fertilized chicken eggs.2. Wait.3. Laugh at little chicks everywhere.4. Several minutes of business as usual.5. Starve.6. Realize that chickens need to eat-- and they did.			"

								I've been playing RimWorld since Jan 2014 and I can't recommend it enough. It's like playing a top down version of the Sims only 100x better. :) You start out with a few colonists and start building up the colony from there. You will be utilizing various different types of people, which don't always get along.Each playthrough is a unique story and you'll likely be relating the story to people around you. My friend and I have swapped RimWorld stories over lunch at Taco Bell many many times. The stories are created by you, but also by the story telling AI. It keeps an eye on everything you're doing and throws little curves your way to bring you down a bit or help you a long if you are struggling. There are various different types of story tellers and various difficulties in each style you choose. With the steam release and Steam Workshop integration, using Mods and shared scenarios will be easier than ever.  I honestly can't recommend this game enough. If you like base building or management games you'll love RimWorld.			"

Note: Played time is not reflective of actual time spent - I entered via the Kickstarter which gave us a non-steam version of the game for quite some time.Don't be put off by the Early Access or even Alpha descriptor!Despite being absolutely accurate in the sense that the game is not feature complete - what is here could easily have passed for a full featured release.Heck - it could have done so since the time before it came to steam. If you liked the idea of Dwarf Fortress but couldn't get past the ASCII 'graphics'......then you tried it with tilesets right? There are a number of good ones.But also, this could be the game for you! It shares the same sense of 'Fun' - it understands that success in a game isn't the only criteria for it to be enjoyable. That the loss spiral needs to be at least as equally fun as when things are going just swimmingly.Wait... What's Dwarf Fortress?:oWe can't be friends any more.Although I suppose you could be forgiven for making your first forray into the jungle of colony survival (*cough*) games Rimworld.There have been a few other attempts to capture the same things that make DF a winner, but none have managed it as well as Rimworld to date.

								I think the game falls short of it's desired outcome (ie escaping the planet) but as a basebuilder it has amazing potential. Workshop support also adds so much to this game. Looking forward to seeing where it heads in the future.			"

								I've played RimWorld for quite some time--probably over 100 hours--from the DRMfree version available on their Website.This game singlehandedly caused me to loose an entire day, one moment it's 10 A.M. and thenext it's 1:00 in the morning.The premise of RimWorld revolves around your colonists trying to survive on a planetthat's out to get them. With an intelligent storyteller, it throws various events tokeep you on your toes.One example of a game I played recently was when my colonists were in a boreal forestand the weather was below freezing. They were complaining about the cold, so I made heatersto comfort them--but not in the traditional sense. I used the AC system that was keeping myfood frozen (in hindsight I suppose I could have just left them outside, but oh well)and using the exhaust from the AC system to keep the bedrooms warm.Long story short, an event that caused my batteries to explode caused a fire in the bedrooms.I tried having my colonists extinguish the fire but due to the combination of the heat fromboth the AC and the fire, my colonists started to burst into flames, killing everyone butone person.Oh yeah, then their pet dog went rabid and killed the remaining surviver.The versatility and replay value of this game is immense, creating hours and hours offantastic gameplay.All I have to say is, GET THIS GAME! 10/10 Would spontaneously combust again.

								Though I have barely any play time on steam I have played this game for over a year now, and easily have 500 hours clocked.  Rimworld is a colony builder sim similar to games like dwarf fortress and dungeon keeper. It looks like prison architect, but dont be fooled by its simple art style, its has a complex combat system takes into account things like visibility, cover, weather and injuries. The difficulty level in the game is dictated by storyteller ai that throw different events at you. Storytellers range from merciful to sadistic and help create moments of desperation and victory that make this game so intriguing.   The game is easily modded and tweaked, and regularly updated. The dev Tynan Sylvester and his team are really dedicated and post up regular updates on the dev blog. Some of my experiences with the recent updates include: Having to store human bodies for the winter when a blight wiped out most of my crops. Harvesting a colonist's captured pirate uncle for organs  when said colonist lost a lung fighting said uncle. A love story unfolded between a dull farm boy and a 3000 year old aristocrat, the farm boy ended up sacrificing his life to save the artistocrat when a cougar went mad and attacked the colony during the wedding ceremony. This game is all about the joyful and dark moments you'll experience with your little colony.			"

								I bought this game when it was in Alpha 7, I've been playing ever since then. Every week I love to just relax on the weekends and watch my colony grow. Afer each update I created a new world and every time it felt like the game went through an evolution. My favourite update was when they added the extented health system. If you love games that are base-builders, overseer, and controling a settlement, then you will love this game, and I highly recommend that you try living in the tundra when you have gained some experience. Living in the tundra is my favourite spot to live in because it presents a really challenge.Although it is a great game remember than it's still in Alpha and bugs/errors/crashes can still happen.9/10 Overall10/10 if they make it so that you can name the animals yourself.

								Fantastic Game, have been playing this since it was released (pre steam).Some thoughts below:Endless hours of fun, stress and restarts trying to get everything perfectGraphics are basic but thats what this game needsYou will spend more time trying to get the right colonists before the game starts than the main game itself, which makes it even more frustrating when they die to a rabid squirrel straight awayIt overall is a fantastic game with a pretty simple learning curve, overall i have put roughly 400 hours into this game and each scenario i have played has been completley different.Hoping they add the mods to the workshop as some really do make the game.---Jesus			"

								In my first game of Rimworld, a wanderer named Vladimir Black stumbled upon my colony from the desert and joined us. He proved useful as he had experience in performing medical procedures and one of my initial survivors had her legs broken in an attack from a man-hunting squirrel. Unfortunately, as Vladimir got to work on his operation to fix her legs, he botched the surgery. She was most displeased, and he perplexingly got frustrated at her for the operation's failure. He returned to work on her legs and botched the surgery again, leaving her a cripple. He immediately fell into depression and was in a fragile mental state, and ultimately lost his mind as he was scouring the plains searching for food.He took off his clothes, and began beating up the other survivors with his bare fists.They retaliated in turn, but he proved too powerful for the colonists. One, a 94 year old man named Spiffy, had to be carried back to his bed in a critical condition. He beat on Patricia, the woman he had botched surgery on twice. He beat her to death. Spiffy's wounds became infected and disease spread quickly throughout the colony. One of the colonists shot and critically wounded Vladimir, but out of some misguided notion of honour nursed him back to health. Vladimir once again turned on the colonists, who were already at breaking point.Raiders came and saw the colony in disrepair and kidnapped the only able-bodied, sane members remaining. Vladimir, Spiffy and Hutch succumbed to madness and beat each other senseless.10/10 would recommend.			"

								My 3 colonists initially worked good and hard to achieve what I asked of them: A place to call their own, a farm to grow potatoes and a nutrient paste dispenser. They never went hungry and never needed to sleep on the ground.Fast forward 20 days and they are pretty sick of that disgusting potatoe nutrient paste sludge, tired of sleeping in a area small as a shoebox.The female colonist snaps first and starts to put everything on fire, and is quickly followed by our only doctor who also snaps from having a mental breakdown due to the hideous decor. He brings out his shotgun and starts to bash the last healthy survivor to death who sits calmly eating his paste.RIP my loyal Potatoe lover			"

								First attempt. Permadeath mode, cause why not you know.after months of work finally, my colony is starting to stabalize. The people are happy and well cared for and the prisoners from raids are well monitored and slowely coming along to my side.When I discover an ancient evil in the side of a mountain and decide to dig into it. Break the wall down and out pour five naked sex slaves running for their life. I desperately try to fend off the robotic bugs that are chasing them down but can't do much with my primitive weapons. Then suddenly from within the cave dozens of arrows come flying out. murdering sex slaves and scarabs alike. I think that perhaps this is some miracle come to save me and my new potential recruits, when suddenly a giant robotic centipede crawls through the break in the wall and proceeds to decimate my colonists. I only hope some traders happened across my home and made good use of the ample stock of supplies left behind.10/10 would release ancient evil and attempt to rescue sex slaves again.			"

								We crashlanded in the coldest of places, a tundra with nothing to offer in the way of resources or shelter.That first winter was the hardest. We had managed to scrape together a meager harvest during the summer, but as we ate meal after meal in our small wooden hovel, we knew it wouldn't be enough. By the middle of winter, we had killed and butchered the cat. A few days later, starvation set in. We thought we would die there, staring at each other, emaciated by unfortunate circumstances.Then, a miracle. Some cargo pods broke the atmosphere overhead. Braving a cold and driving snow, we set out, praying the pods had a bounty of food. As we crested the hill near the cargo pods, we realized what had landed in our midst. 526 units of human flesh sat there in the snow, mocking our hunger. We slowly collected it and brought it back to our hovel.One of us went berserk. We had to beat him unconscious. Then we slowly nursed him back to health, all the while feeding him the flesh so that he could regain his strength. Others of us started fires, trying to cope with our predicament by burning it all down. Most of us just silently wandered around the hovel in confusion, not wanting to face the dark sin we had committed.But eventually, winter broke. Spring came, and we emerged from our hovel. Alive.Things are better now. We built sunlamps and heaters so that we can grow corn even through the coldest of winters. We domesticated a herd of caribou so that we can have milk and meat whenever we please. We sell smokeleaf and manufactured clothing to keep our economy going. Things are so good, some of us even settled down and got married.But now, when an escape pod crashes near us and we hear the helpless pleas of a survivor begging for our help, we don't even blink. We simply surround our newest meal and slowly begin our feast.Welcome to New Hannibal. Mind your toes.			"

								First attempt: Start simple, right? So I go tribal start in a rainforest. I learn the basic controls and mechanics of the game, painfully at times.All is well.Unable to build walls yet, I dig out a home in a small hill. Beds for everyone.My community thrives and slowly grows and expands its numbers and riches.Still no walls.Get raided multiple times by bandits, often having some major injury from the firefight.Into the second year nearly every living member of the tribe either has an eye patch, hook hand, or peg leg. One colonist is even totally blind, having lost both eyes.There's gotta be a better way.I know, I'll tame some attack animals. Tamed my first two panthers no problem. Never got a chance to train them before attempting panther number 3...Tanning fails. Panther attacks. Kills 3 of my 6 colonists, and injures my doctor and cook. Nothing but the hunter left who doesn't know much of medicine.He attempts to save them.During surgery on the doctor, he critically fails at installing the peg leg and removes her brain (how, I have no idea). The cook later dies of infection.My hunter lives his days in solitude until the next bandit raid. During the raid he is shot and his stomach is destroyed. He dies alone from infection.10/10 Would remove brain again			"

								This game is just absolutely, utterly, unbelievably fantastic. I've been a supporter of Rimworld since 2013, when I purchased into one of the very early versions, and I've been a huge fan ever since, I've logged hundreds of hours on the game before it was released on Steam. This game crafts you a story and crazy things can and will absolutely happen. I've had spurned lovers go on rampages killing the person who spited them, a bear defending my colony kill half a dozen tribal attackers emerging only with a new collection of scars, plagues wipe out colonies in the blink of an eye, and had amputate the leg of a colonist after a vicious squirrel attack. This game never gets old, never gets reptitive, and it will always shock you with just how organic and original it can be. It's absolutely worth the purchase, a great game with an enormously responsive developer, and constant, signifcant updates. If you do get this game (Which you absolutely should) just remember, never reload a save if something terrible happens, it might be incredibly tempting if you lose a colonist during a raid, or a farming season goes badly, or a colonist goes on a cathartic drinking spree. This isn't the kind of game you play to win, it's the kind of game you play to experience.			"

								After playing heavily through A6-A7, I thought I was done with this game back in A8. The Steam release proved me wrong. I sat down to play the new (A14) build at about 10pm a few nights ago. When I got up to get a drink of water at 7am... well, it was 7am.A bandit named Sven attacked our settlement one day. My sniper shot his leg off. We gave him decent medical care and a nice bedroom to recover in - but did not replace his leg, just in case he got uppity and decided to try to escape. Took a year to convince him to join the colony. We didn't know how to make good prosthetics yet, so we installed a peg leg just to let him walk again (at 60% speed, after a year of bed rest).A few days later, while Sven was out mining steel to upgrade our A/C system so people could survive a >55C heat wave, a rat went berserk and injured his good leg - reducing his walking speed to basically nothing. As he hobbled home under a load of steel after killing the rat, a group of pirates (from Sven's original clan) attacked. He didn't stand a chance - but he distracted them long enough that the rest of the colony could form up and repulse the invaders.The doctor who had cared for Sven for a year, eventually convincing him to join the team, and who installed that peg leg died of heat stroke the following day.9.5/10 - Minus half a point because I'm still tired from the other night.

								Well,after all this time,I don't remember a good enough story to tell. But,there was this one time where I led a group of tribals,and gave the leader an A.I chip,Bionic arms and legs,all Synthetic organs... Hell,if I saw that guy,I'd run and tell my faction to worship him. Besides,everyone who fought him ended up casually persuaded to join or shot to death by powerful,futuristic weapons.EDIT:New story! After seeing chapter one of Rock Paper Shotgun's ""Bogdan's Rest"" I made Big Boss Hotel. With a LOT of mods,including Glittertech and more furniture,fashionrimsta,and MORE,I built a massive hotel in a Boreal Forest inside of a hotel. We had Kevin ""Boss"" Lewis,with great social skills,Craig Boone,who keeps talking about how his wife is dead,but then shoots millions more to death,and Shauna ""Food"" Gray,who makes food. We quickly made a grand entrance hall,and right above the entrance,we made a massive power room.  To the left,we dug further into the corner and built our rec center,where our first infestation was. Boss beat some bugs to death with his baton,but Boone came in and killed the rest in around one shot while Food ran outside and hid behind a tree. We then dug below the rec room,and expanded to the rooms. The first 2 were guest rooms,and the next 2 were for staff. Staff rooms were larger and had colours based on the personality and name of the character. We dug so far down,and then came our first visitors! They were a group of Outlanders and had some good stuff to trade. They all went into thier rooms. One guy brought some drugs,he began smoking flake,then died. He overdosed or something. We happily took his stuff,and when Boone was wearing his jacket,noone suspected a thing. After a while,they left,and were so amazed they turned over the rest of thier drugs to us! Remember kids,don't do drugs,give them to random strangers!1 season LaterARK! GET AT THE DOOR! BOONE! GRAB THE RIFLE! COOKE! GET OUT THERE!Fourty Rhinoceri outside,bashing at the doors,invading Teh Coive (Our stockpile) and bashing our Enmergency Exit. Boone one shots them all,until they blindly run away to maul a caribous. Cooke charges out there and shoots the legs off of 3 of the beasts. They fall over as Ark guards the entrance,blindly firing her assault rifle at the monsters. Our turrets finally regain power from the solar flare,and mow down the rhinos. As the others begin to wander off,as they've gotten bored of death,we all rush back in and go to the hospital. Down below,a prison break occurs. The Pirate Leader we captured has decided enough is enough. With his useless Lackey,Justin,they break out and grab some wood from a nearby room,under construction. Boss rushes to deal with them,as he is our noble warden. He whacks Maker on his head,and as Justin draws near,Boss flees upward to get more reinforcements. Our pregant,and brave dog,Taffy,charges forth. She bites Maker's arm,and he whacks her tail and legs with his wood. Maker,in a smidge of pain,takes a bow from an equipment locker in a room,and shoots Taffy. She dies in one hit. Her middle-stage fetus,is never shown the beauty of this world. In a fit of rage,Boss charges Maker and beats him senseless. He knocks him over,he falls in pain. Justin,in fear that his beloved boss was struck down,rushes back to his cell. Later,we put Taffy in a Sarcophagus. Maker recovers and stays in his cell,as the hated Dog-Killer. Our colony mourns the death of Taffy still. The save continues on to this day.

								Colonist went mental because an 'innocent' prisoner died in custody. She started attacking her beloved dog, whose wounds later became irreversibly infected. Sold the dog to another tribe. Colonist went mental again, so I had her knocked unconscious. Dog died before the tribe could leave my colony. Butchered the dog...Colonist ate a 'meal' upon regaining consciousness...Excellent game.			"

								If you liked the base-building of ""Prison Architect"", but wanted to be a castaway survivor in a frontier planet fighting beasts, gangs of pirates and the very elements themselves, this is the game for you. They say it reminds one of Firefly, and that's not far off the mark. I've gone days with nothing troubling happening, and then suddenly your power blows, and a rabid turtle attacks and kills a wandering boomrat and now you're trying to stop a wildfire that's sweeping through your pastures, threatening your fields and you're trying desperately to get your crops in while praying for rain.An example of how things can suddenly go off-kilter. Playing as ""Winter"" Steel, we were minding our own business, with the colony struggling to hunt and get our first crops in for the season. Suddenly a pirate raid hit from the Fire Whips, but it turns out their leader is Winter's father, Jake. We fought and won, but Winter, their best hunter and doctor, was knocked unconcious during the fight. She gets taken to her room to recover, but her father is captured, and barely holds onto life for a day, before his wounds kill him. The secondary cook, as it turns out, had some experience in cannibalism, so ate most of Jake raw, made meat pies out of the rest, and fed them to Winter, while she recovered. When she was mobile again, she had not just eaten and killed her father, but now had to live down the stigma of not having a grave to bury him in. Winter went a little insane. She wandered around in the rain unconsolably for a couple days, her friends trying to keep the place together wihtout their best hunter and planter. She dropped her rifle somewhere (where a passing pirate stole it, I assume), and then stripped naked and stood in the rain in the back pastures, until she finally got back off her knees, got dressed again and began lending a hand. But she spent a lot of time in the graveyard, looking at all the pirates she had killed over the last few seasons, and her wandering made her sick with an infection. She wandered off on another hunting trip, when a rampaging man-hunting rhinocerous gored her, before being put down by the perimeter sentry guns.Once more sick and dying of an infection, her friends tried to console her, and nurse her through the sickness, but there was no medicne, and WInter was their best doctor. She mostly recovered, but as a fragile shell of herself, wandering through her days, doing what was needed, but never recovered her soul. She spent more and more time in the cemetary, and finally died of a heart attack next to her own granite sarcophogus.Here lies Winter Steel. Murdering depressed cannabilisitic warrior of the Rimworld frontier. I think she and Alison Reynolds are my two spirit animals.Play it. Make your own tale of woe and wonder. But don't fall in love with anyone. They will all die. Hard.PS - Best death yet. Eaten alive by a horde of thirty mad, manhungry capybara. Because that's how we all wanna go.			"

After playing for 60 hours, and over 100's of hours off steam because i have played Alpha 6, and i am a public tester. I love this game. This is a game where you can watch a small group and a small wooden hut to evolve into a glitterworld level hut, with power armor and miniguns. Then watching that glitterworld hut burn down or mech's shooting though your best guy. Making classes and watching the game messing up your plans. Getting raided by people with wooden clubs but they are 90 years old. Or watching the raiders coming with power armor and all you have the logs of wood.

								It was a nice summer day in New Toledo, the 6 colonists were going about there business, when 2 robots appeared and moved in on the colony. All 6 colonists rose up to try to stop the robots, but alas, it was worthless. Our gunpowder weapons were ancient compared to the charge beams of the robots. One robot posted up outside the colony, taking potshots at the automated turret. The other moved in. Gerald was first. He was shot in the chest then ripped apart by the robots. Wolf and Feeb were then torn apart and collapsed. Luckly, Henry managed to rescue both coloists and carried them to saftey. Both robots were now looting the village, destroying anything that they could. Sam and Henry, the 2 remaiming healthy colonists, then decided to go out and try to take down one of the robots. The battle lasted around a minute, but both Sam and Henry were downed, knocked out by the robot. New Toledo was on the brink of destruction, when Wolf, who was downed earlier in the fight, managed to heal enough to walk. He jumped up and began to limp out of the hospital. Wolf knew that the only way the colony could be saved is if he could reach the coms console in the middle of the colony and call for help. He dodged the robots as he slowly limped to the console. Wolf made it, and called on a friendly colony to send military assistance. He thought the coast was clear, but as he left the console room, he was shot in the head and decapitated by the charge beam of the robots. The friendly faction arrived, but was ambushed by the robots. 2 of their 5 soldiers were killed. During this, Feeb healed enough to be able to walk. She had to reach Henry and Sam to save their life. She stumbled out of her bed, and limped outside. Half way to Henry and Sam she collapsed from blood loss and heat stroke. The friendlies would take down both robots, but it was too late. Feeb died of heat stroke first, with Henry bleeding out shortly after. Sam was the last colonist of New Toledo, and managed to stay alive though the night. He died the next morning. New Toledo was no more20/10 Would get emotionally invested in video game charectors again			"

								Addictive colony builder with high level of customizability and a space-western theme. I'm a very picky gamer and this one checks all sorts of good boxes.Customizable start conditions right down to what items you start with and what name your pet has if you want one. On high difficulty its about life on a alien world that hates you and wishes you to attempt to survive only so it can watch you suffer longer.On low diffculty its about a colonist or colonists setting up a new life on a new world and becoming comfortable and affluent.Somewhere in the middle I play and wrestle with the advesities the game throws at me while trying to achieve wealth and eventually get my people back into space.15 hours into a colony and after two consecutive raids and injuries sustained (but survived) from grenades my inventors mind just broke and is now wandering around my common area bleeding minorly and starving to death in a stupor. When i tried to arrest him to force him to eat and be treated he went berzerk and stabbed my ex-spy doctor to death nearly instantly. My pet warg ate the corpse of the fallen spy as the ex spys lover discovered the scene and immediately mentally broke killed the inventor in a berzerk fit before being subdued (beaten unconciouss) by the ex-spy's  lover's pet muffalo(buffalo creature).The whole time my chef was preparing meals and as the muffalo beat the lover feet away. He sat down to eat and ""relax socially.""The whole affair made me laugh uncontrollably at the rediculously unrealistic chef...until i remembered he had the psycopath trait and as rechecked his stats page and re-read that he had the trait ""Is uncapable of: caring""Then it was a bit too real and i said tahts enough rimworld for today.

								Once upon a time, there were two star-crossed lovers - Oxana and Griffiths. They both had the Beautiful trait, and would frequently flirt with each other. Griffiths tried to woo Oxana into a romance. Oxana rejected it. The next day, Oxana made the same offer to Griffiths, and he rejected it. Back and forth they rejected each other so much they developed a hatred that boiled over into a knife fight in the dining hall. As they both lie on their deathbeds with no mobility, they remembered that the only other colonist happened to have an aversion to anything useful - she was incapable doctoring, violence, or even firefighting due to a tragic past. Several hours later, a raid began. The remaining colonist hid in her room as the raiders burned the entire colony to the ground. The hospital was thankfully made of marble and did not catch on fire. Griffiths and Oxana recovered enough to move, barely, but then Oxana tried to woo Griffiths and they hated each other again. The final colonist died in the fire, so the two laid on the ground helplessly as they bled to death.Best rendition of Romeo and Juliet ever known to mankind.			"

								This game is incredible, and although it is pretty pricey, it's worth every penny. I currently have over 150 hours played on this game, and I don't plan on stopping. Its so satisfying building a functioning colony and whatching it grow, and also entertaining when it inevitably gets torn down by some curve ball the game throws that you somehow forgot to plan for. The way I see it, there are two ways to play this game ( or I suppose 3). #1: Get emotionally attached to characters, get into each of their stories, and craft a nice colony, playing without permadeath so that you can go back to saves when something goes wrong. #2: Enable permadeath, play on a hard difficulty, don't get attached to your colonists, watch them come and go without getting very upset, and making every descion based on the good of the colony in the long-run. And I guess #3 would be play on permadeath with emotional attachment, but then your just asking for emotional trama :)But in all seriousness, this is an amazing game, and if you like top down base builders, or just whacky stories( and I mean really weird stories, for a good hour before I bought the game, I read the stories of colonies people built and then wrote in their reviews) Then you should really get this game, trust me, its worth it.

								Allow me to tell you a grand tale, a tale of three colonists that made a thriving colony only to be ruined by malaria. I was proud of this little thriving community I had created, I had put my mainbase in the mountains surrounded by limestone and other non flammable materials and all was well the colony. I had created a thriving economy, with my three main colonists Lord, Engie and Hunter who all were very happy off. I took in about 5 other settlers and all was peaceful with the colony other than the occasional raid or siege which was dealt with brutality.I had eventually harvested 5000 food with several indoor farms inside the base, life was great, medicine to last, animals breeding, a marriage even happened, and also food glorious food. Then disaster struck, Malaria, causing three of my colonists to die, one of them whom had a wife.I built sarcophgas' to honor the dead, but the pain was too much for my settlers and they began to wander aimlessly and die... There was thing I had not tried yet and I had heard the rumors (via google) to open the forboding places... At first all was fine cryo tubes filled with people, I thought SLAVES for the GRAND EMPIRE..... Unfortunately one survived and she was integrated into our society. Luckily though I had another 5 cryo tubes who I managed to save all except 1... Yet that one was the ringleader for all of the Cryotube inhabitants and none of them wanted to stay with the EMPIRE... So I let them go after treating them... But then the widowed wife wander aimlessly depressed at the amount of death at the colony, and my great construction worker soon followed in suit... Not a problem right? Wrong... Just then the pirates who I have defended against on numerous occasions showed up and completely raided my camp and kidnapped my own slave.... Only one person remained... The pacifist, who had been watching in horror as his friends were blown to bits shot to death and kidnapped away. He went mad.... attacking my pet grizzly bears who even after he passed out after blood loss still rescued my pacifist gone mad... As he laid in bed, bleeding he remembered those that passed and their stories... Butler and his wild attempt at taming the muffalo, Engie and her wondrous engineering feats, Lumi and Lorde with their beautiful home and cooking, Hunter the precision shot able to gun down any bandit from a great distance away, Nichloes the scientist who had just finished researching medicine, and finally as he laid on the bed with his final breaths... Tiger the pacifist healer, his doctoring skills saved a numerous of colonists, but not those from malaria...Who will carry the lives of these colonists? As you can see I am but a mere story teller... But one person did manage to survive the raid, a prisoner by the name of dweeb who had became friends with the colonists but would not join them... He will carry on the story, those of the Glitorians that were far from home... Yet built a lasting remembrance..This is Crisis Avenger signing out....			"

								The town started as soon as our spaceship crashed. Three of us, Leeta, my wife, trevor, my uncle, and I were the only survivors. We began to build, I was the miner and builder, Leeta was the gardener and cook, and trevor was the doctor and inventor. Soon, our little home was blessed with a new survivor, I don't remember his name, but I always called him steve the failure. Steve was an assassin that could only shoot. and when he did, he fired all the bullets. Whatever. We made him our hunter, and he went about killing every animal he saw. And he was good. Then winter came. The Crops that were still in the ground died, and the animals turned mean. Then the raiders came, and stole trevor away. We never saw him again, I still have the necklace that belonged to my mother her gamve to me. I blamed steve for our loss, he didn't care, he could never care. He just seemed incapable of it. In the spring, I found out that Leeta was with child. I was the happiest i have ever been. Our love had culminated in a child. Then, one day, while she was in the fields, she was attacked by a pack of manhunting elephants. I held her in my arms as she died. Tears fell down my face as I buried my wife in a ditch that steve had the gall to call a grave. I took my anger our on steve. It was just us now, I couldn't hurt him, I couldn't hurt anyone, not the elephants that came to kill my wife and unborn child, not the raiders that took my uncle, and not the man that I despised. I lost control, my eyes went red, and I attacked steve, until he had beaten me unconscience. He totally destroyed my nose and ears, and I gave him a bruise on his right tibia. Serves him right. That night, as I lay in my bed, I hear the raiders come, their drums pound in the night, I hear the crack of the hunting rifle from steve, but since he fires so fast he just didn't aim. I hear his rifle fire abruptly stop, I hear new sounds of fire. I don't like fire, not since that accident when I was a kid. I'll just lay here for a little while longer. They are in the house, I see them, one punch and i'm on the ground, helpless, they put a sack over my head, hoist me over their raider's leader's shoulder, I just hope that they opened up that wall that I suspect was the house of an ancient danger...

								This game may look simple, but it is much more complex and in depth then any survival game you have ever played. How about a story. Had a couple of previous colonies and decided to start another one, was feeling good. I get to winter and thought my potatos would last.potatos lasted barely half the winter, had to spend every day hunting to survive.Gang of cats decides to make my base its home. Was about 10 cats.I lock cats in a room and they start having babies.There are too many cats to take care of or feed. I know what I have to do. Slaughter half the cats.Think I can last now.Everyone feels bad about cat so one colonist kills everyone and starts eating the corpses. Every colony I make now I shove the cats in the room until they starve or turn against eachother.Lesson: dont slaughter cats, just dont feed them.			"

								Heroin is less addictive. I've barely stopped playing this since I bought it. I'm considering forcing myself to play CSGO to detox from this, because this can't be healthy.No game is this good. They can't be...*EDIT*: 5th of summer, 5502After losing his tail in a fight with a raccoon, Douglas (my cat) has managed to kick his alcohol addiction. However, one of my chickens is now heavily stoned, and I'm not sure how they managed to do that. *Somehow* the little bugger figured out how to use a lighter *without opposable thumbs*.Kyle finally got his bionic leg after he lost one in one of the earlier raids. It was good to see formerly slow Kyle zooming around. Two days later he celebrated his birthday, developed a bad back, and now moves slightly slower than Douglas did at the height of one of his binges.*EDIT*: 11th of fall, 5502Kyle was always a bit annoying, but when Elvira decided she'd be a happier and more fulfilled person being divorced from him, he was sent on a cycle of depression. Growing season was over, meaning everyone would be spending a lot more time around one another, and for the good of the colony it was decided we would dupe Kyle into thinking he was going for a routine medical and then install a joywire in his brain...Now Kyle doesn't even care that I sold two would-be raiders to slavery. To him the sun is shining brightly and colours seem somehow more vivid, even though winter is rapidly approaching and the skies are dark with rain. In some ways I envy him. Sometimes I find myself thinking if selling those two pirates to another pirate could ever be justified, even if they would've happily killed all of us and stolen everything we found any value in. Then I think what a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥Kyle would be now if we hadn't have been able to buy his new joywire, and I feel ok with it.All this just makes Elvira's advances towards me even more awkward.It'll be ok Kyle.

								So I had a pretty sweet colony going, you know lots of food good number of people. Then it happened. My fighter lost his left foot. ""Not bad"" I say to myself, after all I had a prosthetics mod on that let me make feet. So I make the foot and get him prepped for surgery. The doctor fails. Again I tell myself it's fine we'll just try again. So my doctor then cuts his arm off. ""Well crap time to save scum"" I tell myself. Then my surgeon stabs the poor man in his neck.

								Been playing this for a few years now.  The developer makes regular, awesome updates and keeps the playerbase informed along the way.As for the game itself, it's just incredible.  The game experience is incredibly customizable.  If you want a brutal, no holds barred full on fight for survival, you can have it.  If you want to sit back and build a huge colony, you can do that too, and everywhere in between.A lot of city/colony builders will tell you that ""no game is the same twice"", and they often fall flat, Rimworld does not.  There's just so much good here.  Rimworld is like nothing you've ever played.  The game oozes character out of every orifice.  You're going to die, but you're going to have fun doing it.Now go, cut that stubborn prisoner up for lunch and sit down for a nice meal, and get your rifles ready, because there's a horde of really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off squirrels about to come and wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥real soon.

								Rimworld, is a deliciously deep game with non-intensive graphics and great gameplay. You will most likely grow an attatchment to your colonists, and cry manly tears of sorrow at their death. When two colonists marry, its a moment of joy, crashed by some bandits who decided it would be a WONDERFUL time to shoot the place up. As a whole, the game takes a try or two to get the hang of, but once you got it, prepare to have a good time. I would thoroughly reccomend this game to anybody who even was remotely interested in base builders. If you like story, while the game has no official story, your colony's story unfolds, with no narration, just you playing the game. This is one of the best games I have ever stumbled across, and with many updates coming from Tynan, this is a game you cannot miss. 10/10 -Utterly Fantastic, Would use raider induced divorce again.

								So far, I have gone through 334 hrs of game play on 4 of the many biomes (desert, tundra, tropical rainforest, and temperate forest). At an “ALPHA” development stage, I must say that this looks more like a beta than anything else. Off course, the possibilities with this game are endless given that in real life there are many more biomes around the world like the Gobi cold desert in Mongolia. I would like to see them all incorporated into the game in future updates. Also, given that this game is a graphically enhanced version of a dwarf fortress like of game, the developers could be adding content to it for the rest of their life to add value to what they already have. I think I understand why they call it an “ALPHA” stage game, and it may be related to content because it seems to me that it is well balanced. It does not have as much content as Dwarf Fortress (DF) but in time it could get there. Off course, the themes are different (DF is more a fantasy like scenario while RW is more a wild west steampunk environment) but I would like to see in RW as much content as there is in DF. It would be nice to see the implementation of a Z level layer into the game like there is in similar games of the gender. It would be a huge thing.Since it is a randomly generated seeded game the playability is also endless. Try ‘mesa’ for example, it is a good seed. In addition, the emergency situations are randomly generated and there are many but this is an area where the developers could also expand.In conclusion, for an “ALPHA” stage game, your gone get more than you pay for in hours of enjoyment playing it and the possibilities are endless given the amount of mods available, and the amount of content the developers could add in future updates.

								I have had this game from the very early stages of Alpha, and for the $30.00 I purchased this game, in that infancy it has by far surpassed my expectations more than any other game I have every prepurchased; so much so that I just had to write a review when finding out about the steam link because it's a great game that really needs its moment in the spotlight. To begin with it has simple and quite refreshing visuals, although it may be quite comparable to Prison Architect , and the game does play out slightly in the same style, it sure does bring a feeling quite unique to its name. If you love survival and enjoy a sandbox with scalable challenges as well as a diverse and respectable modding community, you need to get this game. Even if you don't have a very powerful rig, this game plays quite well on older models (such as my acer aspire v3). There should be no reason for you not to try this game and hopefully enjoy it as much as I do.			"

It's a user-friendly dwarf-fortress.  The Sims as a space-western suvival game.   With the mods it becomes a lot more.But my favorite part is that it's a story generator.   With relationships, lots of events and all the social interactions, you get a unique story with the characters you control that leaves you excited to tell your friends, ""You'll never guess what happened!""

								At the time of this writing, I've had Rimworld for about three weeks, and I have already put 60 hours of gameplay into it. This game is, quite frankly, amazing; It is one of the few early access titles that I'd ever recommend to someone, simply because it is already a complete, filled game. The gameplay is fun, if a tad micromanagey; You (usually, you can play other scenarios) play three crash landed colonists, and guide them throughout life on a harsh world, trying to keep them from getting killed, or killing eachother, and eventually work your way from that, towards trying to build a ship to get off the planet; All in all, a complete experience.Alongside that, the game's already large lifespan and replayability is easily extended with the massive amounts of mods available for it; there are some mods that completely overhaul parts of the game.The best thing about all of it though is that it's still being worked on, and probably will be for a while.Admittedly, the game has it's share of oddities and frustrating moments; To highlight one of them, botched surgeries can be botched extremely badly when your doctor decides that in order to amputate a leg, they must first remove the patient's head. Yeah. But all in all, the great things about this game far outshine the few negative quirks. So I have to say it, I can't really recommend this game enough; It is most definitely worth every penny. Go get it, now.			"

This is one of, if not the best space/sim/building game I have ever played. This early access game has a lot of content in it that can make you enjoy this game for hours and hours straight without getting bored. Every game is different aswell (Unless you use the same seed and always pick the same spot where you first started), but aside from that, every relationship is different, starting is different (Unless you use the same senario). Every enemy attack is different, there is randomized weather, (It also depends on what kind of biome you're playing in) randomized animals (Differs with each biome). This game is absolutly a blast (No pun intended, you damn power surges!) The developers listen to their community, fans, supporters (Whatever you want to call us) and are constantly putting out patches and new updates![Short Review]     Quit trying to save time, and just buy it already.Pros:+Cool Backround Music+Pets+Relationships+Graphics+This whole gameCons:- Can be challenging for a new player- No tutorial			"

								Honestly, this is one of the few Early Access Games I do not regret buying.I had been burnt by many games in EA, but after reading a lot of positive reviews, I gave this a shot. This game as of writing is my favorite game on Steam. I've always been a sucker for Colony / Base-Building / Simulation games. Planetbase, Banished, Prison Architect are games that I've fallen in love with, but this one I enjoy a lot more at the moment. Speaking of Prison Architect, the art style reminds me a lot of that.You have a lot of freedom (which is expanded even further by the great Steam Workshop Mods) to start your ""story"" however you want. You can customize how many people will start with you, the resources, weapons and materials to make your ""perfect start""The AI Storyteller can be made to be very easy or extremely brutal if you prefer.Once you land, you'll start building your base, creating rooms for your people, researching new technologies, and creating defenses. There are numerous random events that will surprise you for the good or bad.The combat is the most frustrating in my opinion. I may just be bad at it though. Also, the colonist’s attitudes can be difficult to manage at times, but hey, the game is supposed to be challenging.If you want to just free build, there is a Debug mode built into the game with a ""God Mode"" allowing you to freely build and spawn items if that tickles your fancy.Overall, I feel like this is a really strong game that is VERY polished for an EA Game. I will be dumping a lot more hours into this one and it was well worth the purchase!Lessons I picked up along the way:Check the “Work Tab” and make sure your people are assigned to what you want them to do. I was working on my 3rd colony before I realized only 1 person was set to cut down trees or to construct things which really slowed down my progress.I prefer mountainous regions as you can find natural chokepoints for defenses as opposed to flatlands.Sealed structures tend to hold enemies in them (usually the game will warn you too when you get near it). I’ve wiped a few colonies by deconstructing a wall to get into it before we were ready for the “ancient evils” inside.Research Stonecutting ASAP!Tailor new clothing often as your stuff will become tattered. This makes your colony angry.Create a storeroom ""freezer"" as soon as you can support the power. Makes preserving food for the colony so much easier. "

								So this game to anyone that is buying I would recommend it this, good luck. Why do I say this? Well I had learn how to make the ship however I didn't have any uranium. Whats worse is my comm's had stopped working so that created a problem. While waiting for a faction bringing exotic goods I got hit by Randy with his 20-30+ tribal boys. Even though I had 15 colonists only 5 had guns and the rest were brawlers. The end result many dead, many wounded, and the 3 that weren't down were about to die of blood lose. So pretty much anyone that buy's the game and decides to go up against Randy don't be suprised that he makes you restart a 1000 times. But over all its a great game and you learn quickly to love the people that create mods in this community.P.S. for those that will say why didn't I just travel to a different spot I couldn't. What I mean by that is I literlly placed myself on an island in the middle of the ocean. So yay regret doing that now.			"

								I have been with this game through it's early alpha stages and it truly delivers on so many levels.  Don't let the current ""hours played"" fool you because I am just recently playing through Steam.  I am a huge fan of survival games, simulators and management games, this game satisfies all of those.  Been playing for years and I'm still addicted.			"

								My doctor, Azrael, had a fear of animals, and an abhorrence of violence (something messed up happened in his past, maybe his parents were murdered by a ferret or something).Anyway long story short, for some reason a chincilla went mad near our base when Wulf and Kaerie (my Hunter and his wife, the Miner) were off hunting and mining respectively. So the chincilla went for poor Azrael, who basically ran for his life due to swearing off violence. He ended up getting incapacitated by the damn thing, and thankfully Wulf went to rescue him and killed the chincilla in revenge.Azrael lost a toe in the scuffle (it became majorly infected and had to be amputated), and had some minor wounds to his legs and torso, however came out fine in the end. Wulf even made him a nice Chincilla-skin hat from the beasts hide to wear as a memoir. We never did let him live that down. We made him wear it to the great feast we had to celebrate his recovery (which used the meat we got from it too)TL;DRWhat are you doing reading reviews? Go buy it now! You won't regret it!			"

								Really happy to see this game come to Steam at long last! I bought this game a year ago, and it's given me countless hours of fun in the time since, going through several development versions each with its own set of improvements. The game is at its best when it does stuff you didn't expect; A few days after I started my little tribe, a herd of 10 cats joined us. Holy crap, they're eating a lot of food! And they like to hunt-- whoah, what is that panther-- IT'S EATING ONE OF OUR CATS NOOOOSo my valiant tribesfolk (two of which had terrible childhoods and are too traumatized to fight) bring out their sticks and a lucky jade dagger and kill the panther, after it had wolfed down one of our cats. The panther dies, yay! We butcher it and the cook runs off to make dinner. Later, we try to hunt a turtle. The turtle bites the chief in the eye, he can hardly see now and is in moderate pain. This miraculously ends one day when another panther comes to eat one of our cats, and we (once again too late for the poor cat!) take it out-- It bites out the eye entirely, and now our chief is free of pain! Praise the higher powers!The same evening one of our cats kills a rat and eats its legs. We bring in the carcass, butcher it, and make meals out of it. Everyone sleeps with a full belly tonight!If you like games about building homes, farming, taming animals, trying to save your cats from all sorts of predators, battling raiders from hostile factions then capturing them and trying to turn them to your cause if they have useful skills and/or personality, as well as facing the challenges of heatwaves or extreme cold, this is the game for you. It's still in development, but very much playable and enjoyable. Where on the planet you place your colony/tribe will decide a lot of the challenges you face, especially when it comes to weather and growth season. The storyteller you pick has a significant effect on what events occur, and of course you can also set their difficulty level to whatever you wish. If it's your first time in, here's a few tips: Look over your people's skills before you start. It's a good idea to cover all bases, and check their traits to see if anything could cause trouble.In the Architect menu, click on what you want to build. You'll get a list of materials you can build from. Choose wood, unless you have a ton of stone around you. Wood is renewable, stone is not. Use stone later, when you're established. Items with a red X on them can't be picked up by your colonists/tribesfolk. Click on the item(s) and free them up for use. Make sure you equip your people with the basic weapons you start with, according to their skill. Check that no hunters are unarmed.			"

								I was surprised by how addictive this game was. I thought I'd spend a couple hours in it like I have other base builders since in most other base builders it got repetitive quick but with RimWorld there was always something that needed to be done build more rooms, finish the research, or fend off raids. It felt like I was constantly one person short but not in a discouraging way. It just made me want to keep playing until I had everything I had planned done which ended up in me playing until 3 in the morning.			"

								This is how my first run ended. Apparently a nearby supervolcano erupted, causing a volcanic winter, on top of the winter I was already having. Shortly after that started, A wave of toxin spread over the area, poisoining all of my colonists. The raiders kept coming, and after the first one died, all of them started dying. Eventually, my colony's morale gave out completely, as the populace plummeted into insanity, killing what few friends they had left. Eventually, one man was left, and as the colony burned down around him, he slowly starved to death.........And so ended the colony of Jericho.			"

								I started playing this game quite awhile back, it has been steadily been updated and improved. There has also been a great modding community around it as well. Replayability is very high in my opinion, I actually look forward to updates to start a new colony/scenario. (in the past you have been able to continue to play older version games with little issues). Don't let the grahpics deter you if you like colony sims, survival type games. ATM I have little time clocked on steam, but I have played many colonies over the previous alpha versions, not sure on total time, at least 100 hours+. I highly recommend this game. Despite it's alpha state, there have been very few bugs and I have never had the game crash on PC or Mac.(even with outdated mods). I honestly feel the game is worth the price even if it is never updated again. If you think you might like a sci-fi dwarf fortress style game, play it. The game has a great complexity that is easy to approach.			"

								What more can you say when you can cram 5h a day to play a game, while pulling long hours at work for 10 consecutive days (weekend included)?I have only played 19h so far, and even though I'm as tired as I ever was, I'm afraid to start up this game, because I'm fairly sure I will end up playing for another 4-5 straight hours, before finally heading to sleep at 4am. Again.Disclaimer: my pedigree includes everything from ATARI to Spectrum, 386, 486, Pentium, MMX, and so on. While Quake and CoD are fun to play, the games I typically invest more time are games such as XCom (the old school ones: Enemy Unknown and Apocalypse), Europa Universalis Rome,  Sword of the Stars, and even Majesty.I am a sucker for a challange and an awesome AI that doesn't resort to cheats to trample over my dead body.Now how does RimWorld rank?With a steep learning curve, I took 3-4 hours to learn the ropes. Now, I'm learning about defense, research, trading, herding, resource management, beautifying the settlement, joy, and everything else. The list is too big.I have around 5-6 stories, but one that touched me a bit more than the others. I will update this review later, when I'm not so tired. Will probably play this now. Damn.10/10Quick update: managed to only play 3 hours.Finally had an awesome home base with 5 settlers, until the game decided it was getting a bit boring and unilateraly decided Malaria would make things more fun. Skip forward several game days.Now, 2 settlers left, moody and sad, and 1 gone crazy... ""Engi"". First Engi striped naked and walked around, refusing to eat or sleep. Her BFF ""Nine"" had to arrest her so they could finally force feed her.That didn't last very long, considering Engi almost imediately jumped up and went on a rampage, trying to force the prison door open.Engi's best friend Nine shot her on the spot. And yet, Nine rescued Engi immediately, and tried her best to tend to her dear Engi. That's true friendship, I have no doubt. Engi ended up dying of infection, a few days later.Outlook is bleak... But I will come back to ""Rimville"" tomorrow. All odds are this story will end just as all others... a sea of hopelessness, desperation, sorrow and suffering. 11/10.On a final note... Screw herbal medicine, might as well pack it with dirt, rambo style (hint @ game dev).			"

								Im going to break down this review in 2 parts: for people that know what Dwarf Fortress and those that dont.if you know what DF is and you like it, just buy this game. you will definetly enjoy it. maybe you wont think its better or anything but it is worth your time and i personally think that it could surpass DF with enough time and dedication.if you dont know what DF is and never had your Dorfs mauled by a carp before, this game is basically a colony builder where you try to keep your ""pawns"" alive as best you can in a border world. these types of games are usually realy daunting at first but RW in general does a very good job of easing you into the core gameplay loop and has several features (such as being able to control your drafted pawns directly during attacks in a similar fashion to other grid based games) and being able to manually tell someone to do a specific task goes a long way towards making the game more player-friendly. i suggest watching youtube videos of people getting their colonys up and running, dosent matter the version. its real hard to put into words exactly the type of game/gameplay you can expect out of it but just 5 minutes with a video and you will have a fairly clear idea of what to expect.in general its a solid game. several things can and will be improved, either by the devs or modders, but with just what they got now you will have a lot of enjoyment out of this game. i havent experienced any annoying bugs either, some stuff definetly needs to be balanced/worked on and stuff like that but it runs just fine.

								This is my first game review so I'm not exactly sure what to say really. About two years ago I bought this game from ludeon studios because my friend came up to me one day and was like ""Yo I'm going to email you something so get it and play it you're going to love it."" Of course my first thought was something like ""Oh god it's so gonna be a hentai game or something"". When I got home I tried out the game Rimworld and I absolutely loved it. Now for these past two years I have made over 200 worlds lasting for at least 3 weeks each. I have done so much different stuff with it and I'm still not bored of it. Over the years Ludeon has made Rimworld from a pretty cool game into an AMAZING game that just makes me love it more with every update that comes out (They will never have one of those R8 updates [shoutout to csgo players]) I was very happy when Rimworld came to steam because well of course it's where I play ALL of my games so I would want one of my favourite games there as well. I was even happier when I get an email saying ""Hey guess what! Since you bought Rimworld from ludeon you get it for free on steam! Congratz!"". So overall Rimworld is just an amazing game and if you don't at least TRY it then you're a pinecone.-Turtle			"

Everything was smooth sailing...Until they came.The pirates attacked with their savage ways, and captured Brex while Brex was trying to save Trosma.

After playing a few times on base builder difculty i felt ready for more chalange, i was blasted to pieces and the last dificulty with joy and tears on my face, my colony burned to ash by stormtroopers, we defended to the last one with bows and rifles. One survivor went into shock and was leftr for dead by the invaders. After the atack he came back to life only to bury his friends among the ruins of the colony. after the last tomb was dig he went crazy and locked him slef in a room and died of starvation.WARNING: NEVER EVER NEVER EVER name any colonyst after you, your friends or anyone elso you know, they will die, thats a fact or you will end up loading to the limit of exploit.

								I had tamed some timber wolves and they had given birth to an adorable wolf puppy named Patience, one day she got into our colonies beer stores and got super drunk, in fact she drank so much that she got tiny puppy liver cancer.

								If you've played Dwarf Fortress, you've developed a taste for a perpetually doomed populace. You may not, as of yet, have developed a taste for interepreting matrix-text on the fly. If you're willing to abandon digging straight to the center of the planet and instead manage a bunch of mostly-humans who live like elves, this game will scratch that same itch, without making you blind or paranoid about the letter 'c'.

								This game may look simple, but it is much more complex and in depth then any survival game you have ever played. How about a story. Had a couple of previous colonies and decided to start another one, was feeling good. I get to winter and thought my potatos would last.potatos lasted barely half the winter, had to spend every day hunting to survive.Gang of cats decides to make my base its home. Was about 10 cats.I lock cats in a room and they start having babies.There are too many cats to take care of or feed. I know what I have to do. Slaughter half the cats.Think I can last now.Everyone feels bad about cat so one colonist kills everyone and starts eating the corpses. Every colony I make now I shove the cats in the room until they starve or turn against eachother.Lesson: dont slaughter cats, just dont feed them.			"

								I recently discovered RimWorld and I absolutely love it! The graphics do not need to be cutting edge to make an incredible game and this is just further proof of that. I have only put about 10 hours into this game so far but with all the unique scenarios, environments, colonists, and challenges, I believe this is a game you could play for years on end and still enjoy.I'm excited to see where the dev's take this and what will be implemented in the future. Reading RimWorld stories can be equally entertaining and hilarious. In my short time so far playing, I've already experience the swing of emotions that only truly great games can provide. I highly recommend this game, once you get your feet under you (just like every other game) the true fun and possibilities open up. I spent hours reading reviews and stories of RimWorld before purchasing.. and not because I was worried about wasting $30 but because I found myself enjoying the reviews / RimWorld stories that others have shared.You won't be disappointed so give it a try.

This game is awesome if you like basebuilding and survival in a micromanagement setup, where each individual in your colony have certain trades that makes them faster at learning certain things. And then there are the quircks of each one, making each of the crewmembers you make absolutely unique. On a side note, yes it's expensive, but there is so much content for an early access titel, with everything running smoothly (haven't encountered any bugs at all since I bought it). So yes, while it is expensive, it's worth every penny			"

I'm considering forcing myself to play CSGO to detox from this, because this can't be healthy.No game is this good. They can't be...*EDIT*: 5th of summer, 5502After losing his tail in a fight with a raccoon, Douglas (my cat) has managed to kick his alcohol addiction. However, one of my chickens is now heavily stoned, and I'm not sure how they managed to do that. *Somehow* the little bugger figured out how to use a lighter *without opposable thumbs*.Kyle finally got his bionic leg after he lost one in one of the earlier raids. It was good to see formerly slow Kyle zooming around. Two days later he celebrated his birthday, developed a bad back, and now moves slightly slower than Douglas did at the height of one of his binges.*EDIT*: 11th of fall, 5502Kyle was always a bit annoying, but when Elvira decided she'd be a happier and more fulfilled person being divorced from him, he was sent on a cycle of depression. Growing season was over, meaning everyone would be spending a lot more time around one another, and for the good of the colony it was decided we would dupe Kyle into thinking he was going for a routine medical and then install a joywire in his brain...Now Kyle doesn't even care that I sold two would-be raiders to slavery. To him the sun is shining brightly and colours seem somehow more vivid, even though winter is rapidly approaching and the skies are dark with rain. In some ways I envy him. Sometimes I find myself thinking if selling those two pirates to another pirate could ever be justified, even if they would've happily killed all of us and stolen everything we found any value in. Then I think what a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥Kyle would be now if we hadn't have been able to buy his new joywire, and I feel ok with it.All this just makes Elvira's advances towards me even more awkward.It'll be ok Kyle.

								So first off I want to say that buying this game, I had full intent on not liking it. I've tried a couple of games like this (Prison Architect comes to mind) and I just could not get into them at all. Now, saying that, I have been horribly, HORRIBLY addicted to Rimworld since I bought it. It has skyrocketed up on my list of favorite games ever. The $30 buy-in for this is nothing compared to the amount of fun I've had with it so far. Whether you're fighting off raiders, starvation, mad animal packs, diseases, or just mother nature herself, you will find yourself in a world of excitement every minute you play. Yes this game is in alpha, but Tynan loves his community and the feedback he gets and he puts forth a ton of effort into making this game great. He fully supports modding and even encourages modding with fully integrated workshop support. He stays connected on twitter and acts like an actual person instead of a robot. I can honestly say that if I knew how awesome this game, the community, and the developers were before I bought it, i would have zero problems spending upwards of $100 on it. We need more games like this. Definite purchase in my opinion! :)			"

								Have you ever wanted to be mauled by a giant friendly looking sloth, how about having all of your colony die of sleeping sickness? No.......WELL TO BAD. This game is going to instill you with hope and then whisper inappropiate things in your ear and make you cry, and youll just keep coming back to it no matter how sore your♥♥♥♥♥or how defiled your spirit is. But real talk its a colony builder game thats actually difficult (if played on rough or higher) that is both intresting and in depth. With its constant dangers you will always be on your toes. youll be managing resources and trying to keep your people from stabbing eachother or starting random fires whilst fending off raiders and just making sure you dont lose somebody to a stupid thing like a hare bite getting infected. Also if vanilla content gets boring or annoying there is always mods to revamp or help you in game. all in all i give it 8/10 just because sometimes the Ai can be a bit buggy and sometimes the game is straight unfair but its still addictive like heroin.

								This game is so fun it will ruin your life.This game is like Luciferium (Play the game and you'll get the reference.) You play it once, and then you're addicted for life. You can't stop playing. If you do stop playing, you'll become increasingly violent, mentally unstable, and eventually just straight up die. Even in the time I'm writing this review, I want more of the game. I can't stop playing. The only reason I bothered to write this review was because I was playing it, and randomly decided to check my brand new watch I got for Christmas. I thought it would say something like 12:30 A.M., somewhere in that ballpark.It took me a few seconds to process the fact that it said 3:36 A.M.This game is too fun. It needs to be banned before more people fall under it's sickly sweet spell. Don't make the same mistake I did. Warn everybody, Rimworld is a game made by the Devil himself. I want to click the 'Do not reccomend' button, but every fiber of my being is forcing me to click the 'Do reccomend' button. It won't be long before I fully lose control and go back to the game.I want to stop, but at the same time I don't. Rimworld is... calling... beckoning... leave me behind. There's no hope for me. My soul is doomed. Run while you still can...			"

It wasn't.The mechanics are so deep, the developer seems to devote all his time to developing this game and user feedback is practically always taken into consideration. This is a game where the players also decide what it will look like and which features it needs. It's also open for modding which adds tons of potential playtime.Just buy it.			"

								I started a colony of cannibals in the coldest region I could find on the map. There was Corynn, the green-thumbed bartender; Yoshi, the volatile geologist, and Engie, the cold-loving, blood-lusting engineer. In the beginning things were going swimmingly - raiders showed up, died, and became lunch. Escape pods crashed into the landscape, their inhabitants quickly stripped of clothing and left to freeze to death out on the ice before being promptly butchered. Any new additions to the colony who did not approve of its cannibalistic customs were quickly and efficiently euthanized before being dropped off at the kitchen, their skins stitched into parkas to keep the loyalists warm. The colony's mountainside base slowly but surely expanded into a brutally efficient human-harvesting complex. What it lacked in luxury was made up for with stability.Then a woman showed up. Rose. Some nobody slave-girl on the run, desperately pleading for protection from the pirates pursuing her. She had little to offer, but it turned out she was Yoshi's sister. The colony agreed to save her and fight off the pirates - food stocks were looking a bit thin and a few dead pirates could go a long way. She promptly came sprinting through snow and subzero temperatures, wearing nothing but a hat and a smile, her pursuers hot on her tail. The colonists, well experienced in dealing with such threats, swiftly killed two pirates and forced the third to retreat, dragging the corpses back to base to guide them towards their new lives as steak. Rose lay shivering in the medical bay while Corynn tended to her frostbitten nose and fingers.Unknown to Rose, an uncomfortable but necessary debate was taking place. As it turned out, Rose did not share her brother's love for human flesh - in fact, she was disgusted by the very thought of it. Naturally, this attitude perplexed and worried the rest of the colony, who, unable to offer her any alternatives, eventually came to a decision. It was agreed: Rose had to be euthanized. Food was food, and principles were principles. Little did the colony know, this decision would put into motion the chain of events that would culminate in their eventual downfall.Engie volunteered for the task, perhaps slightly too enthusiastically. It was the work of moments to put Rose out of her suffering, and once it was done, she was solemnly, if slightly urgently, carried to the kitchen. Yoshi was hit hard by the loss of his sister, and, stricken with grief, suffered a mental breakdown. Removing his clothes in a daze, he wandered out into the frozen wastes, sobbing and naked. He recovered his faculties just in time to notice the polar bear that ripped off his left arm and both legs and left him bleeding out on the snow. Corynn, armed with nothing but a plasteel knife, ran outside in an attempt to rescue him, but couldn't make it in time, and was forced to watch as his friend became bear food.A band of particularly opportunistic raiders decided this was the perfect time for an immediate attack, and began closing in on the colony's mountain base. Three of them, armed with pistols and rifles, advanced on an overwhelmed Engie while Corynn rushed back to the base in a desperate bid to back up his last remaining comrade. Engie killed the gun-wielder, getting her left foot shot off in the process; however, she was unable to take out the other two before they fell upon Corynn, knives flashing. With Corynn gone, the knifemen turned their attention to Engie, the last remaining survivor. She killed one and incapacitated the other, but not before getting stabbed multiple times.Bleeding from multiple cuts, Engie limped back to base, dragging the incapacitated raider behind her. Being unable to tend to her own wounds, she locked up her new captive, hoping to recruit him to the colony in time to patch her up before her injuries got infected. Fate, however, had other ideas. The colony's battery reserves spontaneously exploded, cutting off power to the heaters and plunging the base into excruciatingly low temperatures. Engie, being a cold lover and wrapped up in a Parka, was mostly unaffected, but her prisoner and last hope succumbed to hypothermia in the night.Finally coming to terms with the certainty of her death, and already feeling the beginnings of infection ravaging her system, Engie did the only thing she could - she weakly carried her dead prisoner to the kitchen, butchered him, and sat down for one last meal in the dark before lying down and drifting into a sleep from which she never woke.If you buy just one game this year, make it this one.

								Here's the story of Kim Hands.Kim came to my colony looking for work and gladly joined us (disregarding the period wherein he was our prisoner.) With relatively impressive stats, I noticed he didn't really do much. This was because he had no right arm nor left hand. In order to remember how useless this made him, I nicked him ""Kim Hands"".Jumpcut some months later, and I've gotten a sizeable defence. This defence got shut down however by a solar flare, and not an hour later a pack of manhunting wargs came for my colonists. They all fought bravely, but when the battle was over, both sides of the struggle lay in shock and each others blood... except Kim Hands.. who stood there surrounded by his dying friends, unable to help.TL;DR always check if people have hands, it's good life advicePS: good game go buy			"

Probably gonna stick with the non-steam version as well, so I doubt my time will go up much. :VAbsolutely fantastic game. It's complex enough to be fun, while still keeping a very solid UI. Not quite Dwarf Fortress in space, but significantly easier to learn how to play. And if you DO want to suffer, you can always go grab some of the fun mods. :VUnlike Dwarf Fortress, you can actually ""win"" on this. I don't suggest it though. Just go have some fun while losing. :V			"

								You choose one of 3 ai storytellers at the beginning of the game. They throw everything they can at you to burn, freeze, slaughter, starve or otherwise wipe you're beloved flegling settlement off the map. Your settlers each have their own skills and foibles which flesh them out and distinguish them. This is fundamentally a game about optimally allocating time and scant resources to meet the unrelenting disasters the game throws at you, but the settler traits and events give the world a touch of life and narrative beyond the bare strategy mechanics. The game is still being developed, but is fun to to play and feels complete in it's current form.			"

								After almost 10 hours in this game its just as addicting as the moment i got it, It starts inocently enough,with 3 colonist,but things can go out of control quickly i was just getting my first harvest done when a heatwave hit. Me being the noob that i was thought if i forget about it, it would go away....i was wrong. It started with heat stroke initial, i did not care and forgot about it, this was my first mistake. my second was the fact that i did not care about cooling so i hoped it would go away. The final nail in the coffin was when my most competent colonist collasped, acting on impulse i sent someone to go get him,the person who went to get him collasped...... soon enough this started a chain reaction in the colony with everyone down, me being ignorant, hoped they would get back up...they never did. That is how my first game went10/10 would die again			"

								Alpha 16 review. Early Access is a dangerous place to buy a game. I've been burned, specifically Towns (which is sad, because I rather enjoyed it). Many devs have the issue of not balancing out features with objectives (in-game, or the content to be able to come up with your own). Rust gets dull quickly, with most time spent leveling up, and Townes had a breaking point that you could reach within a few hours. The developer of Rimworld, however, has done a very good job of balancing out features and things to do in a Early Access Game. Hell, I put in 50 hours of playtime last week. Almost no bugs, and nothing that is gamebreaking. Lots of animals, character traits, backstory, mystery, and events. The ""ancient engine of hate"" line about the psychic drone gave me tingles, and reminded me of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.All in all, one of the only Early Access games that is worth buying in Early Access. The developer could say that this is a completed game, and I would feel it was worth the $30 that I paid. The developer, last I heard, is still working hard at updates!Pretty big mod catalog and support too, but I can't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to actually deal with modding and keeping things up to date. As the game is still actively being updated, you don't have the mod stability you find with Skyrim or Rise of the Reds.All in all, worth the $30 I paid for it.			"

								Well crafted game by developers who know their game design. Have been playing most of the alpha versions before this release and never encountered a major bug. Very customizable game experience thanks to the new custom scenario system; both pure base-building and pure carnage/chaos settings are possible. Game is rather free-form and open-ended so there is not much in the way of late game progression besides launching a costly spaceship. Playing until spaceship launch on medium difficulty will take about 30 hours depending on playstyle; so round about 1 dollar per hour. Last alpha version already had some modpacks, modding community support is good. Looking forward to possible future titles with more simulation systems, multiple z-levels, etc. from the devs.			"

 Don't let the amount of hours I have played fool you. The first thing that I noticed about this game is how well it runs. Yes, it's the not the most demanding game in terms of RAM usage etc; but it looks really nice on the eye. The textures are great to look at.I have always enjoyed games which are unpredicable, making you wonder what is going to happen next. One minute you are being attacked by a rival tribe, the next minute you have a new colonist in your home. Having a new colonist comes with strengths and weaknesses, and their weaknesses can have a massive impact on your colony. You have be sure to keep your colonists happy, as they can fall into a minor or major mental breakdown. This can affect many thing, from gathering crops to mining resources.So far I have enjoyed every minute of this game, and is worth every penny. Get it now!			"

								Fantastic game by a fantastic developer. Really like how it's been fleshed out and so open to modding. I've gotten my money's worth out of this title and would definitely recommend it to others.My only complaint is the lack of z-level resources. I think Ty's ""vision"" for the game doesn't necessarily match up with what some players want. He's more for the game being a progression to a space-ship helping you leave the planet, where what some or most players are looking for is a perpetual colony management game. Resources are finite and once you exhaust them on the area you hold your colony you have to depend upon traders for things like minerals. I haven't really had a game last that long, but it's a frequent complaint I hear about the game.			"

								Only 32 Hours on steam at time of writing, played Rimworld much longer before steam launch.Rimworld is a shining star in the early-access landscape. Unlike most early-access games I have invested in, I have yet to be uncertain about Rimworlds future. With an active and communicative developer, Rimworld is regularly updated with new and quality additions.This game is for everyone, whether you wish to calmly construct a settlement, watch your colonists farm, thrive and advance through technology, propogate relationships and tame and train animals through friendly companionship.Conversely, you can raid a passing caravan, capture all of the survivors, remove all of their limbs, eyes, jaws' and nose' (and much more with mods!), sustain their pitiful existence for as long as you find necessary, then replace everything with bionic fittings and blades to make your very own deadly (albeit traumatised) cyborg army.I can honestly say few games have given me as many crazed laughs and hours of enjoyment as Rimworld has.10/10 would commit horrendous atrocities against humankind again!

								This game, even in early access, is the ultimate evolution of the dwarf fortress mechanic.  It's like the developer played DF, Craft the World, Towns, Gnomoria and Prison Architect, and elevated the genere to a new level.  Intuitive, smooth and  polished, each iteration of the game shows the Ludeon team's skill and dedication to perfection and a positive gameplay experience.There is somehting very authentic-feeling about these procedurally generated characters and I get reallly broken up inside when they get hurt, sick or killed.

								1st game: Half my colony died to ""Plague"" including my doctor's and builders, so when some tribals came and attacked, all the remaining people died of infection or multiple spears in their chest.Game 2: My base was very lit. Very lit. And made of 100% wood. It burned. Then with no base left, a manhunter pack arrived. It didn't end well.Game 3: Pirates land inside my brand new hospital which is unroofed!

								In a nutshell if you bounced off dwarf fortress even with tiles but knew the game lurking underneath was for you RimWorld will scratch that itch and more.first game my colonists where merciessly slaughtered by an vicious man hunting Turkey.second game my malnourished surviors where beaten to death by pirates.third game I mined into a room full of techno goodies, sadly a few of them where shiny killer robots........my six hundred and seventh game.... you get the idea. RimWorld is crack and in active development so far for the better with being Early Access.Rawr!			"

								Over 90 hours in the first week alone. I'm hooked. The ability to create each game with the story you want and the ability to build towns and colonies your own way and as defensible as your tactical ability allows. I still remember how excited I was when my first set of colonists decided to get married. I made a flowery garden for them and everything! Then there's also the sadness when a relationshi[p is unable to endure the rigors of survival and they must go on their separate ways, even to the point of letting themselves die from depression. So far this is my favorite game of 2016 and it's not even out of EA yet! I will update this review to reflect the changes as it moves out of EA access into a full fledged game.			"

								Once upon a time, there were two star-crossed lovers - Oxana and Griffiths. They both had the Beautiful trait, and would frequently flirt with each other. Griffiths tried to woo Oxana into a romance. Oxana rejected it. The next day, Oxana made the same offer to Griffiths, and he rejected it. Back and forth they rejected each other so much they developed a hatred that boiled over into a knife fight in the dining hall. As they both lie on their deathbeds with no mobility, they remembered that the only other colonist happened to have an aversion to anything useful - she was incapable doctoring, violence, or even firefighting due to a tragic past. Several hours later, a raid began. The remaining colonist hid in her room as the raiders burned the entire colony to the ground. The hospital was thankfully made of marble and did not catch on fire. Griffiths and Oxana recovered enough to move, barely, but then Oxana tried to woo Griffiths and they hated each other again. The final colonist died in the fire, so the two laid on the ground helplessly as they bled to death.Best rendition of Romeo and Juliet ever known to mankind.			"

								TL;DR: Buy this game if it remotely interests you, you will not regret it. Except maybe don't buy it if you like your social and/or professional life. Allow me to tell you the tale of my first game:Three colonists awake to the sounds of explosions and alarms, in a panic they manage to make it to the escape pods. Of a ship of hundreds, they are the only ones to make it out alive. Those three were the engaged couple Lowe and Ceti, and a stranger. James was a counselor in his previous life, while Ceti a geologist. They weren't exactly a picture perfect match, but they were deeply in love and planned on getting married on a whole new world to begin their new lives together. Mushinto, the stranger was a hunter and former gang member - he never talked about his past, but the knife scar on his torso and gunshot scar on his arm said enough. Somewhere along the way, Mushinto managed to befriend a Yorkshire Terrier that he named Don and develop serious alcoholism. Upon first setting down, they set up a single large building, in order to escape the elements. After doing that, a couple rooms were added - so that the engaged couple may sleep together in peace, and they wouldn't disturb Mushinto at night. After the living arrangements had been settled, the illustrious group set up a couple farm patches, in order to grow rice and potatoes (Mark Watney would be proud). About one season later, Ceti's sister Glenn arrived! What luck! This is a good time to mention that Mushinto was getting quite close with Ceti - he attempted to romance her a number of times. As far as I can tell, she rejected him every time, so Mushinto turned to what little booze he had with him. Somehow Lowe never noticed, or if he did, he never acted on it. Mushinto and Glenn immediately hit it off on the wrong foot, becoming rivals quite quickly. They were never meant to be as she was a child spy turned machine collector and an ugly one at that, so Mushinto treated her quite awfully. Probably due to his withdrawals at not being able to brew more alcohol. The next season was spent expanding the settlement and doing some basic research. Sometime around late Summer, the settlers realized they did not have any parkas - so they desperately set up a cotton patch. Alas, they would not grow enough cotton before the weather started to change for the worse. Fighting off numerous animal and raider attacks, the settlers somehow managed to survive until Fall when a fifth arrived! The booms and smoke trail gave off the telltale signs of a crashing escape pod. Ceti was immediately dispatched to go rescue the lone survivor, Diver. It turns out that Diver was a former mercenary! Her skills would come in handy many times during raids and wild animal attacks. As the weather changed for the colder during fall, everything was looking good. The colony was expanding to add a few houses for the colonists, so they wouldn't have to live in the wooden main building, there was a massive supply of food (more than enough for three Winters!), and there were enough colonists to do all the work. As the temperatures dropped, a hopeful last crop died overnight in a surprise cold snap right before the onset of Winter. That Winter would be marked by staying indoors and doing as much research as possible - unlocking the next tier of technologies, Mushinto being a jerk to both other women in the colony, Ceti befrending a couple turkeys and a Muffalo, and the colonists surviving in the warmth of their heaters. Now would be a good time to mention that the colony had a hybrid solar/wind/battery electrical system that provided a 24-hour clean and renewable electricity supply with two massive battery backups that could go several days discharging. Alas, this electricity would be the beginning of the end. A freak short circuit on a single strand of wire in the outdoor refridgerator caused a massive fire that immediately burned the entire outdoor supply of potatoes and rice. Mushinto was the first on the scene, trying desperately to stamp out the fire, not realizing that the interior of the outdoor fridge rapidly heated to over 200C. He would die from his wounds in a matter of minutes, with Diver frantically trying to rescue him as Ceti was already dragging a wounded Lowe back to his bed. This left the colonists with only a handful of food, and a dead ally (Diver and Glenn both secretely relieved). Sadly, this would not be the last of the tale of woe. Oh no, what should happen next? A raving pack of exploding rats attacked! Ceti and Glenn set out to kill them, but in their wounded states the rats got to Glenn and wounded her badly. Lowe dragged her inside where he was hiding due to a lack of a weapon and tended to her wounds before grabbing her pistol and going at the exploding buggars. Using a distracting technique, Diver managed to lure a couple rats around the main building where Ceti got a lucky shot and instantly blew up one of the rats. Trapping the other  two in the fire, Ceti and Lowe managed to kill the rest, leaving their corpses out in the open as a grim reminder. Unfortunately, this distraction wounded each of the settlers, and combined with a thick coating of snow, killed off the remaining local wildlife. In a desperate bid to survive a bit longer, the colonists butchered their own turkeys. Rest in Peace, Turkey 1 and Turkey 2, we hardly knew you. Unfortunately, Muffalo 1 was also attacked by a bear a short time later, before she could be milked. On the last day of Winter, we were left with a desperate situation. No food, torrential rains, no wildlife, and a rapidly failing electric grid due to a lack of sun to charge the batery, the colonists were forced to ponder their fate. On the second day of Spring, Ceti snapped and attacked her now husband (married in early Fall) in bed in the middle of the night, Lowe carrying his pistol managed to down her with a gunshot to the arm, and Glenn's knife to Ceti's throat. Miraculously, she survived. Combined with the act of wounding his beloved and a delirious state of malnutrition, Lowe spent a whole day just wandering in the rain and not planting any food. Ceti being wounded, the act of planting was left to Glenn and Diver. Unfortunately they were not enough. On the night of the 4th of Spring, Ceti and Lowe passed away in their sleep of starvation. Glenn would die the next morning, with Diver surviving until the end of the day by desperately feeding off the corpses of her former friends.And that folks, is the story of my first game.10/10 I would absolutely recommend this game if you are into survival and management games like Dwarf Fortress or Banished. This game is quite similar to Banished, but with a futuristic apocalypse setting.Do not let the Early Access fool you, this game is complete enough as is to warrant the $30. I've owned the game for two days and I've put in over 10 hours. It's complete enough for release, but the devs want to add some more stuff. Neat.My only complaint are a few minor issues:* Using right click to drag causes the interface to pup up every time you right click - this shouldn't happen. (it should if you just right click and not drag, but shouldn't when dragging)* The number of rabid animal attacks is quite high for the regular difficulty* If my colonist has a 9/20 gun skill, he shouldn't miss 30 shots in a row against a sleeping beaver. I counted, that actually happened.* Colonists seem to have serious ADHD on the default priorities - maybe tweak the priorities a bit, so colonists will focus on finishing tasks rather than rapidly switching between unrelated tasks. That's a nit-pick, and you can all but avoid it if you set the priorities right.			"

Personal Rating 9/10 RimWorld is an incredibly awesome game of its kind. It's difficult to master which makes it even more interesting to play, because you really want to figure out what you have to do so your people don't kill themselves. If you are into the survival and management genre this is definitely a game for you!In the first game I was like ""ok, just a little bit farming, building houses and that's it"", but after the first few deaths you know that these little idiots can't survive alone. You have to manage their jobs, resarching, food management, animal sheltering, etc... but wait, there is more! Wild animals, which go crazy, invading enemies, diseases, poisonous clouds, too hot, too cold, bad mood, dead pets... there are so many things you have to handle, but this is what makes the game fun to play and you want to go further and further just to see what the future brings. Since this is an alpha there are a few things which have to be improved, but in its current state it is a really good playable game. For example in the german version some things aren't translated yet but that's nothing bothering me. The pathing is something which needs to be improved, because they are using like 10 doors instead of walking around the building which would be faster. And it would be more useful if you could assign a whole sleeping room to a person and not only their bed, because when they sleep others come into their room and want to ""hang out with them"" and then they are in bad mood, because the got disturbed while sleeping. There could be more decorations and stuff to build but since this game has also Steam Workshop this is also a point which isn't bothering me.			"

We are currently researching electricity. 7 Villagers Remaining Cold snap, temperature goes down 40 degrees. All the crops are gone instantly.No problem: we have enough food for a season and we'll plant some crops inside the mountain just in case.The roof breaks in a bedroom, villager goes insane from cold, runs out of base and gets killed by wolves.Cold snap passes, resources are low, temperatures aren't rising much since we're in late fall.We start going on long hunting trips but everything is dead.Almost no more wood for heat, the tree have all been burned for heat/cooking.It's too cold indoors even for crops, they stop growing.Leader kills a man after he rejects her advances.Sister of deceased starts eating our remaining food in her room, she catches a cold and dies. 4 Villagers Remaining Some big furry white animals appear, kill 4 of them and butcher for food, hunter/beasttamer killed by wild boar.Villager leader has an infection and a flu -> dies without so much as an ""atchoo"". 2 Villagers Remaining WellRounded is keeping NoManualLabor villager alive. NoManualLabor goes berserk from having seen all his friends die and starts killing our remaining animals.WellRounded tries to stop NoManualLabor with his fists and gets killed in the process.NoManualLabor gets bitten by the last remaining husky and is left to die in the kitchen. Husky saves him from death 24 hours later by bringing him in bed.Travelling nomads come by to trade. NoManualLabor is incapacitated so no contact, the nomads get bored after a day so they steal our food give it to their bears.NoManualLabor dies from an untreated infection.10/10 Would go through frozen hell again.

								PROSThis game is absolutely brutal \m/Though it's in Early Access, I would almost consider it full-featured already (definitely still some major fixes/additions I'm waiting on)Astoundingly detailed character health/skills/personality/mood - love it. Like The Sims ""needs"" system with Dwarf Fortress injuries and equipment.Weather, seasons, temperatureMods up the butt!Random occurrances such as pirate raids, visitors, heatwaves, rabid animals, and toxic smog keep the game interestingIf you don't take care of them, colonists go berserk and start murdering their own -- just like in the USA!Pets <3 (it's really something special when your colonists run around naked and yell at trees because their cat died)Prisons and prisoner recruiting and organ harvestingMEHThe game world only exists in 2 dimensions. As a result, resources can be much scarcer than in Dwarf Fortress and similar games. Mining only gets you so far, then you need to sell crops, animals, art, or people to trade for things like steel and gold. This would be alright, except you've no idea how long you may need to wait before someone willing to trade comes along with the resources you want.CONSOne wrong click in combat and your dudes will straight murder eachother. A friendly fire toggle with some kind of simple combat AI would be nice. All I want is for the colonist with the shotgun to take a step to the side before splattering friendly melons everywhere! "

								A great devastation wiped out the tribe. The five surviving members of the tribe set out led by Crow, who was raised in a cave as a child and went on to become his tribe's most brilliant hacker despite not having the technology level to build computers. Crow and his four companions found a nice spot in a world that was largely deserts. It was the sole tropical forest.Crow and his friends get to work! They build up some sleeping quarters, a research area (maybe one day Crow, gifted hacker, will be able to figure out how to make a computer, like the prophecy foretold), and then disaster struck. Raiders from the desert wastelands beyond the new tribe's village had attacked! After beating one of them unconscious and stabbing the other two to death with spears and taking their guns, Bear, the tribe's resident medic, stood by while the rest of the tribe very quickly built a prison. Bear brought the fallen man whose name was Gizzard, to the prison.The group decided to try to recruit Gizzard, and meanwhile Crow and two other tribals headed down to start excavating out some of the compacted steel in the hills nearby. However, Crow noticed a wall and it terrified him. It was made out of polished granite. Despite Crow's warnings, Soup, the tribe's primary researcher (who was also a cave child, and a pyromaniac) decided to take down one of the walls.Beyond the wall was a series of four pods. Strange things, they said CRYOSLEEP on them. The tribe went to bed that night, but Crow knew taking down that wall was a bad idea.The next day, the pods were empty and open. What happened? Well, no bother. The tribe needed to forage, and Bear and a one of the other tribeswomen (Lilac, an art-loving psychopath), went off to hunt.Then the sleeping occupants came back with heavy assault rifles and two arctic foxes.Sadly, the last of the tribe of Goreflicker was no more.10/10. Dwarf fortress in spaaaaaaace.			"

								""King of Swamp Castle: When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built in all the same, just to show them.

Yes, it is not the most graphically enhanced game; it shares the same general style as Prison Architect...but it makes up for it in surprising depth of character.  It is simple in concept and complex in action; a resource/structure (colony) management game with a Firefly vibe.You get attached to your colonists.You celebrate their victories.You mourn their losses....I for one forsee wasting a lot of hours on this game.
