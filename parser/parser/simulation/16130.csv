												Restarted game until I got double the first magic fish you can have, bred them, sold them for high prices, got them their own tank, forgot to feed them, and raged. GREAT GAME THOUGH!			"

												This game is free from the developer's website, there is no Steam cloud saving, no cards, and no achievements. There is literally no reason to buy the Steam version, unless you like spending money.If you need a link to the website, here it is. http://www.lastdayofwork.com/fish_tycoon.php "

												The concept for fish tycoon works for the man who is occupied with work and can every so often take a short break to check on things, such as social media and, in this case, virtual fish. This is not a casual experience you sit in front of and make stuff happen, this is a game were everything takes it's sweet time to do...something-anything! It does things on its own, and every so often you need to come back and make sure nothing dies. Although its not the best game, it certainly is entertaining.			"

												What an immersive game! Hour upon hour with what seems to be endless gameplay of pure fun. Whether you going for the big catch(no pun intended), or casually enjoying the company of the incredibly wide variety of fish, you are going to have a brilliant time - a must buy in the 21th century.

												My Rating:""★★★★✰"" Wow this game is actually more fun than I thought it would be. Creating and breeding your own fish types is pretty awesome and rewarding.  There is so much to talk about in this game I don’t know where to start. First off I want to make this clear, it’s a Tycoon game, meaning you have to grow yourself into a huge monopoly by using strategies and methods of your choosing to make as much money as possible. It’s almost like a complex pet simulator which may not be attractive to a lot of people. One cool feature of the game is that it even plays itself while it is not being played at all (and when the game is turned off O_o), you gotta check in on your fish every so often to see how they’re doing.  You can also breed over 400+ different types of fish in this game which is crazy. The game starts out kinda rough and slow, but then it picks up as you start Tycooning in dis ♥♥♥♥♥. If you loved gigapets then you’ll love this game because it is like a gigapet times 6,000!!Replay Value: There is a lot of replay value hereDifficulty: The game starts out pretty hard at first seeing how you have little money to spend "

												I remember playing this when I was 6 or so. This game was my entire childhood. I remember the first game I made, I over fed my fish. This game is the best. Its exactly the way I rememeer it. Im happy I convinced my mom to buy it for me. Very worth it!			"

												It's an old game that I used to play and loved. If you like sim games this is a good one. Just make sure you turn off the time before you leave the game or all your fish will die.			"

												This utterly impossible to solve, unfeasible, array of composite enigmas succedes at absolutely destroying your frontal cortex of your now mindless excuse for a brain. The seemingly endless assorment of few and far between fish has yet to be fully discovered by great minds such as Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein. Not only this, the age defying, eye popping graphics dont for one second make you think this is a normal game. In conclusion, if you are a fan of vast, impossible arrays of unsolvable enigmas, this game is for you.			"

												My initial review might have been too harsh.  What's pertinent is that this game is a relatively simple, ""indie"" simulator set in a fish store.  What's more, it's literally ""real time""; your fish only spawn / grow in actual days / weeks, meaning if you breed off a set of new and interesting hybrids... it'll be days before you can do anything with them.  Some folks appreciate this ""realism"", I guess, but it strikes me as an odd choice when everything else (inter-species breeding, ""magic fish"", etc.)  is completely fictionalized.  In the end, it makes for a game that doesn't have a lot of ""bite"" to it, and requires relatively large amounts of ""real time"" in order to see any kind of progress.  Frankly, I can find better ways to watch the hours tick by.			"

												Great game if you want to just relax and do other stuff while you're playing. Like sometimes I want to draw or read but game at the same time, just minimize the window and you can do just that with this game! Not to mention once you get it down it's pretty easy to start getting the rarer fish and work your way through the teirs. :D			"
