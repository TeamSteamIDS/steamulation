												Let me make one thing clear from the get-go: Smooth Operators is super difficult. It's a call center simulator which has so many balls to juggle, that you'll no doubt need to restart a few times before you finally get the balance right. People answering the calls, computers exploding, walls cracking, contracts to fulfil... and while it's all a bit overwhelming and ridiculous at times, there's something about it that really makes me want to crack on and keep trying. Overcoming Smooth Operators is quite the achievement, and it's sort of refreshing to play a management game that wants to destroy you constantly, rather than hand you a victory on a platter.You can watch my quick playthrough here:

												Cost of Game/Time Spent Playing easily makes this one of the best deals you will find on Steam. I've had a lot of fun experimenting with different layouts and mixes of employees. If you like tower builders or business simulators, it's a fun light hearted game that will keep you challenged the whole way through. How high can you build before the nearly unescapable death spiral brings you crashing back down? Easy to pause and save at pretty much any point in the game, which is great for someone like myself who usually plays turn based strategy games or slower city building games.Computer techs kicking computers until they start working again is quite possibly the best example of IT work I've ever seen in a video game. Watching managers storm around freaking out for no reason will make any call center, retail, or food service worker feel right at home.This is one of those ones you buy that make you angry you spent $60 on some AAA title you got bored of in 20 minutes.

												If you have ever worked in a call center, this game may bring back those horrible memories (especially if you were a supervisor and had to deal with those awful productivity reports LOL), but this is a fun and unique building game in the same vein as SimTower.  You have to make sure you have enough agents to answer the call volumes of the contracts you choose to accept and you must keep those agents happy and productive.PROS+ Fun balancing multiple agent types and IT Support, Housekeeping, and building amenities+ Lots of things to build and upgrade+ Realistic sound effects that make you feel like you're back in the call center+ Cartoony but attractive graphicsCONS- Low income per call means slow pace of building upgrades- Satisfying contracts AND your staff can be tough			"

												At the moment I'm some 5.5 hours into the game. Turns out it's not really a ""simulation"" nor a ""strategy"" game (as implied by the Steam tags) but a ""click-and-wait"" game. Luckily I got it at a decent discount. The premise is promising and could make for a very interesting game. Thus it's a real shame it's almost not a game at all. Your business runs on its own and you just have to keep adding new rooms and people when you have the money -- and usually you don't have the money, so most of your time is spent waiting for money to accumulate. There's also not much to stop the money from accumulating, except for the random message dialogs that randomly pop up and require you to click ""OK"". The game is literally unable to advance a single in-game day without you being present clicking something. Forget about SimCity and the like where you could leave the game to run for an hour and come back. This game runs a minute or two and after that it need you to click a button.Building a new room into your call center costs $3000 or more. At least in the beginning (for the first couple of hours) you won't make more than a few hundred dollars a day, so you wait. And wait. And wait. Occasionally someone quits and you need to replace him or her, and that of course takes away from the small pile of money you had accumulated.Upgrading rooms costs $5000 or more, so your money seems much more well spent just adding rooms than upgrading them. Or at least I think so. The game lacks proper statistics so it's difficult to get an overview of your situation. Sure, you can read the thoughts of all of your employees and you can see a list of your clients (up to a whopping number of two (2) within my first 5.5 hours, or two in-game months), and you can click on all of your rooms and get to know some stats about them. But there's no list of rooms, or heat maps of any kind. There is a list of employees, but it appears that you cannot sort it, and the filter system (for choosing which types of employees you want to see) is really clumsy, requiring multiple clicks on a different screen from the actual list! So while you can get the details of a detail, there's no real big picture available.Talking about your employees, you can hire different kind of people: inbound (IB) agents to receive calls, outbound (OB) agents to make calls, managers, janitors, etc. The different professions are very stereotypical. They might've been true in the 1960s or funny in the 1990s, but seriously, it's 2016 now. When a manager's work description is ""putting fear in the agents"" and you see him running around and shouting at people, I don't even. Similarly, a ""Coach"" turned out to be a cheerleader girl waving pom-poms. Seriously?? You can also educate your employees (just a click of a button and ta-dah, they are instantly smarter!). The education levels are very sketchy too, like a manager learning a class ""Management By Fear"" or another person learning ""Lying 101"".Yet another profession is the Project Manager. They unlock new things for you to do. However, you cannot decide what, so most of the time they unlock the possibility of building an even taller building (10 floors, 15 floors, ..., 50 floors, ...) when your building is still less than 5 floors tall and you'd much rather have, say, some better education levels or some new room types. (Not that it'd matter, you wouldn't have the money to buy those things anyway, until after waiting for quite some time.)All in all this game seems to waste its potential really badly. It's not a game that you play intensively, but a game that you put into the background or on your second screen while facebooking or something, and just check out occasionally to click ""OK"" on that dialog. I believe I'll still give this game a chance for a couple of more hours to see if the money would start pouring in a little faster and if that would make it funnier, but I have my doubts.			"

												Someone once asked, ""Whats the least amount of work I can do for a game and still get paid.""This is the final result.The unlocking system in this game is unproductive. The first people unlocked are entirely based on how many days have passed. You won't get the janitor until after the second day, which leaves the office dirty the entire second day and makes employees unhappy. You won't unlock the Coaches (Employees that make others happy) until happyness because a problem. When you finally unlock the employee that unlocks other items you'll find that even 5 offices full of them have a rediculously slow research speed.This game has a very vague information system. An employee will quit, why? ""My dog is lonely at home"" or ""My sports team wins when I watch them at home."" Very rarely will you find an excuse related to something they might have actually hated, like elevator queue times or Managers dragging down their morale. There is no research time table for unlocking items, you will never know when the next item will be unlocked or if you need more researchers.Starting out in this game is very difficult. You are given a client without any option of choice and the number of calls they want done is realistically not possible. Even with 20k it is very hard to get the number of officies  and employees to take all the calls. If you spend all your money trying to make this happen you will not have enough money to buy the offices or Janitors and IT techs when you really need them. On top of this, you will not get an elevator upgrade for a very long time, this causes an unhappiness black hole and you will see employees quit left and right, causing more financial ruin. Janitors are the most laughable programming when they come to their job too. They will stop cleaning a desk to use the restroom, they then return to their home desk before returning to the desk they were cleaning.If you want to play a game like this, just look up Corporate Inc. a free flash game which Smooth Operators was clearly based on and save yourself $3.

												Great simulation/management game. You take control of and construct a call center while managing employees, workloads, clients and HR issues. Features and upgrades unlock as you progress and expand your business, and the workload can become a bit of a challenge if you're not careful with the layout and transportation of your office, along with your employees moods and scheduling.+ Fun and simplistic - quick and easy learning curve + Soundtrack you can tap your foot and whistle to+ Unlocking achievements grants a cash bonus (which usually hits right when you need it) + Offices can be built up to 40 floors high+ IT staff fixes PCs the way I'd like to ""fix"" mine+ Most dedicated receptionists ever- Menus would benefit from sortable columns when evaluating employees, along with viewable past reports; would be nice to schedule/educate employees by building- Can't zoom out wide enough to see entire building- Adam Demamp, Blake Henderson and Anders Holmvik not includedOverall, this is probably the best deal among the sim/tycoon genre on steam. 8/10			"

												Very addicting. Never thought that running a call center company would be so difficult yet fun!  The pacing of the game starts off fairly slow (if you are playing it right), but picks up very fast once your company grows in size. You have the ability to manage each and every employee you hire, and the amount of employee late game can become overwhelming. But that doesn't stop you from expanding, upgrading, and making more money! The developers of this game has been coming out with updates that improve and add new features that make the game more intuitive and easier to manage. The ""Coach"" employee resigned from my call company due to the following reason: ""No one in this call center wears condoms"" <(0.0)> 10/10 Would hire again!			"

												I saw a youtuber by the name of Sips do a play of this, and as a lover of simulation games, I really wanted to get it and play. Alas, it was on Desura, and as my only payment option  being a visa gift card, it woudn't process transactions outside the U.S. I noticed it was on greenlight and voted on it as to hopefully see it appear in the steam store... I recently found it and bought it, $2.99, cheaper than Desura, and on a nice platform.The only things I have to say about this game is that it is really hard if you don't plan properly and understand the mechanics, yet it is possible to pull back a failing call center and start profiting.I wish you the best of luck, and happy call centering...

												I love this game!Smooth Operators is a call centre sim in which you have the power to construct your own call centre, take on clients, manage staff and ensure that your business is working effectively and efficiently. For those familiar with Sim Tower, this game is not too dissimilar. Like Sim Tower, you have to ensure your elevators are working at their best to ensure your staff move around quickly. You also have to provide service staff to fix all your computer issues and provide general maintenance.This game isn't a cakewalk, however, as balancing your funds and prioritising is paramount. You will not always be able to achieve what you'd like, and there is always something that is requiring of your attention (and money). The pixel art is great and overall looks polished.  I would, however, like to see the speed capability increased, as oftentimes I am just waiting around for the next day.Overall, I think this is a great casual game.			"

												Like, I would assume, most people who bought this game, I picked this up as kind of a joke purchase. I thought it'd be something I maybe fired up for ten minutes and then dropped; something I could mention off-hand to the guys at work who think it's hilarious that I have played more than 50 hours of Euro Truck Simulator. However, it was surprisingly engaging - my first 40 minute session felt like a third of that and I only stopped as I was interrupted, and to my surprise I've since returned to the game.It's a fairly straightforward management game, but so far seems well-balanced, introducing mechanics over time and neither too challenging to feel like good results are attainable, nor so easy that you feel like you're just coasting.The basic mechanic is building up your building to build up your business (a la Unholy Heights), combined with a very rough sort of worker management - you can hire and fire staff, assign rooms full of them to accounts, educate them and essentially add modifiers to their mood/productivity etc. by hiring other staff. There are a variety of roles covered, so balancing the ratios is the part of the game you'll have to think about the most.Full disclosure, you will spend a fair bit of time just waiting - I presume that will be reduced as the game progresses and you start earning more money, but I've reached a slightly uneventful plateau where I just have to wait a couple of days to add a new building, and that's a little tiresome even on the highest speed.I like the art style - it's nothing novel, but it's well executed, and you should be able to see at a glance whether the visuals are for you.The music is a little cheesy, but I guess that's to be expected from a game about a call centre.Overall, I'd recommend this as a cheap purchase (I got it in a bundle), but this price seems pretty fair anyway. Don't buy it expecting an immersive cinematic experience, but for the money, it's pretty good.			"

												Good value.  Not exactly challenging, but there's enough to it to keep it engaging.  Both tracks of the soundtrack aren't obnoxious either, even after 40 hours.There is enough room for improvement left in this game that I would consider getting a sequel or expansion if one were released.  It'd be nice to have some metrics screens to help identify poorly performing employees, to be able to adjust schedules of several employees at once, to be able to see the previous day's performance again after you've closed the screen that comes up at midnight, and some way to more easily tell what hours you are over/under-staffed (especially with L2s!).There seem to be odd algorithm issues that could be improved, such as when you have multiple flowtubes and employees sometimes take unnecessarily long routes or when your elevators are upgraded and people get stuck on them quite awhile because of how the floor stops get queued.  Still, if you're a fan of casual tycoon/sim games, none of these are serious enough to ruin the game.The biggest obstacle I ran into was IT staff quitting frequently because of the poor performance of the elevators (I finally caved and built them their own elevator at the end of the IT wing of the building).

												It looks like an interesting game, and I know some other people enjoy it, however I find it quite frustrating. The idea is to build up your company and increase profits. The problems I find is that:1) every time you earn an achievement, it pauses your game and forces you to click ""ok"" which gets annoying when you are earning achievements every minute or so, and especially when you're in the middle of doing something2) every time you want to build something, you have to go through the menu system again (you cant click what you want to build once, then build 5 of them)3) It gives  you little ""side problems"" such as people stealing from your company, where you have to click on each person to find out if it is them. When you have 20 employees thats easy, but when you have 50 or more then it gets very slow and tedious.Aside from these issues, the game itself could be quite fun. The graphics are poor, but the gameplay itself and level progression appears to be quite enjoyable.			"

												Sim tower office simulator! Simple fun game. I mean simple in the way that the concept is straight forward, there seems to be a lot of depth to the mechanics of it.  Looks a little dated on the looks and controls, but not a serious downside. A few processes, like purchasing new employees, are a bit harder than I feel they should be. In the example hiring a Call Center Rep involves opening the store menu, opening the operations staff menu, selecting the type of rep, and dropping the rep on their workspace. Not terrible, but pretty taxing when you just added 12 desks and need to fill them all. The tutorial feels a little invasive and it seems to play every time. Breaking it down to Pros and Cons.Pros:Easy initial learning curve.Decent depth in mechanics beyond initial learning curve.Cute art stlyleUnique GameLow PriceCons:Dated feel.Tutorial nevers.No true ""Sandbox"" mode.Occasionally frustrating processes.A good value. I'd suggest it if you like tycoon and builder style games.			"

												This game was cute and a good 'click and play' game if you're trying to kill some time.There are a few things that need to be worked on.  Apparently, someone is always randomly stealing from your company.  The only way I can see to find this person is to pause the game, go into each worker, and read their 'thoughts' to see if they stole the money.  When you expand this is tiresome and really isn't worth it at all to the player, just annoying. finding employees and educating them also takes awhile.  I'd like a better way to sort through people and see what they're up to, doing, how effective they are, and educate/fire them accordingly.  One last thing, but it doesn't make or break the game - I don't need to know every time an employee goes on sick leave.  When you have 200 employees its the last thing you care about - or approving their vacationt ime.In the end, I'd play this game if you like simple game managment/sim games.			"

												Highly addictive , well made game extremely hard to stop playing once you start. It takes a few restarts to understand whats the optimal way to get the call center running in a profitable manner. Worth the price would be even better with certain more refinements to the mechanics of the game.Ps:- Here is a simple way to catch thieves in your call center , as soon as you get a pop up from HR saying there is some money missing, slow down the game to pause mode by moving the speed counter to left fully . Now the game is paused so close the prompt and start looking at the thoughts of all employees present there, you will find the thief soon.His thought should be something like this , this way you dont have to look at every record present.http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshot/3318339547224108620 "

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Simulation game.Interface/Menu/SettingsNo options or whatever. (only ingame)Only able to choose if you want to play. Normal or Hard mode.About the game.You start with a small company and it needs to grow like a true business building. You are able to give your company a name that you desire. You have to complete jobs to earn some money. Completing some Challenge (achievements) will give you some extra bonus Cash. Slowly but truly you will expend and become a true hit. But more things will be unlocked and causes for trouble.Destroying a room will only give a little bit of money back.Upgradeable RoomsTutorial ingame.There are not alot of music variety.There is an option to change the volume of the Sound/Music with a slidebarAble to speed up time.There are many Save slots.Other things.Birds are able to enter the office floors?Each day you get a \""tip of the day\"" and able to save your game.Reminds me of \""Sim Tower\""-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Amusing, sure, but deeply flawed as is.- Only one elevator per elevator shaft, which is super lame. I read in a guide that you had to put down one elevator per building segment, which is unrealistic and utterly lame. You get limited real estate after all on the horizontal. You can apparently add more elevator cars, but you have to wait for a project manager to unlock it after days of waiting. The wait kills me.- It makes sense that computers break down, but they seem to do so way too much. This is unbalanced and frustrating.- Workers quit way too often. Is call center turnover this bad in real life? Jesus.- Seems like way too much grinding.- You can't cancel contracts. Why is this bad? When you don't do enough of the tasks per day, you get penalized $100 per Inbound, Outbound, or Backoffice category. It's frustrating when turnover is so high and it's hard to get enough productivity out of your shifting work force. It doesn't help computers break all. the. damn. time!- It costs a down payment to recruit personnel. Coupled with high turnover and your revenue begins to dwindle.- Actor Pathfinding is kind of bad...Regardless, I'll play this some more. It's at least cheap (2.99 USD when I got it), but probably not worth your hard earned cash.And oh: Go play SimTower instead. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTower "

												If you are looking for a simple but challenging business simularor then look no further it's always keeping me on my toes but it never gets too much. The game has a chearful aesthetic with music to go with it. One thing I would say is that some things could be made quicker and easier, I often find hiring large amounts of staff tedious, however this is a minor blip on what is otherwise a quite enjoyable game.

												Let me get this out of the way first: this game has lots of potential.  A great combination between Corperation Inc. And sim tower, This game combines great aspects from both.  How ever, there are quite a few reasons this game isn't a thumbs up.1.Unlocking is slow.What I mean is, by the time I was given the ability to purchase handymen/HR people/Project managers, it was either after the time I realized I needed them(in the case of HR/Project Mnagers) or when the cause that i needed them escalated way out of hand.2.No hot keysIf I wanted to change the shift time of a group of employees, I had to select each worker, open the menu, slide the thing, save it and close it for each worker.  While this isnt as big of a problem concerning one or two blocks, this becomes a tiresome chore when dealing with entire clients.  I would also put hotkeys/mass selection. in for hiring/firing, educating, and upgrading3. No control of unlocksThe project manager researches what ever he wants, taking a couple of in game days.  I would suggest having a more a concrete progress bar instead of ""about 3 days.""  I would also suggest allowing me to select which things im reserching.  I dont need to unlock a 15th floor when my elevators can only carry three people. "

												Addictive little game that had me remembering the good old days of SimTower, but doesn't really advance it any further. The first few days of the game tend to suffer a bit from the railroading forced on you by ""unlocks"", and it took me several attempts before latching on to a somewhat decent plan of progression. There are a few rough edges (can't keyboard-control speed when a message is on the screen, and some of the UI is a bit dodgy) but it's not often I get a new game before lunch and suddenly find out that it's 2AM in the morning when I next look up.

												This game resembles a simplified version of SimTower or Yoot Tower. I liked those earlier games, and I have had a good time with this one so far. I think it might get old eventually, but it is soothing to play. I like to have it run on my 2nd monitor while I'm typing. It doesn't take a lot of thought, but there is some strategy in planning how you'll expand your call center. I've played 7 hours so far, and I think I'll get my money's worth. It is pretty simple, so if you're expecting a thoughtful business simulation (which I would play the heck out of!), you'll be disappointed. For some people, though, even this will seem like a spreadsheet as a game. For those of us who like those sorts of games, it's a fun addition.			"

												While the gameplay itself is not bad at all, everything else is seriously lacking. - The settings menu only has two sliders for sound. The resolution is wrong and cannot be adjusted. Controls are also non-configurable.- In a tycoon game, I expect to be given sufficient information to handle my business. If, in order to do anything meaningful and keep track of even the most basic aspects, I have to keep a pen and notebook at hand and write everything down, from employee vacations to schedules, the game is doing something seriously wrong. You are provided with almost no useful information that can be easily accessed. Looking up what you CAN look up means clicking on each individual employee. This can become seriously annoying after you get more than a few workers.- Want to change the schedule of 30 employees at once? Find the employee, click on him, click Schedule, click Change Schedule, drag the slider to approximately the right place (why a slider!?), click Confirm, close employee menu. Now repeat 29 times.- Want to make your employees to come to work at 2 PM? No can do, your closest options are 1:57 PM or 2:02 PM. How does this make any sense at all?- Somehow, the janitors in this game are the laziest human beings on earth. Why the hell does it take two and a half hours to clean a single desk? I should not have to hire an entire army of janitors if I only have a few rooms. This is, by far, not the only thing in this game that makes no sense.This game CAN be fun, if you are willing to put up with a ton of small, but important annoyances. At least it's cheap, so you won't lose much if you don't like it.			"

												ORIGINAL--I really, really, REALLY hate to downvote games. But this one the gameplay is GREAT, the graphics are very nice, and the controlls and interface is pretty easy to understand, but one issue I have trumps everything else, the game doesn't save. Now, I'm not seeing many other people with this with problem, but after a big update, nothing would save, which sucks. I was really loving the game. But this could just be a bug on my client end and may be working just fine for everyone else, if this is so, you only have $3 to lose, but definitly give it a try incase it really does work. Like a said, I would give this game a 10/10 for gameplay, but the saving issue trumps that in my opinion. I hope this is just an issue for me.----------------------------------------------------------------I really love this game, as you probably read above. I was having some issues, but re-installing seemed to fix the problem. Definately worth the money if you enjoy this job area, if you don't find call centers very interesting, it may not be the game for you. 10/10			"

												Honestly, it wasn't what I expected, I thought more customization and more micromanagement would be needed. But it's not bad either. It has cool 8bit graphics. It can be funny watching your workers bang on their tables and their bosses yelling at them. Or you can laugh at the ridiculous reasons your workers give for not coming to work today.Basically you are running a call center and you continously expand and upgrade it. You get a new workload everyday and try to deal with it. You pay your workers and increase your capital which you use to improve your building and the life standards of your workers. Are you going to be the evil boss who pools money only to himself? Or are you going to be an angel and give your workers vacations and raises? Or are you going to use that money to solve the elevator problems which anger everybody a lot. Are you going to add a new toilet and a canteen to your new floor? Or are you going to use that floor for even more workers? It's up to you.Dialogues and character designs are funny. The mechanics and formula are well implemented. You have to think, calculate, invest. But for some reason I got bored quick. Also the game was harder than I expected. So I wouldn't say it's a game for everyone. But it's cheap and fun while you're trying to learn it. It's successful and beautifully made. I recommend it.Buy it if you want to run a call center.			"

												Is this game in Early Access? It feels like it.Smooth Operator has Charm, it's unique, insofar as I've never played a call center simulator before. Is that enough? Maybe for a few hours.After a few hours it becomes apparent that the challenge is keeping people happy. And keeping people happy is largely based on your transport, elevators and the like. So while you are using elevators people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from slow elevators, when you upgrade to tubes nobody gets mad and the game becomes too easy. So since the primary challenge of the game is managing people and their routes, it's sad that there are no controls to help route people, they pick their own paths and their pathfinding is atrotious. They will line up outside an outdated elevator even when there are shorter and quicker paths. I'm not actually sure how they pick their paths, but sometimes it's just awful. Their tasking is also terrible. An IT worker will fix broken computers, but sometimes he walks all the way across the building to fix his next one while there is a broken one right next to him. So it ends up with a lot of wasted time. I wish there were ways to give them an area that they work rather than let them run all over. I kinda regret putting 17 hours into the game.But for 3 dollars it's not bad for an hour or two.			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle with other games, although this game was one of the reasons I bought the bundle. The building of units reminds me of Sim Tower. The game itself is very hard and even more difficult if playing with an erection. Its probably one of those games which could get boring if it was too easy, but the difficulty is also slightly decreasing my enjoyment and I am wondering if the game might be impossible as at just 4 levels of tower block the elevator gets jammed, without enough funds to build a new one and the R&D guys just want to keep allowing more floors rather than a much needed elevator upgrade, and building stairs is not an option (which could also be a fire risk). I was also hoping more people would use the Relax Room before quitting, but it seems very few people use it and the game gets to the stage where you are either contantly giving vacations or people are quitting. I'm also wondering if there is an optimum ""only one way"" of beating this game when it comes to placing rooms. Its a challenge and Ive already found myself starting a new game several times, trying things in different ways in order to try and crack it. For a few quid it is worth it, and had I had known about this before seeing it in a bundle, I would have bought it for a few quid as it is worth it.			"

For someone that loved simtower / mad tv this is hitting all the right buttons with me honestly I think its a fantastic game at $15 but for $3 (thats what it was at the time of writing) I cant think of any reason that you should not be able to get your money out of this game.

												Smooth Operators is a ton of fun for its price.In Smooth Operators you manage and expand a call center company. You get clients who offer different contracts that you have to fullfill in order to make money. There's a lot of things to manage, eg. cleaning of your offices, overcrowded restrooms, too busy elevators, working hours, salaries, maintenance, IT support, vacations and most importantly you have to makse sure your employees are happy. Just having to wait for an elevator too long can upset your staff and cripple the business.This isn't an easy game. You'll probably end up restarting the game for a few times before you get a hang of things. Just like any good management game, there's never enough money (well, maybe once your office building is 30 floors high and you have money flowing in from a dozens contracts) and things can get a bit chaotic.With its relatively simple but solid concept and mechanics Smooth Operators can be a really addictive game.

												As a former call center employee I bought this on sale out of morbid curiosity, and I can confirm that the game is a spot-on chaotic simulation, but this becomes more difficult to manage than it needs be with its very basic UI controls.  With better controls for improved management, I might be able to better wait out the time needed to accrue money for improvements or offices due to the profit margin in-game being so slim.  I've been able to do this with so many other games, but not this one.  Due to the lack of variety in rooms or perhaps general gameplay compared to other tower-based games, the game has caused my curiosity to eventually die from bordeom, and move on to an afterlife of better simulation games.I would only recommend buying this on sale if you are hardcore into sim games and have lots of patience, OR have a very strong interest in call centers.  One thing just as redeeming to me as the quality of the game is the selling price of its Steam cards, which currently go for double of what more common cards sell for.			"

Smooth Operators is a business simulation game wherein the player takes on the role of a CEO of a contract-based call center.  Story N/A   Aesthetics The graphics consist of pixelated sprites on pixelated backgrounds. The art is aesthetically pleasing and contains a good bit of detail. Trash will build up throughout the day, cracks will appear as the buildings deteriorate, and the objects in rooms change when rooms are upgraded. The graphics are also clear and easy to understand with each room and employee color-coded and easy to distinguish.   Gameplay The gameplay consists of building new rooms and facilities for your employees, managing the hiring and firing of your employees, assigning job tasks, researching new upgrades, and acquiring new contracts for your company. The room building is done on a grid system and the game encourages you to build up (as in Sim Tower, for easy comparison). One aspect of the game that was rather grating for me is that there is no way to mass select your employees. Moving an employee to a different desk is a chore. For someone like me that likes things to be organized, shifting my workforce around to ensure that like employees were in the appropriate room involves selecting the first employee, issuing a move command, selecting a separate empty desk, selecting the second employee, issuing another move command, moving them to the correct vacant desk, and then doing the same to get the first employee to the appropriate desk. Also, at the end of each day, you are presented a summary report of the day's activity that will kick you out of any menu you have open at midnight each day.   Sound The sound design is very minimal in the game. You have a few looped chiptune-esque songs in the background that is mostly covered by the sounds of phones ringing, elevators going up and down floors, and your IT staff ""repairing"" computers.   Closing Thoughts This game is competently made and performs its functions without hiccup, however, the game is just not fun, in my opinion. The tech tree is incredibly shallow and the game offers no greater strategic depth other than finding out an optimal room structure and then hiring enough workers to cover the amount of work your have to do for your contracts. I found myself playing the game with the speed slider turned all the way up and the game still felt like a slog. The problem is that the progression in the game is too slow. Perhaps this is to compensate for the lack of depth, but I spent more time waiting for money to roll in so I could build a new room (which I couldn't actually afford employees for then) than I did actually doing any meaningful tasks in the game. Business simulations like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, etc. have better pacing so that you're never sitting around for days in game waiting for enough funds to come in. Maybe this is a symptom of the game being ported/targeted for mobile platforms. Either way, the game just doesn't have enough meat, enough of that ""wow"" factor to recommend.

												GAME REVIEW BROUGHT TO YOU BY ANGUS, THANKS ANGUS!TL;DRYou like micromanaging a company of call center that could collapse at any time due to your own incompetence? Enjoy it you ♥♥♥♥s. Otherwised save your money for weaboo ♥♥♥♥♥.LOOOOOOOOOOOONG Version.First things first before we begin another session of '♥♥♥♥ me i'm bored so lets write a review please go to the following website and play the following ♥♥♥♥ing game for at least 2 hours. Dont worry its addicting and you will somehow spend more than the requested time with the stupid game. Dont worry, the review can wait.http://armorgames.com/play/7348/corporation-incDone? No? Go back you ♥♥♥♥ing idiot......Done for real? Good, lets get on with the ♥♥♥♥ing show.1.What the ♥♥♥♥ is [Insert game title here]Essentially its just a more improved version of that game i just forcefully shoved down your throat where the objective is to manage a call center [or a muffin button pushing company in that link i gave you.] and prevent the collapse by a number of highly subjective factors also note i use the word improved very loosely. On with the show please! *clap clap*2.Graphicscompare to the that link call center chaos has an extremely terrible looking graphics, actually its on par but its my opinion and i hate it but sure doesnt help that game is fun. Its 2D pixelated♥♥♥♥♥♥♥representing the everyday mundane object of an office enviroment but its a ♥♥♥♥ing lie because my old office dont have water cooler nor cute furry cats! It looks, feels and taste retro style but ♥♥♥♥ it i hate it.3.SoundsPeople with sound sensitivity beware, its annoying. Seriously, it buzzes all day long and most of the sounds kept on repeating due to how often your staff push their big fat finger onto the keyboard and invoking the *taptaptaptaptaptap* noise so prevalent in this game but ♥♥♥♥ it you need money. It sounds appropriate enough like a real office which is to say its ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. 10/10 SOTY. [SOUND OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING YEAR]4.GameplayAnd here is where the game crash the most. Its good fun, addicting managing your little company to eventual stardom where you can build ♥♥♥♥ing  TELEPORTER  because the ♥♥♥♥ing lifts are not fast enough. You can micro manage the daily scedule of your minions and even build floors upon floors of bland offices and nasty smelling bathroom that only accomodate 4 people at a time unless people goes back HOME to♥♥♥♥♥♥which is ridiculous because i would have gotten fired for it. Speaking of which the micro section is the game's downfall for me, sure its fun setting schedule and giving them holidays but if only there was a damn option to disable em because i want my employee to just ♥♥♥♥ing be a MINION not human beings with feely feely feelings and needs and desires. ♥♥♥♥ that. Also for some strange reason essential items are locked behind the research section! The hell.CONCLUSIONFOR those who enjoyed that damn link........... oh who am i kidding?! its Armorgames.com you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥s and yeah if you enjoy it then feel free to pick this gem of management chaos up.

As you build your ultimate call center you will rapidly wonder why the hell there isn't any possibility to apply day work schedule in bulk which seems obvious or apply salary policies also in bulk. The micro management brings nothing to the game but waste of time.You will notice then how unfnished this game was with the impossibility to cancel the customer contracts that you would nevener had signed. Finally the irrelvance of the few concepts of the game such as lifts rapidly overcrowded and making your employees so unhappy. The developpers built into artificial element to create the difficulty.

												I really dont like this game. I find it the most boring game on my steam libery... which i will admit only has like 15 games but i just find it boring. dont get me wrong im not the adverage COD player who cant play a game where you cant kill people and have to go to school the next day\ never left the massive rear-end imprint on their mothers Sofa  (If you cannot tell i despise New COD), i like a good game where you build and manage like prison architect, nor am i a guy who hates a good meaty challenge , i love games like binding of isaac rebirth and FTL, but this game just bores me with just everything. The ""meaty challenge"" is just trying to manage everything, i mean ive only met requirements ONCE in the 4 hours of playing and the amount of times i tried to repair a comuter and i havent had the money is Staggering! like 12 times! And dont get me started on trying to keep your guys early game! They'll be dropping out like a romantic parter after you explain how much time yo've spent ond World Of Warcraft, taking a barrel full of money with them.overall: the difficulty is just not like other games like theras mentioned, prison architect where the challenge is having your staff not die because Jimmy ""likes to stab people"" Jones got into your kitchen.

												A fun enough game to keep me playing for a few hours, which considering the low-low price made it worth it, but nonetheless there were a couple of problems that kept me from enjoying the experience as much as I could've. I'll leave these notes just in case the developers want to patch this or perhaps make a sequel.1. Lack of micro controls. I constantly found myself in a situation where I wanted to change ALL my Outbound agents or all my Back Office agents to a different client, and then had to go around changing that setting for *each and every office*, which as you can imagine got very boring very fast. This game would seriously benefit from the ability to set control groups of office blocks so you can change settings for whole groups of office blocks en masse.2. The menu sidebar. As a result of the constant client-switching mentioned above, another thing that often annoyed me was the inaccessibility of the performance report (the one that tells you how many jobs have been done and how many are left for each client). One would think that such an important menu would be included on the sidebar (which includes the HR menu, one that I hardly ever have to look at), but it wasn't: instead I'd have to go into the pause menu to find it. Not a huge problem admittedly, but it would nonetheless be very convenient to have the option of choosing which menus you want in your sidebar for quick and easy reference.3. Game balance. This point should be taken with a grain of salt since I'll admit I didn't play the game more than a couple of times, but it really seemed to me as though the only way to make a profit was to focus solely on the Outbound and Back Office work and just take the hit on the Inbound penalty. With the small profits you make at the beginning you simply don't have enough money to spend on the huge amount of Inbound agents that you need to fulfil a contract, especially factoring in other costs like the employee benefit blocks (the restroom, restaurant etc.), service blocks and agents, and of course the elevator. You can play it safe and save up but that takes a lot of time not doing anything which simply isn't fun, not to mention if you don't hire Account Managers the number of jobs you get will start to go *down*, which means less money - on the other hand, every day you have an Account Manager hired is another day closer to having another client contract forced on you, so you get stuck in the double-bind of not getting enough money but also not being able to fulfil your contracts, thus incurring penalties which makes it even harder to make a profit. Either the game should give you fewer Inbound jobs or make a few costs cheaper to subsidise the building and staffing of Inbound offices.4. Priority System for Coaches. I noticed that moods were getting low in my offices so I invested in some Coaches. However, the Coaches didn't seem to have much of an effect because they randomly targeted people - a lot of the time they would go and cheer up someone whose mood was already high, which is simply a waste of time, effort and money. As a result, those with low moods ended up quitting (rather unreasonably I thought, especially after I'd bought all the employee benefit blocks for them), forcing me to hire new staff. On a particularly bad day the new hires not only wiped out my profits but also bit into my savings, making it even more difficult for me to expand. Surely Coaches should prioritise workers with low moods to stop this from happening?			"

												Its quite similar to Simtower, a bit of a game that you mostly watch, but with less meat to it. The only major gripes i have is that it has a bit more boring micro managing than i like, having to upgrade each employee/room by hand after getting them with no option to buy them at the upper levels that have been unlocked. Doing so for 36 people and 9 rooms gets a bit tiring. Also, the difficulty of manuvering around the building without a minimap of some kind to get around quicker. Even the ability to save camera positions would be nice. Other than that its a decent game. Thou without more to do, once i finish my 100 days on my current game, i dont see myself returning for another playthrough anytime soon. Not bad for the price, cheaper than a movie ticket, and a few more hours of entertainment than one.			"

												Surprisingly quite addicting. as far as realism its pretty much correct as to how a real call center works, just a feww tweaks to make it a more fair game, plus there isnt too much penelty for keeping or firing workers. despite this its a very thin line of buisness where u tend to struggle to keep yourself from going bankrupt more so than getting rich, which gets points from me. If you can make dull buisness like this not only fun BUT ADDICTIVE! you get an A+  from me! ^-^			"

												Overally, this is a good game (for simulation fans). The BadGenerally, it's facing a lot of problems, which make it shallow and unrewarding:Stupid AI (being the way you handle your clients/contracts)Unintuitive UI (ancient UI, making the most simple tasks a pita)""Broken"" content (almost 50% of the mechanics/employees/abilities are utterly useless)Unbalanced gameplay (balance is achieved through trial & error solely, logic is almost extinct)Unintuitive UI (to stress this a bit more, anything you want to do other than watch the screen, is extremely time consuming in the most unproductive way)The GoodAlthough I wouldn't think of many ""good"" things to say about the game, being a sim fan I did have my few hours of fan, mostly because of: The nice concept (I'm an entrepreneur, so it's always interesting to run a virtual business)The cute/silly pixel graphics/animations Building 40-story headquartersHow easy it was to get a 100%ConclusionIf you're not a hardcore sim fan, there's not much to like in this game. If you are, maybe add it on your wishlist and grab it when it sells for like 20 cents. I'm posting the review as positive regardless of the ""bad"" feedback, simply because it's a well-hearted, and quick, ""fun"" game, that's priced as it should be. I'm also guessing we won't be seeing any future updates, and all the broken/useless mechanics will stay the same, making Smooth Operators a silly/mindless sim game.			"

												I work at a call center and the concept of the game sounded interesting, I was wondering how it would play out. Unfortuantely, the game isn't very enjoyable though. Too many buildings and staff are locked at the beginning of the game, and you kinda need them beforehand. Also it took me 9 in-game days just to be able to get HR staff, 9! You cant change schedules of your employees or anything until day 9, then you have to have the money to build the building, then hire the staff, etc. The game is a grind in a bad way, but perhaps that's intentional, perhaps it is meant to be a statement on how call centers are, and I guess mission accomplished if that was the goal. Still, I would have wanted something with more humor, satire, and freedom in the gameplay. Also the sound effects get REALLY annoying since they can stagger, I guess again it is probably intentional, but it makes for a better statement of the call center world than it does an enjoyable simulation game.

												The game is fine as a simple time-waster, but it has to many 'large' bugs, un-intuitive design features and lack of explainations of mechanics to be recommended, even with it's cheap price tag. The tutorial misses a LOT, and you quickly find yourself wondering what to do next, what to focus on, and how the mechanics of the game work. Many problems are found in the first 30 minutes of playing (e.g. ""hire X person to enable upgrade feature"". Hire that person, game still says ""hire this person to enable this feature""). Controls are frustrating (Can't easily move people between desks, have to do 1 at a time, which becomes increasingly lengthy when your offices are jam packed. This includes other micro-managing such as schedules, very cumbersome and frustrating design), the reports are semi-pointless and unhelpful, many offer no useful information and they also don't link to in-game objects (can see a report of employee happiness, but cant click to view employee, you must remember their name and scourer through your offices trying to find them). This game lacks a lot, and while it could be an excellent sim with a great and fun concept, it is poorly designed and bites off more than it can chew. Spend your money elsewhere, there are many other office sims which perform far better.			"

The interface, which is barely adequate for a small operation, becomes a massive chore when it comes to managing your growing 'empire'.Apart from changes in quotas, the occassional research upgrade and managing staff rotation, there's really not much to keep you entertained while making sure things tick over as smoothly as you're able.

												I think I grow my company too fast, I went broke every time :PNot a bad game, I would probably play this more on a mobile device, but the game is decent.Not really my main style, but I found myself playing it even after the cards dropped, so I might play it as a burn game, just something to do when I don't have time for something more serious.Get it on sale if you like these kinds of burn titles.

												I wanted this game for a long time, because it reminds me a corporation game which I used to play on Kongregate or so, where the concept was very same, probably even better, just the problem with it was that it used to lag when you had a big company later on and in general it was a flash game... So I finally got this game on steam, because it is almost accurate rip-off of that game I used to play and after playing some time I can say that the game is same fun as long as you don't get bored from waiting untill the day will finish.. Even on the biggest speed the day takes just too long, which is really annoying. The other thing which sucks is that when you scroll the view with mouse and or buttons, the screen scroll speed is really slow and if you have a really big corporation then again - it gets annoying and that's about it.. I didn't really saw bugs or glitches, it is really simple game otherwise, I would say 2€ is a roof for its pricing.  If you wIll not concider those two things as a major problem and you are into strategy/simulation games, then you should be okay with it to try, of course if you will grab it for less than 3 euros. It's a fun game, I just wish developer can at least give us an option menu for settings like scroll speed and would increase speed of day running.			"

												A very cute, stylish, bite sized game that unfortunately gets extremely repetitive after a while. It gets even more annoying when you have to micro manage each and every staff using a very poorly designed UI. Staff quit for no reason (even after you have spent time training them), your clients will have very unrealistic expectations (daily targets) and penalise you daily for not fulfilling it. Overall a good time waster but lacks depth and becomes extremely repetitive after about 5 hours in. Skip it and save your money.			"

												Quite a fun management sim, but hindered by unweildy controls and prompts that reset your place in menu drill-downs. A little too much trial and error as well, though perhaps that's the point.			"

												If you liked Sim tower it's a good time sink for the price. Less complicated than simtower but still fun.			"

												This game is awesome!It might look simple at first, but the game has a lot of economic feats to consider. You will start over more than once as you slowly get an idea of the various consequences of your management descisions. Starting from ""How do I 'design' my building?"" to ""What personnel do I hire when and can I ever have enough janitors?"". ""Why is the back office department so unhappy?"" ""Why do I have so many sick employees?"" ""Why are my customers flooding me with low paying back office work?"" ""Is the whole world against me?""  ... these are only some questions that will come up.Playing ""Big Brother"" has never been more entertaining! Check it out - it's worth it!			"

												How they managed to mess up something as simple as elevator logic and prioritisation, I do not know. But I eventually got fed up with watching empty elevators zipping past people waiting for them. And queues load from the BACK for some reason, so you've got whoever is at the head of the queue getting more and more stressed out while those who just got into the queue get into the next elevator. Lots of similiar minor details, but very annoying. I'm going back to SimTower.			"

												Really got my money's worth and definitely beyond that. It's a very fun game, I dunno why but I became desperate of it, probably because pixel art and managing games are just my thing. Or maybe because I'm currently at the 8th floor and wanting to go up to 40? Hmmm...Anyway, definitely buy this. I found out about it thanks to a Discount Coupon which allowed me to buy it at about 16 cents.Very nice game, congrats devs and keep supporting it, it's my thing.			"

												Had a need for something small and wanted to see their take on the Tower Management genre. This game can keep you entertained for a while and can also run out of challenge fairly quickly. For the price I would not recommend it.If there were updates still coming or at least something that broke the “late game” into something worthwhile or gave us some kind of progression it would make this a lot more of a recommendation. As is I don’t feel there is an end or third act to the Simulation or Tower Management.			"
