												The best zoo-tycoon game in my opinion. The WP series features heavily on realism, unlike the Zoo Tycoon series, although that series is good too. Animals look realistic, as are their AI behavior. It takes a while for babies to be born, unlike ZT where it apparently happens instantly. Food don't magically appear out of thin air to feed your animals. like in ZT. You need to place the proper facilities to make the food.WP 2 also focuses more on those rare/unknown animals, unlike ZT where they feature mostly well known/popular animals. I like this idea, because it lets people who play this game learn about animals they've never seen/or read about before. For example, there's the frilled sharks from the marine expansion. I doubt many people who aren't shark fans would know what they are. The map isn't really set up like a grid (ZT again). You simply 'paint' the paths along the ground for your customers to walk on, which makes your zoo look more realistic if you're using stone or dirt paths for instance. One thing I do like in ZT over WP2 though is setting up your habitats for marine animals. It's very easy to do in ZT but I find it frustrating to do the same in WP2.Both zoo series are good, but if you want more realism in a zoo game, then WP2 is the way to go. With 150+ animals, realistic AI, along with loads of plants and attractions, etc, however, you should buy it anyway.			"

												Excellent game but a little buggy in places. I got the game on a sale with all the expansions, which gives cracking value and a really vast amount of content for the money.The very real question is whether or not this game is better than Zoo Tycoon, which is a tough one to answer.Zoo Tycoon 2 is without question more polished, less buggy and very enjoyable to play.However, Wildlife Park has masses of content, is cheaper, has more flexibility and an engaging realism. In short, they are two quite different games so compliment each other quite well. I would definitely recommend getting the expansion packs for this as they are quite spectacular. On the whole I'd strongly recommend this and with some bug fixes it would probably beat Zoo Tycoon 2.			"

												As a big fan of the Zoo Tycoon series, I wanted to check out more zoo sims and found this one to be fairly comparable. It has a very nice selection of animals, buildings, plants, and decorations, and the world building tools are actually a little more robust than the Tycoon series' in certain areas. I feel like the art direction of this game is also very good, tending to run a little more realistic than Tycoon's, which I personally enjoy. The animals themselves have nice enough personality and animation to them, and there's a wide variety.That said, it does have some negative points. The buildings you need to care for your animals are large and a bit obtuse, and you need a lot of them. The whole 'plants have needs' thing is a neat idea, but in practice is nothing but irritating. The AI can be pretty wonky at times, with guests wandering off and getting lost or animals starving to death while staring at a trough overflowing with food. Luckily, these things are managable so long as you're paying attention, it's just more annoying than game-breaking.That said, I think that if you're really into zoo sims, this is definitely up to par with its main competitors and is a solid game all around. I've put hours into my zoos and think it's definitely worth a buy.			"

												more in depth than Zoo Tycoon and with a larger variety of animals, enjoy creating amazing zoos with animals both alive and extinct. downside would be the animals trained get sold to circuses, so if your against circus animals might want to avoid that bit, but remember this is just a game and not real life, your not actually hurting animals it's just a pc game.

												OKay so as someone who still owns and plays the Zoo Tycoon games, I gotta say this one is pretty interesting. Now I like it even more with the amount of content when the (very inexpensive) expansions/DLC were bought and added.The landscaping tools allow you to make a very detailed park as far as habitat and such goes. However some of the tools are labelled oddly. I suppose in other games I am used to the 'flatten' tool when in this game it's called 'plateau' but it does the same thing, bringing everything up/down to the same level and flat. A little finicky sometimes as it can be difficult to make a nice small pond in enclosures for drinking/swimming (sometimes there's not enough of a flat spot to put the water pump in so you have to mess around a bit). And the different types of turf are marked by hardness which is a little weird to me. I know some of the species of animals would like certain trees in their exhibits from their country of origin but the animals and trees can be dissatisfied trying to share the same turf type. I don't like the whole bit about micro managing the foliage of the park on top of the animals. That feels a little awkward.Graphics are actually pretty decent, less cartoony than ZT 2 and (sadly) Wildlife Park 3. I am personally okay with the vast majority of them. Though I have one bug (not sure if anyone else gets this) where animals or people randomly turn invisible. They're still there and sometimes I find them by accidentally clicking on them. But you can't see them. You can see the 'meh' yellow smiley over their heads if they're somewhat unimpressed.I do hate that the staff all have their own building, and you have to strategically place said buildings to get the most work out of your employees. The buildings take up valuable real estate that could instead be used for decoration or more exhibit space. On the plus side, the workers are pretty dedicated and no major complaints about them, in my humble opion. It would also be nice if they combined several of the staff into 'the Maintenance guy'. Gardener/Handyman/Bin Man could probably be the same dude since their work tends to be more infrequent.I love the animal selection, though the Swiss Brown Cow is perm-invisible for me for some reason. You can create fairly interesting combinations of beasts for the most part, for mixed compatible exhibits.Overall I'd have to rate this game (with all extra content) an 8/10 and if they make a 4th game and don't fudge it up like the 3rd one, I'll be the first to flail and yell ""Shut up and take my money!""

												I've always liked simulation type games and looking after animals, this game is done very well.I love how you can build your zoo from scratch and look after the animals and name them and watch them from close up or above. And the graphics look quite good.Though I dislike that each staff member has their own building, to me that is silly and takes up too much space.  It ends up looking rather ugly having these tall staff buildings every where. There should be 1 major staff building for the animal workers and another building for the maintenance staff. And you can employ how ever many staff you need from each building and then asign to them a task or area for them to work. I did work experience at a zoo when I studied land management and the staff get to other areas around the zoo by bicycle or use a ute or other vehicle if needing to transport stuff.I also dislike that you have to look after and watch the plants needs. That is not fun and I think it's unneeded. The plants should be alive but just classed as a decoration you don't have to look after like what they did in sims 3. Or at the very least I'd rather not have plants tell me they aren't happy and just have a gardener smart enough to look after them himself. So that I wont have to deal with the strangeness of plants telling me they aren't happy.I also can't figure out how to properly build a water habitat. The game never shows you how to. I end up flooding everything or when I try to lower the ground more I end up with the water deep down the bottom and a massive cavern at the top. Iam not likely to buy the marine world DLC as I hate building marine habitats they always work out wrong. With you having to make a big hole and put a pump in and the water never fills up to the top and it looks ugly. And underwater viewing tunnels don't work properly either. When you build it you have one of two options.. you can either build a one-way line into the pool which ends underwater, or build a true tunnel with two exits.If you opt for one-way visitors enter your tunnel but exit underwater and then swim in enclosure heedless of risk; and then start getting angry because they are stuck.If you opt for two-way the tunnel acts like an invisible barrier preventing any animals from crossing sides - effectively cutting your pool in half. I did not test to see if this barrier prevents attacks by one species on another. But I did test and proved that they would rather starve to death than go get food just 2m on other side of the under water tunnel. Further animals begged for fellows if split up by a tunnel but don't if both on same side of it. And this barrier effect remained true no matter how deeply underwater the tunnel was placed and how shallow the animal's swim parameters were.Could be more educational and have descriptions of the animals. Eg. Cheetah: a large feline of the felidae family which inhabits most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the fastest land animal. It likes to hunt antelope etc. I am likely to get most of the DLC eventually, except marine or horses as don't like marine habitat building and just horses in a dlc seems boring to me. Despite the things I dislike this game overall is fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend it and give it 7/10.  It would of been an 8 but loses a point for things I dislike. Maybe If they make a much improved Wildlife Park 4 they'll make this one worthy of an 8 or higher.			"

												There should be more than just a thumbs up or thumbs down for these reviews as this title has both.  For children it is a definate thumbs up as that is the obvious target audience.  The game leads you by the hand every step of the way and the controls are extremely basic.  For adults it is a thumbs down for the same reasons.  Missions get repetative and boring, animations are the same as the controls, basic, and even for a game released in 2006 not good enough to satisfy the older gamer.  Another turn off is that even the plants appear to be sentient and tell you why they are not happy which again, is good for kids but not for adults.  My four year old loves the game but my six year old prefers ZT2, as do I.  make of that what you will.I should also point out that the expansions do not appear to blend seamlesly with the original game but are rather stand alone products.  i bought the ultimate edition and have 7 seperate games to play, all of which have their own settings etc.			"

												I'm going to start off by saying that I really wanted to like this game.  I read through all the reviews before making my purchase and even though there were negative ones, I decided I'd find out for myself exactly how horrible this game really is.  Well, I've come to realize that it's not horrible, but it's not great either.  It's just okay.I have always loved zoo builders and for some reason there's a serious shortage of them out there, so Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2 is pretty much up against Wildlife Park 1, 2, and 3.  I have played both the Zoo Tycoon games avidly and I hold it very dear to my heart, despite its discontinuation.The Good-1) I love the amount of animals, but also the amount of out-of-the-box type of animals that came with the DLCs.  I liked the farm animals, the domestic animals, and the animals that are kind of used as ""decoration"" (Ducks, Butterflies, etc).2) The graphics are nice.3) I liked the animations of the people and animals.4) Unique buildings that are animal themed like horse stables.The Bad-1) Graphics are buggy.  When I started my game up, I instantly saw black squares in place of some plants.  It went away when I zoomed in.2) The camera.  I always feel like I'm TOO zoomed in.3) Placing water was crazy ridiculous.  You need to dig into the ground then place a water pump and the water keeps filling to whatever level the pump was placed on.  It's just too complicated and to be honest, quite annoying.4) You can't build on a grid like other zoo games so your zoo ends up looking messy.5) NO BIOMES.  Nothing is organized into biomes so you have maybe 1 tree for your Savannah exhibits.  The animals like land based on ""Hardness"" which is just.. weird.6) Like I said, the menus are unorganized.  You have to hunt for the things your animals want through each menu and if you forget you have to navigate all the way back to the animal (yep, re-scroll and everything) to read their requirements again.  The animals aren't even organized.  Nothing is organized.7) No themed decorations.  You get maybe 2 flowerbeds and 2 statues.  So difficult to theme anything.8) The weather.  It might sound cool at first, having weather, but when it starts raining or snowing, suddenly EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is sad because they ""Don't like the weather"".9) Every time you want to place staff, you have to place a bulky and unattractive building.10) Buildings are nice looking, but seriously limited.  Decorations are the same way (as stated above).  For example, there are no restaurants.  Want to feed your guests?  Okay.. do they want to eat french fries and soda?  Because those are some of your main options.I want to add that Wildlife Park 3 is a much better game but I was attracted to the DLC packs for Wildlife Park 2.  I'll wait until they make DLC for Wildlife Park 3 and continue to support this developer even though I was disappointed in this game.  I love zoo builders THAT much and I think they're doing better and improving.  I will still play my zoo on Wildlife Park 2, even though the bad things I listed get seriously aggravating.			"

												This game has many issues that prevent it from being fully enjoyable.  In fact, had I known about these issues, I wouldn't have bought the game.  The main issue is that the expansions do not act as DLC.  They act as their own seperate games.  They show up individually in your library.  The base game does not contain missions or maps from the expansions.  In order to play with those, you have to start up that specific expansion.  However, the animals from the expansions seem to show up almost randomly between each other.  For example, the base game appears to have almost all of the animals (fish, dinos, dragons, etc) but appears to be missing certain specific species.  The expansions have the same issue; having certain species and not others.  You can fool around in the program files and condense most of everything into the base game but you will still be missing stuff.  And, I must point out, the animal color customization button in the base game doesn't work.As for the actual game itself, it is alright.  There are aspects of it that are annoying (each employee has their own individual giant fugly tower, there isn't much variety in animal enrichment items, there aren't many items for guests, etc) but overall if you're looking to play something mindless for a while, Wildlife Park 2 isn't the worst choice.  It is certainly not as enjoyable as Zoo Tycoon, however, and if you're looking for an exciting, challenging simulation game, I would not choose this. "

												This game is possibly the best zoo simulation game on the internet. First, you have to pick the environment you want. From Costa Rica to Himilayas (heck, even a crater). Then, you have to build your whole zoo from scratch. No, not one of those crappy iphone apps where you get a colossal enclosed area and you just tapped on animals to feed them (and somehow get money from the animals), you have to actually BUILD it.This brings me to one of the bad things about the game; The prices are insanely off-bordered. A pig costs 10 dollars, while an extremely rare Napoleon Wrasse from a DLC costs 48 dollars. In real life, the Napoleon Wrasse would cost thousands.Anyway, after you start adding pens, you can put animals. They start off pretty hungry and possibly near-death, so what do you do? Either abuse the system and buy 1,000 lemon trees for cheap, or get a greenhouse for 500 dollars.Once you get an entrance, you can open up the zoo for visitors.Brings me to another bad thing; every visitor is so picky I can't even laugh about it.If you have the Crazy Zoo DLC, every single kid will not stop whining about wanting to climb something. Sometimes, I just put them in with some monkeys and tell them to climb the monkey slide. It's so annoying.You can put a wide variety of machines for visitors to use, like vendors, shops, and other stuff to take all of their money. Then, they complain to you that they ain't got no money. What do you do? Well, you have them take your money from an ATM and re-pay the same amount! YAY!Also, they want to pet the ""cute"" animals. Even if you only have dead anglerfish around, they want to pet cute animals. It's so freakin' annoying.Notheless, this game is great, and I recommend it.8.9/10 %			"

												I LOVED Zoo Tycoon 2, still do, as a matter of fact, but I'm rapidly falling head over heels for this game, too. It's incredibly beautiful, and really, the only downside to it is the animal audio - music is wonderful, voice acting is, if a little silly, imersive and was a fun surprise, but if you zoom in to get close, EVERY animal near you makes noise CEASELESSLY and it's very headache-inducing, especially if you're doing something with a large number of nearby animals. Seriously, my only complaint. Word of advice, though: do the four quick tutorial missions, even if you never do another mission. Trust me.			"

												There are a lot of people who compare this game to Zoo Tycoon, and for good reason. It's basically the same premise, after all. This game cannot be faulted for being less realistic than the ZT series, because it is, and that does add a little depth to the simulation.BUT.The interface is far, far more clunky than ZT's, and some of the design decision are questionable. For example, each zookeeper you hire requires you to build him a special Zookeeper's Hut, which is a three-story-tall eyesore. And he can only handle about two enclosures, so prepare to build a lot of them. Also, some of their claims about number of animals are specious (You can't have Rabbits AND Bunnies.), and the overall assortment of things to customize the look of your zoo is FAR smaller than ZT (No flower beds? Really? And the entire list of statues I can build is 'Bear' and 'Panda bear'.)All in all, I think ZT2 is a far better game, and kinda regret this purchase.			"

												Growing up I was addicted to Zoo Tycoon, so as soon as I saw this for sale I knew I had to try it.I feel like most people who enjoyed the ZT series will enjoy WP2. I wouldn't say this game is harder than ZT, but it has more of a realistic feel. You need to have structures to harvest food for the animals, plants need care, and babies animals don't just pop out of nowhere, instead they have a gestation period or eggs are layed.Starter missions are fairly simple and do a good job of introducing you to the game machanics. The only major thing I can complain about is the set up for marine habitats. Otherwise I feel the game is overall very userfriendly.			"

												Definitely a fun game for those interesting in simulation/tycoon genres and are interested in animals and the types of requirements they need. The game has more realism involved than other similar titles which adds more chaos and fun to try and balance everything out. There game does have a few bugs here and there (save before you tab out or else you could lose your zoo's data). The animals you get to begin with are enough to have many different combonations of exhibits. The major flaws that I have found or can't seem to understand are the terrain tool and I'm dissapointed in how small the map is. The terrain tool takes a while to get used to and sometimes doesn't do what you want it to do and with the map size, I can only get around 10 exhibits along with the required buildings for my visitors. Overall its a nice game for people who are interested in the genre or just animals and zoos in general. 8/10			"

												Do you like animals? Farms? Zoos? Circus? How about building you own ecosystem? Yes, thats right, you heard me. Ecosystem. The animals in zoo tycoon can't eat eathother. There are also no dead bodys. The animals in Wildlife Park ""WP"" become carcusus that can be eaten by predators so making an ecosystem isnt that bad! The missions are better. They are not timed, but still challenging and you have to think and trial and error. Its nice. But to be honest. Zoo tycoon can't even put a finger on this game. Its so much better. I got the 9 pack, so wroth it. The animals are more realistic, they act more like animals would although they can be a little stupid. The people too. ""You can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink."" you can also walk ammung the animals which is a plus for me becaused i wanna see how all my babys are doing. Great Game!			"

												The game and its expansion packs are formatted to be different games and don't really blend well into each other. The missions are good tutorials but they get very repetative. The interface is very clunky and the information about the animal is very vauge. This is not a zoo tycoon equivalent. The game(s) do feature different aspects that zoo tycoon didn't such as hardness level, amount of food, and weather conditions but I find those features limit the game experience instead of enhancing it. For instance I wouldn't be able to have a penguin and a dragon in the same zoo and would have to make a new save. The water placement is also an interesting mechanic but if you are going for an asthetic look is not great. The DLC only adds about 1-3 new animals which for $5 is a bit of a rip off. However compared to other zoo tycoon simulators I've tried this one holds up well.  If you are looking for something that isn't zoo tycoon and is fairly cheap then this game is okay but I reccomend looking into purchasing zoo tycoon itself (even if its expensive).			"

												This game is NOT Zoo Tycoon, let me make that clear before going into depth about the rest of the game.First, you not only look after animals in this game; you look after the plants as well. Be prepared to see your plants responding positively or negatively to the type of soil or temperatures you put them in.Pros+ Lots of animals, providing you get the DLCs.+Temperatures and a far more sophisticated biome system.+ Models are nice, textures are okay but could be better.+ Controls like any other builder...which is easy.Cons- Music is repetative, I recommend turning it off.- Not many buildings, decorations or enrichment items for animals...even with DLC, it feels very empty.- Some plant and animal combinations do not work when they should do (see below)Be prepared to see plants and animals, that should live in the same habitats together, suddenly flare up about ""soil being too hard"" or ""too soft"" and not liking the weather, even though you select their native land as a habitat...I am looking at you Mr.Panda and Mr.Bamboo.Why don't I recommend this game over Zoo Tycoon? Well I would do, since for a start it works on Windows 7 and up, whilst Zoo Tycoon doesn't...but the game feels incredibly empty even with all those DLCs crammed into it.If it wasn't for my computerusing WIndows 8.1 I would still be playing Zoo Tycoon, but I can't. And that would be the ONLY reason I'd recommend Wildlife Park 2; it fills a gap, though very VERY shallowly.Final verdict; Meh. 5/10.			"

												I think this game is pretty fun. It's more realistic than games like Zoo Empire or Zoo Tycoon, which makes it a little bit more difficult than those games. The feed you give to your animals comes from an actual building rather than the other games that I mentioned earlier. At first, I was just playing freeplay and I didn't really understand how it worked, but I played the first 6 or so missions and I got the basic stuff down from that. The one bug I found was that anytime I downsized that window(to look tutorials up on the internet, or things like that), the game crashed. This is a pain because my window menu opens up randomly and I had to restart the entire mission (which was starting to take a bit of time), so that wasn't fun. I also don't like how random animals want to swim all the time? Like, I didn't know that pandas and raccoons want to be swimming all the time, but in this game they did. Also, I was kind of hoping for there to be a cockatoo in the game but there were only macaws and not cockatoos so I was a bit disappointed in that. I also can't figure out how to open your zoo to the public in the freeplay mode, but maybe I just haven't gotten that far with the missions.What I did like in this game is how much more diverse all the animals are in this than the usual zoo simulators. I like having the option of being able to have different fish, chicken, rats, etc(Of course those are all different expansion packs but I'm grouping them all together), but /still/ kind of disappointed in the lack of a cockatoo, which is right on the loading screen art.Anyway I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Fix the bug where it crashes each time you close  the window and then I'd make it a 5/5.			"

												Recently I let an eight year old and a six year old play this game because their parents would probably dislike it if I let them play FNAF the only other game with ""cute animals"" I had to offer at the time. This may have been a mistake as it's possible they now hate me, this game and possibly animals in general.  In my previous review a few years ago ,which I clearly should have read before letting them play, I said that I wanted to love this game when I bought it. This time I would have settled for generally playable. It's not. In two instances animals simply refused to complete needed tasks regardless of every requirement being met meaning long challenges with limited ability to do anything else while you waited had to be restarted. The keeper staff gets hung up on gates unless their gazbo building which each of them apparently needs is placed inside the animal pens and the guests are simply terrible. There is no logic or explantion for when things go wrong and the controls are clunky and terrible. After lunch break I asked who wanted a turn with the zoo game and they both offered to let the other one play. Then they decided to color instead.I wanted to love this game. I owned it years ago and I put down any remembered flaws to hardware failures or thinking it was more difficult then it probably was. I bought the ultimate addition because I thought the marine life would be a nice addition to the game I used to play.................Two days in I have all the regrets for paying any amount of money for this. Animals are sometimes invisable. Swiss brown cow female is apparently just a shadow that moos. The animals make tons of loud rrepetitive noises constantly which is extra annoying purely because most of the missions are hurry up and wait. As the game won't run in the background I literally had to have the screen up and the game running for two hours to complete a mission after I saw to the needs of the animals.........make a better zoo while animals take the time to do their thing? can't. During missions you are locked out of most of the other features. The only reason to play the missions is because otherwise you will have no idea where or what some of the important items in the game are for sandbox mode. I still have no idea after to days how to properly build a water habitat, the controls are really seriously awful. Features seem broken. I have no idea if I am supposed to be able to change the coat color on some or all of the horses since they all look like they have that option but only two of them actually allow it. Can't make mixed animal pins easily because animals are SO picky about the surface they are on. Plants handling is a nightmare. I can't believe a game got this many expansions without them fixing some of the core world building issues.............in short I wish I had saved the money ordered a pizza and watched animal planet instead.....it would have been far less frustrating.

It is your choice though If you want animals then buy, if you don't then don't buy it P.S. I put my tiger in to path while people are walking, it didn't attack at all but chase. so my rate for this game is 78.9/100.0			"

												Well I have always been a fan of zoo tycoon games, and this game is a worthy trip down memory lane.Let's get the one gripe I have out of the way: The graphics and animations are a bit yesteryear but not terrible, but an upgrade to more realistic models would have been a 10/10.And all the rest is good. All of the features in this game are very familiar to a fan of the genre and the ability to play topdown or on the ground is seamless. Full terrain editing on the fly, enclosure editing with shelters, animal enrichment etc. All the familiar snack shops and gift shops, bins and fountains, staff to sweep up, you know the score.All in all it's and updated version of the zoo games we have missed. I will say that it feels like it is targeted at a younger audience as an education tool, but if you've missed a good zoo game, then buy it.9/10			"

												This game has a few cool concepts but behaves more like an alpha or beta than a complete game.I bought this because I wanted to play Zoo Tycoon 2, which was my childhood game but not compatible with Windows 10. But this game doesn't fill the spot at all.Many of its concepts are somewhat nice. For example, animals need heating and cooling, and food and water costs money instead of just magically appearing. I like the fact that plants also must be cared for, but the omnipresent unhappy faces hovering above all of them are too much. It's nice that some animals need to be placed with others of its kind to be happy and stuff.Overall, the game feels empty. The animals are not as diverse as they are in ZT2. But mostly, I hate the lack of stuff that there is to put down. For the visitors, we have a snack shop, soda machine, bench, and some other random stuff like restrooms. There aren't any restaurants, no seating other than the bench. There are about nine fench choices to choose from. We don't have much in terms of animal toys, though something I find weird is that animals that need to climb can only climb on the climbing toy and not on any of the actual trees. There aren't any rocks other than these three grayish blobs. This lack of stuff is what I expect from an alpha or beta, not a complete game.But what I probably hate the most is how each zoo keeper or maintainence guy needs his own building, just for himself: one person. And when he's not working, he's just standing there like a statue. And if we have a way to refill the animal's food and water bowl by ourselves without the help of these weirdos, I haven't found it. Also, the way to make ponds is really weird, and the UI is weird, with no way to sort it, but with the lack of items, that isn't a huge issue.			"

												I generally like tycoon games, but overall my experience with this one has been pretty dull. The menus are tedious and I didn't see any way to sort plants or animals by biomes, needs, etc, the graphics aren't very good, and it kept crashing every time I tried to switch to another tab. The soundtrack is really repetitive and the missions (as far as I played) were boring and tedious with the slow narration.The whole game feels kind of dull and empty. If you're looking to fill the zoo tycoon void, look elsewhere. I do not reccomend this game and I am hoping that I can get a refund.The price of the actual game isn't bad, but I don't think that the DLC is worth it. If you can take care of one animal, you can take care of them all. It's all pretty much the same.			"

												While I do like this game, it gets a little boring once you've played through all the missions, so getting the DLCs is a must if you want to come back and play this game later on. I feel that if the devs allowed modding support, it could've helped to keep the community alive. I mean, older games like Zoo Tycoon, JPOG, and others kept their communities alive with mods. In the case of JPOG, modding kept the community alive and was the reason why we got apps like Jurassic Park Builder and JWTG. Because those games did well on mobile we are getting mesisoica and prehistoric kingdom as spiritual successors. With this game, the devs just released DLC to keep the community alive, but eventually people quit buying them because it was the same old game. So when wildlife park 3 came out, nobody cared. And when the orginal wildlife park went onto mobile, nobody cared. If the devs were smart, they would have allowed steam workshop support, but instead they released a bunch of DLC and abandoned the game. I don't really care that the game has low graphics quality though, because to me at least, it doesn't matter as much as the fun factor of it. I would recomend playing it if you love animals, but don't expect it to last long, if you want that, play zoo tycoon 2.			"

												Wildlife Park 2 is a pretty standard game, it is entertaining if you are a fan of tycoon type games. I found the missions quite tedious, sometimes going longer than an hour (cough cough the infamous Ostrich Farm mission..). I enjoyed the diverse range of animals that were only increased with the multiple DLC that became available. The game (and DLC) are affordable, and I would not have paid anything more for a game like this. It's fun, you have compelte control of how you play and run your zoo (or Wildlife Park... but really it's a zoo). I like attention to detail, the animal textures are decent and the many life styles factors that affect the wellbeing of each individual animal made the experience more real, catering to each animals individual needs as well as their herd. The mating animations were humerous and I was shocked the first time I saw a pair of Ostrichs going hard at it.. especially when I had the game in fast forward mod.. However there are a few issues with this game. You cannot access all the DLC content in the Main Game, rather playing the individual expansions separetly. I would have liked to use ALL animals and facilities in the one game to make zoos more diverse nd unique, offering more animal types and experiences for the (very ♥♥♥♥ing needy) visitors. Another issue that has put me off the game is the fact about a third if not a half of the animals textures no longer work and instead you have an awkward giant ♥♥♥♥ign square. It's a mediocre game, it's fun to muck about on and can sometimes be addictive trying to make a kick♥♥♥♥♥zoo. However I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												As a Person who has most likely 400+ hours into Zoo Tycoon 2, I must say this game is a significantly worse 'Zoo em' up'.The Good of Wildlife Park 2 >The variety of animals in this game.>The Graphics have a unique charm to them, giving me a similar vibe to Zoo Tycoon 2's graphics. The Meh >Why is it instead of biomes, we have 'hardness'? Not that it's a big deal...>The Weather sounds like a good touch, but all it seems to do is give everyone a negative mood. The Bad >Dear GOD the music, I am so sick of hearing the same song OVER and OVER to the point where I finally turned it off.>For a large duration of the game, everything is silent, except for the sound of water pumps, and the occassionaly cry from an animal. There is no AMBIENCE. Music does not play until you zoom out. If you're zoomed in to look at the animals closer, the music stops, and all you can hear are those annoying as all hell water pumps.>The UI and it's organization is AWFUL.>Couldn't they include a grid system? Placing things feels so janky and wrong compared to games like the 'Zoo Tycoon' series.>The VERY LITTLE variety in terms of buildings, gates, walls, fences, etc. that this game offers.>What is up with water placement? I absolutely hate the pump system this game has.>Having to place these giant, space taking buildings for each individual staff member is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.>The AI for the animals, people, and staff are stupid. The animal AI just wanders wherever it pleases, and have had doctors literally walk past injured bodies in their job's sphere of influence, and do nothing. Nevermind the AWFUL AI pathing for everything.>The fences, gates, and walls ARE WORTHLESS. I've had a giant Crocodile devour a tourist behind an ELECTRIC FENCE. How the hell does that even happen? >The amount of DLC for this game is incredible. There are a few which do add some nice new animals and buildings, etc. But some are either pointless, or should already be in another DLC/Base game.>Instead of just having a ""Hunger"" bar, animals sometimes have several bars which they need to have filled. Does it make sense for a Crocodile to want to eat meat after eating a pile of fish? Why does it care so much to eat meat when it just had a pile of fish? The Ugly >I don't know if it affects me, but apparently people are missing certain animals from the games files. This is has something to do with the fact that each expansion doesn't act like a DLC, but instead as a seperate game. So some animals, maps, and missions don't appear at all unless you run a specific expansion. Conclusion If you are looking for a Zoo simulation game, this is not what you want. Go order Zoo tycoon 2 on Amazon if you really want to play a good Zoo simulation. If you REALLY are desperate enough to want to get a Zoo game, get this and it's expansions on a sale.			"

												This game is about a love affiar with Sweden. It allows you to customize a massive park with various animals (DLC adds extra) both marine, land and air. You have to make sure the proper staff are hired to feed, clean and care for the park and it's inhabitants.The game has a story type mode, but personally, it isn't too fun or interesting, though it's quite long. My highlights were making a massive waterpark filled with fishes and nice waterfowl. Guest would walk on sandy beaches and observe them. I also placed a Sarcasucas Imperator (Giant crocodile) in the waters for a special attraction.			"

												I'd say at least the DLC's should be free.. nah,It's a good thing the game doesn't cost -that- much. I got curious to WP more so because of the DLC but the content is.. very lacking. I like the idea, the realism, the animals but I really think it lacks content (buildings and decorations especially).  Shaping the ground is something that I find difficult in this game. (There isn't really an option to make the ground the same level, filling a space up with water can be hard) I haven't found a way to top view the park either (yet) which makes shaping also a lil difficult. The music is SUPER repetitive. The animal sounds are even worse. All in all.. I wouldn't recommend it but it might just still be fun to play.. casually... I'm not so sure , I really hoped for more content I guess. (My opinion can still change though xD)			"

												I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I bought the full special pack of games from this series because it was on sale and I used to love Zoo Tycoon, so I wanted to play around in the game. The specs even have Windows 7 in the list of OS that can run this game... no dice.I can't even find an option to play this in compatibility mode, all of the tutorials for doing so show options on menus/properties that don't exist. The entire load-up screen is broken. I've never had a problem like this with a steam game, even Alpha/Beta versions of games. I assumed it would work because I trust Steam's selection of games. When I pay for a game on Steam, I expect it to work correctly without me having to go to great lengths to get drivers or updates or compatibility software or whatever it is I'm going to have to get in order for this game to work. I expect this kind of thing when I try to boot up my old Sims 3 cd, or even when I download Sims 2 FOR FREE because it's so old and incompatible. I didn't expect a perfect game - I expected glitches and old graphics, that would have been fine. But I did expect it to be functional.It's not like I'm diving into the $5 game bin at Walmart and picked up a game from 1998. The game was released in 2006 and is available digitally, so why doesn't it work on modern OS? If I can't get a refund, this is going to have been a complete waste of money. How am I supposed to review a game I can't play? I actually have to mess around with the dysfunctional game-launch so that I can hit the minimum 5 minutes for ""playing"" a game in order to leave this review. Handy, that.			"

												Dull and boring, really not worth it for the price. If you are looking for a zoo tycoon experience than this isn't for you. Good chunk of the time played was getting the darn thing to run, than once it did I found a lack luster experience. Place buildings that have a small range, with workers tied to said range, animals that spend most the time just standing there doing nothing. Very little in the means of customizing or setting up the maps how you want. Crashes and bugs and just dull all around. Over all I wish I hadn't gone over my two hour refund limit by a few minutes.

												When I bought the game an all the DLC I didn't have big expectations.  I like Zoo Tycoon and thought I would give it a try.  The game has a few residual flaws, very little community to help, dismal manual but fairly simple mechanics.Having said that. I had lots of fun just messing around with it and got more than I anticipated for my money spent.  It is not often you buy and later feel you got a bargain.  The animals and graphics are  much better than even Zoo Tycoon2 in my opinion.It is too bad the developers have no presence on steam for this title and content.  It is too bad they left the few little bugs that remain after so much work on the DLC..lol			"

												This is a kids game. Bought it on the recommendations saying it had more complexity than Zoo Tycoon - there is almost NO tycooning element in this, and most of the animals are happy with 1 solid type of ground, food, water and a toy. That sounds like it should be a lot but you can set up a perfect enclosure in about 2 minutes, and the animals breed like crazy.Oh, and the park guests - just open up the status menu, find someone complaining they are hungry/thirsy, and drop some shops on them. 100% satisfaction and good cash flow without any thinking.Just far to simplistic, I'm sure kids will love it, but not a game for adults, or anyone who wants a serious tycoon experience.

They did a good job of teaching concepts and explaining the game.  There was enough variety between them that I didn't get bored.  I had no major performance issues playing the game.  The storyline for the missions was adequate but not something I would write home about.  Still, if you are in it for the sandbox portion of running your own wildlife park I don't think you'll be disapointed.			"

This is good if you're after a creative sandbox-ish game (freeplay) and love animals. It has great fine tuned exhibit creation controls and the animal graphics have stood the test of time. Wonderful for kids, not so cerebral for adults so for me it's a good zen/casual game.If you're looking for challenging scenarios and a financial manager, I'd look elsewhere. Zoo Tycoon is more challenging in terms of scenarios and managing finances all the while balancing animal happiness. You learn tips, tricks, and shortcuts for success while WP is pretty straight forward. WP2 does have some better defined realism, such as actual gestation time for animal pregnancies, but it's just plain easy to 'win' and turn constant profit.Both games (Zoo Tycoon and Wildlife Park 2) are good, but not equivalent/don't have the same focus. ZT had better customization with its modding community and a better selection of items/objects/fences to place to match your aesthetic while Wild Park 2 has some aggravating graphical shortcomings (i.e. your animal keeper gate is always made of wood, even if the fence is made of concrete).By and large, I like Zoo Tycoon better, but I don't regret purchasing or playing Wildlife Park 2.

												Great game if you like stuff like Zoo Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon 2. The interface is very much like any of them. This game has a lot of the stuff gamers wished Microsoft Studios had included in their zoo game. Although the building is much easier in some cases; fences are another issue if you’re a perfectionist you may not like. However when building the in closures the fences don't look great (but work) around the animals. So you may see polls to close or too far from each other. Other than that the game is easy to play or build in and does have some appeal to it that some will like. This game would be enjoyable for any zoo tycoon gamers.			"

I have played the original Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2, and this one is just as good.  One of my favorite features is that you can build and edit things from first-person view, so you could play the entire game without ever needing to go back to world view, if you wanted.  It does need a few glitch fixes (sometimes an animal will disappear), and a few more scenarios would be fun, but overall it's great.  Lots of expansions, and plenty of animals to acquire!			"

												This is a game I wanted to like, but just couldn't.  To start with, I love Zoo Tycoon, even as an adult, so I figured that I'd enjoy this game.  And there are details about it that I DO like even better than Zoo Tycoon -- such as needing to wait for animals to gestate and training the animals.But the controls are just so totally cumbersome that it's agonizing.  It's WORSE than the old controls to the original Zoo Tycoon.  There is no way to add gridlines on the terrain, so digging holes to place sea creatures in is a nightmare.  The zookeepers, trash guys, etc, all have these annoyingly small, diagonal zones -- which means you're placing workers every other exhibit.  The customers make me want to feed them all to the lions, because they're constantly demanding more plants, more food stands, more decorations, etc... even if it's only been 10 squares since the last food stand and they're three steps from a decoration.  Oh, and the decorations are (a) ugly and (b) extremely limited, so there's no satisfation in prettifying your park.Having played through almost all of the missions now, I would not recommend this game.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  Oh, and the fact that I CAN play through almost all the missions in a couple of hours also should warn people how easy it is.  It's just too bad there's so little satisfaction in winning.  :(			"

												After many hours of reading up on the game and querying myself on weather to spend £5 on this game i finally caved in and bought it. And im very happy i did now. To start with the controls seemed a bit clunky and foreign but after my first hour on this i was used to it. The game takes detail a lot further than Zoo Tycoon does and it does it well From animal pregnancy gestation dates to a bear who is upset because it cant climb on anything. Wildlife park is a good zoo sim and i would reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the zoo sim genre. I would say this game is defnitetly worth the fiver it is being sold for and want to reassure anyone having doubts about it like i did just give it a go and you will be surprised.			"

												A pretty descent tycoon game. Slightly more challenging than other zoo games but it is a bit dated. Some of the missions can not be beaten, for example, one mission requires you to keep about eleven guests happy but there are never more than ten guests in the park and there is no room to expand the zoo or add many new species to attract more guests. There is a little bit of entertainment to this game but the restrictions become annoying after a while.			"

												If for whatever reason you're looking to play a Zoo Simulator, i would only ever recommend Zoo Tycoon 2 and Its expansions, despite its glitches Zoo Tycoon 2 is so much more enjoyable than Wildlife Park 2. Even WatchMojo .com will agree Zoo Tycoon is one of the top 10 Tycoon series out there.Bad Glitches, Overall Confusing, Boring Story, Pointless stuff, Water bodies can only be created with Water Machines and you can't exactly tell how high the water is going to go, The game is stuck at a choppy framerate. Overall Wildlife Park 2 is boring as hell, seems the only reason i bought this during the holiday sale is because i use to play it several years ago as a child, even then i thought Zoo Tycoon 2 was so much more enjoyable. I decided to give this game another run since it was on sale, but it didn't take long for me to see how boring as hell this game is, so much so that i decided to have this game refunded so i may purchase a different and far more enjoyable game.Although Zoo Tycoon 2 isn't available on steam, if you're looking for Zoo Simulators for whatever reason then look no further than Zoo Tycoon 2 and its expansions.

												I was extremely excited to play this game, but unfortunately it refused to acknowlege any screen resolution changes and left the game unplayable on my TV. It also does not have an option to switch to wiindowed view, and the only solution i could find also threw off the mouse calibration. Perhaps this wouldn't be a problem if help was avalible but the forums don't seem to have many threads about this issue, and also seems to be dead since 2014. I'm really disappointed :'( I'll probably keep the game incase I figure something out, but until then this game is completely broken for me.			"

												Fairly decent game. I'd say the only con is that there are many wildlife park 2 sidegames but none of them can be accessed as a DLC. So even if I have all sidegames I can't access all the content at the same time.			"

												Great zoo game! It takes a little getting used to, but overall it is a fantastic game that I would recommend to any zoo fans.  I have played the original Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2, and this one is just as good.  One of my favorite features is that you can build and edit things from first-person view, so you could play the entire game without ever needing to go back to world view, if you wanted.  It does need a few glitch fixes (sometimes an animal will disappear), and a few more scenarios would be fun, but overall it's great.  Lots of expansions, and plenty of animals to acquire!			"

												I mostly played it for the storyline missions.  I've never been one to play the sandbox side of things without some type of goal.  They did a good job of teaching concepts and explaining the game.  There was enough variety between them that I didn't get bored.  I had no major performance issues playing the game.  The storyline for the missions was adequate but not something I would write home about.  Still, if you are in it for the sandbox portion of running your own wildlife park I don't think you'll be disapointed.			"

												Has its pros and cons when compared to Zoo Tycoon 2, but I'm finding more cons than pros so far.Lacking in interface and design aspects compared to ZT2, and the marine animal add-on is rather sad by comparison (no tanks?).  Fewer animals, decor items, and landscape options, and none of the neat information that came with ZT2 animals and plants.  However there are a few innovations here that could be well incorporated into ZT2+, like temperature concerns, seasonal change, and bad weather. Also fence building is sort of buggy.   I like being able to build any shape pen, but I'd also like to be able to snap walls to a grid when I want.   A few graphical issues come up as well - wall type mismatches, clipping problems.  There's a lot to clean up here.			"

												After many hours of reading up on the game and querying myself on weather to spend £5 on this game i finally caved in and bought it. And im very happy i did now. To start with the controls seemed a bit clunky and foreign but after my first hour on this i was used to it. The game takes detail a lot further than Zoo Tycoon does and it does it well From animal pregnancy gestation dates to a bear who is upset because it cant climb on anything. Wildlife park is a good zoo sim and i would reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the zoo sim genre. I would say this game is defnitetly worth the fiver it is being sold for and want to reassure anyone having doubts about it like i did just give it a go and you will be surprised.			"

												This is a game I wanted to like, but just couldn't.  To start with, I love Zoo Tycoon, even as an adult, so I figured that I'd enjoy this game.  And there are details about it that I DO like even better than Zoo Tycoon -- such as needing to wait for animals to gestate and training the animals.But the controls are just so totally cumbersome that it's agonizing.  It's WORSE than the old controls to the original Zoo Tycoon.  There is no way to add gridlines on the terrain, so digging holes to place sea creatures in is a nightmare.  The zookeepers, trash guys, etc, all have these annoyingly small, diagonal zones -- which means you're placing workers every other exhibit.  The customers make me want to feed them all to the lions, because they're constantly demanding more plants, more food stands, more decorations, etc... even if it's only been 10 squares since the last food stand and they're three steps from a decoration.  Oh, and the decorations are (a) ugly and (b) extremely limited, so there's no satisfation in prettifying your park.Having played through almost all of the missions now, I would not recommend this game.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  Oh, and the fact that I CAN play through almost all the missions in a couple of hours also should warn people how easy it is.  It's just too bad there's so little satisfaction in winning.  :(			"

												This game is great, it can become a little boring or tedious after a while but that can be solved by taking a break and coming back to it later. I love freeplay mode. I recently discovered that you cn breed oddities which is cool. Despite it not being compatible with my shiny new computer (which means I have to play it on the ancient brick that is my other PC), I've never experienced any lag, glitching or crashes. However its a little disappointing to not be able to change the colour of things in the park (fences, building, etc) and especially not be able to change the colours of the animals (to other realistic colours that species comes in, of course).Overall I'd give it an 8.5 / 10!

												it has its positives and negatives, was hoping for a more Zoo tycoon game, had some similarities and things i thought were better. i enjoyed the non grid building, and a decent animal selection but was very disappointed in the marine animals and set up for them, not a lot of options for buildings either, just very basic ones. not a ton of decorations or foliage (ex. trees, plants, rocks, ect..) to enhance my zoo. Still a fun game to relax and enjoy over all. If you are looking for a zoo tycoon experiance i would say this is probably not going to live up to your expectations.			"

												As both an animal lover and a fan of simulation-type games, this one appealed to me quite a lot. Also happening to like sandbox-y games, the freebuild mode is my personal favourite. I would highly reccomend this game to any person who likes the aforementioned types of things.The graphics can get a little choppy if I zoom in too close, but other than that, it's very smotth gameplay. The world loading screen takes a good minute or so, but that's understandable. I really enjoy the fantasy animals more than anything, as well as the Horses DLC's added features (I also reccomend getting the Ultimate version, as it comes with quite a lot of DLC's and while it may take longer to install, the additions are so worth it). It's really cool how the animals interact with each other, and how realistic it is. It actually makes me get attached to my animals, and I like that. It's nice that you have to plan what you're going to have in your zoo, since not all the animals will like it where you are (Dinosaurs want a warmer climate, while sapphire dragons like a frigid one).Overall, this is great, and if you're looking for a new zoo simulation game, this might be the one for you.

												The game on its own is very different than other games in this genre, such as ZooTycoon 2, Zoo Empire.WildLife Park 2 is really cool since it doesnt has a grid, but with making paths it can be annoying.It has a unique system of gaining food for the animals since you have to place down the fittinf farm. Also you need to get gardeners to water your plants.Also the game has activists wich are people that will break down your fence.you can do marketing aswell to gain more visitors.In my opinion is this game more realistic than the others in this genre			"
