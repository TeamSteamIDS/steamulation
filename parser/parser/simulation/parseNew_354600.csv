												It takes a little while to get the hang of it. I had to do the tutorial, a short scenario and watched a couple of youtube videos. The battle mechanics are similar to HOI3, it's even more detailed because you are actually fighting for ground and not just provinces. There is also a little more micro management of units because the divisions are split into various parts. For example Panzer 1 will have 4 separate Panzer brigades, so you will have to move each one separately or as a group. in HOI 3 you just move the entire division around from province to province.Just one mooooore tuuuuuurn. P.S. I opened the game for about 30 minutes so steam would let me do a review. But I've played for much longer.			"

												This wargame has an interesting focus on Your army management, that I really like. Each turn You get some amount of equipment of different types (different models of guns, armor, trucks, infantry, speciality units, etc.). Unused equipment is automatically stockpiled in Your main HQ unit and then it is distributed to the frontlines, where it is needed. You can even force Your units to redistribute some equipment back to the HQ resource pool and then back to other units that needs that equipment more. You can designate a new type for Your division and it will automatically get a new equipment to fulfill that role. You will need to keep supply routes open for that and need a bit of patience because it will not happen automatically. This is really nice feature to play around and see how Your force evolves.			"

												Well i have played this one for about 50 hours so far, and for the most part i do rather like it.      Its cleverly thought out and it makes you think about your every move. nice one team. however there are a few things that niggle. not least of all is that i find it  damn near impossibe to  beat. Even on easy, i still havent managed to get passed the second scenario on time. Frustrating as that is though, it does leave me wanting to try again , and so i guess in that sense , its very good value for money.     The larger campaign maps are very large indeed,  dare i say a little too large for my liking, as i find them difficult to control. but they seem very detailed and its quite the job keeping tabs on whats going on.      Sadly the time clock doesnt seem to work in days , rather 2 or 3 days increments ,  which i find a little odd, as it makes hard work of the plan making and also knowing how many moves you have left.      But all in all, its really good fun. and despite not being very good at it yet, i promise i will  try harder. cheers.			"

												I play all the VR Design games.  Adv Tactics is good, DC Warsaw is better, DC CB is best.  Can't wait for DC3 Barbarossa.			"

												Very Good game - really challenging but not as overwhelming and time intensive as other even more complex games. I hope we will see one day a 1939-1945 campaign ;-D			"

												I'm still getting into this game, but it seems like Vic took everything great about DC and upped the ante.  It has all the operational fun with new strategic considerations.  Dictators set objectives, allies and command can paralyze, reinforcements and replacements come in based on perceived importance of the front, etc.  This is all the fun of DC1, but with a new strategic aspect and longer term considerations.  Do I really want to bash Wiking through that river, or should I let them rest and rail them to the center?10/10 wish I were better at PBEM.			"

												Very Challenging game,took me a few tries on before I got any Major Victories. Historically accurate simulation of Operation ""Blau"" from both the German and Soviet perspective of the 1942-43 campaign in Southern Russia. Well worth the money spent on the game.			"

Decisive Campaigns SeriesI recommend very warmly this turn based little gem strategy game at operational level with a very good intuitive interface&gameplay mechanics not overly convoluted , for those who want a greater challenge&have free time to spend - and also a more detailed historical background regarding the units in combat - the description on the game page is very accurate from my POV - 10/10 !

												This game and the others like it in the series are real gems for wargamers both computer wargamers and those that used to play board game style wargames from Avalon Hill, SPI, GDW, and other classic wargaming companies. The amount of detail and historical data the game encompasses is thrilling. As an exampe, you don't just have a an armored unit. You get an armored unit that is broken down by the type of equipment it has, its morale, training supplies and so much more. You have can interact with high command to get more supplies, trucks, new artillery pieces, even additional command staff. If your prestige and polical points (consider it in game gold for purchasing replacements) is high enough, you may be able to convince high command to abandon some set objectives and to go after another objective. Individual generals have a large effect on battles via their stats and can play differnt cards which represnt differnt command functions. For example, one card may allow your infanty to attack better, while another card may help out a division's sagging moral or help with recon. The games in the series are a little pricy but worth it, particularily if you catch them on sale.			"

												Badly designed game that on its face looks appealing, but when you get in the meat of the mechanics of the game is deeply flawed on many levels. For a quick example, in the Operation Uranus scenario against another very seasoned human opponent, as the German player I was able to leave Stalingrad and then defeat the Russians along the entire line. Completely unrealistic. Don't buy this game. There are much better games on the divisional/regimental level, one being Gary Grigsby's War in the East. That game I recommend.			"
