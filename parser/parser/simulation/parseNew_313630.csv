This is the first review I have ever written and I have been with steam since HL2 was the new hotness. in short I LOVE this game in VR. I can't wait for more fleshed out games, the tech is there the games are not.... This is a glimpse of the future God Bless You Guys and keep up the good work!!!!			"

The Solus Project

By: SABINA




The Solus Project is among the most engrossing games I've played. The creators have clearly put a lot of time and thought into creating this world and its story. While still in Early Access, it is important to note that the current content and gameplay is complete and polished. Regular updates add more content and areas to explore. And exploration is where this game shines. Stranded on an alien planet, with an unstable, volatile weather system, you must survive to make contact with a humanity that has lost it's home and desperately needs a new one. As you search the open-world for parts to build a communications tower and survival goods, as well as try to survive the richly atmospheric weather, you begin to reveal a deep story behind the planet's inhabitants. The mounting level of intrigue, even horror at times, is expertly written and delivered. Anyone at all interested in aliens/ancient aliens lore will be immediately swept into the story and begin to formulate theories of their own.  “The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. There also we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak; and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight."" -Numbers 13:32-33

The story seems to hint at ideas most popularly written by the likes of Zechariah Sitchin and Erich von Däniken, concerning such things as Nibiru (the theoretical tenth planet in a much wider elipse of the sun), Sumerian myths concerning the Annunaki, and the much interpreted biblical passages concerning the Nephilim, more widely written about in the apocryphal Books of Enoch. ""The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God (bene Elohim) came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them.""  Genesis 6:4

At its heart, The Solus Project is an exploration game. The game world is beautifully rendered with UE4 and highly optimized for any machine. While it is tagged as a survival game, it doesn't have some of the common elements of EA open-world survival games such as crafting menus and base-building. This absence does not detract from immersion in any way. The story touches on themes that no other game has ever touched, remarkably so, because it is a rich treasure trove of fascination, mystery and intrigue, and yes, as Arthur C. Clarke so famously said; absolute terror.			"

												Excellent game, one of my new favorites for exploration/puzzles in first person. The storyline moves really well, the graphics and textures are on point. The first ten minutes can be a little daunting as you understand how to combine items and how the game's flow is going to be but after that it carries onward. If you aren't interested in storylines you might not find this as good just from a puzzle perspective. There's no combat at any point, either. It plays a little like Amnesia but somehow feels like Portal 2 in terms of the atmosphere. I haven't found nearly all the locations and ""secrets"" that are in the game yet, as I was driven to complete it and understand the full story. The story itself is something unique and interesting, not much can be said about it without giving too much away though. The controls all made sense and managing health/thirst/hunger/sleep seems daunting at first but is manageable once you realize where the game is going to put resources for you. The only bug I encountered was with the inventory. Sometimes the inventory would disappear when you move your mouse and you'd have to do this multiple times before you could actually switch items. You can use the keyboard to do this too, but in some situations time was of the essence. The only negative part of the game is the male protagonist's voice acting. It's just terrible all-around. The quality of the voice isn't the issue as much as his acting, which is disjointed and awkward sounding. The character speaks probably less than ten times throughout the game, giving short audio diaries to send home that you listen to, but each time given the circumstances he's in at the moment his attitude and demeanor is entirely inappropriate which draws from the immersion of the game. I'd say his acting is on par with a high school theater student. Even without a change to the script, replacing his lines with a more capable voice actor would carry the game a lot further in the long run. I'm not sure how the female voice is, but I will try that option for my next playthrough.			"

												Review is based on the non VR version of the game.I am fascinated by the end of the world topic / exploring a distant alien planet and this kind of ScFi adventure games as such. This game delivers it all in very good quality! I’ve been following its development since 2013 and now I have seen the end!The main objective is to reestablish the radio transmission / call out for help. But this isn’t as easy as it seems at first glance. You have to survive the extreme climate (tornadoes, storms, meteors, etc.) and the deadly/dark secrets buried beneath the surface of this hostile planet. This journey can be done with a female or male character. The world (vast!) setup: 5 islands, 10 levels, 60 locations, 118 secrets and 513 documents to discover, if desired.  So make sure that you complete all your objectives, to avoid additional backtracking. Gameplay: First person, main focus is clearly exploration, but with survival elements. (Look for shelter, food, water, etc.) Difficulty multiplayer 0-100% available, select between easy and hardcore mode. (…never seen this before in any game) The following character parameters can be influenced by “artifacts”: Health and Inventory limit, Movement & Resistances: Hypothermia, Heat stroke, Starvation, Dehydration and Falling. “Easy to go crafting; combine 2-3 items”. You can save your progress almost always, when you're sleeping.Graphics (Unreal Engine): Amazing day and night cycles. The very decent graphics, with great attention to detail, reflected in diversified level design fills the planet and its hazards with life. There are a lot of settings to adjust the details of graphics quality. (Presets, VSync, Field of view, etc.)  Sound: Realistic, well done quality of waves, thunderstorms, the howling of the wind, etc. There are very atmospheric, selectively placed elements of music.  Score:  The story and dense atmosphere kept me hooked from the very beginning till the bitter end…! Clear recommendation! 9/10			"

												Have a Vive and want a full game experience? Pick this up. Bought it for Vive and were frustrated by the controls? Update it and load it again - it's like a brand new game.FIrst for the people who tried it and walked away because of the ""In Prgoress"" controls. The 1.02 patch released today adds the ability to point a controller in the direction you want to go while free-looking. You can D-pad move or teleport, your choice, on the fly. And most importantly, the game interface now supports the Vive controllers. This was HUGE for me. No more clicking through your inventory one at a time. No more guessing which item will come up. No more crafting nightmares. No more trying to remember which button does what, because it's all look at the screen and direct select what you want. On top of that, your PDA is now functional by pressing the buttons with the other controller for the objective screen, sleep, status, and even zoom. This pretty much addresses every problem I had with gameplay, that turned exploration into a chore as I fumbled for light or tried to refill my canteen or get some shuteye. Instead of rushing through the game to finish, I now want to explore every nook and cranny and with this new control scheme I plan to do just that. So - if you bought SP for your Vive but quit because it made you want to stomp your controllers, update it, fire it up and give it another go. It's totally worth it (especially since you already bought it, right?)If you don't have it yet, the new VR additions make it a must buy VR experience. There aren't any other real adventure/exploration games out there yet. Bear in mind this isn't a shooter but more of a dungeon crawl. It's closer to Tomb Raider than Mass Effect. There's no combat, only traps and enemies to avoid, and an environment that's trying to kill you. But it's a way cool environment, with islands and caves to explore, ancient catacombs, some really interesting plants and animals and an interesting mystery that almost works until the end. But Solus Project put me on an alien planet. I can't think of higher praise for a VR title. I believed I was on another world with its own weather, climate, tides, etc. I wanted to explore, and by the end of the game as I started firguring out where things were and how things worked, my little base camp on top of a cliff started feeling like home.  Even with all of the issues I had with the ocontrols prior to this current version, I had to keep going. Just when I was getting tired of the beach, I found the caves. I got tired of seeing the caves, here come some ruins... And after the ruins? The game kept throwing new things at me right about the time I started thinking ""is this all there is to this game?"" Right now, I don't think there's another game that can touch it for absoulte immersion. As for the gameplay itself, like I said, think Tomb Raider over Mass Effect. The story moves along like a lot of other standard adventures with written and audio logs. What interaction you have with plot elements are all scripted but flow well. There's a survival element which is fun at first but can become a drag, though the longer you explore the stronger you can get and the less you have to do it (plus now you won't have to fight the lack of an inventory screen - made surivival a HUGE hassle.) There is also a minor horror element to it, more psychological than anything and there are some hugely effective moments as you start to think ""Did I just see that"" which later turn into ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I AM seeing this and it's kinda freaking me out..."" There are one or two jump scares as well, which if you're not careful will make you jump through a virtual door and run into your physical wall. This too, is high praise for a video game but no joke, I heard a noise behind me,  turned and saw something nasty charging me and tried to leap out of the way on reflex and smacked right into the wall in the real world. Again, high praise for making me forget I was in my living room.The game still has some flaws... IMO the story doesn't have a solid ending, it's possible to abuse room scale to get through locked doors, and there still aren't loading screens in VR which mean you see your VR lobby in between levels. Also, if you're not into exploration, this isn't the game for you because that's the hart of this game: wanting to see what's around the next corner. Solus Project delivers that in spades, and with this latest Vive patch it's finally a top tier VR experience.			"

												Finished the game just now. Plenty to do for the intrepid explorer. Nice creepy atmosphere with just the right amount of danger. Navigate large areas, keep cool, keep warm, sleep, eat and find fantastic scenery, motivating clues and a story that is actually interesting.Only downside was that the ending was predictable (and as such, I feel there should have been some sort of option for the player to change it).All in all, highly recommended for anyone with any interest in SciFi and/or survival-games.

												5/5 Stars, absolutely would recommend!This is a VR review of the game.Are there flaws with the VR? Yes. Could it have been done better? Yes. That said, this is still the single best experience so far for the HTC Vive I've played, approximately 40 or so games/experiences (Haven't played starseed yet).The Cons:-Movement can be worked on a bit as it's all over the place regarding which implementation your using. This could arguably be a good thing as well, as you have the opportunity for both normal locomotion and teleporting.-Inventory system is extremely weak and a bit frustrating clicking through until you get to the item you want.-You need a beefy PC. I'm running a 8 core extreme i7 and a 980ti and still had to turn down the settings. The resolution scale should be at 150% no matter what or its blurry but the game still looks fantastic. Disable AA as its making the experience worse.-VR controls not intuitive. If I have a torch, I should be able to light a candle by bringing the flame close. Little things like this break immersion but again this wasn't built ground up for VR.Now for the Pros:-Stunning atmosphere. The game feels amazing and I quickly forget where I actually am. The music, the scenery, the sound effects all work seamlessly to create an amazing experience.-Tension. The game is not a horror game, at least not up to where I am, but it has an amazing tension that is building as I play. No jump scares, but definitely a healthy presence of danger and threat. This is amplified by VR and is quite frankly amazing.-Mystery. This game does a brilliant job at showing you there's something going on but not telling you outright. Its a great balance between trying to find clues while exploring as you progress through the game. Many secrets to be found.-One of the biggest and most important pros are that the Devs are vocal in the community. They're on reddit taking feedback and using it to fix many of the issues we're seeing. The most recent update fixed many of these issues immediately.-Content. As far as the content goes, I would say that this game as 2-3 times as much content as the next highest game on the vive(excluding simulators). This is the first real roomscale game that you can take time to enjoy as you're playing through it and exploring. As great as vanishing realms is, this game has much more meat than just 2 hours!All in all, the pros vastly outweigh the cons and this is a game any vive owner should have. It's truly a shame that the work in progress feature they added (VR) caused it to have so many negative reviews when it clearly says its not ready and in an alpha state. Please note that while the VR is not finished and not perfect, this game MORE than deserves your time and money. If this were any other Vive game, the price should be over 100$ based on the content equivalent of similar Vive games, at 20$ this is an absolute STEAL.Please support the developers and write them a good review as this game is exceptional and the few people who cant read that VR is a work in progress, should not tarnish its reputation.5/5 Stars, absolutely would recommend!

												Holy sh** this game is captivating. All the negative reviews are from VR kids who don't like the VR implementation. If you don't care about VR, then there is no reason not to buy this. Absolutely worth the full $20.It's a survival game, but there are more things to be mindful of than in most survival games. Ways you can fail to survive include:--Starvation--Dehydration--Hypothermia--Overheating--Exhaustion (lack of sleep)--Physical damage to body (falling, etc)The game makes all of these even more challening by putting you on a planet with volatile temperature and weather conditions. One minute the temperature is below freezing so you have to huddle in a cave throwing sticks on a fire while waiting for the cold front to pass, then the next minute it's blistering hot so that you have to run from shade to shade to keep your body temp from rising too high. And of course you have to stay on top of food and water.Unlike other survival games, there is no farming---only gathering. And there is technically no storage, although you can still hoarde piles of things because the game will remember where you dropped them.Also unlike other survival games, there is a narrative and an overarching goal to this game. It's not just a game of seeing how long you can survive---you're also trying to scavenge materials from crash sites to build a satellite uplink. There are also huge caves and dungeons to explore (be sure to bring food, water, and light!)---not to mention loads of secret items as exploration rewards.If you like survival gameplay but also like exploring and having a definite end goal, then this game is worth every cent.I emphasize again that this review pertains to the regular, non-VR experience.*edit*Updating this review because it's also worth noting the following:--This is first and foremost an adventure/exploration game, but there are some survival elements as described above. HOWEVER. The game lets you tweak the survival settings to make them more intense or, if you prefer, make them completely negligible so you can focus on just the exploration (which is also fantastic!). So FYI if you like exploring but dislike survival.--By default the game uses the metric system. But if you were born in stubborn America, like me, then the game options can be tweaked to use Fahrenheit / ounces / miles / etc.--By default the protagonist is male, but you can switch to a female voice in options (mostly just your typical grunts and groans, but the protagonist DOES talk occasionally, so take your preference).*/edit*7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			"

The Solus Project - detailed reviewThe Solus Project is an adventure-type game, in which we have to survive on a human-unfriendly planet, where meteor rains and deadly tornadoes are common aspects of living. Our task is to communicate with the mother-ship, however the communication system is broken. As we try to fix it, it turns out that we aren't the first human-like creatures to live on that planet.Gameplay conceptThe game puts emphasis on storytelling and atmosphere. As developers mentioned, the game also consists of exploration and survival, but don't take these as major elements. Survival itself isn't demanding and player is guided where to go in order to continue. Unless we want to explore deeper, optional areas - to find out every secret hidden in the game - we won't have any problems.ProsMusicBeautiful, ambient music composed by Jonas Kjellberg accompanies us through the entire journey. It changes depending on where we are, what we are doing and whether we are in danger or not. I have to admit that without so magnificent music this game would be much worse experience.Graphics & visual performanceCongratulations to developers! Smoothly rendered and good quality graphics are hard to achieve, but here it couldn't have been done better. I haven't experienced any lag issues so far and had all the chunks loaded before entering a certain location - perfect!StoryRich in secrets, complex environment pays off for rather linear story with no side-quests. There are plenty of references to famous alien-like movies, books, etc., but I won't mention them here (find them!). Story idea itself is quite genuine and well told. It also does contain some horror-like elements, which, together with magnificent music mentioned above, creep you out very well. Great!ConsPoor fauna/floraWhile locations like alien structures or caves are really detailed and diverse, flora and fauna could be much more improved. It simply lacks variety, even for the planet with surface created of rocks. Why not add bird-like creatures, if we already can hear them in the game, some fish living in the ocean or stone-like plants chilling at the beach - huge field to fill the game with details, yet not used for anything.SurvivalUnlimited torch fire. Unlimited water source in every cave. Unlimited food and water every checkpoint. Multiple full food/water recovery snacks found everywhere. Plenty of rockets filled with resources dropping from mother-ship. Come on guys, how is it survival? Even while exploring some deeper areas never was I even close to dying from thirst or hunger. And that's almost the harderst difficulty level. In addtion, nearly all puzzles could be solved in seconds and multiple traps found both in caves and alien buildings definitely couldn't be described as ""deadly”. I actually used the fire ones to warm myself in cold areas. Smart, isn't it?OverallTo conclude, The Solus project is a beautiful, astonishing game. Its main strengths are story and atmosphere, yet it lacks diversity in planet nature and survival aspects. Strongly recommended for every adventure seeking person! Score: 8/10 "

												You wake up to a foreign sky. The moment you step out you are greeted by a meteor rain or a closing tornado. You turn around and you see an ominous planet just over the horizon. Welcome to Gliese, the mysterious planet on which the Solus Project takes place.The game is described as an advanced environmental survival-exploration game with very mild horror elements. And it's just that. You walk/run around looking for clues to what happened to the other ships from the expedition trying to survive as the planet isn't very friendly – the weather changes from heat to chill, heavy rains, meteor showers, tornadoes may occur instantly and you better run for cover. There are a lot of documents, diaries, photos scattered around and by reading them the player starts learning about the Solus Project and what caused it.At its core the game is a walking simulator, there are very few hostile creatures and your main concern should be looking for food and water and surviving the climate changes, you have no firearms just a teleporting device. And here is where the main problem lies IMO. Most of the time you have to babysit the survivor. Especially annoying is that he gets tired and needs to sleep every 10-15min even after sleeping for 8hrs on a mattress and a pillow. You start exploring an area, tornado/meteors/heavy rains interrupt your exploration, you have to look for cover and wait for the weather to stabilize. Finally you go exploring again and just after a few steps you hear “Operator tired, sleep advised”. You can choose to ignore it but the suit AI won't stop repeating it every 60sec. Or “Operator wet and cold, temperature dropping”. OMG, is the “operator” a trained interstellar explorer or just a boyscout-wanna-be? Aside from that, The Solus Project is a nice exploration game. It has good graphics, interesting story, no bugs or any other setbacks. If you are into stories, exploration, loneliness – this game is for you.			"

												The Solus Project is too simplistic to be a survival game, too easy to be an old-school adventure game, and too linear and dull to be an exploration game. Survival elements in the game are so dumbed down, they're pointless. Your character doesn't starve or dehydrate as quickly as actual survival games and you have easy access to unlimited food and water at frequent resting spots throughout the game, and other food/water items are easy enough to find anyways. Crafting is extremely limited, with too few items and combinations. Surviving the planet's climate extremes is marginally better, but you spend the majority of the game underground in low temperatures, and you get access to a heating ball fairly early on that renders most of the surviving parts irrelevant. The game's attempt at 'puzzles' is laughably poor. They are either (1) find key to stick in lock/device, (2) put rocks on pressure plates to open door, (3) step on/operate mechanism to select clearly-marked symbol, and if we're being really generous, (4) press button to open door. None of these would ever count as real puzzles in any other game, but this is the best The Solus Project can do. Clearly, this was meant to be the spiritual successor to developer's previous game The Ball only because it involves giant metal spheres as plot devices. And finally, the exploration is limited. You start on a very small island with terrain that, while not completely impassable, locks you into only a handful of paths, most of which just lead you to the single cave/ladder entrance to the island's underground. From there it's a single underground path to travel through, hitting the occasional large space that, again, has a single entrance and single exit, any number of the previously-mentioned non-puzzles, and then you hit the loading screen that takes you to the next island, where you do it all over again. In theory, you can try and wander everywhere to find the secrets the game keeps count of. You could just pull out the teleporter and squeeze yourself into every nook and cranny, or start jumping around the rocks to get places, but what's the point? The secrets you find are items that boost your survival stats, but the survival gameplay as described earlier is completely pointless. And it's not like the setting and story are interesting enough to explore, either. You're basically just walking through the same-old tunnels to find just different varieties of underground temples with different collections of skeletons inside. You figure there would be an interesting story to them, but The Solus Project also falls apart here. The game's only way of communicating is to make you read exposition from these giant stone tablets that your tricorder-like Wilson device translates for you. It's clunky and uninteresting, and you quickly get bored of stopping to read everything. Overall, The Solus Project is a terrible game. If you want a survival game, go buy a real survival game. If you want an adventure game, get one with actual puzzles. If you want something with an interesting world to explore, there are a ton of other options that aren't even open-world. Whatever it is you want, The Solus Project isn't it. Save your money and your time.			"

												This game was suggested for me by my Steam Queue, and by the trailer alone I knew this was my kind of game. Gladly I wasn’t wrong. I am a big sucker for Sci-fi stories, and very recently I have been finding out I’m a fan of survival games. This game is a delightful mix of both elements.I have to mention that the Story part is stronger than the survival one, but just one bit. This, however was no problem for me, since I enjoy a good story. And this game kept me on the edge of my seat while I was figuring out what happened in the planet I crashed into.Talking about the planet, the atmosphere of the game is amazing, climate is always changing and even when most of this changes are dangerous for you, are still a sight to behold. This is one of the things this game doesn’t lack, great visuals enhanced even more by a great use of soundtrack and sfx’s.Now, there is a horror-survival side of this game, however I wouldn’t call it much “horror” as it is creepy, which at least in my opinion, it’s 10 times better. Because the times you can get scared in this game does not rely on cheap jump-scares. But in its ability to keep you “uncomfortable” in an environment that you are not familiar with, and why would you? It is an alien planet after all! This element of the game intensifies as you get deeper into the dark caves and unveil secrets which I won’t spoil any further!--There is however, an issue that it’s worth mention for AMD Fx users such as me. Apparently there is a “hiccup” with this processor and the audio used for this engine (Unreal 4) which causes the game to freeze at some points when the game is loading. Which is obviously a minor inconvenience. That being said, I can testify the devs have been working hard to find out the source of this problem and facilitated a patch for us AMD fx users, which can easily be found in the discussion forums.-- Anyway, even with all that, I still recommend this game because you can tell how much work was put into it. One of my best gaming experiences in the latest years.And an even stronger recommendation if you are Sci-fi fan like me.Pros:- Engaging story- Great use of visuals, sound and music- Lots of secrets to discover- Big areas to wander around and exploreCons:- Audio glitches (for AMD Fx)- Survival can get a little too easy some of the times (For hardcore survival players)			"

 You're Earth's single hope! If the Solus Project would be like any other project you do for a class, then this would easily get an A+.Side Note | Important for some  The lack of registered hours on this game is because I had no choice but to play it offline. Lore  Humanity no longer has a home. Earth has been destroyed, and all that remains of it is on a nomadic fleet of ships searching for a place to rebuild their civilization. In The Solus Project, you take on the role of a surveying team charting an Earthlike planet that may just prove suitable for humanity’s resettlement. Disaster strikes suddenly and you find yourself marooned on the surface of Gliese. Armed with only the most basic knowledge of the dangers the planet holds, you must set out to solve the mystery of the destruction of your ship, and contact your fleet for rescue.You were sent to save the mankind.Who will save  you  now?GameplaySolus Project is a single player, first person survival game. Solus Project takes place in an alien alike prehistoric, colourful sci-fi setting. As stated about the sci-fi setting and all, The Solus Project could easily be mistaken for another sci-fi themed survival game. As soon as you start, you're greeted by your PDA which gives you basic information to get you going in the unknown, as well as some tips about survival.It might have the same mechanics as all survival games such as finding food and water, be careful with your character's temperature and get enough sleep. One of the differences here, and quite a big one, is the need to create buildings. The shelter itself is not permanent. You're a nomad. Why? Because the objective of this game, is to explore, explore and explore! But not generated lands! It's one, big planet full of rich alien foliage, mountains of impressive sizes giving quite a challenge for the player to reach their top. Upon doing so, the view is fantastic especially with the weather the developers have implemented that gives the game even more charm, I simply love the meteor showers with an undescribable feeling. Though the player must be careful as the temperature as well changes and gives more discomfort, giving more difficulty.The lack of mini-map gives as well an interesting feeling, since like in the old days, you're let with the single option, that one option being to draw your own maps with the explored areas.For the achievers, there is a multitude of secrets and hidden areas ready to be plundered, with quite a reward. More lore. Yet.. it's pretty short without exploring and fiddling around with every bit, you can complete it fast, in an hour or so. Don't fret! Part two is here so the hours have been extended. Have fun exploring, for the mankind! Graphics As stated above, the whole relief of this planet is not only the reward itself for exploring, but something mandatory as soon as you're in-game. It's quite stunning to see such a beautiful unknown, which makes you want more and more. The Unreal Engine 4 really pays off on this one, especially maxed all out, to let your eyes feast on every little detail. The color palette used for this game surprises me as well, a mix of orange and gray, with lots of blue, metal there and there which are the ambient's mains and it's delicious. Those are the mains, while the secondaries are the ones used for the foliage, items and so on. OST & SFX This game’s sound design is just superb. The soundtrack is incredibly atmospheric and memorable. The sound effects are incredibly satisfying. The music just adds so much energy and life to the world, as any good soundtrack should. It’s a great listen to while exploring caves and strange structures. Such a great one that I just stared at the scenery and let the time flow with the tune playing. Should you buy it? Overall, Solus Project is out of this world(pun intended)! In my honest opinion, it is a nice experience and take on the survival genre, which is focused more on exploration. If you'd like to experience something new with the same mechanisms, this is your cup of tea, worth the whole sip. Full price recommended.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group   "

YouTube™ Video: The Solus Project - Quick Game Review 

			Views: 1,072		

			The Solus Project is a first person sci-fi survival exploration adventure, developed by Teotl Studios, that’s a spiritual successor to The Ball. The game is available on both PC and for VR.		

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION! THIS IS A MIXED REVIEW!The Solus Project is a first person sci-fi survival exploration adventure, that’s a spiritual successor to The Ball. Now that the Earth has been destroyed, you are sent to an unexplored planet to investigate the surface, and see if it’s fit for humans. You are the last member of your crew, and the last hope for humanity’s survival. You must find a way to repair the communication tower and report back to what's left of humanity.Pros:intriguing story that gets even more interesting as you continue to explore the planet, and learn the truth (and even though there isn't any replay value as far as the main story goes, there are so many secrets to discover for those who love exploring)excellent graphics; everything from the planet’s surface and caves to the sky, storms, stars and nearby planets look absolutely fantasticthe voice acting is done very well, and it helps to convey the importance of the mission at handthe music, sound effects, and ambience work extremely well to create an atmospheric environmentvery immersive world throughout (I was sometimes be so focused in what's ahead, that I would walk into traps, and scare myself)exploration is satisfying - there are tons of secrets to find, and every one of them rewards you with a small permanent stat or resistance buff - it’s also nice that the game tells you how many secrets are left in an area when you’re about to leave itthere’s a lot of lore to be discovered as well, and those who learn more will have a better understanding of the story, and likely get the most enjoyment out of itthe survival aspects are manageable for the most part, and you are able to find enough food and water without much trouble; maintaining your body temperature to avoid hypothermia and heat stroke was a bit more challenging, and it often gives you a sense of urgency while exploring, but doesn't usually feel overwhelmingthe teleport movement, and room-scaling is implemented well for the HTC ViveCons:when it was dark, being in extremely hot and cold areas was annoying at times because the hot and cold orbs don't give off much light, and you'll have to change between items to see where you're going (you can hotkey some of the items you use regularly, but the heat orb is not one of them - some of the items with hotkeys available feel unnecessary, and I would have rather had the option of which items to assign keys to)inventory management gets tedious since space is fairly limited, and it’s not always clear what items you should keep (it might have been less annoying if you could keep walking while accessing the inventory)some people will be too sensitive to motion sickness to really enjoy the VR experience because there are many times where the camera shakes from earthquake or meteors (I used PC instead)I encountered an issue that caused me to be unable to finish the game* without completely starting over (partially my fault, but the game should have stopped me - a completely separate auto save point right before you pass the point of no return would have saved me)*I ran into an issue where I unknowingly skipped getting an orb that makes you cold, and continued playing the game not realizing. I then got into the final chapters of the game, and hit the point of no return. I was warned to be prepared, so I was stocked up on food and water, and figured I was good to go. However, I did not have this one specific item that keeps you from dying to heat stroke in intense heat; this item seemed to be required to finish the chapter, and I have no idea why the game allowed me to skip getting it in the first place. I admit that I am partially at fault for not having fully explored. After hitting this point of no return, I couldn’t find any way to go back, and I couldn’t finish the game without restarting completely.Conclusion:I played The Solus Project for 11 hours, but over an hour and a half of that was me being stuck trying to get through a part that was actually impossible for me. I was close to the end, and I never intended to go back and try to find more secrets, so despite my issue with not being able to finish the last part of the game, I still really enjoyed the game overall. I’m just glad that I was able to watch the ending, otherwise I would have been really mad. I'm sure there aren't many people who have come across a problem like this, but I still hope they fix this issue though, so that this can’t happen to others. It’s still a really good survival exploration game, with a lot of secrets to uncover, and I enjoyed playing almost all of it.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations here.You can also view this review on my website here.[www.azralynn.com] "

TLDR at the bottom - The Solus Project is an adventure exploration game that borrows some aspects from survival games. That said, while it is not by any means a survival game like the ones that’ve flooded Steam over the past few years, I think this is one of the few that delivers a true survival experience, even if it lacks in many aspects.Earth is doomed, and in an effort to save Humankind, the UN creates the Solus Project, a series of ships destined to search for a habitable planet for the top tier scientists to colonize. You are sent to Gliese, one of the most promissing planets, before the rest of the fleet in order to scout the surface and determine if it can sustain life. Unfortunately, after years of space travel you crash land upon arrival and soon find yourself stranded, all by yourself and in a constant fight for survival in an unknown and alien world. Welcome to the Solus Project.Right from the start the game introduces you to the light survival elements that it has, which consist mostly on barebones crafting and collecting items. You’ll have to keep an eye on your PDA for your calories and thirst meter as well as body temperature, wind velocity, condensation, ambient temperature, health and sleep deprivation meter. In order to keep these things in check, which for the most part of the game is an easy task, you have to eat, drink, sleep, avoid getting too cold or too hot in order to avoid hypothermia and heat strokes, which is most efficiently done by seeking shelter and sleeping there for a while. However, these are not your only threats, there are multiple natural phenomena that will come at random times and can kill you in an instant. These are particularly pretty well done and the first time I saw them I was blow away by the scale of these events. Despite the fact that this is at its core a very linear exploration based adventure game, there is plenty of optional and side stuff to do. Most of the narrative and background story is actually delivered via texts that you find and read through your PDA, but there is the ocasional voice dialogue where you record a message or you catch a glimpse of a transmission from the fleet that is out there waiting for you to report. For me these were some of the best parts, initially you can see that the operator that is transmiting is worried about you, but by the time you’re in the later stages of the game you can feel the terror in her voice, the idea that the Humanity could potentially become extinct if you don’t make it, you are the last hope of Humankind.This is what sells this game for me, being trapped in a beautiful alien and unknown world, struggling to survive, trying to keep on searching for a way out, witnessing marvels of nature of enormous magnitude, while very slowly starting to unravel some pretty grim and dark secrets beneath the planet surface. While the visuals do a pretty decent job, the sound design is way much better in fully immersing you into this world and the sountrack is pretty good as well. Some areas have this very dark and spooky atmosphere and there were a lot of times I was very tense on my chair, looking for small signs of light in the middle of dark caves.Final verdictDo I think that this is a perfect game? Absolutely not! But I strongly believe that this is a must play for anyone who likes dark and tense adventure games with an emphasis on exploration, or games with a great atmosphere filled with mystery, intrigue and a whole lot of sci-fi and doomsday scenarios. That said, I was kind of sad about how the game ended, it felt very anticlimatic, and explaining how and why that was would be spoiling you what was to me the joy of playing this wonderful little gem.Also, I mentioned that most of the background story and lore is delivered via texts that you find, this is entirely optional and I’m pretty sure I didn’t find a lot of them. Could I go back and explore everything in order to unlock every possible piece of text and secret? Absolutely, but I think in doing so it would ruin my experience, I rather leave things as they are, a result of a one time experience that I will always remember and I hope that so will you.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												This is a really impressive story game that presents you elements of survival, exploration and treasure-hunting.I really liked it, especially buying it at half price, I thought it was excellent value for money - at the sale price only. My reason for this is because it is a one-play linear game. As soon as I had completed it, my enjoyment there ended. Reading the text within the game, (the notes left by people there, or signs carved into walls etc), played a part in my enjoyment-for-money, so I recommend reading what you can, but it is not essential. I even made my own alphabet and was able to decypher the alien language, it really is accurate! (I even found a translation mistake on one of the slabs of text, but I was able to translate what it said myself, so that was rather fun in itself lol!)Even though the fun is over now for me, I will say that the game most likely requires a re-play because there are some very well-hidden secrets to be found! I would replay it for the completion factor I think.These secret treasures combine to 'upgrade' your survivability stats and are banked as soon as you obtain them. I would only replay the game to find all secrets for the completion factor, not for the upgrades, since I enjoyed the difficulty and challenge of the survival element. Oh and if you are a hard-case, you can make it hard, so don't worry about collecting the secret treasures.It pays to keep paying attention to your vital stats, featured on your hand-held device. You need to do whatever you need to to survive and that involves preventing numerous ways that you can die from happening. So make sure you box - clever. With this in mind, I will give you some helpful advice about what you are likely to encounter in the game;1) At the start of each area/level, you will encounter small 'worship shrines', 6 ft high pointed stones, standing in the ground (that are actually spelled 'woship' lol, but hey never mind). What these are telling you is how many artifacts, secret treasures, are to be found in that area/level, which is neat because that will be useful for the second play-through.2) Secondly, you will come across 'Cargo Manifest' crates, that list certain items of use, but the cargo box appears to be empty. What are they? Well, these are telling you what special items are to be found in that given area/level - much like the shrines that tell you about the hidden artifacts! (I had to google to find this out, since I found it confusing and didn't get it). This did not ruin the game, since I enjoy having to find things out for myself and not have my game played for me or my hand held. However, it may as well be given as advice to save time for those who just want to get on with the game.As you adventure along in this Alien world you come across different items that you can decide for yourself if you want them or not and yes.. there is no 'right or wrong'. You only need food, water and sleep to survive, so your inventory is yours for the making. I liked that.However, I'm not sure why some objects were there in the game, what role they actually played because for me, I didn't find much use for them. Nevertheless, this did not spoil the game at all for me, I enjoyed unravelling the mystery cave by cave, engraving by engraving and with every turning of a key, which unlocked more of the game as I played.I do recommend this game, as long as you don't mind not having any guns. Still.. you can always make a Hammer..			"

								Great game, enjoying it immensely. Especially impressive coming from such a small dev team.  The level designer (Sjoerd de Jong ) is a genius with UE4 unreal engine.  Just watch some of his tutorials on constructing the world of Gliese, very clever. The game focus is on exploring the island and the secrets it holds.  Yes, there’s some crafting and health management, but it’s not too intrusive (unless on higher difficulties) You can freely wander around, or follow the storyline, it’s up to you how you play the game. If you liked “the Martian” you'll like this.			"

												           This game is amazing. Just. Amazing. The next level atmosphere, the incredible story. Uncovering the history of this species just gave me thrills. It's a generaly long game, but I never felt like I was slaving away trying to do some sort of useless puzzle. No. In this game you are always doing something productive. It's like you can never get bored because every area is different. In short, I loved this game.            The only complaint I had was the ending. I feel like the game could've even gone on a little while longer.  The ending was very short. I just felt like it didn't fit with the rest of the game. But otherwise I loved it. I have never felt so involved in a game.10/10 worth every penny!			"

												In the end I am satisfied to have played it through but am also glad it is now over.  Not sure how to define but it took actual effort to keep playing.  I never found myself engaged to the game but played it through just to give it every chance to connect 'cuz I wanted to like it but never did.  Makes me wish there was a ""meh"" rating. Some mechanics are complex and well implemented, others are just there.  Has video slow down issues on a low-end system even with lowest settings.No combat.  Walking puzzle game with survival elements.  Navigate a guided path to piece together a story while collecting an array of fantastic tools.  Some of it is spooky.  Violent themes.Mostly twisting subterrainian exploration dependant on maintaining light sources and navigation without a gamemap but with navigation beacons.  Must also manage food and water supplies but there is a lot of it around so mostly just remember to pick it up when you see it then eat/drink if you get hungry/thirsty.  And there's avoiding the cold with fires and such.  And sleeping periodically in places where it's not cold.  You'll figure it out after it kills you a few times.			"

												The Solus Project is a game that is not perfect, but works well with what it is. Focused on basic survival around drinking water, managing heat/cold, and fighting hunger wrapped up in a linear narrative, this game is focused on a combination of seeking secrets while managing one's own failing condition. The game's narrative itself is the focus of the game, don't expect crafting to hold your interest. It's pretty basic at best and mostly used to limit your access to certain items. There's a reason why a lot of fear in the game comes from losing your torch. Though I'll say that it will be nothing compared to that one small section. I will say the ending is kind of weak, felt kind of like they weren't sure how to advance the story more. Otherwise, enjoyed almost every moment of this game.			"

												From the hour i played, ill be sticking with the game to the end. Echoes of myst and classic 90s exploration/dungeon crawlers are all over this game, with a sci fi theme. Also noticed a few easter eggs/ nods / connections to THE BALL, the devs previous game. If you are looking for a laid back, puzzle solving, exploration game this has got you covered. And if you want an insanely difficult survival experience at the same time theres a difficulty slider in the options for you, making eating, drinking, staying dry, not jumping off high cliffs, etc very important as you progress through the world. Something here for every type of gamer, from the explorer not wanting an overly difficult survival game (me) to the most hardcore masochist, its got you covered. Just dont let a twister kill you within the first 5 mins like it did to me :c			"

								Verdict: A Galactic success story.Before I describe to you, as to why the Solus Project is a phenomenal game, I must admit that I was at first dubious as to how immersive the gameplay would feel and how much replayibility it would have. Having played for almost 3 hours, I realise my concerns were unfounded and here is why:SimulationYou start the game marooned on an alien world but it has traces that an Egyptian type civilisation once inhabited this world. Hieroglyphics depicting gods being praised by their worshippers adorn the walls of the the subterranean underworld. Water drips down the stalagmites, its drops signifying health reguvenation is close at hand. Alien plant species strike from the shadows, breaking your visor and splattering it with blood. You will need a medkit or sleep to heal your wounds from this beautiful yet deadly ecosystem.VisualsThe game is near photorealistic in its depiction of life on this hostile planet. The sea glistens and undulates to the rhythem of the tide, a day and night cycle creates unimanginably gorgeous panoramic scenes, cave interiors beckon to be explored with their incredible colour palettes and glistening stones. Asteroid strikes light up the sky with trails of fire and smoke, striking nearby scarring the landscape with their tremendous force. Of all the games in my librabry, this is by far the most visually stunning game I own (80+ games with a GTX 980)Some screenshots:

AdventureWhilst this is no sandbox, the parametres to explore are wide and there is a deep sense of accomplishment when you discover a humanoid clutching a sword which can be used for a multitude of purposes. Kindling can be lit to ensure you keep warm after suffering from hypothermia, or shade can be used to reduce the impact of heat stroke. An advanced monitoring device held in your characters left hand indicates all your vital signs and even reminds you that you need to sleep!PerformanceThis game does not perform like an EA game. There is no stuttering, no erratic fps drops, no sudden crash. It runs silky smooth even during natural events such as  earthquakes, tornadoes etc. On my GTX 980 laptop I'm getting 50fps at 3k resolution.ValueFor just under £10 this game is an absolute steal! The production values are extremely high for such a modestly priced game. Bear in mind, during EA content is being released episodically until May (the release date).ConclusionIf you love the following themes buy this game: Atmospheric, survival, Simulation, Aliens, Galactic, Crafting, Exploration, Beautiful and ClassicEdit: Just completed the first part in 3.5 hours. It would have taken me 5-6 hours had I explored more rather than stick to the objective. Great value for money!			"

The survival is not as hardcore as other titles around, but it feels great with the right amount of tension and resource management to be something to always keep in mind while exploring the beautiful scenery.Very polished game, with an amazing sound design and atmosphere.I highly recomend it to fans of scifi and exploration.

												The best experience I have had in VR so far, this game has taken me to places no other VR game has so far. Some may find it slow but I enjoy that in a single player game. It's mainly about survival and gives you missions to complete to help you survive. There are little bits of story all around you to discover and if you take your time it builds up a great back story.This game has sold me completely on VR and what In depth games can be when some longer and more story driven games are released for VR. Some of the stunning VR moments for me have been.Watching meteorites crash all around me Shining a light into the water and seeing depth to it like never beforeExploring deep within caves and looking up to see the the high cavern ceilings with my torch light flickering of itGoing under the ocean and feeling like I'm under the ocean.Watching the massive moons move across the sky.Standing in a torrential down pour and almost feeling it hitting me.I know pretty mundane stuff but it all adds up to making the game more realistic than anything else I have played up to now. Just the fact that when I'm playing I really feel like I'm on a distant planet.Anyway if you have VR and enjoy story driven survival games on distant planets then def give this a go. Also if you have a large fan make sure you have it going on you when you're playing as it really adds to the immersion.  "

Good Exploration Game with a StoryThe Solus Project is a good exploration game with a touch of survival threaded together by an interesting story. I played entirely in 2D (no VR) and it never felt like a tech demo. I played almost a full 40 hours before reaching the end. I could have gone longer if I explored more, but I felt like it was a good time to end.Do's and Don'tsDo expect to deal with varying degrees of threatening environmentsDon't expect any combat; you can't even swat a flyDo expect to search for food and water and safe places to sleepDon't expect a lot of crafting; the recipes are mostly just combining two itemsDo play with the game audio on. The audio is cool and audio cues are extremely helpful.Things that could be ImprovedYou can only hold one thing at a time which is annoying when you need one item for your environment (e.g. a light or temperature control item) and another to do an action Some of the areas with extremely high and extremely low temperatures are more of a pain than a survival mechanic. Towards the end, even with the best possible items, there were times I had to drop a bunch of items to create a ""temperature offset zone"" just so I could bring my body temperate up/down.You can only hold items in your right hand. Generally this doesn't matter, but when going for high precision shots with the Teleporter, you can get ""locked out"" of a shot that would be possible with your left hand.To get the max distance on the Teleporter, you have to jump. Since you can only hold the Teleporter and nothing else, this just delays how long it takes to get a good shot. Plus, it just feels stupid.Sprinting is interrupted by jumping or short steps down. So long as you hold down the sprint button, you should be sprinting regardless of your other actions or terrain.There's a bit too much crouching required. It's painfully slow and despite the reality that dank caves would require a lot of crouching, it just slows down the exploration.The stuttering of walking up stairs is far slower than walking up the railing beside it. I understand that's more realistic, but I shouldn't hate stairs and constantly seek out a railing to move around the game world.There were very few glitches and they were minor or brief. A short period of no rain sounds while standing in rain or a little terrain flicker in a corner. It's a solid game that has a lot to offer, especially for the price. I think it's worth full price, but if you find it on sale, it's a must buy.			"

												HTC Vive VR review.Wow. I'm only (!) 3 hours into it-- and it's so awesome thus far. Beautiful, immersive, with so much tension. These kind of games/experiences are exactly what we need in VR. Can't recommend this enough.It says VR is experimental, but it's one of the most polished VR experiences yet.			"

												I love this game on the Vive. It's probably my favourite experience on the device so far, after having bought about 50 games. And that from a game with VR support added after the game was mostly done. That of course has its limitations. The inventory is cumbersome (but l understand the devs are working on it), and the controls aren't always logical. You have to push a button to interact with things (that is probably hard to fix as the game is designed around a controller). But you can use your hands independently, light your way with the torch etc. and move about freely. The default locomotion will be tough for some, but with a little tinkering you can adjust the walk speed, and even make the in game clock slower so you have more time to explore the incredible looking locations.  You even get a teleportation gun you can use for moving around if your VR legs isn't good (I haven't used it much though as I find the default locomotion very nice, but I've had some time to train my VR legs). It can be quite scary in VR, with an eary atmosphere, and I have more than once had chills go down my spine.And the story so far is really good, keeps me pushing on. This game is fantastic! The VR implementation is an example for other devs to follow, and its improving with every update. Thank you devs for giving me this amazing experience in VR!			"

												This is a VR Review.I bought this game due to it's roomscale VR and motion control support, and long gameplay time.This game has a lot to it, however, I didn't realize this was a survival horror game. Or at least from how far I am in it, I think it is. I believe this is supposed to be a survival game, but even the smallest creatures in VR as so surprisingly scary. Everything in it is so scary because it's VR.The controls for roomscale are still being hashed out, but in general they aren't bad. I'd say I have more of an advantage compared to those in seated experiences due to the teleportation mechanic. However, this is not a reason to stray away from this game.If you're considering buying this game for VR, I'd say this is a full game, which is something not seen often for the early stages of VR. I recommend this game for that reason. The controls being a work in progress show that they wanted this in players hands as soon as possible.I don't think I'll find the courage to finish this game. However, I do applaud the content and presentation.			"

												As a sci-fi adventure it's pretty good, if you like to put down your blaster and do a spot of exploring and follow the slightly predictable story.  Great enviromentl effects, looks nice, plays decent, and certainly worth the entry price, though if your the trigger happy need action all the time player, this game is not for you, but if you have a good sense of imagination and are happy to open yourself up to story and atmosphere above pew pew, you'll enjoy it.But try in in VR and holy f*%k, it is staggering, it literally dumps you on this alien world and the feeling of presence is amazing.  Your brain reacts to this in a totally different way than playing on a monitor, it ceases to be a game and becomes an experience, a personal adventure and the first game to illicit genuine feelings of fear and dread about my own survival, it's a remarkable acheivement for an Indie developer, it feels like a AAA title, yes it still has a few bugs, and needs a fair bit of polish and optimising, but please, continue to push the VR support devs, you are SO close to making this a poster game for VR's future.  If you have a VR headset, stop reading this and go buy it, it's un-missable, if you don't have a VR headset, this game is absolutly worth getting one for, it's nice wthout it, but I can't express the effect VR has on this game over playing on a monitor, it's a genuine taste of the future.  Support this developer in either case, for the little cash they are charging, from a VR point of view, this game is definate value for money if you like creepy, isolated, using your brain for once, trapped on an alien world that wouldn't look out of place on ""Star Trek"" but at the same time, giving you a sort of stranded colonist in an ""Alien Covenant"" creepy what the hell happened on this planet sort of way chills, you'll lap up this experience.Not for those with a short attention span / don't like puzzling out things, or need to be blasting aliens to be happy.For those who enjoy mystery games, can inject a little of their own imagination by thinking what they would do in this situation (especially in VR), recommended.

												[Played on HTC Vive]This is my favourite VR game to date and the one I have got the most value out of. Playing this in VR meant I actually feel like I explored the alien world and not just viewed it through a monitor.The VR support is very good, but not perfect so please see my tips before playing:Turn resolution up to 150%Turn shadows to low and AA to offUse teleporter when navigating up stairsEnjoy!

												Absolutely loved this game and the whole story of it. Immersive with just the right amount of creepy scenarios, monsters and puzzles. Beautiful graphics and it´s nice to get to play a complete game on Vive for a change instead of early access beta ones. If there´s anything the devs could improve on, it would be the inventory system. It can be irritating at times when you scroll past an item and you have to do another circle of scrolling before the item comes up again.			"

Early Access Review
								Now the release is on 7 june, i can say this, its a real gem.You play as an astronaut who\'s vessel crash\'s on a unknown planet, and you have to find your crew and survive.The gameplay feels great and there are always new stuff to craft, places to explore, even if the game is somewhat driven it still feels open enough.The graphics are splendid, unreal engine 4 is used really good here, the designer has lots of talent for creating a world in space you really immerse yourself. So basically you can do big playthroughs in this game cause it\'s really not boring, always new stuff happening and yea, immsersive as.I\'d give it a 9/10			"

												Review written as of 11/2-16.Played the ""normal"", non-VR version of the game. It took me 13h to finish.I will divide the review into multiple sections, I had to rewrite everything because I hit the review character limit before. The lists below are just points worth noting in my eyes and they describe both good and the bad parts of the game.Let's start.The Solus Project follows a space ship colony sent by humanity after destruction on Earth in hopes of finding a new home planet for our species. After reaching the probable new home the colony ship gets shot down from the surface of the planet and you crash land on it. After getting into grips with your situation you discover ancient buildings and architecture while trying to establish contact with the remainder of humanity who are still waiting for the update from the mission. However, things are not as simple as they seem and soon you learn of the past interactions between other species who have previously visited and inhabited this planet, for better or the worse.Uncovering all of the truth is not easy, you will be put through many tests with cult and religious like background, all mixed together with an unsettling and often sad atmosphere surrounding it.- Graphics -Looks good from afar, worse up close due to lower res textures.No AA options but you can super sample (Resolution scale option is available if you wish).Says you can edit advanced graphical options in .cfg files instead of having them in the menu itself.Good art direction, makes it a coherent whole.Decent looking effects, they are quite varied (weather etc).Weather is not global, it's localized around the player (hide under a roof and rain disappears from the whole world).Has baffling performance issues in certain areas, runs super smooth otherwise. - Sound -Very atmospheric, good quality.Own footstep sounds can be misleading, has weird coordination issues (at least in my case).Spot on ambient, music and effect sounds.Good voice acting, nothing bad or outstanding, it's all around solid and nice to listen to.Can specify between male or female character sounds and dialogue voice. - Gameplay -Heavy on story telling and atmosphere, explores the ancient aliens and exploration themes.No weapons, running from the dangers in required in order to beat the game.No map, you can leave beacons behind to mark important places.The planet itself is your enemy, you need to protect yourself from the elements.First person exploration with optional survival elements.Features a somewhat realistically driven weather system, caves flood with water depending on the sea level due to the moon phase etc..Includes a lot of easy puzzles of basically every kind like environmental ones, basic logic ones and so on.Badly designed interaction and inventory systems. Wastes your time, fit for consoles but not for a PC keyboard and mouse usage. Interactions have a pointless timer on them (think No Man's Sky inventory where you have to hold a button to do anything minor) and it carries over to your teleportation device. - Level Design -5 different islands, all interconnected together with a complex cavern system.Islands and caverns are all behind loading screens, it's not one world in that sense.Gorgeous buildings, architecture and story telling by the environment.The sense of scale is astounding when it comes to buildings and locationsThere is a lot of variety between different areas and they are easily identifiable (except the caverns especially if you are out of light sources :3)Has a megaton of secrets and hidden areas everywhere. I've stumbled upon secrets inside of secrets... it's craaaazy. Overall if you are into exploration games that are linear with good and engaging story I would recommend this game. To make things even more interesting try out the predecessor to this game, it's called “The Ball”.Once you have played “The Ball” some of the things will make more sense and/or be more interesting in “The Solus Project”.Good job devs, hope I can see some DLC/sequel(s) in the future with improved mechanics.Recommended!

												Non-VR reviewThe Solus Project is one of those indie creations to get excited about. It’s a very good game, but is it a perfect game? Of course not! It’s got a few weird things going on: a couple graphical issues and seemingly endless references to other intellectual properties (borrows much from TV show Lost in particular). Readers, I know what you’re thinking: So what, another indie studio created another indie game blah blah blah why should I care? Readers, I already told you the answer to that: it’s a very good game! Weren’t you listening!? Think: a crispy Lost pie crust with the disappointing conclusion trimmed off (Season 6, I’m looking at you) and fill that with Interstellar custard cream, but now scrape the oily Matt Damon meringue off the top and then sprinkle with a couple teaspoons of crushed Ancient Aliens. Ahhhh, pure heaven I tell ya!Okay, so there’s no black hole or time travel in TSP, but it captures that “Interstellar” vibe nonetheless. More than once, I found myself overlooking an alien tropical beach paradise at the precipice of a craggy drop off and wanting pump both fists into the air and yell, “I’M THE MATTHEW MCCONAU♥♥♥♥ OF THE WORLD!!!” I didn’t though. My wife isn’t into videogames. Such spontaneous outbursts would be frowned upon and followed up by punishment nagging to do irrelevant tasks. Yeah, fetching that glass of water for you and then that bowl of kale chips for you and then turning off that hallway light so you could watch Gilmore Girls without the glare sure showed me for enjoying something without you. Lesson learned.Ahem, moving on readers, this is simulated walking at its finest. That statement is coming from me: a gamer who loathes Dear Esther et al. I feel like TSP goes the extra mile to stand apart in its genre, so much so that “Exploration Simulator” would be a more accurate description of TSP’s gameplay.Exploration of the unknown carries the risk of fatal failure. If history is a guide, then it has shown us that the cost of expeditions to parts unknown is paid not only in coin, but often in blood as well. Elon Musk knows this when he asks “are you prepared to die” on a journey to Mars? In a game that tries to put explorers on Gliese-6143-C, a fictional planet orbiting another star, you can bank on people dying in it. Spoiler alert: they do!Exploration of the treacherous unknown is all well and good. Eventually though, the unknown becomes the known, the traps and pitfalls mapped and accounted for, yada yada yada fartnoise. That’s a problem when the main hook is exploring; before long, the soul-sucking boredom of the type found in standard walking simulators can seep in. Worry not readers, for the agile TSP parries the creeping tectonic blow of boredom with a quick megathrust of excellent pacing. You are encouraged onward via objectives at a rate slow enough to let you take in the sights of the superbly crafted islands and caves, while fast enough to keep the flow moving forward. If you linger, it’s at your choosing and likely because you are trying to find the secret areas, you elite completionist, you.In that sense, despite the open world that allows backtracking and travel between areas at will, TSP is a linear game with a defined beginning, middle and end. This structure keeps things fresh hour after hour, much like those packets of silica beads found in packaged products (you know, the ones that say “DO NOT EAT”? I really should start listening to those warnings). However, I did experience some game fatigue, but that was after 35 friggin’ hours in a 16 hour game, so yeah my fault mostly. Fortunately, getting back into the plot progression quickly reengaged my interest.The plot is solid in TSP. It is a chunky mishmash of other sources but it injects originality into the mix. In the 22nd century, a rogue star has destroyed Earth and torn asunder most of the solar system; a cataclysm that has stranded the survivors with dwindling supplies on ark ships near Pluto. Before they can burn fuel reserves needed to leave the shattered remnants of the Sol System behind, they must desperately await the “all clear to colonize” signal from any of the scout vessels sent to promising exoplanets. Wow, that’s just the backstory.I’m on a scout ship lightyears away, which suddenly turns into a roman space candle while entering orbit around an exoplanet. All of my crewmates appear to die in the explosion. That’s okay though, I could use a little alone time after spending 8 years pent up with them inside that relativistic sardine can. So there I am, crash landed and alone, and loving it!All kidding aside, the atmosphere from then on is tragically hopeful as I realize I can still succeed in my scout mission if I collect enough scrapped spaceship parts to build a transmitter. I cling to that shard of positive thinking, which the plotline sinisterly whittles away at as if it were carving a marshmallow roasting stick. I soon felt that at some point I would be plunged into the fire. The survival of mankind hinged on my ability to overcome creeping hopelessness. This is a story that I thoroughly enjoyed, and I found the emotionally charged conclusion to it very satisfying.This is a story supported by strong visual and audio production. The graphics are excellent, with a couple of issues. There is a weird distortion effect sometimes seen on the edges of objects that are framed in the near background by water. Also, on my midrange system with the settings on Ultra, 1080p ran at 60fps+ but dropped inexplicably every couple of hours to 40ish until I entered a loading screen or restarted the game. Not a game breaker for me; it simply meant that I had to play a small percentage of the game below the ideal framerate. Besides, the audio steals the show here, readers.The sounds of Gliese-6143-C pull you into the fantasy. From the thematic background music to the immersive ambience, you can hear the love that Teotl put into this important aspect to gaming that is too often overlooked by other dev teams. My biggest complaint here is the voice acting. If your preferred language is English DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME AS THE MALE CHARACTER! The guy who voiced the male derped hard and cannot sell the story. Luckily, the woman who voiced the female protagonist did an incredible job capturing the emotion behind the script. I smiled her smiles, shivered her shivers, and cried her tears (they were crocodile tears, no wetness; manhood=restored). Play with the female voice enabled or don’t play it at all. Yeah it’s that important to the journey through TSP.To aid that journey, you scavenge supplies from ship wreckage and derelict alien settlements and craft various inventory and quest items. Scavenging is crucial, but this game mechanic is well implemented and avoids the tedious resource grind found in other open world survival games. For example, you don’t need to stock up excessively on food; you could live almost entirely off of the infinite alien food and water stations found around the levels. The devs took the infinite supplies idea a little too far, though. Alien technology explains infinite food stations, but the oily bark torches you craft that never burn out was a weird design decision. After you craft the first torch, there’s no need to make another one. Small gripe I know.That’s how well TSP is made; I’m nitpicking to find things I didn’t like. More nitpicking: the exploitable loophole where you can put a burning torch in the inventory “backpack” and submerge yourself in water, then get out and pull the still burning torch out of the backpack… then use it to help dry yourself off. Come on Teotl, that’s dumb. The torch system should be reworked for more realism. Again, nitpicking.TSP is a well-crafted adventure. A must play for sci-fi fans.TL;DR this game is a steal at $20. I got it for 10 and I’ve been indicted for internet piracy.			"

												HTC Vive VR Review A menu that wouldn't let me select anything at first (needed to alt tab on my PC), an hour of  figuring out the controls, settings and movements, clunky Vive controls ...None of these things detracted from this being my favourite VR experience yet!This game works best once you've got used to artifical locomotion (I used to get really really sick, now not at all). It has a teleport system in it, but it's not quite as smooth as the Lab, and I personally find teleport breaks the immersion.Last night, I crash landed on an alien planet, where there was lushous grass and rock pillars and I was really there, warming my frozen hands on the engine of my broken rocket, watching shooting stars fly past the moons in the sky. Searching around for food, I sat down to eat, and watched as light slowly creeped into the alien world as a new day broke. I survived my first day!This all felt very very real.This is clearly a beta VR experience, but the world fits VR so well that it's clunkiness can almost be ignored. How this is so far down the VR recommend list is a mystery to me... But I can advise anyone wanting to play this to go and try some demos with artifical motion first, and see if you can get used to it. Took me at least a few weeks, maybe even a month. If you can though, it is well worth it for this experience alone! Worth the full price I paid for the game. Would pay €40 no probs for a game like this if the VR was just a little bit better implemented.EDIT: completed.Don't want to change my review as too many people have already read and liked it. Just a quick edit... 16 hours to complete, wow what an experience! The ending was pretty bad, expecially in VR, but the journey there was amazing! Such an adventure, and was exactly what I dreamed of playing in VR when I was a teenager. Give it a go!			"

												Back in the 1990's and early 2000's I was lucky enough to call the folks at Cyan (who made MYST and Riven) people I had met and discussed their games with directly, including sitting with Tim Larkin in his studio while he shared with me some of his techniques for making the music to URU. I wrote a 5 page review of MYST III:Exile that was published during E3 in that year with the help of Presto Studios (man, that was a long time ago, I'm an older gamer), so I love adventure games. I love FPS games too, don't get me wrong, but adventure games are really hard to do correctly. That is why, when one comes along that does it right, it can become far more engaging than even the best FPS for me. Solus is one of those games. Solus has an extremely engaging and simple inventory system that work to help both solve puzzles and keep you alive. The survivalist aspect of Solus is so well implemented, that simply trying to gauge the weather and atmospheric conditions consumed a full three days of my time at one point (which was entirely my choice since I figured it was probably important to understand if the weather was going to be my friend or not). There's more, of course, to Solus that simply that, but the point is that there are a lot of layers to Solus that reveal themselves only if you really push yourself. And if you get killed, you have only yourself to blame.The game has really good velocity, and never stagnates into a hunt-and-click. In fact, that somewhat annoying aspect of adventure games is completely missing in this game, much to my delight. Solus is really beautiful. OK, the skyscapes are in fact stunning. Watching the celestial mechanics can be entrancing in this game. I really feel like I'm on another world here. I almost want to go buy a VR headset just to see what that must be like. I'm sure it's really amazing. The rock textures and plant textures could be better, and the water effects also seem a bit thin even when all my settings pegged at ultra. But the balance they have struck between beauty and performance is so well acheived that this really is just a nit that I mention because I'm sure someone will pick it. :) The Solus Project implements survivalist adventure gaming in the most engaging and immersive way imaginable, with a storyline that I like because it's not overly complicated, is plausible, and it ends in a way that to me seemed very likely given what we are learning about the universe around us today. The game runs completely bug free for me, but I understanding the first release was not really that stable. I haven't experienced any problems at all. I love this game.			"

												I did not finish the game, yet. But I am on my way to do so. I am not a VR user, and my opinion is for non-VR potential purchaser.If you read this, you probably wonder if you should buy this game. TLDR : exploration + immersion + background story + PvE + next-gen graphics + very few bugs = this gamePros:If you like survival-oriented game, with some puzzles but mostly exploration, fantastic landscapes mounted by orbiting planets in the sky, powerful meteorologic events and being the last hope of humanity... You will dig into this game.If you want a 'pew pew' game with moar guns and ghillie suit... Forget it :D You are in the wrong place.This game is a combination of Myst + Alien Story + last-gen graphics + No bugs so far... It's an adventure you want to know, an adventure you want to live.Cons:Initially the games asks you to make a decision (what outfit you get) but this is the only decision you will ever make (or maybe not, but +50% done and this was the only one...).It has no RPG feature at all. No skill tree, no experience... Only secrets (stats booster) you find by exploring. I was hoping for more choices ala 'make a decision on what happened and live with it' but it never happened again. The fact there is no RPG element is not a downside, but letting you think there might be is a little bit when you look backward (or you just forget it and move towards that light source). In the end the path you take is the path everyone takes. I think once the game is finished you might not want to replay it. This is not FTL.Conclusion: 200% worth the price. My hat for the devs. Such a small dev team, but such a competent dev team. 6 of them can do what a team of 30 can never achieve. Good work!			"

												A VIVE USER PERSPECTIVE – A VR EXPERIENCE LIKE NO OTHERThe Solus Project is a prime example of what implementing VR to an existing, originally non-VR game can accomplish. The result is a supremely immersive, story-driven, athmospheric, and gorgeously beautiful exploration and survival sci-fi adventure, on a vast, mysterious alien planet. The game exemplarily captures the feeling and pace of arriving to and exploring a great unknown.I think VR (Vive room-scale) really makes the game. A couple of weeks back, before VR support, I watched a bit of a playthrough video on YouTube, and thought the game looked slow and boring. But once I heard the developers were adding Vive support, I had to try it, and haven't looked back since. I must say the Vive room-scale implementation really makes the game for me. It truly places you in the middle of a mysterious planet, exploring around, experiencing the story that is really well and immersively paced. It's quite amazing; a testament to what VR can do to a game, and surely a benchmark for the future. For me, what initially looked like a boring survival game on a 2D monitor is now an amazingly immersive sci-fi adventure that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who has the Vive and the least bit of interest in a good story. With The Solus Project, you'll get to experience one like never before.To add, the developers are still making adjustments and fixing bugs, making their VR support even better with future updates. Frankly, with the current price of 18,99€, getting this game should be a no-brainer, especially for a Vive owner. A++(This review was based on version 1.01, using the walk control scheme while playing standing up in a room-scale setup.)			"

Early Access Review
								First things, first, The Solus Project isn't just another survival game, its much more than that, its done what many other current FPS survival games haven't, had a narrative. You'll notice straight away that there is an intriguing storyline, which I won't go into much during this review due to spoilers (which ill try my best not to have), it's a game best played before watching any ""Lets Plays"" or any other gameplay spoiling videos. You should probably be avoiding this review, but here we are. I'll put the review into individual sections covering the games mechanics, due to the Early access nature and the already large amount of content already in the game, this review will be regularly updated as i explore the current features and any i have come across.The game features a robust weather system, with tides changes and water levels rising/lowering, snow falls and rainstorm occur which affects the temperature of the character, requiring you to find shelter and/or a source of heat.StoryI refuse to go into much detail for now (for your enjoyment) but will update in the future.GraphicsUtilizing the latest Unreal Engine 4 the game really benefits from having advanced graphics, I find I get a steady FPS on all setting at their highest, You can tweak additional settings in the configs files but i have'nt delved into them just yet (will update when i try them out).Textures are high quality, lighting effects and the general details in the levels are fantastic, spider webs hanging in caverns, colored lightingfrom crystals (some form of torches). I didn't like the fire effect on the default torch and you can't see the protagonists hands when holding most items but it is early access. SoundThe atmosphere in the environments really benefit from the high quality sound effects, from eerie sounds in caverns to the flames from a damaged ship engine.I was genuinely freaked out when I was exploring a dark cave and I could hear these strange noises echoing from deep within. Voice acting isn't fantastic butits pretty good, atleast to me.GeneralOverall I'm currently enjoying The Solus Project and its a huge step forward for the company since Unmechanical and a gigantic leap since ""The Ball"",I enjoyed The Ball but it hasn't aged well. The player can explore a ton of islands and solve puzzles. It's like Tomb Raider but an FPS on an alien planetin the future...with aliens..., Well it has Tombs in it. The tombs/caverns are extremely creepy as mentioned a few times during this review. I haven't come across any creatures yet (if any exist). I wouldn't recommend this to people that want a Call Of Duty shoot em up or want to murder everything that moves. I really like the variety in difficulty, from hardcore survival to an Easy mode for those of use that enjoy the game for story and exploration rather than the realistic survival aspect of hardcore mode. I've barely dented the surface of this great game and will update this review regularly as I play through more content and the game gets nearer to release. The developer is often updating and releasing new updates, Episode 2 was just released with tons of new content.Summary+ Fantastic Graphics+ Unique Environments+ Story+ Difficulty Settings+ Open Environments+ High quality sound+ Atmosphere+ Will Support VR + Eye tracking+ Frequently updated+ Weather EffectsNeutral+/- No character customization (doesn't necessarily need it)+/- Can't see players hands (personal preference, could be down to supporting VR mode)Negative- Inventory management could be better9/10			"

												One of those gems of a game that for some reason isn't adequately advertised. I have been playing it only a couple of hours and I am completely wrapped up in it. If you like, mystery, science fiction, semi survival mechanics and great story telling then Solus is for you. I cannot recommend it highly enough. For the price, you can't beat it. You will get more enjoyment out of the game than you paid for it. Its one of those games.I don't review games very often, even the great ones like Witcher 3 and Fallout 4,etc., haven't gotten written praise from me; so for me do one for Solus, tells you I consider it a rare, rare game indeed. End of my original review.My original review stands for the game up until the ending. Now that the game is complete; and I have finished all levels; I wish to add this note about the end: If they were setting up a continuation of the story with a sequel or just another spiritual successor to the game, then I have no problems with the ending. However, if there is no further games planned for this game, than I have to say the ending was for me a total let down. Furthermore, if I had run across any indication that the ending played out the way it did I probably would not have purchased the game. I have not purchased other games because the ending of those games was not to my personal liking. Video games on the whole are not art forms. Some video games aspire to be an art form while other are done so well they deserve a higher quaility of appreciation. This games has elements of that higher quality of appreciation. But that ending,  is not a moral of the story kind of ending. It is an ending that should be examined closer because the aliens are committing serious genocide and no matter how long its takes the aliens will get their comeuppance. The company may not wish to go that route. Fine. However, the game let me down with that cliche ending that there is evil in the universe and the like it or not everyone survives. Meh.			"

												I have played this on HTC Vive with a 980ti as graphics card.I think the game is incredibly good, I can't recommend it enough for playing in VR. Probably the best VR game that exists at this time. It is very immersive, great atmosphere, has good graphics, cool visual effects, an interesting plot. Once you get into it, it is difficult to stop playing. I havent had as much fun with a game in years. It is like playing the main character in a great scifi movie.Besides being a good game it is also quite cheap, well worth the money! "

								Really enjoying it! I made it to the end (where you get a notice for the next part not released yet), really loving the environment, sounds and music. I've had more first time ""woah!"" moments that I can recall, haven't had this much new/original/unique stuff like this in a long time. Searching for stuff is super fun, puzzles are mostly easy to figure out (except the big fish room, ugh). The hallways with the hazard dangling bits were frustrating. I was expecting to find a gas mask or bio suit, never found one, and I looked everywhere. Now that I've reached the end, I can go back and find all the other stuff I was missing. Can't wait to see how the story ends!			"

								The Solus Project is an exploration game (walking simulator) with great atmosphere and some survival elements. It's not an open world game with resources and crafting, the levels are linear and there is plenty of alien guacamole and water in the tombs, so you won't have to worry much about survival (except for when random tornado/meteor shower catches you on planet surface).But if you like story driven exploration games with mysteries, this one is the best looking atmospheric sci-fi ""the interstellar like"" experience you can get for 4 euros xD			"

								I want to stress this is not a bad game from what I played, just not for me. I read review after review and thought this game looked great. I love survival games and I love science fiction. The problem for me was the lack of information about the fact the game is very much a mystery/puzzle solving game. I spent the first 15 minutes outside checking stuff out, and ""surviving"". Then after you go into the second cave it becomes a whole new game. I spent the rest of my time walking around inside a dark cave. Tunnel after tunnel after tunnel. Pointless door after pointless door to open. Water everywhere, food too, temp in  caves are great too and no weather. Survival went out the window for cave diving and linear ""exploration""/puzzle solving. The caves I saw were hardly interesting either. Same thing everywhere I went. I decided I would rather get my money back and wait for the game to be finished and on sale. Maybe you love caves and puzzles... I do not though.			"

												The Solus Project is a hybrid adventure/survival game, successfully melding environmental exploration with managing the hazards an alien world. What begins as a fairly straightforward ""crashed on an alien planet, time to survive and find out what happened"" quickly evolves into a larger mystery uncovered through environmental storytelling and glyphs left around the environment.The game does a wonderfully job of making you feel like you're exploring an alien world; one that's familliar yet not quite right. The general atmosphere of the game is fairly benign, save for a stretch of time in the middle of the game where it shifts into more of a thriller/horror setting. It wasn't something I was expecting, which made it all the more unsettling (which I believe was the intended reaction).Puzzle solving is fairly intuitive and melds well with the exploration focus.  The survival elements never became overbearing. The storytelling was delivered well and I enjoyed piecing things together and constructing a fuller understanding of what happened to my ship and what exactly has happened on the world you're stranded on. The ending stumbles a little bit, of which your understanding of it will likely depend on how many pieces of lore you've uncovered and how well you've stitched it together in your head. I could see the ending making little to no sense for people who just main-line it straight through; finding ways to make some of the more important historical information central to the main progression would have smoothed over this issue.The game looks gorgeous with numerous times where I just stopped to take in the scenery. Unreal Engine 4 runs great and I experienced no crashes or bugs. I did not play in VR.All in all, The Solus Project is a great little game that will take you around 10-15 hours to beat and offers an interesting story, unique and compelling world, and plenty of pretties to make your eyeballs happy. Recommended.			"

								Solus, where to start. The direction of the game is a unique one. You are one of the last humans alive in the universe. You crash land on an alien beach (ARK) and have to use basic crafting supplies to survive (ARK). As you progress alien sounds and relics empower and guide your path to find a benevolent intelligence at work. The strengths of this game include a bizarre alien weather system, which makes survival interesting and unpredictable. One minute you're burning hot, the next you're freezing. You can retreat to various safe areas, which typically coincide with save points, but you will encounter a dark presence, which leaves you few options for a safe retreat. As survival games go, this one has puzzles that remind me strongly of any of the recent Metroid games. (I say recent, I think back to Gamecube and Nintendo 64) The puzzles require intelligence and planning. You will eventually have more locks than keys. Choose wisely! (spoiler)The textures (graphics) leave a little to be desired, but as you go you get swept up in the big picture. There are very few glitches (if any, I have encountered none) and many hours to be derived between searching for secrets, dodging the weather, hunting for aliens, and finding interesting new things to craft. This game gets 5/5 from me. Definitely recommended.			"

I have not found any major bugs, only 1 and that was due to my own stupidity by jumping into a tight space and being unable to escape.. i did this a few time to test it..I am at the end of act/ phase 3 and i am eagerly awaiting the ice caved(of death)...Saving the game can be harsh- literally if you are caught out in the open and it turns nasty(see above) as you can not save unless at a sleep point(usually a safe place) or a save point. Other than that, and you will have to keep an eye on the elements when out walking, climbing and swimming... Eyes on the skies people!If you like wandering about(there is a LOT of this) hunting for items, secrets(found a few of them) as well as key components for crafting stuff, and other ""keys"" to open doors / solve puzzles this will be right up your street.I took a punt on it, and .. i`ve become pretty well hooked! I have had a great time playing and dying to this game, as survival games are not really my thing, but this game is great fun,and makes you think as you get very little instructions on what to do and where to find stuff... So what are you waiting for- get it while it is cheap			"

												I am really sad to give this game a thumbs down, I had very high hopes for it because I found the idea of a non-violent planet exploring game where you fight the elements interesting, unfortunatly, it's not that fun. Not a whole lot is happening, you do a lot of walking to find stuff and combine stuff, and that's about it, that's the gameplay. You gotta keep dry, warm, drink, eat and sleep, that's great, but apart from that, you just walk, find things and combine them. This is the problem with a no-combat game, you have to substitute the combat with something else or you end up standing next to a campfire doing nothing and waiting to get dry.Tl;dr: It's boring. Yes, I knew from the start that it's 'one of those games' but I don't like it. I find it neither challenging, nor engaging.Also, I got stuck in a dark cave that I didn't know had water in it, I lost my torch and couldn't teleport out, which was very annoying. This pretty much rekt my playthrough and I had to decide then and there if I want to continue or else I couldn't get a refund if I started all over again. I decided no.			"

												Not many people mention it but this is partly a horror game. However it doesn't make you leave your chair it sucks you in. The story is quite rich. You don't get cut scenes that explain the story, you figure out the story by interacting which I quite enjoyed (oh and you need to make sure there is nothing behind you while you're reading the walls and such). You spend a lot of time in the caves that connect every islands, it scares you bad enough that you want to see the sunlight, but when you do get back to surface you realize that nature hates you and you're better off in the caves. Overall this is a pretty good game with some very minor flaws, which I think are unimportant. Definitely worth every coin spent on it.			"

												I've been enjoying this game since launch. Initially there were a lot of issues around controlling the game in VR and it was not in a state I would recommend. After several updates the game has been cleaned up a lot and controlling the game in VR is now a lot better. On the Vive it still plays like gamepad controls have been mapped to the motion controllers with the controllers acting more as a cursor, and you still have to press buttons to have held objects interact with anything, rather than using physical interactions. But overall it is still a good experience and mostly intuitive. The game is a single player campaign in an open world, with a set of linear objectives. There is a mystery to unearth on this alien world, and all the while you need to survive. The world itself is believable and well designed, and both artistically and technically gorgeous. The meat of the gameplay is in exploration of its world and occasional puzzles, which usually revolve around using an item you found on something. The game is heavily reminiscent of adventure games such as Riven or The Dig, in its world, atmosphere and game mechanics. There are also survival elements such as having to deal with hunger, thirst, hypo/hyperthermia and sleep, but these didn't really add much to the gameplay. There is a slider to tune them down to a minimum if you find them too difficult or annoying. I have not yet finished the campaign and am about six hours in. I'll update this once I'm finished but for now I feel I can already recommend the game, particularly for VR users looking for a campaign with a good amount of content for the price. Right now, particularly for the Vive there is a lack of long form content and this certainly fulfills that role nicely. When you also look at the game's price this is probably the best game from a content point of view - you can easily pay double what the developer is asking for other VR games that will end up with half the playtime.

			#thesolusproject http://store.steampowered.com/app/313630 Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ + One of the best most immersive exploration games I have ever played....		

+ One of the best most immersive exploration games I have ever played.... The game keeps pushing you forward with so much mystery you can't help but think ""what comes next?!"" At times I felt like stopping, and then a new area would open up or some event would take place that would force me to continue onward. + The amount of content in this game is unbelievable. You will think you are getting close to the end but it just keeps going. You will likely spend over 8-10hours+ to get to the end.+ The planet you explore is HUGE with a variety of very atmospheric environments with a metric ton of space to explore. Many miles of islands, caves, and tombs to wonder through. You truly do feel like you are on an alien planet.+ The story is pretty epic, especially if you manage to get through the entire game. In the most basic terms, you crash land on a alien planet, and must find if it's hospitable enough for humans to live on after Earth is destroyed. What you find....is pretty alarming.+ Graphically speaking the game looks gorgeous. I was playing at max settings at 1440p, and loved every minute of it. + The survival elements are ""light"" meaning that you won't be wasting too much time going out finding food or water. The game typically provides a lot of water / food sources. (TIP: DO NOT LOSE YOUR TORCH)+ So many alternate paths, and places to discover. It almost felt like there wasn't anywhere you could not reach, and there is useful items, artifacts, and lore hidden everywhere!- Some of the puzzles can be a bit overly challenging which can be a bit irrating. At some point through the game I was just like ""Ughhhh I have to find more keys?! Just let me continue through the game!"" - The game doesn't provide you with a good sense of direction or purpose. You will feel lost, confused, and alone throughout most of the game. I was constantly thinking ""what am i doing? where am I going? What am I supposed to be doing? Am I even going the right way"" as the rabbit hole kept going deeper and deeper and deeper.This game is better than most AAA games, you won't be disappointed, and has earned a spot in my favorites			"

												I have never played anything like this before but I really like this game. The graphics are fantastic, especially the sky box. Sounds and in-game information are scarce, but this can be seen as part of the desperate situation the protagonist finds himself in. The puzzles are more on the easy side and the bigger challenge is to find out what to do next, which is not always obvious. The story is decent and keeps you going if you let immerse yourself into the game but the end was a little underwhelming. Nonetheless, the 23 hours I played this game were well spend!			"

The Solus Project - What A Great Experience!You find yourself in orbit of a newly discovered planet in an attempt to rescue humanity from extinction back home on Earth. Suddenly your mothership is engaged by an unknown entity, forcing your immidiate emergency descent to the surface of Gliese-6143-C. Things are not what they seem at first. Your are confronted with servere weather conditions, harsh climate and only a few basic things to help you survive. Sleep, hunger, thirst, temperature and body wetness play a fundamental role in the game and it is up to you to learn how these parameters are affected. No one is holding your hand here. Throughout the game you come across texts and inscriptions. Sometimes segments of text refer to ancient history known to humans on Earth today. Is there perhaps a connection between our civilization and that of Gliese-6143-C? In other places you might come across inscriptions seemingly belonging to a complete different entity. Who were these former planetary settlers?The Solus Project (TSP) has a consistent storyline but also a lot of variation as you encounter different environments from blazing cold to heat only comparable with that of Hell itself. As you will learn there are clever ways to comply with these extreme conditions during the game. As a sci-fi fan myself I really appreciate the way the devs have used their ingenuity throughout TSP. You will almost surely become immersed right from the beginning!TSP offers some great environments! I have been perplexed several times during the game by the size and scale of things. Some of the buildings you encounter are asbolutely megalithic! Huge structures with many secrets and hidden bonuses giving you advantages in movement-speed, falling-damage and lots more! You also come across massive cave systems (which can be somewhat difficult to navigate in for the first-time player, hint: beacon) with countless secrets, adding yet another dimension to the game's survival aspect.TSP clearly targets the curious and explorative gamer-segment and there are a couple of pretty neat puzzles aswell. The game can get pretty eerie at times but it's not actual horror. I have gotten some pretty good scares in the game where things looked to be something they were not! A place where TSP falls short though, is in the conclusion of the game. I was left with more questions than before I started the game, and there doesn't really seem to be a final wrap-up. The mission objective of TSP is to ensure the survival of mankind, but this issue is quickly dealt with by introducing the discovery of another habitable planet found through the Aliens' starmap. There are many hours of gameplay in TSP and if you love sci-fi it's packed with that!OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10 "

												This review is strictly for the vr version of the game.  The quick review is this: It’s the best experience I have had to date with my vive and I highly recommend it. Now for a little more detail.  I was skeptical of this game since it is a port from a standard pc game.  I’ve read that porting a game is a recipe for disaster for vr.  The port does come with some down sides.  Since the game wasn’t made with motion controllers in mind, most of the interactions are point and click.  For example: you have a can that you want to open up and eat the food inside.  With the motion controllers and playing other vive games you may get the idea that you can set the can down, pull a pipe out, and swing for the fences with your controller to have the pipe smash open the can.  This is not the case.  You simply drop the can on the ground, pull the pipe out, point the cursor at the can and pull the trigger “simulating opening the can”.  The other negative in its current state is the inventory system.  Right now you have to cycle through everything which is a bit cumbersome.  The devs are working on an update to this issue and supposedly will have it out in the next couple days, so this will more than likely be even more of a non-issue than it currently is. Now on to the positives of the pc game port.  This is an actual, fully-realized game.  This isn’t a cool concept. Its not a wild 10 minute tech demo that has you salivating for more. My previous favorite experience was the gallery.  The gallery is $30 and lasts about 3 hours.  It’s a wonderful experience and great use of vr, but its over before you really get into it.  The Solus Project does not have this problem.  I am currently 5 hours into the game and have only scratched the surface of this world that you get to explore.  The devs say that you can beat it in roughly 17 hours, but can take up to 50 if you explore all the areas.  I long game like this is what the vive needs. There is depth to this game that you simply won’t find on any of the current made for vr games on steam.   Now let me take a moment to break down a couple aspects of the game. Controls: There are several different options you can do to move around the planet.  The standard teleport option which most games use is also available for The Solus Project.  For those that can handle it, you can also use one of the track pads to move around.  In the options I have set the walking speed to 30% and love the experience that it provides so much more than teleporting everywhere.  It’s a nice slow pace that will probably take me ages to complete the game, but its at a pace that I feel like I’m actually walking through the caves.  Overall the control options are good enough to allow you to play the way its most comfortable for you.  I also need to mention that the motion controls are definitely utilized in the game.  I mentioned above that the interactions are mostly point and click.  While this is true, the motion controls still work great.  When holding up the torch, you can move it around to change the angle of the light hitting off the cavern walls, point the flashlight where you want, etc.  the controls are 1:1 in terms of movement, just don’t expect to swing a sword around and have it physically hit something. Graphics: Holy crap is this game gorgeous.  Again, this is what sets this game apart from most games out for the vive.  These devs have taken a lot of time to make the caves look as organic and natural as possible.  The Unreal engine really shines in this game.  The feeling of being in a large alien cave chamber is indescribable.  The pacing of the game also lends to the visuals constantly changing.  By the time I was getting used to the cave scenery, the cave would end and you would be thrust into a gorgeous outdoor scene with alien beaches, rock formations, meteor showers, crazy storms.  It really pulls you into the game and gives you the feeling that you are on this alien world. Audio: The audio is perfect.  The general creepy ambiance they have created with the sound is superb.  I  hate horror games and jump scares. This is definitely not one of those games.  However walking around in a cave is inherently creepy.  Add in that this is a cave on an alien planet and the creepy factor goes up a couple notches.  There have not been any jump scares or anything scary that I have experienced in the game.  The creepiness and general foreboding as to what is behind the next turn is greatly enhanced by the audio.  I’m pretty sure it has spatial audio in the game.  There have been several times where I know I’ve heard something behind me.  Being able to pinpoint sound locations also adds to the overall atmosphere that they have created in the game. Gameplay: This game so far is more of a walking-simulator where you are the lead in a mystery story that is unraveling before your very eyes.  You aren’t going to feel like a badass like when you play holopoint or SPT. If you are in to movies like interstellar, or books like The Martian, you will absolutely love this experience.  I have been awestruck by the beauty of this game, and I have had to tell myself that I’m really just in my basement and nothing is going to hurt me if I keep moving forward.  The puzzle’s have been non-existant to really easy so far, but I’ve only just begun. Overall, this is the exact type of experience I was dreaming of when I first learned that VR was becoming a reality.  This game gives you the ability to travel the cosmos and explore an alien planet while you try to survive and figure out what’s going on with the planet.  Not too bad for only $20!  I can’t recommend this game enough! Go buy it now before the devs realize that this is at least a $50 experience. You won’t regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								The Solus Project is a diamond in the rough of survival games. While most will bore me with the repetetive gameplay, ""The Solus Project"" has kept me interested by keeping the survival elements as a side feature and focusing more on the exploration and story. And man is the story interesting. I haven't even gotten that far in, but I'm intrigued. Why did my ship get shot down? Who built all this stuff? Will I ever be found? These are all question I want answered. Mostly though, my very very recent experience with a weather anomaly is amazing. I woke up to a tornado spiraling out of control, I walked out of my house (cave) and was in awe of the tornado, it got closer to me, I ran into a wall trying to escape and then took shelter in my tiny cave, the music is amazing, the voice acting could use some work though.EDIT: As I progress through the story I can't help but be even more intrigued. There was a civilization here. The best part was finding The eggs and skeletons, and learning about the Sky gods. The graphic are great, the gameplay is amazing. This game is probably one of my top 5 favourite games.			"

												I am no fan of survival games and i have tried. I own dayz and ARK. Barely touched them. Then I reat that this supports the Vive soon (while back) and has sort of a storyline too.I bought it and waited. Today i tried it out since vive support is patched in and supposedly working. Damn was I in for a surprise! Brilliant locomotion where you pick whatever you like from normal to blink to teleport. Great graphics and just a well designed engaging game. This not your typical 2 hour game either.A must have for Vivers. Money well spent.Edit: I am now about 12 hours into the game. The Devs released a great VR patch yesterday. The PDA is a lot bigger now making everything a pleasure to read. Locomotion got better too and the button layout on the controllers is better thought out now. These devs really care about their VR implementation eventhough it was no VR game at first.After 12 hours: Still extremely positive!			"

												Wanted to play on Vive and was a little skeptical after initial reviews, however what you get with The Solus Project is an incredible VR experince much richer that any other VR 'experience'. This is a full game that transports you to a stunning planet that you need to survie and explore, once you get over the slightly difficult controls, this is the best VR game out there right now, I stood on an alien world watching the moons orbit at night and really felt like I was there for a few moments, dont hold back if you have Vive.

												I got this because I saw the name pop up a few times and saw it was on sale when I went to buy The Gallery. I was planning on playing that first and then maybe have a look at this but boy was I wrong, The Gallery was so short and uneventful and then I open The Solus Project and I found myself playing for 6+ hours straight and even then I only stopped because my vive controllers ran out of battery.I highly suggest people get this game especially if you are using the vive, this is by far the best singleplayer game, I only wish I could play it coop with a friend.

												As an HTC Vive owner, I was a bit worried about how well the controllers would be added in but found them to work great. The PDA and inventory could use some work but I find it not enough to get in the way of the experience. The navigation functions like that of The Lab allowing both walking around and teleporting.Aside from that I am finding the game to be a fun experience. I love exploring the alien world and caves. Crafting is fun as well. I am eager to venture deeper and discover the secrets of this world.If you have a Vive, I'd highly recommend it even if support is in beta at the moment.			"

												I'm very positively surprised by what this game have to offer for its price. Its more like story driven walking simulator with survival elements than purely survival game like ""The Forest"". You still need to watch for your food, water, temperature, humidity an sleep indicator. But it is not so complicated and annoying like in some other games. World have interesting terrain shapes, formations and caves. I like how game looks and what climate have. Graphics are very good like for indie game.Beside some strange things and weather anomalies take place around me. It maybe one hell of a ride on this ""Inhabited planet""  :)			"

												Spoiler Free Review: The Solus Project was an unexpected surprise.  I did not play it via VR, but still thought it was an enjoyable game.  You play as a stranged astronaut on a deserted world.  Loads of exploration and reading ensue.  Even without the VR, I thought the graphics were good, and the controls smooth.Note that this isn't an action game, more of a novella.  A sci-fi story which requires exploration and to get the most out of it, reading.  The aliens in the story are quite interesting, but you have to read and search and explore pretty much everywhere to get the most out of it.  I understand if that is not the type of game everyone enjoys.  Honestly, you rarely have an enemy or see any living thing besides yourself until well into the game. Replayability:  No multiplayer or DLC available for this game.  One play through is enough, although if you're like me you'll be going back to try and get all of the achievements.  Some of which are very hard, such as finding all of the secrets. Rating: 7 out of 10. Recommended. Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb Ram, GTX1070			"

												Highly recommended for explorers and completionists. This game is hours and hours of exploring, walking around vast cave and tunnel networks, temples, and deserted-ish islands. If you just want to wander 'over this way' and see what's there, you're going to probably enjoy this game. There are secrets to be found, journals and labels to read, inventory to keep track of ... all the while keeping yourself healthy (warm, fed, rested).It's not 100% free-roam, happy-go-lucky: there are a few antogonists you'll have to learn to avoid or run from. The first few times I encountered these things, I was swearing and messing my drawers, as the makers of this fantastic game outdid themselves with the music score. Dread and anxiety, heh ... why not just say FEAR, crept up on me as the music & sounds got closer. It's not horror genre, however. There are no jump-scares or zombies out to dine on your flesh. After a few run-ins with the 'things', you'll learn how to properly deal with them, and (hopefully as I did) marvel at their presence.There are puzzles, jumping puzzles. Nothing hard and annoying, especially since one of your tools allows you to go pretty much ANYWHERE you want to. The game is LONG, and replayable. I found less than half of the secrets, and look forward in a few years time to hitting it up again with someone's video/guide/map to aid me in finding every nook & cranny.			"

I re-vistited it after the VR update and with a new pc - (gtx 1080 included) and it has been one of my favourite VR titles so far. Taking about 13 hours to complete, i can only hope for more fully fleshed out games such as this in future VR titles. Recommended for VIVE owners (with high end gear)			"

												A MUST HAVE FOR VR!!!!! This is the game I have been waiting for since I got my Vive. What else can I say? The movement is the kind where you slide along the ground without walking but you can also teleport at the same time. I did not feel motion sick at all at any point ever. The only thing I ever felt was immense curiosity and drive to explore and a little bit of fear. An amazing game am very excited to dig deep into this one!! A MUST HAVE FOR VR!!!!!EDIT: The latest patch has improved the experience immensely! They say it is still a work in progress though so it can only get better from here!! The only issue I have so far is the inventory, wish there was an easier way to select items. Sometimes you are in pitch black and it is difficult to know what item you are holding as you cycle through them all.			"

												This game is so damn good. I've been playing non-stop for hours now and can't seem to put it down. The atmosphere and environments are absolutely incredible. You feel so alone yet at the same time you always feel watched. The graphics are average, but the amazing work they put into the game makes up for some lower end textures and overall it's gorgeous. Mechanics are probably the weakest aspect of the game. However, the story is incredibly interesting and if you are considering buying this just quit wondering if you should, and start it right now.

												This is the most awful thing i have experienced in the vive. The controls are far too numerous, the movement is sickening, the objects are hideous. I couldn't carry on playing it. In summary there is a lot of stuff that should be disabled when playing in VR mode as it's just bad for the experience. Controls: The button that does one thing on one hand, does something completey different on the other. What's pick up on one hand is teleport on the other, whats menu on one hand is crouch on the other. For VR this is very difficult to get your head around. The two track buttons have 8 functions! Movement: there is teleport which is ok.. there is button that glides you foward, and forward is not determined by which way you are facing but by the game somehow. so if you turn to your left and push the ""glide forward"" button you start shifting sideways! Turn all the way around and it's now a ""glide backwards"" button. This gliding is pretty sickening even when looking in the direction that you are facing. Crouch has no movement or animation, you just teleport to about shin height, which is far too low for a crouch anyway. Scale: in one hand appears your vive controller at normal size, in the other is a MASSIVE tricorder type thing. Easily 5 times the size of the vive controller in the other hand. To make this worse you can't read anything on it without moving it closer to your face making it take up half of your entire field of view. Scale wise it's like carrying around a briefcase sized tablet in one hand.In short things like crouch need to be removed when playing in the vive, as players will just crouch. Also unbind things like rotate left/right and glide forwards (unless it can go the direction the player is facing). I understand these controlls are trying to be appropriate to people with the Rift, where they might not be able to crouch or turn and are just head tracking, but why then bind these controlls to the Vive controller?? If you own a vive PLEASE do not put people into this game as it will taint their opinion of VR forever.			"

												Great game!With  a few hours into play, I hope this review would be convicing enough.Without spoiling anything I would say this game has a sandbox/ linear play to it. If you decide to purchase the game you'll see why I said that. This in NO way is a bad thing. Story is left somewhat told through the letters you may or may not find scattered about. I encourage anyone to finds these only to bring you in closer. Lots of items to find. All if not most are a benefit. If your like me who likes to leave no 'stone' unturned then what are you waiting for? Gameplay is smooth. UI is very basic. Hourences encourages you too tweak the game files if your wanting to pull more in the way of graphics. UI for me just wasn't quite enough, so forced some settings through Nvidia CP. Still, the game is a beauty. No errors or hitches.On a side note; you can go back as far as you want during your quest. (Maybe you have to eventually, IDK), but I did because I found a tool needed for something I passed early on. I just thought I'd add that in. 10.2 hrs at this point, and I'm not taking the time that I probably should, but I believe I'm about half-way through. That may give you some kind of an idea on length of play.Not trying to sound biased, but I've followed Hourences since the days of UT2004 and the map-packs he and the community back then we're involved in, and his work has always been pleasing. Quality.It really is a great game.			"

From the creators of ""The Ball"" comes a far more confident and genuinely interesting offering, serving up a slice of survival adventure that for once, doesn't require you to harvest a ton of wood.The Ball was a really good game, don't get me wrong, but it was at it's core, about ""The Ball"", and as such effectively was centered around a singular note, navigating and solving puzzles with the titular ball. It was an excellent exercise in good puzzle gameplay, with a smattering of platforming and a side dish of adventure story nonsense if you did a bit of skimming into it, but it was a first try for the studio, so really it was mostly for them to get their eye in and to make sure they weren't doing anything mechanically wrong. In that sense, ""The Ball"" was a roaring success.""The Solus Project"", that's a far different proposition, this is a game that actually goes several steps further, creating a real story around your actions, a limited survival system that whilst not lethally challenging in ""normal"" difficulty (in hardcore however, you'd best believe it can punish you fast) does serve as a constant reminder to keep fed, watered and rested, and a zelda-like crafting and inventory system that gradually expands your reach and your ability to explore an alien island that you've just crashlanded into, nose first.A very beautiful, desolate land, it's like Sweden, but an unearthly SwedenAnd oh what an island it is, it's genuinely beautiful at ultra settings, whilst managing to remain fairly decent looking even if you tamp down on the pretty, whilst there's very little to actively contend with in the sense of wildlife and movable nastiness, there's a fallen civilisation that's left behind a lot of high tech nastiness, and a lot of that can, and will kill you if you're not paying attention. You learn pretty fast to keep an eye on the floors, ceilings and immediate surroundings if you're indoors, and your atmospheric readings if you're outdoors, as the outdoor temp can swing wildly between ""So cold it freezes your genitalia off"" to ""So hot not even ice cream will help"", this doesn't count the weather cycles, which seem to take their cues from America circa 2016, complete with tornadoes, blizzards, torrential rain, heatwaves, and that's all in twenty four hours.Your primary mission is to re-establish contact with Solus command, and effectively to warn them that the planet has a giant energy cannon that is being operated by the remaining natives that can and will blow anything out of orbit (as seen in the intro), so it's likely a really, really bad idea to come knocking at this planet unless they fancy a dose of highly concentrated plasma being slung at the colony ship (almost certainly a bad plan).Over the course of the game you'll get a bunch of downrange transmissions sent to your dinky little PDA from Solus command who are getting progressively more panicky at the state of the Solus probe teams, it seems most of them have not ended up in places that would qualify as ""safe"", but more than that would be deemed spoilery, so I'll keep that bit quiet.Unfortunately, whilst you might be ""A"" martian, you're no Matt DamonThe game leaves you alone to deal with the hazards posed by Gisele, the planet you are stranded on for the bulk of it, and essentially puts you in the shoes of ""The Martian"" but instead of trying to survive, you're trying to explore and figure out just what in the name of dieties is going on with the planet, you'll be spelunking through caves, picking through the remnants of a previous civilisation, and dealing with some genuinely creepy stuff as you work your way into the bowels of the planet. As you progress you'll gain an inventory of useful items for helping you deal with the various environmental hazards, starting with simple tools and working up to the really helpful stuff like hammers, teleporters and ropes to pick your way through.Some areas are very much ""linear"", you'll go through them and unlikely revisit them unless you're going secret hunting, others are much more exploratory, since you'll have to scour them for the parts of the comms tower, but in either case, you'll be roaming Gisele back and forth for a significant sum of time, probably 12-16 hours for the average player. If, like me you got this during the sale, this is a fantastic buy and well worth the money.  At full whack, potentially a tricker choice to make depending on your love for exploration games, if you -really- like them, then it's a safe recommendation, if not, you may want to wait for the sale to hit.Final ThoughtsThe Solus Project marks a coming to form from the creators of ""The Ball"", it's a much more confident and complete game, and it definitely marks their graduation from promising developers to fully fledged and talented rising stars. If the Solus Project is indicative of what we can expect of their things to come, they've a genuinely bright future among the distant echoes of space.Verdict : Recommended, if you like survival exploration games, upgrade to highly recommended.

												Sure dodging bullets and shooting zombies is quick and fun but I believe VR experiences should be a bit deeper. HTC Vive + VR adventure = full immersion. If you liked Call of Starseed, you are going to like The Solus Project. The recent VR update greatly improves the controls. Enjoy.			"

												The Solus Project:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  After the earth has been destroyed, the faith of mankind is now relying on a small fleet of colony ships near Pluto! Your job is to scout planets to determine if one of them is suitable for human habitation. Well, as you approach one of them, your ship is hit by something coming from below and you just manage to reach the escape pod in time. As you fall rather quickly towards it, you keep wondering what you are going to find out upon impact!The Solus Project is a First Person/Survival/Exploring game with absolutely stunning visuals. At the start of the game, you will see a couple of splendid introduction videos from the destruction of earth to your crash landing. Then, you will step onto this glorious scenery of the planet Gliese-6143-C.All is beautiful but you really have nothing on you and your first task is to scavenge for useful items around the crash site. The first one you find is a survival device; a PDA which will tell you when to eat, drink, sleep, the outside temperature, can decrypt alien writing and other useful options.  You will be lead to specific destinations and will be shown where you can find food, water and how to craft items too. The game atmosphere is just brilliant - either you are on the surface of the planet or deep in the caves. The weather element is well done, too. You might experience a meteor shower, lighting and other extreme weather on the planet surface. Try to gather food (cans of food or plants) before entering the cavern just to be on the safe side. Oh, and be careful not to get wet too often especially in a cold environment like caverns. This is a great recipe for hypothermia!   The game does have a puzzle element to it, but to be honest they are not very difficult (as far as I have progressed) but make sure to read all the notes as well as the Alien symbols which can provide you with great intel; your PDA is very handy for that.You will only be able to store up to 12 items in your inventory at the Start of the game, which is a bit of a bugger. I like to gather as many items as I can and you never know when you might need them.Graphically this game is stunning. Mouse and keyboard for the controls and great sound effects all round. Also, you can set whatever level you want to play, from easy to hard.  Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Stunning Graphics-	Good story-line-	Great weather effects-	Very good atmosphere-	Achievement & trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Inventory could hold a larger number of itemsThe Solus Project is a very good First Person exploration game with a good story and splendid visuals! It is time for you to land on the planet Gliese! You won’t regret it!9/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Solus project is a story-focused exploration game with survival elements. The story of this game is mostly told through environmental storytelling: reading plaques scatterd through the environment, observing said environment, listening to the protagonist recording his diary and some communication from the rest of the humanity's fleet. This game is quite good at storytelling, much better than I would have expected from this studio, given The Ball's... questionable storyline, both in terms of delivery and writing. This one's story is not only fantastically voice-acted (albiet there is VERY little dialogue), the environments are also excellently crafted and paced to preserve the sense of mystery, without creating confusion. Game's world is scattered though several open levels, which you progress between in a linear fashion (though you can always go back to explore and scavenge a previous level). Levels are rather open at the start and they get more linear toward the end. I don't know why it was made this way, it doesn't detract anything from the experience, but it doesn't add anything either. And sometimes I did miss a little storyline-free exploration towards the end of the game. Closer to the end you start to get a lot of information very rapidly, making a little more open and safe to explore levels would have helped some people process that info, IMO. Throughout the game, as you explore you are required to manage a basic set of survival stats. That is probably the most frustrating thing in the game, and for the most part it serves no purpose other than to restrict you from exploring at your own pace. Thankfully the survival elements are rather simplistic and not the focus (and by setting difficulty to easy you can pretty much just ignore them), because if they weren't I would definitely have hated this game. As it stands, they simply get in the way, but not too much. What I will say is that there is a stat which DOES contribute to gameplay: temperature. Manging temperature in this game is closely tied to gameplay, and unlike other survival stats, it actually contributes a lot to the atmosphere in some places. Reminds me of Cryostasis: Sleep of Reason (maker's breath, that was a good game), except here you also need make sure you don't overheat, just as much as freeze.This game does let you save your progress at any time by sleeping (assuming you sleep in a safe place), which is very important as it is incredibly unfair, when it comes to killing you. Most of the dangers in this game come from hazards, and there is one in particular - some sort of alien drone, that they don't actually reveal the details about, which kills you instantly when it touches you. That drone has fixed paths it partols, but instead of going back and forth like you'd expect, it spawns at the start of the path after finishing the route. When you don't know where that start is, it can and it WILL spawn right on you, killing you instantly. That would be incredibly infuriating if you could only save at save shrines. As it stands it's just a mild annoyance. The game also likes to obsure some traps in shadows, and there's a hazard which instantly kills you when you walk into with a torch lit (this is not mentioned ever before). Furthermore the game can spawn climate anomalies, which you have to hide from in caves, however especially towards the end of the game, the caves are really not that common, so if you encounter such an anomaly and you don't find any shelter in the next 30 seconds (which depends largely on luck), you are also dead.One of the greatest things about this game is it's sound design. Fantastic ambiance, with well-placed and fitting music and great sound processing, combined with my Corsair Void Wireless create an amazing atmosphere at any point in the game. Eerie in caves and dark chasms, calming outside during the quite mornings, exciting during a cataclysm of some kind or when you are exploring large alient structures.Contrary to the sound, the graphics is not that great. Poor texture quality is quite common, despite running on highest settings, and my 2560x1080 monitor really highlights lack of polygons on many models. Lighting is not better than Skyrim with mods and in general this game looks like something from 2011, and no a 2016 game running on UE4. I did work with Unreal Engine 4 a while ago and I know what it can do without too much effort from the art team. I guess it simply wasn't the focus. What I will say is that weather effects do look amazing, even if the tornados for example always repeat the same animation, which is not exactly accurate (but then again this is an oceanic planet with a desert climate, so clearly realism is not what they were going for).Lastly I would like to express my disappointment at the game's ending. It is, frankly,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Absolute trash. After such an awesome game to get such a rushed, vaigue, anticlimatic and dumb ending is much worse than getting it at the end of a trash game. I don't know if they ran out of money, or if they are sequel-baiting, but that ending provided no explanation, no closure, and no answers whatsoever. Moreover, after the game spent so much effort building up the importance of your task, making the player invest in that importance (even the death screen constantly tells you about it), it is extremely disheartening to just see such abrupt and inconclusive finalie to your mission.The ending is, by far, the worst part of the game. So much so that I probably would have been better off if I just left the game at that point, where I finish the communications tower. It was even worse because I didn't expect it to be so bad. I honestly thought there's going to be some extra levels on the alien mothership, teased in the distance for the last 3 levels. Never could I have though that such a good game can just end like that.I still recommend it, because no matter how bad the ending is, the rest of the game is excellent. And all you horror devs: THIS is how you make horror. This game is not even a horror by nature, but it's scary sections are more eerie than 20 Amnesia's combined. Because instead of putting stupidly exaggerated ugly monsters and jump-scares, it manages to create an atmosphere that tickles your nerves even when you KNOW there's no danger. That is friggin impressive. So yeah: play it. And I hope by expecting a disappointing ending, you'll be less disappointed than I was, when it ended so abruptly.			"

One of the few survival games I have seen with actual goals. This is not an 'open world' game it is kinda on very wide rails so there is room to explore in each area. Recommended. 10/10			"

												8/10Always have an oil torch. Your best friend. If you feel comfortable, the weather will make sure you won't for very long. Surviving in the game is difficult even without an array of creatures trying to kill you. A beautiful game with puzzles. Great story. The story line alone could carry the game. Large backstory and collectables. Pretty cool they added some fan art.Now to reason its 8/10. The animations when performing actions like cutting or breaking a wall for example. The backstory is very scattered. It takes real effort to locate all the tablets, and i did because it was worth it mind you. If you lose your oil torch it is very very hard to survive. Its almost unrealistic to survive without it. Normal torch doesn't last at all but that just my opinion. Nutural: Game was different from what I expected when i first got it. Didn't dissappoint.Its an excellent game. Best $10 game i got in years.			"

												With 71 VR games in my steam library, this is by far my favourite, most polished and complete experience. This is a prime example of what VR should be like - a full lenght game instead of just another tech demo. As for the adaptation to the VIVE, I actually found the walking locomotion using the VIVE controller trackpad to be far more immersive than teleportation. I don't think teleportation does this game any justice. I personally didn't get any nausia and wish more games utilised trackpad walking.			"

There was also some cool but uncomfortably creepy parts in the game as well.  I would recommend this game.			"

												Thoroughly been enjoying this on the Rift. About time I can find a good rift experience... and for the current $12 it is definitely worth it. The ""normal"" mode is a bit too easy, as there are way more survival resources than required, all over the place, but I'm probably going to be too lazy on trying anything harder at this point.I can understand why others say it is repetitive, as it is in many ways. But I love the open world. It's a lot larger than I ever expected. I'm the kind of guy that likes to find everything (Zelda syndrome), so I'm starting to get bored looking for any secrets, and 95% of the time the secrets are worthless. Permanent buffs are pretty much always only 1%. Woopy.  At this point (8 hours in), I think I'm just gonna try to do general explorations of areas and forget about trying to find secrets. The way I have been playing is definitely burning me out.My biggest problem with the game is that I WANT to explore all the environments, but sometimes I don't know that the way I am heading is to the ""next area"", and then it takes forever to go back. I just accidentally skipped like 4 areas and got to the third island, and I barely even touched the second island. I hate missing content and the game doesn't make it clear what is the next way to go, so I feel I am missing a lot going the ""right"" way first.			"

												An incredibly immersive sci-fi exploration and survival adventure. A journey across and through an alien planet builds and grows as you try to find a way to save your mission from disaster. It has survival aspects as you battle the elements of a hostile planet, making sure you don't freeze to death, and lots of exploration with plenty of secrets to find and a world lore that expands as you make your way across the planet. For a large part, it's like living on the planet. For fans of adventure games and sci-fi, I'd highly recommend this.			"

												Finally, a game with VR Vive support that lasts longer than an hour. The world looks incredible. In my opinion, the movement would be better if you could walk backwards. Sometimes when transporting forward you can get too close to objects and you have to turn around to back up. At one point in the game, I was expecting a huge spider to come out of the ceiling. That didn't happen. Thank you for that. I am not ready for huge VR spiders yet.			"

Early Access Review
								The Solus Project forces my hand into giving a positive review for three simple reasons:1) Developer communication. Having had fairly important issues initially running this game in virtual reality (Oculus DK2) I had to resort to the community hub for some help, which finally ame in the form of an update from the developers. Not only were my issues resolved, but options were added to resolve issues others were having, and in the end we even got options that are a welcome extra. Devs that communicate so openly and then deliver on the discussion need to be recognized.2) Amazing performance. While the game is in ""late early access"", the VR portion of it is far less complete, but what makes it easy to handle - not being the case with most VR games - is the butter-smooth performance. When I'm not using any recording software I've seen the game stick at 75fps without even touching any of the stock settings. This will lgo a long way in making your playthrough smoother.3) Well polished. This part applies less to VR and more to the game overall... for what is being delivered, the game is almost there. They seem to have their mechanics about 95% the way, and at this point most of what's not here yet is actual content. The game has gotten my attention enough to select it for a let's play video series.Here's the DailyMotion 2D-only version of my first impressions video:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3uzrpz_oculus-rift-dk2-the-solus-project_tech "

Big fat TWO thumbs up.6-8-16 UpdateThe complete game has come out, and I absolutely was not disappointed with the ending.  The indie developers are on the right track with TSP, as it completely captivates you from start to finish.

Great performance, never dipped below 60 fps, survival mechanics are pretty great for the most part except for starving/dehydration during sleep. environment is pretty spoopy but not in a constant adrenaline/terror IV drip like SOMA or Alien; its a subtle spoopy, much more enjoyable for me. i love the mysterious atmosphere and seemingly random weather events (not sure if they're random or scripted) either way very cool. cant wait for the next episode keep it up.

												The atmosphere of the game is just amazing. The build up in the story takes some time in the beginning, but when it starts rolling you just wanna finish the game in one session. The survival aspect is kinda... well, it's there but I never ran out of food or drink in the medium setting. Should try second playthrough with the hardest setting.Graphically the game is pretty good. A bit outdated by today's standards but I liked the art style and look of the game. Also, the music score fits the game well.So, if you like games with great atmosphere and good storytelling, buy this game. If you like action, this is not for you. Also, if you're looking for a survival game, this might not be the best choice.			"

												For starters, I haven't had the chance to try this game on VR, so my review is with non-VR play in mind.I really enjoyed this game, through-and-through. First of all, the art of the planetscape, with all its unique flora especially, was spectacular. While at first I doubted that the survival and story elements would cooperate, I was quickly surprised by how well they worked together to form and immersive experience. The game is really engaging; I really felt like it was me stranded on this strange planet, seeing so many strange things, trying to understand what was going on. There wasn't a dull moment in this game, from start to finish, but it didn't feel stressful either, like some survival games. All in all, a great experience that I intend to play again. Would also love to try this game out on VR - after playing it normally I think it would significantly enhance an experience I already really enjoyed. Really the only thing I can think of about this game that bothered me was that your PDA is called ""Wilson"" but has a female voice. That's literally the only thing that bothered me. Everything else leads me to recommend this game :)			"

												Just finished it! Best game for VR in 2016 imho. Exploration, good story, scary parts which do not do jumpscares, but sends shivers down your spine :) And it took me almost 40 hours, which length is very rare among VR titles - unfortunately :( . Absolutly must have for all VR holders!			"

												Extremely well done alien planet exploration game. Very atmospheric. And those water spouts freak me out every time (I think it is the music - creepy).I don't particularly like the ""survival"" aspects of the game as I find them more annoying than anything else (I am playing on ""normal"" mode). I also think the weather changes much too often.Much, much better than No Man's Sky (even after its ""foundation"" update).			"

												The Solus Project is a nice survival game with a taste of adventure and exploring. Yet there's room for improvements. Let's have a look!The mankind has lost their most important thing, the Earth. The only hope is The Solus Project, a space ship colony with the hope to find another planet to live in. You and your crew were sent to Gliese-6143-C, a harsh and barren planet, covered by a vast ocean. As soon as you've hit the planet's orbit, you were hit a strange projectile, causing fatal damage und thus the crash course into Gliese. You've survived the crash, wondering if the crew is okay. Once you stand on the assumed safe ground, it's just You, Gliese, and a Nokia like device that helps you in the entire adventure...The adventure I'm talking about puts you in many tests. Finding food, solving puzzles, uncovering the stories Gliese helds in it and most important, to not die. Optional, you can look for collectibles that can improve your gear and thus your surviving capabilities.Gameplay wise it's well made, although I couldn't really friend with the object interaction system. There are soo many areas to deal with, 5 islands connected with a cave system. Whereever you go, you won't loose the impression that there's a secret somewhere. When it comes to graphics and sounds, it's also impressive that leads you to a nice atmosphere. Well, not everywhere. I got massive FPS drops in certain areas while it's pretty smooth otherwise. When it rains and you run into a cave, the rain disappears. The graphics options have plenty of settings, and says you can edit the .cfg file for more. I know that from older games but for today I'd expect a GUI for every setting. Other than that I loved the exotic art and style of Gliese. Also worth mentioning is the very well made voice acting and soundtrack.With hard difficulty and a slight effort for secrets, it took me 18h to finish the game. It lasted pretty long I must say. In the other hand I was a bit glad that it's over. The story end is not I was hoping for and it left me with many open questions. But that's a good sign for a sequel and I hope it'll happen so.Altogether The Solus Project is a pretty good experience for the price and it deserves my recommendation.			"

												What a impressive game even without the use of VR.I'll start with the Gameplay:There are thrist and starvation mechanics and you need to sleep, but in my playthrough i never got any problem with finding food or water, because there are many savepoints with unlimited supply. Savings works either with sleeping or by using a savepoint. You also have to keep yourself in the right temperature, because some areas are hot as hell and others very cold. There is also a basic crafting system to craft torches or put some items together. You also have a very useful (and needed) teleportation device, that's needed in some areas to progress furter.Environment:The areas are small isles, connected with tunnels. There are many secret caves and in a small cave you could find a button that opens a gate at the other side of the area. The isles are barren with only some grass and trees, no animals or signs of life. The weather is dangerous if you are outside, got no cave to find shelter and a anomaly is coming over.Story:Wont say much to the story, but it took me 9 hours with finding a few secrets. If you really want to find them all then you will have more time. I liked the story and there are many survivor pages and stones with writings on it to find.Horror:They put a decent horror in the game. Its not that obvious like in other games (walk downstairs and ooooh wow a horror moment.....). There is the overall darkness and some pretty creepy things. You have the torch (emits heat), some useless glowsticks, a flashlight that needs solar energy, a red crystal (emits a small portion of heat and less light), a white crystal( emits a small portion of cold and less light) and you can make ""orbs"" out of the crystals at some rare occations to let the emit a lot of heat/cold.I will definitly come back if i get a VR somedays and i know that i will♥♥♥♥♥♥myself twice at moments where i got scared without.

												Excellent exploration game, with the option of managing survival elements if you so choose. Easy mode doesn't remove these elements completely, but does make them inconsequential to manage - choose this mode if you are hoping for the narrative experience. Said narrative experience is strong and emotional. The sound design is EXCELLENT! Best experienced with surround headphones. The voice acting from the male character is great. Next I'll be playing as the female character to experience it from her words.			"

												It all starts off so promising.  I like the visuals and the moons effecting the tides was an intersting mechanic that could have been put to good use, but it quickly degenerates into, running down  a boring cave corridor to get a  key and run all the way back to open a door.... rinse repeat. Over and over again.  Like empty Skyrim caves.  No challenge even on the hardest difficulty. No puzzles worth the name puzzle.The infinate oil torches are just a god mode cheat. . The cold no longer is a problem, and you get the infinate oil torches at the start of level one!  I advise anyone starting the game to limit them selves to one oil torch. Carrying three makes the cold mechanic irrelevant. If this game had some alien animals that were attracted to heat and you had to throw your torch as a decoy that would help imensely. But there are no animals to attack or chase you. Just a couple of rare creatures that you can easily evade with out even trying.I get why games want to avoid first person shooting things all the time, but in this case it was just boring.The Long Dark found a perfect balance of conflict between the player and the wildlife. It isn't a shoot everything on sight game but you do still have to be afriad of wolves and bears. The the Long dark I would fight them off with a torch most of the time and rarely shoot with my precious bullets only to eat the animal and use it's skin,  In The Solus project you just begin to realize that there will be nothing  intersting arround the next corner or over the next hill... Just more keys and locks. Nothing will really challenge you or threaton you. I must admit I havn't finished it yet. I got to the Giant windmill and was finally staved to death by the mindless tedium of it all.I wonder about these non violent games being part of Political Correctness... Was this game made by people who don't like violence in video games? I'm left wondering if the devs are Vegans and disaprove of people killing anything even if only to eat it and survive in a video game.Such a shame the visuals and setting are intreging but i'm still searching for the gameplay > maybe it is on the next island level...

												If you belong to movie fans Mission to Mars, The Martian, or Interstellar, then this game will for you.Before play first act, we got simple introduction. Earth is on the verge of ecological destruction. Desperate humanity begins search for new worlds to colonize, and we play as a member of one those responsible for this mission teams of explorers. The aim of the research expedition was reach to the planet, made establish base there, exploration planet to the research and preparation for the next expansion of the settlers. After twenty years of travel stellar, research expedition of The Solus 3 arrive at the place, but the landing on the planet ends in an accident, of which the result killed the entire crew! (of course except of character player) Worse, the damage is most of the hardware, including communications equipment. Thus, we are completely alone, and we can count only on themselves! Just you and mystery planet!The Solus Project is based on survival. The game included simplified mechanics of crafting with logical elements as also the discovery of secrets, hidden by the world and equipment recovered in the course of the story. Player need sleep, must maintain proper body temperature or the level of food and hydration. Must avoid injuries resulting from the fall or confrontation with hostile flora and fauna. You can die by starvation, hypothermia, overheating, drowning, hurricane, lightning storm or even meteor shower!Visually, we get unreal engine 4 with excellent sound effect and music, by what the game encourages you to explore all parts of the world, filled with the many secrets waiting to be discovered. Each sector is filled with monumental ancients structures, which can visit on your own or as a result of the progress of the story. Realy nice to see. Pleasant atmosphere with a touch of fantasy. I had good fun and I recommend try it!9/10 -  requires patience and determination to finish each act. There is a lot of walking and long distance from point to point and sometimes after long walking (special in caves) it becomes plunge.			"

Early Access Review
								Just finished the first Part of The Solus Project in 3 ish hours without rushing it.I'm a bit dissappointed that it was that short since I was looking for a game to get busy for at least one day.a mixture of survival ( you need to rest: sleeping, to eat and drink ) with a day/night cyclus, a lot of exploring and walking through the mysteries of a new planet. Sometimes you need to solve riddles which are not too difficult. So it won't be that boring.If you like walking simulators such as firewatch with a bit of exploring, mystery and decent graphics and are more interested in the story than the gameplay itself, then you should buy this game.another con is that the graphics seem to be amazing, but... even in 1920x1080 resolution the textures looked cheap and undone, while the sky, the lights and the weather and various other effects indeed looked very coolhope more content will be released soon...

Early Access Review
								At first, The Solus Project seems like your typical ""survival"" game, mixed with walking simulator elements.However, you do have objectives to complete, gather stuff and resources so then, you can advance the game.I've played a good 2 hours yet and haven't encountered any bugs. The game plays very well (even though I find the protagonist to be running quite slow, with a grampa's stamina for running), visually impressive and the soundtrack puts you in the mood of ""being alone"" and crash landed on some unknown world....alone for now... since there seems to be another civilization living there!I recommend this game to any and every gamers who digs the survivor games. If that ain't your bag, then skip ahead!For a score, I'd give it a 7.5 / 10... especially for an Early Access Game, it is good!			"

												HTC Vive review: I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to write one about this game. This is by far my favorite VR game to date. The graphics are beautiful, the music goes perfect, it's creepy and exciting. I spent many hours of my game time just exploring the islands and caves. The Vive controller mechanics are perfect. I turned on controller steering rather than head steering which works much better since you can look around while walking. The devs should be very proud of this game. There were a couple places where I did get some stuttering but with the fragility of VR right now I don't know if it was a steamVR issue or a game issue. My recommendation: BUY IT!GTX 1080i5 6700k16gb ramwin 10			"

												I bought the Solus Project a while ago but haadn't tried it yet because I wanted to try it in VR when support would be added. So no I have tried it on the Vive and it seems like a great game - with a very early and barebones, yet functional, VR/Motion Controlls integration.As far as I know the developers only had very little time to actually work on Vive integration and thus I can look past these flaws as the game it self seems fantastic. I can't wait for the devs to improve the VR aspects so it's more user firendly.Don't be discouragd by the current VR integration, give it some time and I'm sure it'll be much improved!			"

												This is, honestly, the VR game I've been waiting for.  A vast and explorable open world with 10-20+ hours of gameplay in a single playthough.  The atmosphere is simply stunning.  I've never gotten so lost in a game as I have with this.There is a teleportation locomotion mechanic, but I personlly I find the best way to traverse the landscape is just walking forward (run in place to increase immersion / reduce VR sickness).Graphics are demanding, so keep that in mind.  My oc'd 1070 runs it pretty well on medium-high settings (shadows set low), but I do get occasional judders when I'm outside.  Cave exploration always runs smoothly.The developers seem to be pretty active and I do hope we can look forward to some more performance enhancements to come.			"

												I played this on PC. The game runs pretty well at 1080p. I only got noticeable frame rate drops when there were a lot of overlapping dynamic lights. This is my setup:Intel i5-2500k Sandy Bridge processor8 GB of RAMNVIDIA GTX 770Pros:- The planet's moon affects the tides, causing some areas to become easily accessible or difficult to access, respectively. This combined with the different weather effects makes outside world feels very dynamic and gives the sense that you are truly at nature's will.- The environments and effects are done really well. There is enough visual and aural feedback to give you a sense of your environment. For example, during the day the sun is so hot that you will begin to suffer heatstroke if you exposed for too long. Heat shimmer will begin to appear on the horizon as a visual cue that you shouldn't stay exposed for too long. Likewise, frost will form on the terrain when it is very cold.Cons:- Character movement feels a bit clunky. Character movement acceleration is so low that it takes a while to ""ramp up"" to full walking speed. This causes your movement to feel a bit unresponsive and sluggish.- You only feel like you're playing a true survival game for a few portions of the game. After a while, the survival aspect kind of takes a step back and the game becomes a full on adventure/exploration/puzzle game, with the survival kind of nagging you on the side. This is largely due to the fact that there are pots of alien soup and pools of drinkable water scattered throughout the game. Eventually the need to manage your inventory and plan ahead goes away completely.- Many of the environments, especially the caves and interiors, start to feel very same-y after a while.Pro tips:- Crouching and then jumping allows you to ""spring up"" and get a higher jump.- The teleport gun is very useful for traversing the map. You can combine that with jumping to launch the disc farther. You can use it to wander out for supplies and quickly recall back to home base. You can use it to escape bad situations.			"

												I originally bought this game when it was in Beta, though not from the very start. I love a good walking/exploration tye game, and I enjoy SciFi, so this seemed like it would be great... and it was! It reminded me of one of my first video games loves, Myst, only much more intense and a bit creepier. I had a ton of fun exploring each section of the planet, finding all the little secrets and unfurling the story. I loved it so much that when I hit my first end-point, rather than wait for the game to be updated, I went and played it again from the start on a harder level (and with a focus towards getting all the secrets too). It was even better the second time around, and with each update, and I really loved how the deeper into the game I went, the more and more creepy it became. There were quite a few moments where I was playing too late at night and got very creeped out!So all in all, this is a really wonderful game, especially if you want something you can enjoy over a long period of time rather than just rushing right through. It's a slow game, but perfectly paced for those who like exploration and a nice slow build. I loved the story itself of course (although I did see the end coming, but that was still okay, it didn't ruin it for me), I enjoyed all the puzzles (and having to solve them without any help since this game is so relatively new!), and on top of that I also really loved the game graphic and design. It felt like I was right there on this mysterious alien world-- I can only imagine how that would feel if I owned a VR device! I even enjoyed the survival aspects even if they're probably what I am the worst at. (Actually what I'm the worst at is falling off ledges in this game and hurting/near-killing myself, whoops!) Anyway to sum up, I highly, highly recommend this to anyone who likes scifi, puzzles, exploration, and a hint of a creepy factor! Enjoy!!			"

Game looks great, runs at a stready high framerate (granted, I was playing without VR, really need to try that with this game some day...), though the controls and movement was a bit sluggish, but that's pretty much my only negative about the game. Great atmosphere and a beautiful (if deadly) world, amazing story telling, and just enough danger, without making it fustrating.Do you like to explore detail rich alien worlds and uncover ancient, best left forgotten secrets?

												So far I'm really liking this game. There were some problems at launch regarding the use of head tracking to control movement direction, but they have released a patch that has made the game a lot more playable.  First person games will generally have this problem until they come up with a better way of dictacting movement direction without depending on a right analog stick on a controller.  Visually speaking, the game looks really great.  I'm a little irked by the sensor device that you hold taking up a lot of screen real estate.  Otherwise its a great foray into first person survival in VR. Looking forward to more updates!			"

												You begin The Solus Project as a crew member aboard a colony ship sent to find a new home following the destruction of Earth. After an unknown event causes you to crash land on an alien planet you find yourself wandering out into the wilderness trying to find survivors and a way to contact home.The Solus Project is by and large and exploration game with some puzzle solving with the survival aspects never really causing too much concern. I played the game on medium so if you are looking for more of a survival edge to your experience it may be worth cranking up to hard from the get go.As you explore the hostile planet it becomes clear this is not an empty planet at all as you start to uncover signs of civilisation. To not give away any spoilers I will not talk about this in detail but let’s just say that the bits of civilisation play a key part in the game’s narrative and exploration.You have a number of other items at your disposal such as a teleporter which is useful for getting through gaps and up ledges and a beacon allowing you to return if you get lost in a cave. There is also a basic crafting system allowing the creation of items such as a fire torch but this never seemed to run out and could be out away in your inventory for use later.The inventory system is actually one of my least favourite parts of the game. You can actually hold a lot of items and cycling through these can take a really long time. Especially when stood in pitch black trying to search through mountains of food and water bottles in search of the flaming torch.Visually the game is gorgeous and contains some of the best weather effects I have ever seen in a game. The tornado and meteor showers that occasionally fill the landscape are awe dropping and were one of the first times in a long time I have been genuinely impressed by graphics in a game.The pacing in the game is a little odd. The game is broken up into a series of “islands” connected by underground caves. These cave sections are usually one long corridor connected by a series of puzzles and these often felt too long to traverse. Equally while I get the idea of wanting to make the players feel like they are on a massive planet (even though we happen to crash land literally next to these alien structures) some of the outside areas are a little sparse and could do with being a little more densely packed with stuff to see and things to explore.A few little gripes aside The Solus Project is an excellent adventure game that I enjoyed playing although I do feel that the game actually being a little bit shorter and more concise would have helped it in the long run.This written review was taken from our original video review which can be found:  Here	[www.thegametutor.co.uk] "

												Sluggish, slow, boring, overhyped and VERY buggy. Not even remotely fun. Especially annoying when savegames stop working or when you have to keep trying to work around the various bugs in the graphical interface and menu's. Not much freedom to explore at all. The ""big"" islands only let you walk along a fixed path and survival ingredients are always very conviently present at the right time when you need them most. Predictable as hell. This whole game is scripted and not dynamic.Gameplay is mostly about letting you walk around a room, a cave or small outdoor sector to solve a puzzle and trying to make the world look bigger than it actually is by making you have to walk from one corner of the sector to the other and back again to push buttons and levers and collect necessary items. This is not a big world, simply a lot of small sectors stitched together combined with a slow walking speed.The story and atmosphere are kind of okay but nothing to write home about either. I get the feeling this is supposed to be more like an ""experience"" than a game. The VR with an Oculus Rift is decent and very much recommended because I can't imagine me playing this game longer than 60 minutes if I didn't have a Rift. Even if you do like this game, it's probably a one time experience at best. It has very limited replayability as it's just a scripted story.To sum it up, the game just fails at almost everything it tries to achieve:Puzzles are too boring and easy and just included to keep the total gametime artificially long, action is non existent, story is nothing special, survival is a joke, the ""big world"" is a small world. Graphics are bland but okay, music is absent, sound is okay, game is buggy.I really wished this was more like the old Unreal game and then with a bigger procedurally generated world and with survival aspects. Unreal had good graphics, fast paced action, nice puzzles, an awesome atmosphere, fast pace story telling and very good music. Guess I was wrong about this one and fell for the hype surrounding it. It could have been a winner but I'll never play it again. Maybe nice for patient people with a lot of imagination but even those would have to agree it's not more to them than a 6 out of 10 as there are far better games than this one in the ""puzzle genre"". For anyone else, it's probably a 3 out of 10. Nice try, but no cigar.			"

Finally! A survival game with a more unique environment, and luckily for me the game isn't a full-on survival game.The story is that Earth was destroyed, and Earth's citizens are moved out into space temporarily. You play as humanity's last hope, looking for a habitable planet. Unfortunately, you crash land onto an alien world.The best thing about this game is the feeling of loneliness. The atmosphere is very strong. Interestingly enough, this is a spiritual successor to the game ""The Ball"". It shares the same universe and lore. It gives me similar vibes when it comes to finding interesting architecture. This game's environment is a joy to look at. The graphics look great, and the world is filled with interesting plantlife, rock formations and ruins.As you explore, you'll find interesting new objects, or random weather effects or situations can occur. Many times I was genuinely terrified, which is great. That's due to the immersion of this game.The crafting is quite simple. You can do stuff like combine one rock with another, to sharpen one of them. Using the sharp rock, you cut some dry roots, and then wrap that around a pipe, which you can then light on fire to create a torch. That particular combination might sound a bit complex, but the game makes it quite easy. There's quite a bit of managing your inventory and resources, as the world is harsh. You need to keep on your temperature, amount of sleep, calories and hydration. Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing through, and can't wait to discover more of this interesting world.			"

												This is a really fun and immersive experience. I'm not a huge fan of survival style games, but this one kept me captivated with it's fantastic level design, interesting storyline, and really awesome world. The game's world reminds me a bit of Na Pali from Unreal 1, which is one of my favorites of all time. There were some pretty dark and scary elements, but no jump scares fortunately. Just good ol' suspense, playing on fear and expectation.I really enjoyed playing it in VR! If you have a Vive, I would put this on your list of things to play. Keep in mind, that the VR element is still in development. While I could teleport around at short distance, I used the sliding movement throughout the game. It took me a little bit to get used to, but it added to the experience once I did. I don't want to spoil the game, but there are parts that are really awe inspiring when you feel like you're standing right in front of them. It's worth it to me.My only criticism toward the game is the need for food and water. If you play the game on normal, you never really run out of supplies, as they're scattered all over. In the end the food/water mechanic kind of turns into a nanny meter that I need to fill every so often. If the the food and water meters have more of an impact on survival, (I.E. Stat boost or sickness) depending on how full/empty they are, it would add a really useful element. In my opinion, it currently does very little to impact of the game.So, that aside, if you're looking for an immersive adventure on a beautiful alien world, give this one a go. It was well worth the money.Please note: This review is based on my playthrough using the Vive/SteamVR. I only played the normal way (Desktop) to check my in game journal, which at the time of writing this I couldn't access it in VR. This game was designed for desktop play originally and VR was added in later.			"

												Really fun game to play.  The crafting/item use I think could use some adjusting (I'd like to have to do something and not just point and click.  With the VIVE the intro as well as the menu screen are freaking unreal.  If I'm not sitting then I dam sure am standing as if i was riding a snowboard or something just to keep from falling.  I swear that main menu is going to give me a heart attack.			"

												Wowzers! After completing the main story line in 21 hours I loved it immencely. I still have a lot to do secret and lore wise to complete the game fully, but im sure i'll get round to it at some point. Atomspherically it was amazing, always keeping me on my toes and creeping me out at times, I dont have a single bad thing to say about it.The open world is beautiful to look at, with environmental factors to take into, you can very easily at first be killed by being too hot, or cold, or even by the occational tornado or thunder storm. I haven't had the chance to try this in VR yet, but I imagine it is just as breathtaking :) 10/10 for atmosphere and play. If I had to say one bad thing about the game it would probably be; unless there is going to be a sequal, the ending was a little disapointing, it didn't have that umph that most endings have, so please do release another game!! I will be buying the predisesor to the Solus Project, which you have called ""the ball""...I look forward to what it is like! :) "

												I picked this game up within the first week it was in EA (I am an EA survival game recovering addict). When I learned they were going to eventually add VR support, I held off playing past the first area and waited. I am so glad I did! Not only do I now get to play through the entire game but I also get to experience something on a whole different level with VR. It really gives you the feeling you are exploring a different world. I am only a few hours in but its a great experience. I recommend this game to any VIVE (or other HMD) user looking for full on game! Its crazy because the VR experience actually made me have the strangest dreams after playing last night. The graphics are great (running on a 1070 had a huge performace boom over my old 970) the music is great, but, the immersion factor is what will keep you coming back. This game fulfills what I originally imagined VR to be like. 10/10 for providing a close encounter with a tornado which will likely never happen to me in RL while living in Arizona.			"

												This is VR only feedback.  The issue motivating me to write is the controls in VR.  I love this type of game, with crafting and exploration.  THANK YOU for locomotion option!  Huge plus!  But PLEASE improve the control scheme overall.  Please, study Vivecraft controls for the java minecraft, they are amazingly well done.  If you implement vivecraft style controls for this you would knock it out of the park.  In this game it's difficult to do simple things that you can blaze through in minecraft.  (Left trigger locomotes you wherever your left controller is pointed.  Right trigger is action.  Right Thumbpad brings up menu.  Left thumbpad jumps.  In this case maybe squeeze buttons should be for droppping.  Also, some kind of visual feedback for combining needs to be implemented.  It's so confusing combining heavy rocks into sharp rocks. (pick this up, open menu, drop that, point that at that,, it's too much.  Just maybe make a simple box style combine.)  In VR, to put oil on a torch, just poke it into the oil (or make the + action menu come up when the objects interact.  Rework that system and I'll be ready to recommend this to everyone.  As it stands I was pretty close to a refund, but I know your VR support is still experimental.I like the world, the enviroment, and the setting.  Very cool to watch a night pass in VR and see the moon go by.			"

												I have to say that this is a great game. I am playing it using the Vive, and the VR is done very well.  The only issue I have with the VR is I feel like using the teleport to move is cheating.  Without giving away anything major, there are some traps that are easily avoided by teleporting past them.  Also, it took me a while to realize that crafting 2 rocks makes a sharp rock, which can cut the fence at the beginning because I was able to teleport past the fence.Other than that, it is an amazing game thus far.

												Speaking as a virtual reality user (sitting experience), I thoroughly enjoyed completing The Solus Project.  I could write more about how much I enjoy it than space allows, but others have done so in other reviews, so let me just reiterate their glowing recommendations:  if you are a fan of sci-fi mysteries, puzzles, and exploration, this game delivers in a format that is very worthy as a virtual reality experience.  The Solus Project also has elements of survival, but for the most part those can be effectively turned off through adjusting the difficulty settings.Some specific things I would like to call particular attention to are the VR movement method, and the graphics & performance as it relates to VR.  The movement is pretty comfortable for VR.  It took me about 6-10 hours of playing and taking periodic breaks to overcome the motion sickness of a walking simulator.  There is only one point at which camera control is taken away from you, and that is at the very end, so for the overwhelming majority of the time, head movement is 1:1 with yours.  In other words, it is very comfortable.  Additionally, there is a ""camera snap"" mode where you can use a game controller to ""snap"" your direction at 45 degree bearing intervals; this makes VR very comfortable, too.  A word on the controller: very intuitive, and I did not need the keyboard for anything except once or twice for console commands.  Side note: my save game was corrupted twice, but I was able to salvage the game with these commands  fly  and  solteleport 1 .  Secondly regarding movement, the game gives you a really fun teleport device.  After mastering it with various jumping, running and throwing techniques, you can potentially teleport several hundred feet.  Takes practice, though, but still very fun.Lastly, for a VR title, the graphics translated very well to the headset.  Typically in VR conversions, objects and textures pop in or can be blurry (try finding a tank on the ground in DCS World at 5-10 miles away), but the translation in Solus Project from a conventional monitor to first gen VR headset resolution is performed very well considering the hardware limitations.  Rendering was on an i5-4690k, 16gb RAM, and GTX 970.  Only once I had to tone down the graphics, and that was due to alot of stuff moving around at the time, but for the other 99% of the game, it was a solid 60 fps.So that's it.  Game play observations are available in other reviews, but if you want to know about the VR performance, then that is what this review was for.  Bottom line:  if you want to play this on the Vive or Rift, I don't think you will be disappointed.  A great game with a great VR implementation.  Have fun, and good luck!			"

Sound design mixed with the amazingly well done environments made my jaw drop on multiple occasions.

												The Solus Project is an amazing experience. I was instantly drawn into its atmosphere and engaging gameplay. I played it through entirely in VR with the HTC Vive and it worked great. I love how the game balances the different aspects of exploration, storyline and survival, you always feel in control while making progress. You feel that you are taken care of by the game mechanics, even when it gets hard. The rhythm of the gameplay is well directed, and things are just dark and intense for the right amount of time before you get relieved to find sunshine and relaxation again, and vice versa. The storyline is one of the most interesting I've experienced in a long time and I look forward to its continuation.			"

												I played this in VR with Oculus Rift - the experience was like nothing I've ever felt in any game, I was so consistently awe-struck at how beautiful and immersive everything was I was at a loss for words trying to describe the game to my friends. My first session was 8 hours in a single day - I couldn't put it down, and the VR is done perfectly so I never once got nauseous. This should be the standard bearer for how VR is done, honestly. I don't want to give too much away because much of this game's joy lies in discovery and exploration, but you'll be looking for items, solving puzzles, and surviving the elements while exploring dark caves, mysterious ruins, and strange beaches all in a hostile alien planet... so if you like survival-horror heavy on exploration with a sci-fi twist definitely give it a shot, if you've also got a Rift/ Vive I can't recommend this game enough.

												HTC Vive review.Basically Prometheus meets The Martian. Except it's a full fleshed game and not another ""experience"".I was a bit confused by the gameplay and movement at first but make no mistake, this game is a grower. Once you'll get used to the controls you will be ready to begin a brilliant Sci-Fi aventure combining exploration, discovery and survival.The sense of presence and general atmosphere are amazing. You really feel like you're alone on this forsaken alien planet.As I was exploring this astonishingly well-crafted world I kept saying to myself ""WOW"", because thanks to VR I was THERE on the top of a giant tower looking at those 2 ominous moons hanging in the sky.Despite being focused on exploration, The Solus Project offers some cool survival aspects. The weather can be harsh (rain, thunder, extreme temperatures) but that's nothing compared to the tornadoes and the meteor showers trying to kill you occasionally. Another positive note is the sound. The effects are great and the music is top notch.I found the story quite engaging and I really recommend to everyone playing this to read all the lore infos on the stone tablets scattered across the world. It really helps to understand the ending.Technically speaking, the game ran just fine on low settings (except for textures resolution on medium) with super sampling set to 130 on my GTX 780Ti.My only problem is the same as every UE4 games in VR: that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliasing. It can really be annoying and it's a shame because The Solus Project is a gorgeous game.If you love adventure, good sci-fi and own a VR headset look no further. This is the game you're looking for.Congratulations to the team who made this. I really hope to play a sequel in the future.			"

												This game is outstanding! It is the BEST SURVIVAL GAME that I've ever played! Many other survival games fall short of excellence for one reason or another, but alas, it has been achieved! This isn't your typical game with enemies running around and fighting. This game is truly about survival. The only enemy you truly fight is the plethora of wild climate changes and climate anomalies, which will effect your health if you aren't careful. This means avoiding rain if possible, keeping cool on the hot days and warm at night, along with getting a proper rest. Sleeping is important, you must find a safe place to sleep as well. The music is great, the environment is stunning, and the game performance is excellent. Gameplay is fun and elegantly intricate with simple ways of achieving complex things (e.g. REALLLY easy to make a torch, etc.). I would recommend this game to anyone, because aside from the survival, there are tons of secrets to be found (which help you in your survival efforts). In my gameplay thus far, numerous awesome events have occurred, and I was immersed deeply in the gameplay the entire way through. This game is one of my new favorites, and I can't wait to get back to this planet to continue my survival, and my mission. I may be the last hope for those that remain out there, I must try to survive and make contact. Enjoy the game everyone! I am loving it, and I will keep my review updated as my story progresses.			"

												I love The Solus Project. It takes a genre that has seen a lot of multiplayer games in the last couple of years and instead focuses on single player. Does it work? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥it does. You are the last hope of humanity and get stranded on an alien planet. But it's not as unhabitable as most planets, as you soon find out when checking out ruins of an ancient civilization. As The Solus Project is a survival game, there are hunger, thirst, body temperature and sleep to watch out for. You can check them by looking down, as that displays a PDA with a couple of usefull things. As the planet is quite uninhabitable, you also have to watch out for different weather conditions, which include rain, snow, meteor showers and even tornados. You might be surprised to hear there is no combat in the game. As such, the focus lies entirely on exploring the planet surface, delving into spooky caves and solving all kinds of puzzles (most with the help of a teleportation device you get early on). As such, the tempo is quite slow and might not be suitable for people, looking for constant action. However, if you can appreciate taking your time and checking all nooks and crannies, you will be rewarded with artifacts, which offer mainly stat increases. Exploration is certainly rewarded.The main thing I wanted to talk about are the graphics. The Solus Project looks absolutely gorgeous and up to par to the recent AAA titles. This is expecialy visible on the surface, where everything, including the weather and sky, is very detailed and a true gem to behold. Not bad for a 5 man indie development team. Despite all that, the performance is still good, even on some less powerfull graphic card. I've had no problems running it at 60FPS on almost ultra with a GTX 960 and a i3 4150.However, The Solus Project is still not without faults. The crafting system is quite basic and hunger and thirst aren't really that big of a problem, since you can find food and water almost everywhere. Another problem is (as I've mentioned) a slow pace, which can turn some people off buying the game. As for the VR, I didn't have the chance to test it, however from what I've read in the comments, it has a couple of problems (don't take my word there, rather read the experience of someone who played the game with VR).Conclusion:The Solus Project is a well developed and gorgeous game, which is avaliable for a quite low price of 15€. It's definately worth the price, however you should be aware that it is mostly a visual adventure. Don't expect slaughtering tons of alien creatures, because you will be dissapointed, if you're after that. Final Rating: 8.5/10			"

												Amazing atmosphere for an adventure game with survival elements. Beautiful exotic alien landscapes to wander.  Love the setting and desperation you feel trying to help the last vestages of mankind. The voice acting was excellent. The mystery always leaves you wanting more. The gameplay isn't the most complex but I found the overall experience very satisfying. The tone and atmosphere of the game reminds me of the movie insterstellar. You never fight or shoot anything. Although there are a few monsters to run from horror game style. If you like sci fi where mankind struggles to survive, and adventure games with survival elements that are more about the experience than super deep gameplay, give this a try. If sci fi isn't your thing, or if you don't care for relatively light stories or adventure games, stear clear. There is a lot of walking and places to explore.			"

												Two words, Simply Amazing. Yes, there may not be much combat but I'm am 100% fine with it when there is such amazing exploration in the game with many hidden secrets where I have only found a few. It's a trie exploration game. I had this game in my library after buying it in June and playing it only for an hour and ten minutes, but I started to play again and I didn't regret it. I finished the story and II won't reveal anything, but there was this one part where it was very similar to the movie Prometheus (which you should watch). Its so similar to the movie and it made me understand more. Honestly, the texts and such on the wall, I didn't really pay attention to much. But, I always would try and hover over them to get them into my explorer diary so if I wanted, I could read it later. I don't remember where I saw this game, but I quickly knew that I had to get it. Amazing game, the story could've been better, and very well done by the creators for the effort they put into this game. 10/10 would play again.			"

								I recommend it and dont at the same time i love this game but theres one major issue i am having with it, sound keeps breaking up when only a lil over an hr in game ex 77min causing fps to drop below one and the entire thing to freeze for a minute or two. If it's a chipset compatibility issue like devs are saying they need to put a warning on the store page so ppl can make an educated purchase. Great game great story so far and great graphics. Love it all except the damn sound clutter.			"

												Played in VR. Lots of options for controls and graphics and things (good for a range of computers and preferred movement types) It's a lot of fun if you like getting into the story and mystery of what happened, and/or exploring an alien world. It's also a long experience as far as VR games go. Probably a dozen hours.			"

												It takes a lot for me to enjoy a survival game: I find most either too punishing or downright frustrating. The Solus Project manages to be neither of those, while at the same time keeping your stress level just high enough that you never feel exactly safe. The game provides you beautiful vistas and a wonderful soundtrack to admire, but then rips you back into reality by reminding you that you are rarely ever safe. This combination of peaceful and stressful moments is perfectly balanced and creates an incredibly unique experience.I played the game through on my Rift and it is one of the most complete and polished VR games to exist at the moment. VR support is amazingly well done for being experimental. The game is downright gorgeous in VR, and all of the mechanics translate over well. The only qualm I have is that inventory management—scrolling in one direction through each inventory item individually—got annoying near the end, especially when you're dealing with extremes in temperature and really don't want to pull out your torch in a scorching hot environment.The gameplay is relatively simple while at the same time never feeling too easy. Your basic goals are to survive and keep moving forward: you have to maintain your basic vitals (body temperature, hydration, and nourishment) while moving into new areas, each one more deadly than the last. There's an old-school point-and-click feel in the mechanics, with much of your time spent searching for that one special item or finding ways to combine the items available to you. There are tons of secrets hidden off of the beaten path, and hunting them down while oftentimes risking your life is a lot of fun.The game's story is enthralling and plays itself out in both passive (pages from journals, tablets with carved language/images, one-way transmissions to your character) and active (interacting with alien lifeforms) ways. Despite being battered by the elements, I felt compelled to hunt down as many pieces of the story as I could to better understand the situation upon Gliese-6143-C. A few of the later transmissions you recieve are downright harrowing, with incredible voice acting bringing poignant feelings of isolation and desperation across.Near the end of the game I was legitimately sad that my time on Gliese-6143-C was coming to a close. I definitely have to say that I got my money's worth, and I really hope to see more games from these devs!			"

												This game is great. I bought it after they implemented VR support and have been playing/streaming it on the Vive. The atmosphere in the game is incredibly immersive with great sound direction and music. The visuals are beautiful, even on low settings, and the story and gameplay are interesting and addictive. These devs are very dedicated to making a quality experience, in VR or otherwise, and it shows. Definitely worth picking up. If you have the Vive, play it on that. It's amazing and one of the better VR titles available at the moment. Certainly the longest story-based game out on the Vive as of my writing this review.			"

												*HTC Vive Review*Obviously I just started the game (only two hours on record), but this game is so awesome in VR that I really had to write a review!You're stranded on a weird alien planet, not knowing what is going on here, what dangers await you, and with a vast, beautiful landscape to look at. Sounds awesome? It really is!I really love how dynamic the landscape appears to be and how dangerous this new environment feels - yes, nothing really jumps you (at least not that far in the game), but you certainly feel threatened. The atmosphere is really fantastic which it manages to uphold the whole time.VR controls:It's really great that you can adjust so many options - do you prefer to walk around yourself? There you go. Do you prefer teleporting around? There's also an option for that. The controls themselves are not perfect (not very intuitive), but after a while you certainly will get used to them.Overall I think this is one of the greatest experiences which I had so far on the HTC Vive and I'm really looking forward to continue the story!---------------EDIT: As of the 07.11.2016, I'm still very excited about this game and also stacked up some more gaming experiences:The developers overworked the VR controls and they are now really great - instead of scrolling though your whole inventory, you now can select the preferred item by looking at it in a big inventory screen. This works really well and is so much better than before!Also you are now able to press buttons on your device via your other vive controller, which makes for instance the whole sleep process much easier than before.Overall, this game is still one of the most rewarding and complete experiences I had so far for the HTC Vive.

												Unfortunately, I should not recommend this game, but I'm going to.  It is my favorite VR game so far and I've got quite a few of them.  It puts you in a world that looks beautiful and badass.  A few hours in, you will encounter some skin crawling situations and in VR you are right in the middle of it.  It is an amazing experience and quite possibly the best survival game.  There is a good chance, however, that you will encounter a bug in which the loading screen takes literal hours to complete(even outside of VR on a PC above recommended specs).  Also, from what I have read, a lot of people are just getting an error message and wait time is not an option.  You may Love this game.  Then again, if you encounter this after becoming overwhelmingly addicted, you will hate it.  Okay, I don't hate it.  I'm just freaking out and need to get my fix.  This game is my drug.			"

								This game has some of the best and most interesting planetary exploration I've experienced. I liked searching for their secrets, it was awesome that they were included in the first place being that most games secrest are pretty lack luster. Their environments felt hostile and dangerous, and they had me creeping around every corner. I enjoyed the survival elements, I felt like they were prominant enough in the game where I wanted to get into them but not so overwhelming and complex that I was put off by it all. I very much like this game, a very well done experience. more of a mystery at this point than anything and I love that. I feel like if this game was a movie that it would be the first half of Prometheus. I absolutely love it.			"

												Okay, I just finished playing this game. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to play. There are some tricky bits, however, there are not too many major puzzles that you find and completely stump you. Which is personally what I like when it comes to this kind of game. There was plenty of story line that is so very well thought out, all you have to do is take the time to read it. Huge plot twist at the end which I was not expecting. I fully recommend for anyone who wants to play an explorative survival game.			"

												Probably the best space archaeology game of 2016 - and we're only halfway through the year. You have survived the wreck of a scouting mission to a potential colony world. Your mission now is to keep surviving, build a transmitter and discover the secrets of a mysterious planet. Those secrets are multi layered and engaging enough to keep your interest to the very end of the game, in a setting of gorgeous, deadly and fiendishly puzzling alien ruins and landscapes.Strongly recommended!

 A True AdventureI remember seeing The Solus Project first showcased at E3 2015.  I was immediately intrigued by the idea of playing as a sole survivor on an unknown alien planet.  Fast forwarded to February 2016.  A friend mentioned this neat new game that came out for early access.  Low and behold it was The Solus Project, released as the first episode.  I immediately bought it and began my adventure.  The game opens up with you, the seemingly sole survivor of a scout ship explosion in oribt above the planet known as Gliese 6143-C.  You find yourself in slight confusion as debris from your ship surrounds you and continues to fallf rom the sky.  But once you get your bearings, the adventure really begins. Your immediate goal  is to build a communication tower to get in contact with the rest of the Human fleet lying somewhere amongst the stars.  I was truly blown away by the world set before me.  Never have I been in an environment so alien, yet there exists elements that give it Earthly similarities.  This perfect balence reminded me that planets like this truly must exist somewhere out there.  Exotic looking beaches, massive rocky outcrops, and bizarre flora define Gliese 6143-C as truly alien.  For a time you feel as if Gliese is completely untouched, but soon you realize it was once inhabited by a race of humanoid beings.  Explore the ruins and stories left behind by these people and discover the secrets behind Gliese 6143-C.Perhaps one of the most interesting elments of The Solus Project is the lack of enemies.  Most of the game relies on you walking from point A to B, mostly unhindered by any physical antagonist.  However, something just as deadly surrounds you at all times--The environment.Yes, that's right.  The environment can and will kill you.  The planet will do what it can to make your adventure difficult.  The weather is caustic and unpredictable.  Daily temperatures can reach 115 degrees Farhenheit, then the next thing you know a brutal storm rolls in and you're running for your life from a violent tornado.Apart from surviving the elements, you must find food and water--Oh, and periodically find a safe place to sleep.  You will be required to plan carefully as to not blow through your supplies.  I highly recommend The Solus Project for anyone looking for a good story while still having a strong focus on survival.

												As played on a high rig PC.A pity this game's interface is such rubbish because it had the makings of something good, special even. But the muddled procedure you have to go through to combine items and 'craft' them is terrible. It took a while before I found I had to discard items and then find a different item from the inventory to modify the discarded one. So if you want to eat canned food you find a tin, discard it, perform clicks to open the can with a sharp rock, then pick up said can again and click to eat the content. Clumsy, barmy, inane. Whoever concocted this convoluted method must have had common sense lessons from a confused monkey that fell out of a tree while trying to learn the alphabet backwards.Graphically the game is pretty good and the scenario is sound enough, only in my view the implementation is awful. The inventory system needs an overhaul (well, trashing actually). Why not have a designated key for eating and drinking from items possessed, if not text options to click on? Simple. This is so basic and fundamental it's quite amazing how some folk like to complicate the mechanics of the simplest of tasks as if eating and drinking is a challenging riddle in itself. Despair. At the outset you have to exit from a small area. However, I decided jumping was the most logical means but there was an artifical barrier that stopped me from simply dropping a couple of feet over to the other side. Hmm, bad start, I thought and wasn't proved wrong. After wandering around the beaches for hours searching for numerous parts to build a comms rig I became tired of eating , drinking, being advised my suit was wet, etc etc, and decided to see 1/ How far I could scale the cliffs, and 2/ If I could swim to the other islands not too far out to sea. I managed to scale the cliffs with some effort while logically thinking that there must be ship debris up there to collect. But no, nothing whatsover despite the wreckage strewn on the beaches  below. An opportunity missed surely. Regarding swimming to the other islands, you can't because you hit an invisible barrier halfway there.Is this really open world? Well, yes, but in a restrictive sort of way. I think this game needs to be thought out more. For starters ditch the clumsy inventory interface and the continual reminders you're wet, thirsty, hungry, etc. Yawn... If this is a survival game let's have options to turn off the hand-holding. On that note I am personally sick of the Simple Simon approach to most game designs these days as if evey player has an IQ lower than a gorilla with dementia.The game promised a lot but there needs to be more freedom and intelligent structure. It needs a better user experience even at budget price. Work in progress I guess but 8/10 for effort and visuals. "

												After a buggy start, a patch was forthcoming and my woes were cured. i started the game again and played it through in a DK2. The vista's are awe inspiring, the game play is challenging, the puzzles are well thought out. But the thing that stays with me was the last island... when i approached the massive building there were tornados everywhere, they sweep right past you and lift you off your feet. It was the most immersive a game has ever been, i was wiping my head to get the rain off me! its probably one of the most impressive things i have seen in VR so far! Its one of those games i remember as an actual memory rather than a playthrough. VR can do that to you if its done right and these guys did it! It has its issues, some of the paths are not very clear and you might stumble about looking for certain items to progress for an overly long time.. but since you are actually in the world, thats forgiveble as soon as you look up and see the sky or the massive statues or any number of other eye candies. It ran very well on the DK2 with a sub par machine on high settings. i ran it on medium in the end as some bits were taxing but thats purely my rig. Overall it did very well. I give it 8/10 (it loses 1 point for the ending being totally illogical and 1 point for slightly hard to read PDA in oculus.. both fixable) i wont elaborate on the ending as i dont want to spoil anything. Definitely worth the cash to play in VR. I cant comment on how engrossing it is on a monitor as i didn't try it that way, it seemed pointless after experiencing it rather than playing it. Very nice game. well done!			"

								Really good potential and it's promising. LOVE IT SO FAR. I've waited for the game's release since I first saw it, and now I've been playing mostly offline non-stop since their early access release.Love the survival style and setting: aka ARK on an alien planet.The graphics are good, since it's running on Unreal Engine 4. The world is just amazing. It is gorgeous and at the same time frightening. The secrets the story has (episodic?) is SO GOOD.If I'm going to compare this game to something, it would be the universe of Prometheus and Alien. The dark dungeons, the outside world. PERFECT. Just without the snake-like Facehugger. Although you'll find similar ""eggs"" relatable to the movies later in the game. I'd say this game is really worth the little money the devs are asking for, though it just came out on early access and probably have flaws somewhere, however, I've had zero problems throughout the game.

												The Solus Project takes a rather simple concept of exploration and survival and wraps a fascinating story around it. Obviously it's not as polished as some triple A titles, but you can tell a lot of care went into the game. The music, art design, and gameplay are really all flawless. There's a little less action in this than say DOOM, but some of us like taking it slower and exploring rather than blasting away.The story itself is what draws you in to this game and will have you addicted to finding one clue after another. While it is a pretty great story overall there are a few speedbumps. There are some horror elements which I wasn't really looking for and they use some very cliche scares. That said, they're so cliche they can almost be overlooked. There are some plotholes that don't quite get resolved in any meaningful way, left open for you to interpret as you like. That was the developers intent though, not an accident, and for that I actually give them credit of really pulling it off well. They draw on a lot of rather obvious other sources for some great ideas, games like Tomb Raider and Half Life, stories like The Martian and Lost. They're brought together quite neatly and I was not at all disappointed in the ending.Overall a great game to get on sale.			"

												The Solus Project takes a rather simple concept of exploration and survival and wraps a fascinating story around it. Obviously it's not as polished as some triple A titles, but you can tell a lot of care went into the game. The music, art design, and gameplay are really all flawless. There's a little less action in this than say DOOM, but some of us like taking it slower and exploring rather than blasting away.The story itself is what draws you in to this game and will have you addicted to finding one clue after another. While it is a pretty great story overall there are a few speedbumps. There are some horror elements which I wasn't really looking for and they use some very cliche scares. That said, they're so cliche they can almost be overlooked. There are some plotholes that don't quite get resolved in any meaningful way, left open for you to interpret as you like. That was the developers intent though, not an accident, and for that I actually give them credit of really pulling it off well. They draw on a lot of rather obvious other sources for some great ideas, games like Tomb Raider and Half Life, stories like The Martian and Lost. They're brought together quite neatly and I was not at all disappointed in the ending.Overall a great game to get on sale.			"

												After a buggy start, a patch was forthcoming and my woes were cured. i started the game again and played it through in a DK2. The vista's are awe inspiring, the game play is challenging, the puzzles are well thought out. But the thing that stays with me was the last island... when i approached the massive building there were tornados everywhere, they sweep right past you and lift you off your feet. It was the most immersive a game has ever been, i was wiping my head to get the rain off me! its probably one of the most impressive things i have seen in VR so far! Its one of those games i remember as an actual memory rather than a playthrough. VR can do that to you if its done right and these guys did it! It has its issues, some of the paths are not very clear and you might stumble about looking for certain items to progress for an overly long time.. but since you are actually in the world, thats forgiveble as soon as you look up and see the sky or the massive statues or any number of other eye candies. It ran very well on the DK2 with a sub par machine on high settings. i ran it on medium in the end as some bits were taxing but thats purely my rig. Overall it did very well. I give it 8/10 (it loses 1 point for the ending being totally illogical and 1 point for slightly hard to read PDA in oculus.. both fixable) i wont elaborate on the ending as i dont want to spoil anything. Definitely worth the cash to play in VR. I cant comment on how engrossing it is on a monitor as i didn't try it that way, it seemed pointless after experiencing it rather than playing it. Very nice game. well done!			"

												I'm only a few hours into the game, and so far I've loved it. I say this coming from the perspective of playing it on the HTC Vive. I'm usually not a fan of games that involves survival aspects, so from that,  I can assume the VR experience really elavated my opinion about the game  even though  it is still not  100% VR ready. So if you're like me and is still breathtaken by a well made VR experience, definitely give this one a try. For whoever is experiencing low frame rate on the Vive, just uncheck the vsync box.			"

												Have you been thinking about buing the Solus Project? Now is the perfect time to get it. If you are an owner of the Oculus or HTC Vive the better for you, i would love to play this game with one of these, unfortunately i dont own one of these devices yet, but hopefuly i will in a fev months. I bought this game couple months ago in early access, first i wasn´t very impressed, but after a couple of hours in i was amazed just how good this game is, it had a fev bugs here and there on the release, but with every update and rlease of next part (3 in total, now the game is complete) it got better and better, the game is smoooth and runs like butter:) i can´t see any bugs, it is well optimized and polished by now, Unreal engine does a great job.I don´t know how to describe it the best, for me this is a game of the year, almost 150 hours in it and still playing. You can finish the game in about 15 to 18 hours if you are in just for the story, but the game is not just about the story, there are some survival elements, you can choose your difficulty and play the game the way you like it to play, there is only a little to guid you through, you can have it hardcore survival or an easy to play game, the choice is yours.Ambient Atmosphere is what this game does the best, the soundtrack is beautiful, the environments are amazing and the world is just.. sometimes i just stop and look around enjoying the scenery. You will encounter lightning storms, meteor showers, tornados, alien creatures, earthquakes and much more. You will also die, die of hypothermia, heatstroke, dehydration, toxicity, hunger and more, you will get lost in deep secret caves, there are secrets within secrets within secrets.If you are prepared to walk a lot, then get this game, you wont regret it.Here is an example of a secret cave.

												""You dawg, I heard you like secrets so I secreted a secret into your secret.""A survival genre game with a definite classic adventure game feel where the thrills are 100% exploration. The Solus Project's high quality aestetics and richly drawn storyline are a welcome change after playing a string of unpolished Early Access survival games, There is zero base-building or environmental alteration. But you do feel a sense of home in a cave or piece of wreckage that you cache found supplies in that you repeatedly use as shelter for a few nights before moving on. This sense of home is more vibrant than a home base you made yourself. When the environment offers you shelter, it has a sense of being a nurturing Other rather than a constructed base that is an extension of Self. It's hard to explain but it is art at its best.Likewise, the story is 'discovered' as you explore in the form of found ship's logs and ruins rather than being thrust upon you via scripted events, quests, or NPC dialogue. This creates suspense in the same way as characters in a scary movie wandering a creepy basement stumble upon a cursed book.  It makes the player feel as though they are accompanying their character on the adventure rather than in other games where you control and direct the character in a procedural sandbox.Just an exquite game that slowly reveals its many secrets at a delicious pace that allows you to savor the plot as your capacity to survive allows you to explore the world around you more fully before you seek shelter in a storm or at nightfall.A must-buy for any fan of sandbox survival games who have forgotten how satisfying a constructed survival game can be when you aren't distracted by sand castle building in a meaningless procedural world (and I love games like that).

												Absolutely brilliant in VR! The environments are very unique and incredibly rendered, and is probably the most immersive game I've ever played, especially while in VR.It has a fantastic story subtly laid out through visual storytelling in the details of the setting, greatly boosted by great use of VR and interactions with the environment. Solus reminds me a lot of other titles that have excelled in this area like Metroid Prime and the Dark Souls series. The gameplay is exploration focused, with some survival mechanics thrown in for good measure (don't worry if you aren't into survival sims; those types of games don't really hold my interest, and it's a relatively small part of the title outside of managing your character's temperature, hunger, and thirst, which are done very well in a non-obtrusive way that only adds a greater immersion.) The most interesting mechanic is the teleportation disc, which is a lot of fun once you get a hang of the physics behind it and get through some great ""AHA"" moments with some teleporation based puzzle solving. Think Portal with frisbees, and you're most of the way there.You'll be exploring fascinating underground ruins and architecture as well as the unique landscapes, and have to survive disastrous conditions, like waking up in the open with a tornado coming your way, or intense thunder storms or heat waves, to name a few of the interesting dynamic obstacles. To say much more would spoil some of the best parts of the game. There some great surprises here :)I do have to say that I can't recommend playing this in VR if you are easily frightened, because there are some very intense moments, to the point where I'd say it outshines most modern horror titles with some truly terror inducing scenarios and suffocating atmosphere at times, especially with how immersive this game can be in VR. But if you can handle these stretches, or enjoy horror, you'll have a blast!I can't recommend Solus Project enough for anyone who loves games with a great setting and a drive to explore.			"

												This is a review of the HTC vive VR Version.To make it quick: AWESOME! BUY IT! NOW!A little longer review: THe game focuses on exploration  and is quite simply stunning to look at. The roomscale is integrated nicely and trackpad motion is available, I usually use short distance teleportation however. Sometimes teleportation is a little glitchy, twice now I was able to teleport to places I shouldn't have been able to yet, and once I couldn't get out again, but these are only minor annoyances compared to how great the game is. Some stages were frightening, some really creepy and some truely beautiful. I haven't finished the game yet but so far it is really great and I can't recommend buying enough, even at full price. If this is on sale not getting the Solus Project is just plain stupid I reckon.Update: Finished it now, and I stand by my initial impression, great game, feels like it was made for VR. The Ending wasn't really great though imho and the credits didn't work in the VIVE, I thought the game had crashed for a while as I was in Space and nothing happened anymore.			"

												This is a space/survial-exploring game where you are the last hope of human kind, and need to explore one of the possible liveable planets.If you like REAL survival games, space games and good story games, this is defenitely for you, don't listent to those bad reviews, go and check for yourself, they are complaning about the things that make a survival game a SUVIVAL GAME, things like dying of hypothermia, insolation, starvation, storms, meteorites etc.Another thing some ppl are complaning about is the lack of map, yes, there is no map or mini map, so you need to memorize the terrain you are exploring, this is maybe a bad or good thing for you, depends on tastes, for me is a good thing due to the kind of game this is; SURVIVAL. If you are looking for a good survival game (not too hard either), a good story, good graphics, if you like space movies with intereseting plot like ""the marcian"", ""interestellar"", ""space odyssey"" don't even think about it and BUY IT, but if you are looking more for an action game where you need to beat the hell out of aliens, stay away! this game is not for you, although if you are looking for something diferent, a no-too-hard survival game, you need to give it a try, just be pacient.9/10 Awesome!!, very original, interesting plot and gameplay.

												Where to begin... I played through this within 2 days, 12 hours in total. Needless to say I binged it, because it had me hooked. I played in VR with my Oculus Rift and gamepad.The setup seems quite simple, crashed on an alien planet with survival elements. However it reveals to be quite a neat narrative driven game with lots of exploration. Some survival elements like hunger and thirst didn't seem that hard to satisfy (the levels are littered with food and water), but maintaining body temperature gets interesting in some places.Exploration is the core of its appeal and, especially in VR, there are some crazy, ominous, beautiful and terrifying sights to behold in this game. It's perfect  for people that like to immerse themselves in virtual worlds. It gives a glimpse of what future big-budget VR gaming will hopefully deliver more of.On the VR side of things, it's very much a VR adaption, not a core VR game. It is a pretty good adaption but you'll need your VR legs. I recommend playing seated with a gamepad.I did find some bugs and sequence breaks along the way (it felt like I managed to shoot teleporter pads much further than intended), but generally things are pretty solid. Do play with async reprojection (at the time of writing in the SteamVR beta) or Oculus' ATW, since performance can dive under 90 fps in places.			"

												An amazing game - possibly my favourite game of all time.  If you're an SF fan, and ever imagined living on a distant planet, this is for you!  This is probably about as close as you will get to ""The Martian"" film as a video game.  After crashing, you are thrown in at the deep end, and must learn to surive before the harsh environment of this alien world kills you.  You must find food, water, shelter & tools, while dealing with temperatures that fluctuate wildly over the day & night, and violent rapidly-changing weather.  And just when you think you're managing to surive, the story takes some unexpected turns (you might not be alone...), which will see you travelling to new places, all the while struggling to survive.  These continually provide you with new challenges, so you never get bored (nor find things getting too easy).And despite being created by ""indie"" developers, this is a HUGE game, with massive sprawling areas, and tons of gameplay.  And the graphics are amazingly beautiful, while the sounds fit very well.  It's taken me upto 33 hours to finish (probably less due to Steam counting time paused).  (No doubt you could rush through it, and maybe finish it in half the time, but then I think you'd miss half the stuff & have half the fun.)But if you are looking for a first-person shooter (where you kill lots of aliens), or a horror game to scare you, then please look elsewhere!  This game is about exploration & the struggle for survival on an alien world, with a story & several mysteries that you gradually uncover.  There are definitely horror elements (especially later in the game), but it's not the central focus of the game.On the down side, while the major plot points are voiced, much of the smaller parts of the story are told through tons of short bits of text scattered everywhere, which you can find & read.  I'm not a fan of this kind of story telling in games, and even though time slows down while you read them, time does still pass (especially as the text appears gradually), so it's harder to survive if you spend time reading them!  What I now do is glance at the bits of text, which stores it in my ""Journal"", and then occasionally pause the game & read them from my Journal instead.  At the very least the game ought to completely pause while you read the text.  And I'd have preferred less individual bits of text to read (it's not essential but you will miss-out on the background story of how things ended-up as they are... which will mean you won't fully understand the ending of the game).Another down side is that the game's performance can drop very badly after playing it for a few hours, almost as if it is running out of memory (due to a memory leak).  Quitting & restarting the game will fix that.Apart from that, the game feels VERY polished.  They must have play-tested it heavily, because although challenging, it's almost impossible to be completely lost or overlook something important.  (Despite it's huge sprawling areas & freedom to do whatever you want.)I highly recommend buying this game, even at full price.  It's massive value-for-money.  Just don't expect tons of voice acting...  Nor an ending that doesn't leave itself open to a sequel!			"

												The games' trailer got me hyped, and the gameplay didn't let me down!I can just downright recommend this game. I got immediately hooked by the trailer videos and got the game shortly afterwards.The game places you as a lone survivor of an expedition searching for a new homeworld for humanity. You must learn how to survive and slowly unravel the secrets of the archipelago you find yourself stranded on.The atmosphere always manages to be somewhat eerie und at times, can scare the heck out of you. At one point, the game sent an unexpected, ice-cold shiver down my spine!Important parts of the story are told by your character, however, I highly recommend you always keep an eye out for readable objects in-game since they add a lot to the story. The story itself is nicely told as it slowly but steadily walks you through the events that took place on the islands before you can finally communicate back home.Survival definetely has its place in the game. The environment is hostile and you have to plan carefully to avoid hazards. At the same time, exploring also is a big part of the game. There are lots of challenge rooms and secrets to be found that can also provide perks for your character, helping you to survive.Overall, I can say I really enjoyed The Solus Project. If you like science-fiction adventures with survival and riddle elements, along with a really scary atmosphere, then this game is definetely for you!			"

												This is a nice survival based adventure. You get dropped on an alien planet and you have to gather pieces to build a radio while figuring out what is going on and what happend to your ship. More you have to keep track of your environment so that you don't run out of food or water.I've played it all in VR and it's pretty good. Tracking and movmenet works just fine and makes you feel there.The only problems I've encoutered are: - stairs (you have to point to the horizontal part of the steps which if horrible when you want to go up).- Interactions. You just point at two objects and pull the trigger to get them to interact. It would be more imersive if you would have to get them to touch.- Getting lost in caves, but I guess that's intended.Overall is a good VR game, and I hope the developers fix the last missing bits.

												This game even if not perfect is really enjoyable on the HTC Vive. The focus is mainly on exploration and does not requires reflexes or shooting skills. The ambiance is well done and you truly lose yourself on the planet and its caves!Plus it has the advantage to be a ""Real"" game (8h and still not finish) rather than an experience or a demo for the Vive.If you have an HTC Vive and like ambiance game, with a good story and nice immersion do not hesitate.

												So, I ended up really enjoying this game, which isnt typical of me and exploration games. The Solus Project sets a really good vibe from the start and looks absolutely amazing. During my gameplay, I ended up staying up too late a few nights during the week since I didnt want to stop exploring. The only thing I'd like to see is a NewGame+ without having to worry about survivability and stats (increased speed), allowing pure exploration.Anyways, if you get the chance, definitely pick this game up or add it to your wishlist for those steam sales. I also suggest getting it bundled with ""The Ball"", also by Teotl Studios/Grip Digital.			"

												If you have a VR HMD, go buy this gameYou will really feel you're there, on that alien planet, with all its amazing day night cycles, weather events, dark caves and unnerving mysteries. Large open worlds absolutely shine in VR, and more are desperately needed. Now the game is not perfect, controls for the Vive are kind of unintuitive. Also, although it has been made clear that the game is about exploration and survival some more action would have been nice.In any case, I hope to see more, in a DLC or a sequel. There are too many things left unanswered.			"

												This was a new genre to me, exploration/survival.  I found the plot and world compelling enough to want to keep exploring.  I found myself reacting in a very realistic way - fleeing from threats or cowering behind rocks to avoid the elements.  I'd recommend the game to anyone who thinks they might like this type of game, it's a satisfying play for the money			"

												The Solus Project is a survival-lite adventure in a world that is dripping in atmosphere. While the lacklustre story let's it down slightly, the sense of isolation and intrigue as you explore the game world remains strong throughout. Mechanically, the game offers some minimal survival elements as well as inventory management and basic puzzle solving. With no map to keep track of where you are or where you've been, navigating the game world can also be a challenge at times.Those looking for a deep survival simulation will probably want a little more than what's on offer here, but as a lightweight adventure with a strong sense of exploration and discovery The Solus Project delivers in spades.

												I am torn. I enjoyed the hell out of 99% of this game. It was immersive. Frightening. Intriguing. Some puzzles were challenging. I did not play in VR but plan on doing so once I get a headset. But...The ending. I kept hoping for something. Anything. Some way to avoid what happens. I keep looking for a sequel or content patch. It isn't that I'm disappointed. I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Truthfully though, the ending is probably fairly realistic. But to go through so much, survive so much, spend that much time, and to have it end on that note? Lame. Super. Lame.Still, the rest of the game is quite enjoyable. I remember the areas fondly, almost as if I'd been there on vacation. And that's without VR. I'm assuming VR will make it even better. Enjoy it while you can. Definitely play. It is worth it, but be ready to want to kick aliens in whatever area hurts the most on an alien by the very end.			"

												Solus project catched my eye when I was looking for a single player space-themed survival game. I do not recall anymore when I saw the forst video clips of it (or heard any news of it), but nevertheless I had been following its stream for a while thinking whether this would be the game satisfying my futuristic survival needs.I finally decided to go for it and boy it did not let me down. Somehow the atmosphere in Solus really makes you think you are alone and you HAVE TO survive. The goals drive you towards nicely, leave room for exploration and there is no dull moment during the journey. Let me rephrase dull here: this is 100% single player survival. You do not meet pals, you do not talk to npcs, etc. By definition that means ""dull"" but in this context its completely the opposite. I just loved every single hour I spend with the Solus Project leaving no rocks turned trying to solve how do I get out of the planet. Take a word of notice, if you are not willing to spend time thinking, digging and studying Solus you will miss a lot. This is not a fast paced fps mmorpg, do not expect it to be one. This is you, alone on a alien planet. Surviving. At all costs.Highly recommended! <3			"

												An interesting take on exploration and survival games. Very well done. The visuals, sounds and story all intermesh perfectly to make this a great game. My only gripe was the lack of a mapping system. You would think that a civilization advanced enough to build starships and fly to distant planets would have the technology to incorperate a map in their hand held PDA devices. Does this ruin the game experience, not at all. But it severly handycaps the player that wants to explore everything and find all the misc items in the game. I give this game 1-1/2 thumbs up.			"

(where most videogames fail halfway through it)I Recommend this game for players who are searching for survival/story and just wanna enjoy what the game has to offer for you! "

												I don't know what to say about this... but I loved this game!  The story, from beginning to end (especially the ending) had me feeling in a way in which very few games have.  I have to say that this game was well worth the price.  Now for the pros and cons.The biggest strength of this game, for me at least, was they story and feeling of suspence.  Learning bits and pieces of what was going on on the planet and what had happened.  I kept finding myself lost in reading the tablets and diagrams of the planet's previous inhabitants.  The artwork is, without a doubt, beautiful... I would end up taking numberous screenshots of the landscape or architecture (more than I usually would from most other games)  Another thing is the survival aspect.  I love survival based games, especially survival horror, where you have to deal with limited resources and limited inventory.  You have to plan ahead or else have a difficult time surviving or dying.Now for the downsides.  The constant alerting of your character's survial device (PDA?) got on my nerves, constantly say ""Operator Wet"" ""Operator Cold"" ""Operator Tired"" over and over and over within a minute of saying it. I don't mind reminders,  but so frequently, it was annoying.  Another things was trying to collect the radio parts.. you have to bascially scavange real hard to find them and you can't miss one or else you'll have to retrace your steps. I missed one piece and spent near 3 hours running around to figure out which island I'd left it on.  Maybe a... better homing signal or something?That's really all I could think of. There were a few minor irriations... but overall, they can be gotten around. If improved with an update... that'd be awesome and make the game that much better.  So my conclusion is that this game is one of the best I've played.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes survival, horror, mystery, and exploration type games.			"

This is the first game I've played that carried the previously mentioned stuff I hate, but did them all perfect. I'm not that far into it, but I can't wait to see where it goes. There is a story here, and the presentation, the excecution, make you want to keep going. To see where it takes you. I'm not kidding, you really get sucked into making sure you see the next day. Seeing that next sunrise is such a relief. Kudos to the dev's. Clearly, a tremendous amount of work went into this. It shows. ::high five:: "

ACHIVEMENTS:  has more than 6  below 1% seldom achived achivements to harvest !!!First hour I was completely overwelmed, but slowly learned to survive and made it though the complete game. Some simple crafting at start is all you need to survive, but gets more and more unimportant in following chapters.Good thing is, this is *NO* FPS-shooting game. Main focus is completely on exploration aspect.Some places will still give you the creeps, while several foe types will need you avoid them.You boldy can push your path forward, because later you open shortcuts back and reconnect all places.

												Ho-Lee-CARP! Where to start?First off, let me first state that I love Survival-esque games. I've put many upon many hours in ARK: Survival Evolved and quite a few in Conan Exiles so far. There are others too, but those two were my more recent favorites. However, those types of games are better played in groups! And since my friends rarely - if ever - tend to stick to a game long enough to play, or are rarely on at the same times as me, I was thrilled to find Solus Project listed as a Single-Player Survival Game.To be fair, as of yet I haven't fully completed the game. Basically, I play a section, then watch a few play-thrus up to the point I'm at and judging by the amount of videos remaining I'd say I'm only about a fifth of the way through the game. However, so far I've been overcome with Awe and Inspiration! Love and Adoration! And also Fear and Conflict!The visuals are absolutely breathtaking! I could stand at the beginning and just take screenshot after screenshot and have an entire library of amazing landscapes that will leave everyone in my household ""Ooooh""ing and ""Aaawww""ing all week long! The attention to detail, the perfection in the way the grass and the trees sway in the wind. The way the water laps on the shore. The way the meteors, falling/shooting stars, Tornados and rainstorms seem so real!! The developers knew exactly what they were doing when making this visually appealing and so lifelike!Their time and dedication in placing just the right dabble of lore and history to keep me looking and exploring for more was absolutely perfect! There's always something to look at, something to draw your attention, something to keep you guessing and eager to learn more! They have the small subtle nods to keep you on track, of course. The PDA does good to remind you every once in a while what your main objective is without being too obstructive. But there's always that gnawing alure of, ""Where does that hallway go?"" ""Where did this cable come from?"" ""What's that glowing thing over there?!""And the music is not only downright beautiful to listen to (this very well might be the only game I actually consider buying the soundtrack from) but it helps immerse you so fully into the game that you sometimes forget you're playing and truly feel a part of what's actually happening! It blends so wonderfully that I had begun to notice that it was swaying my emotions with its rhythm! In soft chiming whispers, I was left in awe at the scenery. In the more somber and sad tunes, I had moments of helplessness where I thought for sure I was either facing inevitable and lonely/slow death (by freezing, starving or injury) or just going to succumb to the depression of truly being alone. And then there were times where the music would slowly and subtly rise and I'd find myself near the point of crying and running away before ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself in fear!To be fair, I scare easily. I can't watch zombie movies without having nightmares for weeks! And even though this game is - for the vast majority of it thus far - practically harmless, I've had a few moments of sheer dread! I had moments where things would happen, the music would swell and send shivers all up and down my spine, my heart would start pounding, my breath would shorten and I literally paused the game in a panic, sing the ""NOPE!"" song and had to walk away to calm down. I even considered trying to talk my husband into finishing that section for me because of all the NOPES! I gave!I managed to get through it! And so far, I haven't had any nightmares from it yet (I'm betting I still will) but that's just the impact I've gotten so far. To have gone through all that and STILL want to keep playing! STILL wanting to continue the story and find out if I will survive despite the possibility of losing so much sleep:You know it's gotta be a damn good game.			"

												The Solus Project is a first person exploration and survival game, set in the distant future, after Earth has been destroyed. The last Human survivors are aboard a deep space colony ship, and the player is one of several scouts who have been sent out in search of a planet capable of sustaining life. After crash landing on your assigned planet, your goal is to stay alive long enough to repair a communication tower, and report back to the colony.As you explore the planet, you need to keep an eye on hunger, thirst and exhaustion meters. Fortunately there's plenty of food and water to be found, and you have a large inventory capacity, so running out is never really a problem. You can sleep almost anywhere which also restores health. The biggest danger comes from the environment, especially when you're on the planet surface, which is rarely a safe place to be. At night the temperature is freezing, and if you become wet because of rain or swimming through deep water, you can quickly die from hypothermia. Meanwhile, during the day, some areas are really hot, which can lead to death from heatstroke. You'll also occasionally encounter extreme weather anomalies such as tornados, lightning storms and meteor showers. When you venture underground, you'll find many hazards such as spike traps, land mines, killer plants, ice caves, acid lakes and boiling lava.The developers have done a really great job of creating a planet that truly feels alien. As you explore deeper, you'll begin to uncover the ruins of an ancient civilization. You'll find massive buildings and machines, and historical records written in a strange language. And without wanting to spoil too much, you're not alone on this planet. There isn't any combat as such, you don't get any weapons, but there are things down there that want to kill you. I had one particular encounter in a very dark area that genuinely freaked me out a little.You can find or craft objects to help you survive, such as torches to see in the dark or crystals to increase or decrease your temperature. There are hidden artefacts that buff your resistances to negative status effects. And you also get a teleportation device, which functions kind of like the old Unreal Tournament translocator, and can help you reach higher ledges or avoid hazards. The game is let down slightly by a poor user interface and inventory system, which has several flaws. For example, when I was trying to collect some dried roots to combine with a lead pipe to craft a torch, the first thing you need to do is use something sharp to cut the roots down. I had two different sharp objects in my inventory, so the game popped up another menu to ask me which item to use, when it makes no difference. Having crafted my torch, I wanted to collect some more roots to keep in my inventory for future use. But when I tried to pick them up, the only interaction option I had was to set them on fire with the torch I'd just made. I had to drop my torch first, pick up the roots, then pick up the torch. Later, when my torch expired, I found out you can't combine two items in your inventory. I had to drop the roots on the ground, and then interact with it to combine with my pipe to make a new torch. Sure, none of this is game breaking, but its annoying, especially when you consider that there are lots of things to craft, so you'll spend a lot of time dealing with this crap.I also find it strange that a society that has technology capable of travelling to distant planets, and a PDA capable of tracking life signs in real time and translating alien languages, doesn't have any way of recording map data. Okay, there are waypoints on the HUD to guide you through the main quest. But when I'm trying to thoroughly search the area for those artefacts and other secrets, sometimes its difficult to know which areas haven't been explored yet.My final little complaint is that, whilst keys are rebindable, the game won't recognise my mouse thumb buttons, or mousewheel click. On a more positive note, I didn't encounter any bugs, and the music is fantastic, really intense and dramatic, especially when you're in danger. There isn't a lot of voice acting, but those small parts have a decent quality.Overall, The Solus Project is a really interesting experience, which I give a strong recommendation for. Its a kind of sequel to the developer's previous game, The Ball, and although it expands on some of the story, you don't really need to have played The Ball to enjoy The Solus Project. (The Ball is also a pretty good game though, which is worth checking out). It took me 12 hours to finish, so the standard purchase price is fairly good value for money.			"

												I like pretty much all about this game. It's a mix of exploration and non-horror survival game. There are a few quite scary moments during the game play, but not so much. I don't like horror, so it was good to find a survival game without it. As an exploration game there are some puzzles to be solved as well, but not to the extend I'd call it a puzzle game. The game comes with a story which is told through notes in various ways. If you like you can just follow the story, as I did, or you can do a lot of exploration and discover secret areas.The story, the ambient soundtrack, the pretty graphics and the challenges. Together they form an immersive experience that makes you always want to move on just a little more, regardsless of what time it is, or what other obligations you should have.			"

												I have to say that I really enjoyed this game. The gameplay is well-balanced and the difficulty level is completely customizable.I really thought that the survival mechanics paired with the planet's weather patterns made for a rich and rewarding experience. Also while not on the surface, a somewhat maze-like puzzle experience awaits you (no complex puzzles though, you mostly just wander through the maze and challenging environment to find switches).There are a large number of secrets in this game to add extra challenge/exploration/rewards if you wish, but they are optional.The story is left to discovery by the player. There are fragments of notes and such left throughout the levels, and the story is somewhat left to personal interpretation.There are no ""fights"" to speak of, but there are occasions where you may need to stealth past or run past certain ""enemies"". The times when you are trying to escape an anomaly are well-done and appropriately intense, but these are interspersed between periods of less-intense play so as to not give you PTSD.TL;DR: A great sci-fi adventure-survival game, well worth the price I paid of $20 USD. Not intense but not boring either; a well-balanced and thought-provoking challenge in the genre.			"

												This is currently one of my favorite VR games. I know originally it wasn't designed for VR, but it does it quite well. There has been a few times where I just sit down on the beach in awe and stare at how beautiful the sky is.  I have not finished this game yet, and that is a great thing. Most VR experiences are short. This is a long play through, it has some puzzle elements. Some people say this is a walking simulator. That’s fine with me; it sure is a hell of a one. I sometime feel like I’m on an episode of Star Trek, or in the Aliens movie.  While they continue to improve on the VR controls, my only complaint is the horrible inventory selection system. Having to click through each item is not fun, and when you miss it, you have to go around the bend/wheel again. Not a big deal in the beginning, but when you get further in and have collected a lot more stuff, it gets frustrating.  I really enjoy the atmosphere, and there are some chilling moments to be hand in the game.			"

Wandering around islands trying to find the last diary entry or crew photo is quite painful. The incessant reminders that I am wet are also quite irksome. I have water all over my screen when I am wet, I really don't need an audible reminder. Cool story line though			"

												A review with the HTC Vive. I just started it and I already enjoy it immensely. It's an immersive and beautiful environment. It's heavily a survival based game so it keeps you busy and moving around. The visual appeal of the game alone is worth checking it out, but it also feels like a fully developed game. Most games available for VR right now are like tech demos, so this is definitely a nice change of pace. Recommended!			"

												I played this game in VR mode with the Oculus Rift and Xbox One controller, and it was amazing. To date, this is one of the best titles out for VR (that's actually a full game, not a 10-minute ""experience""). The graphics were good for VR. The ending left me hanging a bit but the road there was good, long and exciting. It kept me coming back to figure out what was next in the story. The controller movement felt a bit ackward sometimes but it did not take away from my overall impression. Worth every penny. IMO, The Solus Project is a solid and good VR title--I would strongly recommend it. Max kudos!!!			"

												Vive review from a 1 hour play session.First of all let me thank the devs by making this the first standing room only VR game that i have been able to properly play in VR. I have a very limited amount of space and most standing room titles require some degree of movement which i cannot perform. This is the first title i have played that allows me a full range of movement using the game controls to allow me to experience the game.On to the game there hasn't been a whole lot to do so far in terms of actual game play. It is very much an exploration game more than anything, however exploring in VR changes the whole experience and i am looking forward to diving into it more and seeing what mysteries are hiding in the planet.Overall if you have a VR headset and you want a game that is more of a compete experience this is a good place to start.

												Very good slow paced (well, mostly) game in an interesting setting, with good graphics, well designed locations, great sound and music. Slightly resembles the legendary ""Robinsom's Requiem"", although is not as rich and difficult. The best element is the mood, particularly while exploring caves and underground ruins. I really felt abandoned and lonely, and sometimes frightened, even I haven't played it using VR.			"

												First, let me tell u I have a Vive, and I have only played this game through it.The Solus Project is a probably the best representation of a full, polished vr game. The movement mechanics work well and the addition of teleportation to locomotion is something many games lack, as locomotion can often make people empty their lunch, everywhere. (Not I but I know a few people who do get that.) The game capitalizes on the awe of vr using beautiful landscapes and incredible structures.Problems arise in that the survival elements are limited, it basically consists of keep food and water with you, and a light/heat source. If you are expecting an Ark like survival experience, just know that while survival is a key element in this it is quite limited in content.Instead of a mainly survival game, you get an exploration game with a few survival elements, the game is almost entirely exploration driven and it is fun for a while, and then sometimes boring, and then fun again. There really isn't any settling down and trying to build up a nice camp, it's just walk, walk, walk.Lastly, the game has a horror aspect, if you're in a cave, you may here screaming and intense music. Some of the noises are puzzling, like hearing a human scream can really throw you off. It doesn't really fit. The scariest parts of the game are not when it is trying to scare you, but when it is not, when everything is still and for a brief moment you believe you really are a person, hopelessly stranded on a distant world, alone, and doomed to die that way. That there is what makes this game so good.I'd give the game a 7/10. It still is the most complete game on the market and will probably be so for a while. It's worth $20 for sure. So go buy it.			"

												Ever wonder what it would be like to survive a spaceship crash and embark on a Giorgio A. Tsoukalos mystery investigation? Well look no further than the Solus Project. This fairly lengthly narrative driven surival game takes the normally (to me at least) dull eat food, drink water, don't freeze to death mechanics of a surive in the woods game and combines them with a puzzle exploration openish? world of neat rocks n' things.To me this game was well worth it's not too steep price, and was definitely something I would consider an enjoyable experience, despite the game itself not having much going for it other than a spectacular atmosphere. Even knowing that 90% of the time I was completely safe, as stated in the description there's no real enemies, the atmosphere created such a wonderful feeling of anxiety and nigh terror that I would still tense at every random background ambience noise.A solid game, worth picking up if you just want a chill game to play looking at some neat things. The only drawbacks are that the game is fairly easy, even the survival elements are most of the time fairly trivial unless you drop all your food and forget to pick it back up (which I only did once) as there's a pretty consistently spaced supply of unlimited food and water. So don't pick this up if you are looking for a challenge, but otherwise I'd recommend it.Overall rating: 8/10			"

Early Access Review
								At first I thought this was going to be a Basic Survival game similar to Stranded Deep since it was still early release... But this game is WAY more than your average survival game... This has a wild story line, that i have only parshally learned about playing this game for almost 6 hours straight. Another thing i like is that the Graphics are amazing and the caves are scary as was the ****ing hurricane!! A game that kind of puts me off about this game is the survival part is mainly focused on food, water, weather... As it stands for now the crafting part is kind of lacking. What i mean by this is though you get plenty of materials to keep making torches and you get other things in its place, I have been using the same torche for the past 6 hours... STILL EARLY i know but i hope more crafting comes in the future... OH and lets not forget all the SECRET stuff you can VERY easily miss if you dont venture around in the most random of places...			"

												The Solus Project works extremely well as a VR game, especially now that asynchronous reprojection is available. While a few niggles show that it's wasn't purely developed for VR, the large amount of content, beautiful vistas and depth more than make up for this.It's very immersive and once the setting sucks you in it's hard to stop -- I just played for 3 hours straight, and while that is not all that much in traditional gaming it's a lot in room-scale VR.The interface takes a bit of getting used to, but after half an hour I was flipping through menus and interacting with things without any issues at all.

												Solus is amazing, very well put together and very rich story. Not much has to be said through the game its very easy to feel the story its not hard to see the creator is a fan of Aiens and Preditor your probably wondering why i say that all i can say is play the game and you will feel it. The feeling changes throughout the game at the start you get that survival feeling just like your rely lost but as the game progresses and you start learning how to survive you start relaxing and exploring,  the visual side of it amazing makes you feel like your rely there, you dont just get the feeling of whats infront of you but the planet and the univese around it. once you get further into the game you start forgeting about the survival side of things and folow objetives ont the way you find everything u need to stay alive. This game is one hell of an adventure. PLAY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!			"

												Phenomenal! I haven't completed the game yet, but i'm extremely impressed with the obvious amount of work the devs have put into this game. Story is great, should be a book written so we could read and get even more details that we may have missed in the game. Great imagination went into this game, even a little humor.I've been playing this in the Vive on medium difficulty. I have been terrified, awestruck, elated, captivated, happy, sad, exhilarated, and have experienced many emotions while experiencing this VR survival on another planet.This game is well worth more than just the $20 they have been charging. I wish these devs would have been the ones to make the Everest Experience.By the way, there are a few very minor glitches with this game in the Vive, but they are so minor that they don't really even effect the game or gameplay. The biggest glitch I found for Vive gameplay was when I was at this ladder that I was supposed to go way way way down, but the top of the ladder had no white lit up ladder that Vive players or supposed to teleport onto, I finally just took the risk and used the Vive touchpad to walk forward off the edge where the ladder is, hoping I wouldn't just fall to my death, but somehow instead of falling I ended up walking down the ladder.At the end of this same ladder, I kept walking to see if that is how to get off the ladder, but all of a sudden at the last step, I fell off and died. I tried the ladder again, but this next time once I was almost to the bottom of the ladder, I used the Teleport device to get onto the ground safely, but make sure the Teleport disk does not land on the white lit ladder at the bottom of the main ladder or you might end up in an infinite loop like happened to me once.Sorry for the rambling, I highly recommend this game, best when played sitting though, because the head height didn't match my real height, I felt like I was 7 feet tall in the game when I stood, but sitting down worked out great the whole game through so far.

Full review: http://grandpagaming.blogspot.nl/2016/07/the-solus-project-review.htmlI've played games like this before. Often they do not manage to keep my interest until the end of the game. The Solus Project is one of the view that intrigues me enough to keep on exploring, keep on playing. The game is very well done and even without VR it is a game worth playing. Instead of watching a movie, get involved in one, that's how it feels like and it's an awesome experience. Do you like exploration, with tensions and suspense and a bit of survival on the side? Then what are you waiting for, get this game. Looking at the price, the vastness of this game and knowing you cannot finish this game in just a few hours, it gets a solid 9 out of 10 from me.			"

												playing the non VR version of the game i have to say it is beautiful.. and no pew pew, and you dont miss it. pacing is good so are the puzzles, the sound is great so is the weather. the story is great too..a minor gripe is that you can go anywhere and are encouraged to explore.. i have got well and truely lost a few times.. but the game is so beautiful you don't really mind aimlessly wandering around for an hour or so.. just a few checkpoints perhaps would not go astray say at the start of each area,? as it can be quite difficult to get back to an area if you have missed something important..im at 28 hours gameplay and am about 2/3 - 3/4 through the game i think.. am taking my time and am happy just enjoying this world.!!this game has been COMPLETELY bugless so far and i can play on ultra even on my ancient rig. (slight stutter at times.) q9300 8gig gtx560tiwhat a supurb game! 10/10.			"

												The Solus Project is an atmospheric exploration and puzzle solving survival game. It's package provides both VR-enabled and normal gameplay experience.The sole survivor of an event whereby your spacecraft was destroyed, you awake on an alien world. It's up to you to work out the whys and wherefores as you explore your seemingly uninhabited surroundings. Collecting resources, making tools, gathering food...all of this and more is required to keep you upright and breathing. Occasionally an overhead relay satelite will align with your communication device and for all too brief moments you'll be able to hear your mothership trying to contact you. Unfortunately your personal communicator lacks the power to answer...Technically TSP is an Unreal Engine game. On my, admittedly beastly, PC it runs with no graphical issues at 4K although levels take a noticably long time to load. Not too sure what that's about but once loaded all is fine.I personally enjoy playing the game. There is some handholding regarding where to go and what to do, but certainly nothing of the sort when it comes to working out or solving the puzzles. The story is interesting, the world is huge and the environments, levels if you will, are clearly lovingly designed. I give it 7.5/10.			"

								I REALLY enjoyed the first three levels of this EA game!  Beautiful alien world with a hint of Egypt in the tombs.  I spent quite a while in the game, but towards the end I just headed for the ending, as opposed to searching every corner.  But now I want to replay with a greater attention to detail.  I do think there is room for more thrills (such as giant balls or other objects rolling/sliding down stairs behind you, or directed-falling as seen in Tomb Raider 2013, for example, and more to see or do in the caves and tombs).  Wonderful atmosphere, and story, with the music, sound and weather effects topping it off. At the end of the initial first three levels, I find I'm tiring of the caves and tombs, and hope more outdoor areas are soon to be discovered.  Of course a few minor bugs along the way, but nothing you wouldn't expect at this point, and definitely not game-breakers.With a touch more WOW-factor in the caves and tombs, this seems like it could end up being a classic of the genre.  I wouldn't mind seeing a few ideas ""inspired"" by Mind: Path to Thalamus, such as in seeing clearer pathes through reflections, etc., and maybe a few more puzzles.  But overall, this is a gem, in my mind!  Can't wait to see more!!!8.5/10			"

								This game is a one of a kind in the genre, it's survival and exploration that doesn't get dull after an hour. Don't mind my time record, I've watched plenty of videos and such.The Solus Project has an amazing story to it, some jumpscares and an amazing weather system which is complemented by the awesome soundtrack that it has with it. Just wait for that tornado sound <3It's price is right for the content which at the time of this review is leading to episode 3 coming out in two days.I'd suggest for anyone on the edge to look at a video or two but don't spoil the story for yourself because it is amazing and very unique with plenty of references for those who have a lot of experience with sci-fi and such.TL:DR Good story, Great weather, Amazing soundtrack 10/10			"

												Good survival/horror game with a great story, but the very much unexpected horror elements and associated unexpected gameplay change are points that stop it from being a great experience, making it look a little misguided in what it tries to go for. This is NOT a game that can be labeled as ""exploration driven adventure with survival elements"". this is a 50/50 mix of survival+exploration and survival+horror parts.p.s.: Loved the dolls despite everything. Now, please stop looking at me.			"

								Obviously, it's in early access. HOWEVER, this game is one of the most immersive exploration/survival experiences I've played. That is just my personal opinion. The thing that makes it so immersive for me is actually the geology of the place. I love that feeling of trekking into a cave and not knowing at all is going to happen or what I'm going to find. I cannot wait until the updates start to roll out, as this game could be truly one of a kind.			"

								Two words, PLAY IT.The Game is just amazing, the atmosphere, the graphics and the ambient lighting and sounds. you're stranded on a alien planet completely alone, but there's a scary and terrifying past on this planet and you have to unravel it in order to contact back home.You'll feel scared when you're exploring the caves. The anomalies will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, from the meteor rain, to the torandoes and the random Aliens chanting that your Wilson somehow picks up. It's not meant to be a horror game but it manages to scare you and creep you out in a way I've never felt since i first watched Jurassic park when i was 8 years old or when I first played Dead space 2.This game is just great and it has hours of content, therefore I recommend buying this if you're interested in a story and background heavy survival game with dangers around every corner.

												Ate goop from cave. Gained 1000 calories. Would eat goop from cave again. 10/10Tl;dr: If you are wondering whether to buy for $20 and you have a Vive - YES. Emphatic.This is simply one of the best Vive games available right now. Not a demo, not a small thing that's fun for a few minutes, but an honest to goodness game with plot, real mechanics, and exploration. I'm only a few hours in and it's a lot of fun. They really put some thought into using two hands within Vive. Only complaint is really not with the game per se, just that you need to keep the graphics tuned pretty low to handle the outdoors well (running GTX 970). Hopefully this improves with drivers and/or optimization from Devs. They've been great about continuining support for the game and making VR a priority so I have high hopes. Best addition they could make is an inventory screen and it is already on their wishlist to get done. Good on them!			"

												I'm not a particularly huge fan of survival games, but I love a good mystery and adventure and this appeared to be a good mix of elements. I had no idea what to expect when I started this, and hadn't heard of it until it released, and I have to say I am really impressed and fully recommend this game, it is well worth the full price. More specifics are below.Edit: Added computer specs, approximate performance and fixed some typos. Technical Points Graphical Fidelity is great. It isn't the prettiest game out there but is has its own style and feel and it is well fleshed out. Game performs well on midtier hardware.Audio quality is top notch. The sounds are high quality, the music is intertwined with cues and ambience, creating very moody atmospheres, creepy and foreboding moments and refreshing and calm periods. Caves sound like caves, storms sound like storms. You will learn the various audio cues for different things, be it threats, weather, puzzle completion or secret discovery. I cannot overstate just how well the audio matches up to every moment in the game.Options are plentiful and includes resolution scaling (supersampling). Difficulty is a slider and I assume adjusts rates of hunger and thirst and frequency of weather events and such things. Borderless Fullscreen Windowed Mode is supported but as of this writing isn't an option in the options screen but can be set in a config file, hopefully this will be made selectable in game.Exploration is just as much a part of the game as survival. Level of involvement is largely in your control. Many secret areas exist and offer additional lore bits, but you are fully free to ignore those and only focus on the storyline. Exploration does tend to better prepare you, and exploration never goes unrewarded.Will have VR support eventually. VR support is present but is still very 'work-in-progress' as of this writing. Beyond this I cannot comment as I do not own any VR hardware. More Subjective / Philosophical Points Narrative and Story design is phenomenal. I was very engaged with the game, and as I progressed I only found myself wanting to know more and more importantly discover more. I think this is an excellent example of game writing that does much more showing than telling. You see your environment, you discover things, some lore bits scattered throughout the world are picture based only, and hint at various dangers or terrain that you might later face. Very little dialogue exists, and the physical world gives you just as much information as your one basic forward objective does, if not more. There is a mystery to unravel, but at the same time the game does not reveal everything. Space is given for interpretation and speculation, and maintains mysteriousness and creepiness of the game from start to finish.The game does not hold your hand. There is almost always a forward vector that gives you a very general direction, but exactly how you get there is never explicit. Weather is unpredictable when you are outside, and your journey requires you to survive. The planet you are on is not nice. The game is fair, however. There are plenty of resources scattered about, and sleeping also saves the game. Most arduous areas usually have a save and camp spot before them, so that you have the opportunity to mostly focus on what you're doing, at least for a little while.Level design is incredible and uses the environments to their full extent. Some areas become accessible later, and even backtracking through some areas later in the game will reveal something new or changed. Things you do have an impact as areas that were blocked off early on will be accesible after you do things in the story. All areas as far as I know can be gotten back to, with some travelling if you're up to it. There is no map in the game, but this is made up for with some subtle and some not so subtle landmarking. Areas have literal milestones that will tell you about how far you are through a particular area. Other things can also mark areas, such as markings or arrangements on the ground, to simple stacks of rocks in caves.The game is excellent at evoking real creep. There aren't really any directly malicious threats in the game, but the game does a great job of making you feel otherwise. Some areas I was hesitant to enter, or was hesitant to activate some mechanism just because I was somewhat afraid of something happening that might not be pleasant.

												Good: For the first few minutes you play this game you think it's really going to be amazing. You've got a standard survival scenario and a set of interesting-looking islands to explore ... the sound effects and music are good, the graphics are good, it's very promising.Bad: Then you quickly realize that what you're actually going to do is explore a set of very linear caves, occasionally puncuated by a stone tablet or obelisk in an alien language that your PDA will translate for you, and maybe a button-and-lever puzzle or some variant on that. And that's all you're going to do.I like adventure/story games. I like exploration/open world games. I even like survival games, if they're not too frustrating. This game would probably be pretty good if the people who made it had concentrated on one or even two of those things. But they seem to be determined to do all three at once, and they do a horrible job of it.Imagine if the devs had concentrated on story and puzzles and just made this a really good cave-crawl mystery. Or imagine if it was purely an ""explore, get resources, try to build what you need to get rescued"" game. Either of those would have been better than this. The story's not compelling enough and the puzzles not interesting enough for this to make a good adventure game; the exploration aspects are just ""look for secrets""; the survival aspects mostly involve your PDA nagging you to sleep what feels like every five minutes.This is doubly disappointing given that The Ball had puzzles which were actually novel and interesting. The Ball was fun to play even when I had to cheat (usually because I got tired of doing the same jumping puzzle twenty times when it was impossible to aim jumps accurately).With this game, the first time I encountered an enemy in the game who could actually kill me (in the Hallways of Darkness), I stopped and tried to decide whether it was worth figuring out how to get past it. Then I tried to decide whether it was worth it to turn on cheats and use those to get past it. Finally I realized that I wasn't interested enough in what was going on in the game to care any more.

The Solus Project 
A Screenshot of The Solus Project
By: Snowfox




Tags: Early Access, Adventure, Survival, Indie, Sci-Fi, Simulation, Exploration, First-Person, Story Rich, Singleplayer, Survival HorrorIntroductionYou play as a lone survivor of a crashed ship on a strange (and for the most part uninhabited) alien planet.  Tasked with finding a way get back home, you will face harsh environments and uncover timely mysteries.OverviewIf you want a casual atmospheric survival game set in space, look no further! This is one of the most beautiful and immersive games I have played in quite some time. While it’s no sandbox like some others with similar concepts, what The Solus Project has to offer is quite interesting. The levels are crafted even to the smallest detail, focusing on a more linear approach instead of sandbox survival. Don’t be fooled though, hidden within these levels are multitudes of secrets waiting to be found. The crafting system is not too complex but was detailed enough to keep me interested. Things you find on the islands can be combined, for example, you use two rocks to make a sharp rock and use that sharp rock on a closed can of food to open it. Recourses are scarce, so be careful what you do (I accidentally burned some important material by using a torch on it…. oops)The environment is very complex and includes all sorts of weather; scorching heat, tornadoes, storms, and even meteors. This is without a doubt the best feature that this game has to offer in my opinion. Another detailed part of the Solus Project is the in-depth day/night cycle. Every detail is there: temperatures, winds, humidity, and cloud coverage.  Very unforgiving: a single mistake can get you killed. This game is in early access at the time I write this review, and content is being added regularly by active devs. I only found a few problems with the game: The running sometimes glitches (and movement in general is a little awkward) and Saves are not working properly for me (I’m not sure when the game saves and when it does. I thought I saved at a shrine, only to find myself back at the starting area when I started up again.)SummaryOverall, I recommend that you give this a try if you enjoy atmospheric games with phenomenal attention to details.

												I enjoy this game so far. I have one suggestion to the developers that is pretty cool. I find myself using both the teleport and the walking system however, to avoid feeling sick when I walk I pretend that I'm riding on a hover board by turning my body sideways just like I would if I were skateboarding and so I just pretend that I have a hover-board with me on the planet.  My suggestion to the devs you guys should just make it officially part of the game the mechanic is already there and all you'd have to do is change the footsteps sounds to a very subtle hum or something. Also, maybe add the ability to turn on a smooth forward x axis while gliding. Other ban that it's already what it needs to be.  Hover boarding alone in the game is pretty fun if you get in the mindset that's it is what you're doing while exploring and it'd be really cool if it was actually a part of the game  👍			"

												Very very happy with the game. Incredible sounds, sights, and story. The game is immersive, very immersive and very good.My only complaint was that the game led me on the forward vector chase while not letting me know how important the Tower parts were to find. You cannot end the game without collecting all the Tower Parts. At the very end I was left having to go find them all when it would have been easier not leaving an area until I had all the tower parts in that area. Game didnt warn me. I had to use a cheat code for the last tower piece which I could not find anywhere. For that reason I give you the code. Use it only if you must. solgive pieceWould I go back and play the game again now that I beat it? Probably not. But the story run through was very open world and survival. You can really take your time. There is no base building but there is exploration and crafting. You need to watch your temperature, drink water and eat food. There are weather anomolies that you need to hide from. There is no first person combat but the game keeps you sucked in with no need for it. I can tell that whoever was making this game put a lot of love into it.			"

												The Solus Project feels like five hours of an excellent game stretched into 10-15 hours of a mediocre one. The planet feels alive with plants, water, day-night cycles, and a gorgeous weather system. But nearly every strength that this game has is mitigated by an equivalent weakness. I would still buy it again for the truly unique setting it offers... there are some memorable moments to be found here which are worth the purchase price, but I won't be returning to Gliese.THE LONG VERSIONGraphics: They are stunning, with beautiful landscapes, days that waver in the hot sun, nights full of stars, awe-inspiring thunder storms... But after a while, every area, every part of the game, starts to become pretty much identical in content, style, even visual color. Day and night are very different, but since the majority of the game takes place in underground caves and ruins that all look the same too, you won't get to appreciate it. The magic gets lost as each island looks like the last one, every cave is blue and gray. There are plenty of areas and secrets to explore, but I stopped bothering.Gameplay: This is a good introduction to the mechanics of survival games, and my first in the genre. The information is clearly displayed in a handheld device which you can easily look down at without ruining the immersion. This game makes it easy to manage food and water needs, body temperature, and sleep. It presents clever immersive clues to your condition, such as frost on your HUD when you're getting cold, or slowed speed when you need rest. The downside: It doesn't feel like it adds much to the game. Water and food are scattered along the very linear course you have to take for the story, so there's no real need to be resourceful. You end up sleeping just to make the awake-hours meter go back up. The mechanic doesn't stay very interesting. I ultimately didn't feel like I was surviving on this planet, just managing numbers while I ran from point A to point B.Story: A really interesting and unique sci-fi story is marred by a maddening delivery system. It's mostly delivered through tablets, monuments, and papers you find. But you have to scan and read them onto the small hand-held translator. It displays the text slowly and in pieces. When you have six long monuments to read all in one room, this becomes annoying in a hurry. The crew logs are given one page at a time, often out of order. You'll find sheet 9 of 22, then sheet 5... by this point, you're going ""come on, COME ON"" at the snail's pace text as a tornado closes in.And the ending is a huge letdown as well. It's generally not a good move to have the player toil towards a goal, then make it completely pointless with two lines of dialogue... especially with the weird '50s sci-fi turn it takes.Exploration: This is where the game really could have risen above being a linear sci-fi game. Each area will alert you to the number of ""secrets"" remaining, and when you start on this strange world, the islands feel huge and ripe for discovery. But after you brave your first cave with resources at the ready, your reward is nearly always an artifact which grants a minimal stat boost. After finding my third or fourth ""secret"" which was just a 1% resistance to starvation boost, I stopped exploring much. And again, when you know the back of the island will look exactly like the side you're on, why bother going over there? I should also mention what I affectionately dubbed A-hole Island. Ever wanted to experience a tornado, a meteor storm, a lightning storm, ANOTHER tornado, then ANOTHER lightning storm in the course of five minutes? Me either.Of note also, this game suffers from extensive backtracking. Get the running boots at the start of the game. You'll need them.			"

												Enjoyable scifi adventure with a lot of free exploration. Graphics are a mix of of Unreal and Quake 3. Lots of hexagonal basalt columns, inspired by real-life's Giant's Causeway (Northern Ireland) and Isle of Staffa (Scotland), give an alien look and feel to the game. You solve puzzles using only a teleporter, a firestick, a rock and a hammer. Lovely outdoor islands, boring tunnels/corridors. Score: 7/10. Minusses:- only works on Win10 (it seems)- bad savegame system- no map- lots of backtracking- lots of samey-looking, uninspired tunnels/corridors			"

												What a lovely little game. Pros: Atmospheric, survival, first-person, well-enough survival system (compensation for wind, wetness, etc.), and pretty awesome random events.Cons: Slightly monotonous, the alien dolls scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and fortune favours the bold (or those that have time to run around for 10 years). Recommendation:It would have been nice to have had access to the previous islands via some form of teleportation (seeing as you have a device that can somewhat teleport). I say this because I only found components that were critical to a previous island/section later on, and I really could not have given a %$#@ about RUNNING all the way back just to use a cable to further explore a cave. Talking about caves, OH MY GOD – I literally never want to see another cave-like structure ever again. Every time I thought I got out, you submerged yourself like a bloody mole to be encountered by that smoke with spikes (WTF!?). Overall? I enjoyed it and definitely feel as though this was a good purchase for a student such as myself. p.s. Wait for a sale.  "

												Enjoyed the game for awhile the begining is great but gets old pretty quick, not enough to keep me interested. love scifi, exploration and survival but something about this one cant hold my attention. scripted events really take away from immersion so that kinda bothered me and was very easy to spot. The environments are beautiful, spent my first 15 minutes just in awww at the world they created, and the game isnt very expensive so id say its worth a try if you like scifi and exploration, survival in this game feels very shoehorned in the game even tho there is temp mechanics with water accelorating heat loss, it feels like they felt they needed something for the character to do while they walk around the mostly empty world, so dont buy it thinking its a good game for survival, your given everything you need served to you. cant say much of the story as i only finished the first chapter before i couldnt force myself to go on anymore lol. maybe a casual gamer would be into this game. recommended WAIT FOR A SALE			"

One of the best games to play in VRCons	 Beautiful large enviroments to explore Challenging and rewarding gameplay  Amazing weather effects A true feeling of freedom  in-depth story with a lore rich enviroment Great voice actingCons:	 When playing in Vive the menu becomes glitchy at times and does not open The controls have a bit of a learning curveIf you have a vive and like survial games then you will love The Solus Project. This game has no combat what-so-ever. Instead players are left to explore a creepy planet and find clues about the planets past. The world is amazing and the story had a lot of thought put into it. This sci-fi thirller is one of my favorite games for the vive and I highly recommend it.			"

												VR Review: This is one of the most accomplished games on the Vive, and it's the type of game that I would like more of, An adventure in VR that takes you out of your normal life and gives you somewhere else to go, The survival aspect of the game is honestly a pain but the devs give you a slider to reduce the impact of survival and even turn that off if you so wish, Some of the environments are stunning along with the fantastic weather effects, You will truly feel like you are on another planet, the sense of presence is great in this game.Now this is not a horror game but the miles of tunnels and caves under the planet are truly some of the most creepy and scary I have had on the Vive, I have played Brookhaven and that did not scare me a bit, but this I dread going back into the caves, You are not the first to set foot on this planet and you may not be alone, Your main task is to get a signal back to the human race that are relying on you to scout the planet to see if it's a new home for us and our species after the Earth was destroyed, You need to collect parts from your downed ship, and puzzle together the mysteries that you will encounter. A must buy for the Vive.			"

												Wow.  I wasn't sure I'd like this game going into it, but something about it is very compelling. The atmosphere and landscapes are gorgeous, and they change enough that you're never bored. I very much recommend reading everything you come across, as much of the story unfolds through stone tablets or sheets of paper strewn about wreckages.  Things can get a little confusing if you don't pay attention.  This is 100% an exploration and discovery type of game - there is no combat, which is a nice change.  When you encounter certain creepy and/or dangerous things, it makes it quite interesting!  Great game, great story.  11/10			"

												This is a great survival game and just a great game in general. In terms of mechanics, story and graphics the game presents nothing new. It matters not. Everything is put together so well, it blends so nicely and it's balanced in such a way that it will make your gameplay smooth and very enjoyable.As someone that does not enjoy these type of games, I admit I had a lot of fun playing it and I couldn't stop till I finished it. The story got me hooked till the end and I couldn't stop moving forward in order to unfold its mystery while surviving, enjoying the landscape and being traumatized by that music and that badass tornado.Seriously this game does everything well, it will push you, scare you, reward you, all in its right measure. It took 15 me hours to complete it following mostly the main objective and not exploring much. I bought it for $10 bucks but I'd definitely recommend it for $20 that's the current price right now. It's a great game.			"

Good inventory management, a lot of upgrades, a good history and some totally different and good looking scenarios. Changing and affecting weather Slow paced, based on investigation and resources management. Don't expect a lot of action. If anything to improve, maybe more interaction with other objects of the environment.			"

												Super immersive and memorable. The survival elements are very well done and actually immerse you in the island and its story.The sights and sounds are gorgeous and scary at times (which is awesome). The planet is looming and danger could lurk around any corner. There is a ton to explore around planet between natural islands, mysterious structures, and deep caves. All the while you still need to eat, drink, sleep and stay warm while uncovering the mysteries of your surroundings. I had a ton of fun playing this game and couldnt put it down from the start. I like survival games but disklike the open-ended sandbox nature they usually are. This game is the opposite, its a survival game placed inside a story and exploration driven game and it works so well following it through to the awesome ending.			"

												Review of a Vive experience.Today I crashed landed in an escape pod on an alien planet. I wandered around on a beach for a while in a daze. An alien beach. This fact sunk in when stopped looking at all the debris at my feet and noticed the several large planets staring back at me on the horizon. Looking up further I saw an intense meteor shower in the upper atmosphere above me. This was, no doubt, the remains of the ship that I was traveling in not minutes before. The enormity of the situation was inescapable. I was marooned on an alien planet. It was getting dark and colder. Fast. The spacesuit I was wearing would apparently only provide limited protection as I could already feel the temerature difference. I had to find shelter and had to somehow keep myself warm. Visions of Tom Hanks dancing around a fire suddenly sprang to mind and I couldn't help but laugh. I was startled to hear the panic in my own laughter. As I wandered in search of shelter I found what appeared to be a thruster from the ship I had been traveling in. It was huge. The nozzle of the thruster was wider than a man was tall. And the damn thing was still on! As I got closer I could tell that see that the thruster was still attached to a fuel source. A heaping pile of junk expelling plasma or exhaust out of the end. I forget which. I didn't have to get very close for it to warm me up. I dared not get any closer. Not far past that surreal scene I managed to find a cave. It was there that I spent my first night.All these experiences felt that much more real using a V.R. headset. I keep reading other reviews that state that the vr experience is terrible with this title. Not true.Set resolution to 150% and turn off AA! I also have my supersampling set at 2.0. If the devs are working to make the VR experience even BETTER then I'm all in.			"

												playing with the vive, around 6-7 hours in taking it slow. so far so good, one of the few vive game with a  full story and realised world. the ganeplay is exploration/puzzle witha  bit of survival, well suited to the vive as its about immersion and imagining youve crash landed on a deserted planet.controls are good could use a few more options perhaps, but better than most. graphics from a technicval perspective nothing special, but desiggn wise art direction its intresting has an alien type vibe, but a bit like home, things are not as colourful or as extreme as no mans sky more muted and subtle. you may want to use supersampling or in game resolution option if you got the horsepower because theres some terrible jaggies on display on some of the fauna and flora. it is  distracting because you spend a good deal of time looking at some of the plants which are very thin and needle like, and break up in jaggedy eyesore. nitpiking aside its workmanlike with a few ooo moments staring up at an alien planet moon setting and rising with comets wizzing by.  gameplay is slow puzzle based, and i may have to accept this is not a massive game unfortunately and is basciallly linear. there are a few secret areas but they dont offer much  except stat buff. if your type of player who only goes for open world you will feel restricted here, although there is a bit of exploration and you can take your time and poke around the areas a bit.anyway only reason i got this is because im looking for vive games, and this ticks all the boxes, you do feel transported to another world and the survival elements  such as weather/food/water/shelter offer a hint of what survival games in future for the vive will feel like. this game doesnt offer anything special for vive, theres some neat stuff holding your pda in one hand and your torch in other is quite immersive, but it hasnt been designed for vr exclusively so its limited in that sense.good stuff overall.

												Just finished the game and I have to say this has been one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.  All credit to the developers for producing such a great game, story line and VR experience.  I thought it had about 16 hours of gameplay (which is long for a VR title) but finally finished it after 50+ hours ... and it kept my interest right to the end. Apart from a few issues brought about by use of the teleport facility which, on occasions, allowed me to jump to areas of the game that the game logic hadn't anticipated it's been a bug free stable experience for me.  Thought the ending was great too and I don't say that of many games.Highly recommended!			"

												The Solus Project is the first VR game I actually play. I have some other titles and demos which support VR and they are fine for testing and the ""Mhm, looks nice"" or ""Promising"" moment, but I rarely spend time in there for the game, its atmosphere and story itself. In this game VR is fun and impressive enough that I rather wear my headset and stand/walk in my room for hours than sitting in my comfy chair and look at my monitor.The VR support is done well enough, although some things are still rough. For example I wasn't able to play before switching to the release candidate branch. Sound sometimes only works when going to the desktop and focusing the game window. Saving in the wrong place can corrupt the save (will load in a black room). There are also some things I don't like much, like teleporting. It's feels a bit immersion breaking, just changing the place from one frame to the next, but normal walking isn't really an option due to VR sickness risks. None of those are showstoppers however and don't prevent me from enjoying the game in VR for several hours per session.Aside from VR I like where the game and story is going so far, but then I do like the genre (Explore/Adventure/Walking Simulator) a lot in the first place. If you do to and if you have a Vive, then this game is a safe pick for a very fair price.As performance, I have a GTX 1070 on a i5 3570K and play with Medium Quality settings.			"

												I played the whole game in VR and loved it.  One of my favorite experiences so far and gave me confidence that VR won't be a gimmick limited to wave shooters.  The sci-fi story and feel was amazing.  While not a direct comparison, I got a heavy Metroid vibe with the alien environments, lore, and sense of isolation.  It does have a bit of a learning curve, so don't give up on the VR aspect of it right away.  After you've got a grasp of the survival and crafting mechanics, you should be good.			"

												I'm not sure if I can put into words how much I love this game.  I played it through to the end and now I'm playing it again!  I literally stay up all night with this game.  There are so many things to do, explore, and figure out.  I've trulyl never played a game I have enjoyed so much.  I even think this is better than Myst, which is one of my all-time favorites.  The story line is immersive, the exploration is open world and you could really spend hours exploring each island.  Or you could speed through each island, it is truly up to you how you want to play this game.  The puzzles are challenging but intuitive.  I would rate this game a 10/10.  I am hoping for a sequel!!			"

												Wow - this was my first VR adventure and I absolutely loved it!  The story line is very intriguing and I felt like the main character in a Sci  Fi novel.  The immersive nature of VR made the story come to life.  The graphics were certainly adequate ... but what made the experience unique were the sounds and things happening all around you.  I normally don't like adventure games ... go get these 3 keys and then place them in a particular order.  However, the story was so immesive that I actually didn't mind.  I played the game on easy (25%) but there is no way I could have finnished without the online guides.  The steam guide is very good ... and there are several You tube channels which walk you through the tough parts of you get stuck.  Highly recoomend ... even if advanture games aren 't your thing.

												There's really nothing in this game that I didn't like. I loved the graphics, I really liked the realism, but most of all I couldn't get enough of the story!!! I read every single lore tile I could find. I own The Ball, the precursor to The Solus Project, and I found it really amazing how they took thier previous game that had basically no plot and gave it a story. They explained what the ball was, not exactly how it came about, but I really liked how things that showed up earlier in the game would be explained later on. Like how the smoke monster came from inside the ball when the people of the uprising broke it open. One of the things I found most intriguing was how I constantly found myself in places I had been before. This is turning into a long review but I'd just like to applaud the creators for making this game so realistic. The environmental stats, the weather, fall damage, avoiding over/under heating. All of it made it seem so real, that on top of everything else, you were constantly being reminded that the survival of mankind rested on your own.I would absolutely without a shadow of a doubt recommend this game to anyone interested in adventure games, it was absolutely worth it!!!!

												A 15 hour journey that is quite good. The end fails I believe and gives no satisfaction but the adventure there is interesting at most points. Occasionally quite disturbing and atmospheric. I feel the games mechanics get far more in the way of itself then really adding anything of value. It throws regular campsites of infinite food and water. This I don't believe is a well refined system. The temperature mechanics were good though, I felt like it was a very alien world with the wild variations and it added an interesting challenge. Although towards the end I couldn't hold my orb of coldening with a flashlight at the same time so I was always blind. Having to futz with the menu to switch between items.

												I really enjoyed this game.  It did a lot of things right.  There were some excellent visuals, plus just sort of an interesting take on things, and I liked being in this world.I will say, pick it up if you're interested in an *exploration* game.  The first couple hours have a great survival mechanic, but after that there are so many supplies that it sort of becomes a non issue.  I really liked that part though, you vs the enviroment can actually be just as engaging as the more common you vs shooting everyone.I'd also say, once you get past that, there's a big stretch where... there's good stuff here and there, but it's not as strong.  You sort of feel like you're just following the arrows.  The whole game isn't like that!  Things start to heat up in the last 1/3 or so of the game.			"

There are plenty of ways to die without something shooting, slicing, or smashing you (Hint: I'm being secretive on purpose :p). The immersiveness is due to the planet's intricate layout. At first, I thought it was small, but as I dug deeper I found even a small planet can provide hours of entertainment!			"

												Let me tell you first I'm a huge sci-fi, space exploration fan. I'm a sucker of games with sci-fi, space, futuristic technology setting. So it was clear I had to check this game out once in my life. At the beginning I was very sceptic about this game, I watched youtube videos on it, read reviews and alot of people were saying it is a great game etc.. Nonetheless I never was totally convinced and I wasn't sure if I should spend the money on this title and then get disappointed like I got with many other indie games who never felt finished and kept staying in early acces for ages.. So I kept ""Solus Project"" in my wishlist for a long time till finally I had the opportunity to buy this game on sale and I finally gave this beauty a chance.After my first playthrough I gotta say that I was totally proved wrong with my scepticism. This game totally got me immersed in it's beautiful world design. And yes, finally to me this game feels complete. You have to survive on an alien world (not that difficult like other survival games out there if you know what you're doing on normal level). Besides surviving and not dying (which after a couple of gamehours feels like something you just do automatically eg. make fire, eat, sleep etc.) you can also go out and explore the mysteries and what's going on on this planet. Also alot of lore and information lögs and secrets to be found for the real explorers out there.It looks georgeous, it has a pretty badass weather simulation which is helping you getting the feel of survival. And you have also a real goal if you just wanna do a speedrun without exploring too much, you can do that. But to me this game is all about exploring and experiencing the beauties and dangers of this world. Just watching the environment and sky while exploring and walking around just kept me in awe of this planet I'm stranded. The only thing I've missed in this game was the possibility to travel longer distances in a faster way (eg. if you wanna go back to already explored areas you have to travel back by walking which sometimes can take hours.. )The story is ok but honestly to me it wasn't the story who made me love this game, it is just the way everything is balanced out in this world. The interaction of the weather climate change, rain, snow, day night cycles, caves and how it affects your body temeperature etc. just feels on spot. The soundtrack is good (complements the game really well) and adds more drama to the situation. The World, sky at day&night looks stunningly gorgeous and gives you totally the feel that you really are there on this planet, a very immersive game! Just the look of the game made me wanna explore more of this beautiful world. I truly felt like an exploring new worlds pioneer. :)This is definitly a must-have for every space explorer pioneer, sci-fi and survival lovers out there! If you're looking for killing and shooting stuff, aliens etc. this might not be the game for you. If you're a curious, patient gamer and are into adventure/exploring/survival-games and if you like to got immersed and find out more of what's going on on this Planet, just give this a try. Overall price/package conclusion = TOP!! To me definitly best indie game of the year, please more of this!!(sorry for my english it's not my native language..)			"

Product received for free
												Very exciting and interesting game. The story line is very good, as it stimulates your curiosity and allows you to be very creative in order to solve the many funny tasks that you'll be exposed to during the game. The graphic is very good, the music is outstanding and the game gives an overall feeling of realism.			"

I often don't finish a lot of games I buy.The puzzles were fun ad the atmoshpere was great.I was really engrossed in the story and I actually felt a sense of urgency to figure out what was going on and get the com tower finished so I could call the other ship.10/10 Would love a sequel!

												I played solely with the Vive and thought the game was fantastic. When finished, I felt like I had actually visited another world. It's the first game for the Vive that I've played through that feels like a complete full length game. Very nice progressive, mysterious story line with some cool creepy elements too.			"

												VR reviewI am playing this game with my VIVE for 10 hours now and think that I have finished it for about 50%. I have the latest patch installed and the game runs with perfect performance on my not-so-high-end-anymore i7 2600k/GTX 970 combination. VR support is absolutely flawless so far and the handling through the VIVE controllers works very good. The game supports two ways of movement, the well-known teleportation system and the possibility to seamlessly move over the floor in the direction you are currently looking. Although the latter method is a bit slow (i.e. the movement is a bit slow), I use it whenever possible because IMHO it offers much better immersion. So I use the teleportion system only for climbing, for which it works very well.Regarding the game itself, when I was buying the VIVE I was especially hoping for a game that puts me on an alien planet full with mysteries, ancient ruins, and fantastic surroundings. A different, exciting world for me to explore. Well, the Solus Project is nothing less than the answer to these hopes. It looks great, even phenomenal sometimes, e.g. while standing on the shoreline, watching the two moons rising above you together with the occasional falling stars, or when exploring a gigantic cave filled with ancient structures of an old civilization. And the sound is even better than the graphics, providing very intense and even scary moments regularly. By the way, I am using a 26 years old AKG K-280 Parabolic earphone and this game simply lets me believe that it must be the best earphone ever built :)I have read some complaints about this game in other reviews stating that it not difficult and complex enough. I guess this is not completely untrue. For example, in the Solus Project you must eat, drink and sleep regularly. But throughout the game you will find more food and water than you will ever need. You will even find camps (marked with a white icon directly in the world) with unlimited food and water resources regularly. Sleeping is also no problem since you can do it in most places. Interacting with the world is also not very complex. Finding a key here, repairing a lever there, and putting a stone on a plate on the ground. Nevertheless you will most probably die a few times in the game, since it contains a number of different traps, which you will simply overlook from time to time (note that your character has enough health points and will usually not die because of a single trap only).Regarding myself, I must admit that I am happy with the difficulty of the game as it is, because it gives me enough time to explore the world very thoroughly. Since the world is so beautiful this is simply more important for me than a more difficult game. And being able to finish the game all by myself without the need of a guide from the Internet is also not a bad thing, I guess.Note that each area (cave, etc.) of the game contains about ten or more secret locations, and it is a real challenge to find them. Usually the game will reward you with an upgrade to one of your stats when you find one of these secrets. So, yes, this also means that your character can improve during the game (health points, resistances).Regarding saving, the game lets you save on special obelisks that you will find along the way (often enough). Beside this, the game automatically saves when you are sleeping, which means that in fact you can save almost anytime, which is really useful when you are about to try something dangerous. Note however that the game always uses the same single savegame.To say something negative about this game at all, it took about 1-2 hours to become great. Because it started with an intro that did not even look average to me, and the first two (rather small) areas in the game didn't look especially good, either. I can promise you however that the visual appearance of the game will strongly improve after that weak beginning.Conclusion: The Solus Project is a not-to-complicated action adventure that looks and sounds so great in VR that everybody with the slightest interest in SF should play it!Update #1Four hours later and while exploring a large surface area I wanted to add that the survival aspect is more present here than in the caves before because it becomes very cold during the night. So you really have to do some planning, do the exploring during the day and seek shelter during the night, or you will freeze to death.And I also wanted to add that there is an option that controls your movement speed when not using the teleportation system, and its initial setting was only 50%. So please forget what I said about the slow movement speed!Update #2Four hours (18) more I must say that the game still gets better and also more complex. I have discovered two secret caves that I am exploring right now and they are quite challenging. They are more dark, narrow, and contain lots of crossroads so that I have started to take notes about the ways I have already explored. And food and water is very rare so that you have to be careful to find your way out early enough. Great!			"

												Great game that's a walking simulator, puzzle solver, and one of my favorite passtimes collection completion.  I imagine the VR experience would have been amazing too. Without going into spoilers the ending is left reasonable resolved yet open to interpretation and allows you to fill in the blanks youself (leaving mystery there). I enjoyed it but didn't think there was too much in the way of horror, that being said my wife couldn't keep watching when we realized it was meant to be scary at times, most of the game is exporation and mystery in my opinion.

Some great effects, ideas and good choice on the engine.Devs seem to be active in the steam forums responding to bug issues, which is a big plus imo.buy it, worth a play, you wont regret it!oh, i have 20h game time. maybe 4hours repeated when i restarted the game so around 15h gametime if you do a bit of exploring.

												I enjoy this game so far. I have one suggestion to the developers that is pretty cool. I find myself using both the teleport and the walking system however, to avoid feeling sick when I walk I pretend that I'm riding on a hover board by turning my body sideways just like I would if I were skateboarding and so I just pretend that I have a hover-board with me on the planet.  My suggestion to the devs you guys should just make it officially part of the game the mechanic is already there and all you'd have to do is change the footsteps sounds to a very subtle hum or something. Also, maybe add the ability to turn on a smooth forward x axis while gliding. Other ban that it's already what it needs to be.  Hover boarding alone in the game is pretty fun if you get in the mindset that's it is what you're doing while exploring and it'd be really cool if it was actually a part of the game  👍			"

												Very very happy with the game. Incredible sounds, sights, and story. The game is immersive, very immersive and very good.My only complaint was that the game led me on the forward vector chase while not letting me know how important the Tower parts were to find. You cannot end the game without collecting all the Tower Parts. At the very end I was left having to go find them all when it would have been easier not leaving an area until I had all the tower parts in that area. Game didnt warn me. I had to use a cheat code for the last tower piece which I could not find anywhere. For that reason I give you the code. Use it only if you must. solgive pieceWould I go back and play the game again now that I beat it? Probably not. But the story run through was very open world and survival. You can really take your time. There is no base building but there is exploration and crafting. You need to watch your temperature, drink water and eat food. There are weather anomolies that you need to hide from. There is no first person combat but the game keeps you sucked in with no need for it. I can tell that whoever was making this game put a lot of love into it.			"

												The Solus Project feels like five hours of an excellent game stretched into 10-15 hours of a mediocre one. The planet feels alive with plants, water, day-night cycles, and a gorgeous weather system. But nearly every strength that this game has is mitigated by an equivalent weakness. I would still buy it again for the truly unique setting it offers... there are some memorable moments to be found here which are worth the purchase price, but I won't be returning to Gliese.THE LONG VERSIONGraphics: They are stunning, with beautiful landscapes, days that waver in the hot sun, nights full of stars, awe-inspiring thunder storms... But after a while, every area, every part of the game, starts to become pretty much identical in content, style, even visual color. Day and night are very different, but since the majority of the game takes place in underground caves and ruins that all look the same too, you won't get to appreciate it. The magic gets lost as each island looks like the last one, every cave is blue and gray. There are plenty of areas and secrets to explore, but I stopped bothering.Gameplay: This is a good introduction to the mechanics of survival games, and my first in the genre. The information is clearly displayed in a handheld device which you can easily look down at without ruining the immersion. This game makes it easy to manage food and water needs, body temperature, and sleep. It presents clever immersive clues to your condition, such as frost on your HUD when you're getting cold, or slowed speed when you need rest. The downside: It doesn't feel like it adds much to the game. Water and food are scattered along the very linear course you have to take for the story, so there's no real need to be resourceful. You end up sleeping just to make the awake-hours meter go back up. The mechanic doesn't stay very interesting. I ultimately didn't feel like I was surviving on this planet, just managing numbers while I ran from point A to point B.Story: A really interesting and unique sci-fi story is marred by a maddening delivery system. It's mostly delivered through tablets, monuments, and papers you find. But you have to scan and read them onto the small hand-held translator. It displays the text slowly and in pieces. When you have six long monuments to read all in one room, this becomes annoying in a hurry. The crew logs are given one page at a time, often out of order. You'll find sheet 9 of 22, then sheet 5... by this point, you're going ""come on, COME ON"" at the snail's pace text as a tornado closes in.And the ending is a huge letdown as well. It's generally not a good move to have the player toil towards a goal, then make it completely pointless with two lines of dialogue... especially with the weird '50s sci-fi turn it takes.Exploration: This is where the game really could have risen above being a linear sci-fi game. Each area will alert you to the number of ""secrets"" remaining, and when you start on this strange world, the islands feel huge and ripe for discovery. But after you brave your first cave with resources at the ready, your reward is nearly always an artifact which grants a minimal stat boost. After finding my third or fourth ""secret"" which was just a 1% resistance to starvation boost, I stopped exploring much. And again, when you know the back of the island will look exactly like the side you're on, why bother going over there? I should also mention what I affectionately dubbed A-hole Island. Ever wanted to experience a tornado, a meteor storm, a lightning storm, ANOTHER tornado, then ANOTHER lightning storm in the course of five minutes? Me either.Of note also, this game suffers from extensive backtracking. Get the running boots at the start of the game. You'll need them.			"

Early Access Review
								So I stumbled upon this game via the store, read the description and thought to myself ""meh...why not"". So i bought, installed and started it.First thing that struck me was this genious of main menu soundtrack. This one blew me away...right away.I had not a real idea of what i should expect on this, i still thought is some space-survival - nothing more, nothing less. Oh dare me to be this stupid indeed. As soon as it started i found myself within a great adventure. Although some of the animations are - and I am far from an expert to rely on a whatever amount of experience in ""rating"" games - not quite good, this game caught me right away. Making use of the debris, the nature, exploring this indeed very alien place, but on my on - at first. I still have part 3 upcoming to me, as I haven't had the time yet, but I am SURE, it will keep up its pace and beliveable storyline.Another point I would love to mention is the fact, that the developing crew, especially the art and environmend designers made a really fantastic job here. You can somehow relate to this place you got stuck into and feel the need of exploring at every moment.My rating so far is a solid 8/10.Get the animations smoother, and the full scale is yours. Great game, total recommendation!			"

												This is the best and most immersive game I have played for VR to date. It has a completed game feel that other games do not, and a great length of gameplay to sink into. This is probably due to the game being made before VR, and then having VR functionality added once the Vive was released, but the VR system doesn't feel like an afterthought. I get a lot of satisfaction exploring, solving puzzles, and wandering the world. Even organzing my food, water, and other stashed items on the shelves of the empty shelters I find feels good in gameplay. There's something special about being able to reach out, interact with the world around you with your hands, and make it feel like your 'home', however temporary. The atmosphere it gives is quite alien, and leaves you with a sense of risk associated with your actions. I really can't give it enough praise in a market saturated with very dull, dry, and short VR titles. If you're on the fence, BUY IT! I am really glad I did.			"

												I am not even through the game yet (1/4 way maybe?) but have been playing for over six hours. I had to take a break and give this game a review because it is amazing! This game is tagged as a ""Horror"", which is true, but I would probably label that more like ""Errie & Environmental"". There are ""things"" that can kill you, but this isn't a combat type game at all. Getting around the ""things"" is just that, evading and playing it smart. The world is incredibly immersive and beautiful. The audio is 10/10. The environment is rich, alive and ever-changing. This game has a survival aspect, but it isn't your standard ""do everything you can do to survive or die"" mentallity, which I like (discliamer: my first playthrough is on easy).

I´m playing and my girlfriend is watching the screen and shouting at me in absolute panic. I´m tripping out as well , screeming like a thirteen year old girl when things go sour. Even my dog is freaked out now from all the screaming. His hiding in the closet. This is an absolute must have for any htc vive user!  10/10			"

												This is a fun and thrilling adventure game, with some spooky elements in it. Finding resources is very easy if you like to explore throughouly like me, but surviving the climate is not so much. I found myself often ducking in a cave to avoid a tornado or meteor shower more than a few times, and keeping warm or cool enough can also be challenging.Secrets are well hidden and you'll probably need a guide to find them all. Some require a little backtracking as well.			"

												Note: Review is non VR with Steam ControllerPros:-Rich Lore-Good Variety Of Items-Lots of Locations, each with different hazardsCons:-HP means nothing when you get one shot most of the time-Lineir pathing-Twisters... (Sorry but there d*cks)I liked my time with Solus Project, you start on an alien planet with no idea what's going on and have to find out what has happened and relay comms back to HQ.The story always kept me guessing with what to expect next and the rich lore helps you to understand this, the devs worked really well on this aspect, although I felt a bit let down by the ending.Exploration wise there are lots a different areas to explore although the lineir pathing keeps you to one area at a time where I think a more open world would have done better here (like Ori). The items you can get help combat each different location  so it's not too bad.I think this game would be a lot more fun to play with VR as you are more engrossed with the atmosphere (not that there isn't any there this would just be more immersive if so)Nevetheless I would recommend this game (more so if you have VR) around 7/10, there's simply some issues I had with this game (did notice a few bugs) but the amount of effort the devs put in shows through when it does.

												I got this game off a whim and I have to say I do not regret my decision, this is one of the most fun and intriguing survival games I have ever played. The work put into putting a mystery in almost every crook and cranny in this world is just amazing. The storyline in this game is very well crafted, and at the same time isn't overwhelming whereas you can't explore on your own, this game pretty much allows you to explore every part of the area with very few restrictions. There also being extra areas to explore for those more hardy explorers. Surely it isn't a super dedicated survival where you need to craft your way into a mansion-like base, but it really does excel on the exploration factor and the mystery of the past occurrences factor. I will defiantly play it over again. 9.5/10			"

												This game is a mild horror game with exploration at its core. It's a fun survival game that's not to hard to balance. Food and water come often so it's not to easy to starve or get dehydrated. The story is pretty good as well! Only issue I've had is once I got through the second temple I cannot progress any further. Everytime I hit the loading screen the game freezes and loops the loading animation and song. Not sure if this is a problem with the game itself or with my computer. I'll look into it more and update this review when I find the solution			"

												This is the best and most immersive game I have played for VR to date. It has a completed game feel that other games do not, and a great length of gameplay to sink into. This is probably due to the game being made before VR, and then having VR functionality added once the Vive was released, but the VR system doesn't feel like an afterthought. I get a lot of satisfaction exploring, solving puzzles, and wandering the world. Even organzing my food, water, and other stashed items on the shelves of the empty shelters I find feels good in gameplay. There's something special about being able to reach out, interact with the world around you with your hands, and make it feel like your 'home', however temporary. The atmosphere it gives is quite alien, and leaves you with a sense of risk associated with your actions. I really can't give it enough praise in a market saturated with very dull, dry, and short VR titles. If you're on the fence, BUY IT! I am really glad I did.			"

												I am not even through the game yet (1/4 way maybe?) but have been playing for over six hours. I had to take a break and give this game a review because it is amazing! This game is tagged as a ""Horror"", which is true, but I would probably label that more like ""Errie & Environmental"". There are ""things"" that can kill you, but this isn't a combat type game at all. Getting around the ""things"" is just that, evading and playing it smart. The world is incredibly immersive and beautiful. The audio is 10/10. The environment is rich, alive and ever-changing. This game has a survival aspect, but it isn't your standard ""do everything you can do to survive or die"" mentallity, which I like (discliamer: my first playthrough is on easy). Also, there are SO many secrets, side paths, and things to explore that the gameplay time could EASILY reach 60+ hours for a single playthough.

												I played The Ball and really enjoyed it, so I had a feeling I would like this game too. I was right - I absolutely loved it.There's so much to explore while at the same time trying to keep yourself alive. I thought I would have a hard time keeping myself hydrated, fed, at a good temperature and with a decent amount of sleep... but I didn't struggle with that too much. A few times I almost froze to death, but I really only have myself to blame haha.The only real trouble I had was self made: I just wanted to explore every nook and cranny in the game but there were just so many things I had to stop exploring and get myself back on track with the story because I wanted to move it along. I think I will enjoy having more to explore in a second playthrough and I definitely want to find all the secret areas I missed. There is definitely some replayability here for me.I thought that the story was pretty well done. I did a lot of reading about the planet's history of The Sky Ones in my adventuring, and while I normally avoid stories with a lot of reading and text involved, I felt that this game had a respectable amount and it helped to get a better understanding of what was going on.This game really felt similar to The Ball with the mysterious underground buildings and, well, uh, hovering balls! There was a great atmosphere in The Solus Project and the graphics were really solid imho. I found myself spending a lot of time just appreciating the alien landscape, the setting sun and the night sky and just taking screenshots of everything. I'm a sucker for beautiful alien landscapes and the glow effects like in this game.Overall just a really solid game. A+++   6413/10   Would crash land on alien planet again.			"

												So far I've invested about 10 hours into the game, and it really took me by surprise.  I love stories and plots that involve some ancient-yet-advanced tech, not sure why, and this game has plenty of that.  What I didn't expect, was a dark story and some of the creepiest gameplay elements I've ever come across.  Granted, I tend to stay away from scary/creepy games just because they don't particularly interest me, but this one brings it in so subtly that it literally sneaks up on you.  I'm definitely happy with my purchase during the 2016 summer sale, and really feel like I've already gotten my money's worth (and I haven't even gotten to the end yet).			"

												Excellent Game!  Combination of mystery, crafting, story, graphics, audio etc. were on point.  Best game I've played in quite a while.  Ending is both puzzling (in a good way) leaving you wanting more (sequel????????) and also a bit harsh in that you feel like there should have been more.  I hope they make a sequel to this game.  I really got a prometheus vibe from this game. Overall I felt like it was telling the story of an advanced race of beings experimenting on several races of lesser beings which feels alot like the movie Prometheus.  It would be very interesting to see where they take this franchise next.Game also has great value.  I played for about 16 hours or so and I feel like I might have missed some things.  Meaning for the cost, you get alot of game and at no point do you ever feel like you're just grinding for no reason.  Perfect.			"

												I'm part way through this playing in VR with my Vive. The controls are a bit clunky but once you've got the hang of it, the game is simply wonderful. It's perfectly paced, challenging, unsettling and fun. The alien world is beautifully realised and genuinely convincing.   VR adds a lot to this - you feel like you're really there which is both brilliant and slightly disconcerting.It takes a while to get going and the first half hour is a bit confusing but it's completely worth the effort to get started.I don't know how good the game is without VR, but anyone with a Vive and a bit of patience really has to get this. It's head and shoulders above all the mini games and other stuff around at the moment. It's also a huge game with massive vistas and a great sense of scale and exploration			"

												Recommended for players more into puzzles and storyline than outright fighting.  Gameplay is simple, but the story is anything but, being exploration heavy and requiring the player to ration resources as they delve into the unkown.Survival in Solus is about wits, brains and judgement.No instant gratification, no fast paced action or explosions throughout, no swordplay or gunplay involved, just a good old fashioned thinking mans adventure game.If that sounds boring to you, read no further.*waits for them to leave*Alright, here's the rub.Just because you can't fighti in this game, doesn't mean your character isn't in mortal peril.  You have to scavenge for food, water and resources as you explore, and you are constatnly getting killed off by the weather conditions alongsied natural disasters that are happening all around you.This is a hostile world and it wants you dead.  And of course, there are secrets.  Go after the secrets, expect even more challenging deaths.  Use you tools, be smart with your inventory, and you might get to see whats erally going on with the world around you.Highly recommended.			"

												10/10, scared me again! Very Fun game!! Kinda creepy at some parts, but very nice game.Q: Is there a Second Device (Crystal input required)? I found one in Act II if I'm correct and I put a Hot Crystal in it...I want to make a Cold Device, too. The Hot Device has helped me more often, as the Torch with reflective surfaces hurts my eyes and makes it hard to look at stuff. I was hoping for animals, but then I realized this planet is probably the hardest place for small, stupid creatures to live... because Tornadoes would sweep them up. I also take breaks a lot, as my heart beats too fast. Would Highly Recommend Playing. IF YOU HEAR DEEP, BELLOWING NOTES: RUN. RUN TO A SAFE SHELTER. IT IS NOT SAFE. *Static and Wind* -OH NO...

												As for the VR version: Yes, the controls could be more intuitive, but they are workable, and taking a bit of care not to abuse the currently rather unrestricted teleportation system, the game offers a very immersive and detailed environment you can lose yourself in. The fact that the survival aspect is rather light makes this more tolerable in VR, where going about  things tends to be a bit slower and many may do it primarily for the experience.I'm confident that the developers will continue to polish the VR integration. Personally, I'd wish for the controls to become more intuitive, e.g., picking up and combining things by touching them, operating the PDA visually/directly with the right hand, etc. I'd also prefer a right hand rather than a controller model, but that's only cosmetic.With a bit of good will, this is an impressive VR title you can lose yourself in. It also runs with good performance and OK looks at 150% on low settings (ultra textures) on my i7, GTX 970 OC Windows 10 system. Recommended!			"

												Note: Review is non VR with Steam ControllerPros:-Rich Lore-Good Variety Of Items-Lots of Locations, each with different hazardsCons:-HP means nothing when you get one shot most of the time-Lineir pathing-Twisters... (Sorry but there d*cks)I liked my time with Solus Project, you start on an alien planet with no idea what's going on and have to find out what has happened and relay comms back to HQ.The story always kept me guessing with what to expect next and the rich lore helps you to understand this, the devs worked really well on this aspect, although I felt a bit let down by the ending.Exploration wise there are lots a different areas to explore although the lineir pathing keeps you to one area at a time where I think a more open world would have done better here (like Ori). The items you can get help combat each different location  so it's not too bad.I think this game would be a lot more fun to play with VR as you are more engrossed with the atmosphere (not that there isn't any there this would just be more immersive if so)Nevetheless I would recommend this game (more so if you have VR) around 7/10, there's simply some issues I had with this game (did notice a few bugs) but the amount of effort the devs put in shows through when it does.

												This was one of my best gaming experiences of 2016. I've seen other people say that playing this game is similar to being captivated by a great book. Where you are being guided through a journey but the exploration never feels predictable or tiresome. While completing the puzzles aren't incredibly challenging the reward of new lore and areas is very rewarding. I did play this game traditionally but I have seen that most of the VR reviews aren't the greatest at the moment. That shouldn't deter people from picking this game up. It's definitely worth the price of admission. ~Beware dark clouds~			"

												This is a game I bought on a whim. The atmosphere is pretty good,and gettin invested is easy. The music can be either absent or super eerie, setting the mood just right.The difficulty of the puzzles is pretty low, and the maps big, which makes getting anywhere feel a bit like a chore. However, the effects are very pretty, and the story is a head scratcher.Over all, i would recomend this game if you enjoy puzzle games. There is NO combat here whatsoever. Something I didn't accept until the credits rolled by.			"

												I found this game very enjoyable, with only a few flaws.  If they resolved these flaws the game would be amazing.1)  Ability to fast travel to islands - i know this is survival and explore, but the 4th time i got lost trying to find an island in the caves was really annoying.2)  Story Ending - while i am all for a non standard endings, there were to many holes in what we knew (i read all the parts), and the ending left me not very satisfied.  If they extend the game or have part 2, then i would like that.			"

Early Access Review
								The Solus Project looks to be shaping up to be very good old school, but new school game indeed. There is no rule that a game has to be sandbox, multiplayer or involve zombies or survival. Remember those days? Well in The Solus Project there is survival - food, hydration and there is an environmental struggle also. This is all wrapped up in some very nice visuals and what seems to be a decent narrative (remember those?) Below is a video showcasing some of the basic mechanics of the game, I hope it helps in some way to help you making a choice on this title.

Early Access Review
								     Normally I play a lot of Bethesda games for their large mod database on the internet and I can go ham and not worry about ""immersion"", so I picked up the Solus Project for a different kind of experience.  If you've played Myst, it's a lot like that combined with a Metroidvania travel here and do this, and go there and get this object type playstyle.  I played it on easy mode until I ran out of the story (it’s still being released a bit at a time because it is Early Access), but on the harder difficulties you can get your fill of survival.  Temperature and wetness contribute to potential hypothermia as well as varying weather such as sunny weather, snow, rain, meteor showers, and tornadoes.  There are also plenty of secret areas to get items that boost your resistance to hypothermia, increase movement speed, etc. and you are guarenteed not to find all of them in the first go.     There is a story here about Gliese as well as plenty of notes to find and read about your mission and fellow Solus Project astronauts and trying to communicate about your crash landing.  Go to the spoiler tag to reveal what I've uncovered and think of the story.  From the in game texts strewn about on monuments and such it seems that a race of coneheaded people were taken from their planet by much taller humanoids which they named Sky Ones (because these aliens came in spaceships.)  These Sky Ones showed them how to make stone buildings and other sciences.  But there is a sinister element here.  The Sky Ones are underground dwellers.  The coneheaded children are sent to an underground monastery to participate in a ritual called the Flameless Rite, which if I understand the pictures and stone tablets correctly essentially involves running around with a torch that attracts a creature of some sort that is smoke, spikes and rays of light (you don’t actually see what the creature is inside the smoke) which then eats the child and flame.  I can only guess but what I gathered is that lots of coneheads are sacrificed to these “dark spirits” as they call them to power them up and the “dark spirit” is used by the Sky Ones to power their machines or for some other reason.  Of course all of this is done under the guise of some religion so the general conehead populace doesn’t realize they are food, leading to some wise rebels wanting to expel these superficially kind but sinister Sky Ones from their world.  As part of the main story you follow a giant cable from the surface to underground and manage to activate it using a tower which doubles as a lightning rod that funnels the energy.  Overall, it becomes kind of a horror atmospheric game without really meaning to at times. I recommend it for a change of pace and because it’ll leave you wanting to find out about what happened on Gliese as well as the Solus Project itself.			"

												I spent the past 2 days playing through and holy hell it was bloody great. It kept me engaged and it made me want to keep playing till the end.My favorite thing about the game was the disasters. I just wished there were more. The music, the scale of them they were amazing. The ambiance was amazing, everything looked nice, the survival gameplay was good. Especially the heat mechanic in the later areas.The only problem I had was playing on normal difficulty. When I got to the first monster I literally couldn't do anyhting to get past it. it would always come for me no matter what, so I had to drop the difficulty down. Other than that dodging the other monsters was easy but amazing. Especially when it was pitch black and you just hear the music then you see a flashing light head your way.Overall I rarely pick up a game and play it completely blind but I'm happy I did so here. It cost me 16 hours of my life but it was worth it. Good story, great environments, good gameplay mechanics and amazing atmosphere.			"

I was originally just excited that it was set in space. Now it's one of my all time favorites. The environment gorgeous, even if you have it on the lowest graphic settings (so if your card is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't worry). The plot is captivating and definitely keeps you eager to learn more as the game progresses. Just very well balanced and executed all around, imo. If you have any doubts about buying, toss them to the wind my guy because this game is one wild ride that doesn't disappoint.			"

I'm 7.7 hours in and have been having a great time. I don't tend to get VR sickness so the locomotion has been fine for me.It would be great if the inventory system was a bit more fleshed out that next/prev item.			"

												#####12.9 hours playtime as of release of review. This review is for game version 1.02, and may not accurately reflect the current state of the game.##### Overview The Solus Project is an exploration game, set in the harsh wilderness of an alien planet. You will traverse across unique and dangerous landscapes solving intriguing puzzles and finding out what is really happening here. The game by default is also a survival game, where you need to keep yourself nourished, hydrated, and at a suitable temperature. The survival aspects and be turned off (which I personally did) and allow for a casual exploration game. However, you will soon come face to face with some freaks of nature, including the giant death winds (tornados) and the monstrous fireball bombardments (meteorite showers).  Components Visuals - I found the visual style of The Solus Project to be immersive and stunning. The landscapes are varied and expansive, while the caves are claustrophobic yet still beautiful. This game holds many visual treats inside these caves, like stunning crystals, and acid lakes. The lighting effects are magificent. This is the kind of game that will make you want to stop and take screenshots. Overral, the visuals of The Solus Project are awesome.Audio - The sound design... The sound in this game has got to be the most immersive sounds I've ever heard in a game. It will make you feel like you are really there (P.s. A note on immersion: this game supports virtual reality). The soundtrack for this game had been meticulously crafted in a way that it is immersive no matter where you are or what you're facing in this game. The music will match your surroundings and will always add ambience or tension. Not to mention this is some of the best sounding music I've heard in a game. I listened to the whole soundtrack on Spotify and it just blows me away. The quality is just insane. And the music helped make the most tense and frightening moment I have ever experienced: facing a tornado. Even if you are safe and sound in a small cave, the music that plays whenever there's a ""climate anomaly"" makes for a seriously chilling moment. If you want to see what it's like, here's a video showcasing the terrifying encounter: https://youtu.be/f0JmziB5j-I?t=2m5sOverall, I would have to say that the audio in this game is out of this world. Gameplay - The Solus Project pits you against the odds as you fight for survival and uncover the many mysteries in this game. You can craft items such as torches, which provide heat and a light source. The crafting didn't feel very intuitive but it gets the job done. Thankfully it isn't an important component to this game, as it is used sparingly. While mainly being an exploration-centric game, there are also enviromental puzzles throught the areas that require solving in order to progress. Early on you get a teleportation disc launcher, which is a major gameplay aspect. The basic gameplay comes down to solving a puzzle on an isand, then going through a cave and coming out onto another island, rinse and repeat 5 or so times. Yet the mechanics of the game never felt repeated. The progression is smooth and you're always making progress, even when scouting the area. Eventually you'll encounter things which I won't spoil, but I will warn you that this game is borderline horror. And it's not just the chilling atmosphere.Story - Earth is destroyed. You are part of an intergalactic fleet looking for a suitable homeland for humans. However, not all goes to plan when you ship crashlands onto a mysterious planet, Gliese-6143-C. You must attempt to relocate any survivors and try to establish a connection back to the rest of the fleet. The story adds to the intensity of the experience as you carry the weight of humanity on your shoulders. The fleet needs to find a suitable planet or everyone will eventually perish from the finite resources. Functionality - This game was made in Unreal Engine, and it runs greatly as I would have expected. There is a broard range of settings and customizable difficulty. This game never crashed on me, and there is virtually no glitches that I encountered. One nitpick is that the loading times are a little bit long, and it can break up the immersion slightly. Overall, The Solus Project performs technically well. Pros  Dynamic environements; the moon affects the tide and the weather affects the flora Incredibly detailed levels with hundreds of secrets Stunning audio and visual design Clever puzzles and enviromental obstacles Always feels fresh; doesn't get repetitive Customizable difficulty; anywhere between a casual stroll to an intense survival experience Cons  Loading times are a little long Crafting and inventory management is a little fiddly  Conclusion If you're looking for spectacular linear exploration game with survival aspects, then I highly suggest The Solus Project. I can't stop thinking about this masterpiece, this game would definitely be in my top 5 games of all time.I give this game a 9.5/10, an unforgettable digital masterpiece.			"

												Not a fan of horror games in general but this game didn't overdo it, which is nice.Survival games are something I play alot, and The Solus Project have a nice mix between survival and exploration which makes it so much better than your generic survival game.Probably have the most detailed story of any kind of survival game I have, and I have a few. The game is a very good example of survival horror. It mixes well with the story behind it and why the ""creatures"" that roam the caves are there.In conclusion, a very good game for the one that likes both survival and horror games. And might even appeal to VR users, can't really say anthing about that since I don't own a VR headset.Things that I find annoying with the game:None, except for the falling damage effect. Falling a distance dealing greater than 100 damage will make you almost unable to see properly.Final grade: 8/10There's several aspects that need some refining, but overall, quite immersing.			"

												Been playing this with Vive and it is one of the most complete experiences available for the headset right now. I feel that being able to enjoy this game in VR requires effort and time getting used to but it is worth it. Devs are very active and seem to be focusing all their effort on improving VR experience so the ""requires getting used to"" statement most likely doesn't apply that much in the near future.  Game's description states that that Vive is supported. While this is true, VR quality is not on par with content specifically made for VR. As of now, user interface is clunky and locomotion is odd and requires developing vr-legs. The day I bought this I felt bad for spending 20e on a game which didn't seem to be enjoying. On top of that it took some tinkering on getting everything smooth on gtx 970.  It took me about an hour to get over the annoyances and develop short VR legs. There is a teleport gun available almost from start but I don't believe it is useful to rely only on it when it comes to moving around. For the leg-development process the game offers a nice opportunity as there is an option to change the movement(/hovering) speed.  The actual gameplay is great and matches the positive reviews before the VR introduction. Of course enhanced to the power of 2 from actually being there, exploring a ♥♥♥♥in' alien planet.			"

												Get this if you're playing on VR! This game does have a couple of niggles, but once you get them sorted the game is really atmospheric and enjoyable in VR.  Graphics are easily tweaked to make the game look pretty good. Atmosphere and sound are awesome and you get some genuine wow moments from pretty much near the start. The niggles are locomotion and inventory which are both confirmed by dev on Reddit Vive to be sorted soon (I think he even mentioned that he were adding 'The Lab' style teleporting today).The game itself is a little easy but with the set pieces and atmosphere you wont care! When they add the finishing touches, the game is going to be a great one!.			"

												So far this game is a blast, I got a good jump out of it, enjoyed learning how the controls work, loved the VR adaptation from the original game and am still happily just trodding through it, taking my time to run around and see the sights.  This doesn't go without some obvious porting flaws.  I've found that after realizing the game was adapted to the VR that I can walk through walls when I want to, this includes door to hidden/locked areas.  This means I can either use the 'walk-through-walls' approach, or even the VR short distance teleporting to get through walls and such (I've already gathered several secret items this way and hate myself for it).  The movement mechanic I think is fantastic (you can change your run speed in the menu rather than a run/sprint mode that you'd typically find), but the way that movement is handled with the left joystick makes a lot of sense to me.  All-in-all: I think this game is great, not as hard as it seems like its slogan lead me to believe, but great.  If you're looking for a good VR Purchase, I think this game should be near the top of your list.  I'm looking forward to seeing what future VR updates have to offer.A non-spoiler tip that took me a bit to figure out for those of you that purchase this, you can't pick up notes to read them, rather you point your right hand at the object and its description/text will appear on your PDA.  This is neat, but it took me a bit to figure this out.  I like it!  I do wish that the Steam VR understanding of left-hand/right-hand would translate to the game and I would hope most games would let you set your 'handedness' in the future, it seems it would be simple and if you can get it into the Steam VR config, each game doesn't need this own setting for you (same goes for inverted controls on current games...), but there are times when my right hand and left hand got swapped from what I expected when the game started, hopefully this is just a bug that will be addressed in a near release.Get this game.

Early Access Review
								cool mysterious sci-fi exploration game with some survival elements.so far there hasn't been any action yet, just exploring islands, caves and alien architecture.I really dig the the atmosphere they're trying to create with this game, a lot of the story comes from the environment and the things you discover. At first you're like, cool abandoned alien buildings and stuff, but after a while you realize something is really wrong on this planet, like creepy dark wrong, and it may not be as abandoned as you think. You should give it a try if you're into movies like alien and interstellar.pros:-nice weather and environment system (rain, snow, tides, cyclones, meteors, northern light, earthquakes,...)-believable world-focus on exploring and finding out what's happening, instead of action (may be a con for others)-some light puzzle elements, you won't be breaking your head here.-works nice with xbox xontrollercons:-no blowing up stuff (I don't really mind tho, it's not a shooter)-so far it's been pretty linear, you do get to explore islands and caves, but when that's done there's only one option: go to the next island or cave (I get the impression the world will open up eventually in a later phase of the game, in a bioshock kind of way, but I'm not sure)-the environments, while nicely crafted and unique looking, do use a lot of the same textures and elements which make it look repetitive at times. (then again, Mars's surface looks pretty much the same as well) "

Early Access Review
								WARNING.....SPOILERS.....APOLOGIES TO THOSE WHO READ THIS BEFORE I WAS REMINDED...Well, I've spent 3 days playing this game, logged most likely 18 hours total.  Yes, I'm one of those types who really gets immersed in the game and wanted to find as many of the treasures as possible.  I must say I find this game to be totally enthralling and kept me busy thinking about how I was going to get from point A to B.  The teleporter gadget is fantastic. The weather effects and the graphics are great and I am a graphics snob.  I totally recommend this game for anyone who loves to figure out mysteries, puzzles, and secrets.  About the only thing, I didn't like was the fact the game isn't done yet. I got to the part with the pillars in the room with the huge cable you're supposed to follow and finally figured out how to get to the other side and BANG!!  the early access is done!!!   OMG!  now I will have to wait for the completion of the next part of the game to see what's next.  This game gets a round of applause and a thumbs up.  Hurry up and get the rest of the game finished!!!!!			"

												The game I waited most for VR and I was not disappointed. Everything looks beautiful and the movement doesn't cause me motion sickness on my oculus rift cv1. Once I start the game it's really hard to quit. I even had to face my worst fear in the game and it almost made me crap my pants, but I won't spoil anyone what it was :D Some things took me a while to learn, but that might just be my own stupidity. I really don't have anything bad to say about this game at this point! Absolutely love it and I honestly could have paid even more to get this game! Devs have really taken every measure to avoid causing motion sickness to players and I think it couldn't get any better than this.			"

												HIghly enjoyable. It's not unlike being in a cross between an FPS (without the 'S') and a point 'n' click adventure. It's got the feel of STALKER (the exploring and dynamic wether threats) with the 'alien-ness' of LOOM all wrapped up in a failry pretty package and with a real sense of purpose and a sound storyline. So far my experience is that the narrative/story (for want of a slightly better description) has to be discovered but it is there and makes the game a reasonably rich experience. Definitely happy so far. And the sky is worth stopping and staring at (if it's not actually 'threatening' you). Oh, and I'm not playing in VR.			"

												The Solus Project is a sci-fi exploration/survival game set on a distant, seemingly uninhabited planet that you've crash landed on. Despite very little dialogue, or substance to the story, my early access to this game still managed to suck me in.PROS:- Beautiful, immersive environment, atmosphere, sounds and weather. The juxtaposition between the dream-like cosmic surface world and eerie, cryptic caves is well done. The weather system is dynamic ,and  at any point you can experience meteor showers, rain, earthquakes, temperature fluctuations, all which have an effect on your characters well being.-The survival feels intuitive. A PDA companion gives you lots of great vitals on your body, survival status and environment such as body temp, humidity, sleep/energy levels, weather temperature etc. What makes this great is that every little thing affects these vitals accordingly. Get wet from a rainstorm or swimming in the ocean? Your body temp will lower and you'll become at risk for hypothermia, but you can bust out a torch or start a fire and watch it come up in response. There are plenty of other ways to help maintain homeostasis. Tons of little things like this make you feel like you're actually surviving on a strange planet.-There is an in-game adjustable difficulty. Want to mainly explore without worrying about dying of thirst? Slide it down for an hour, seamlessly. Want to have a complete immersive experience with no objective markers or help markers, and a completely hardcore survival difficulty? There's an option for that too.-Exploration is rewarded. The different areas are littered with bits of lore, random items which may or may not be useful (I've found everything from a teleport device to a solar-rechargable flashlight), ""relics"" which can boost various survival stats, things that give you temporary buffs, crafting and survival supplies, small puzzles and other random stuff which never gives a dull moment.NEUTRAL:- No immediate combat. There doesn't appear to be any enemies thus far in the game, thus your only enemy is surviving and not falling to death.- The game is not completely open-ended. You are free to explore each area, which is rather large and packed with secrets, but ultimately there is an end goal/story of establishing communication which will lead you from one area to the next.CONS:- This is a fresh early access game, so expect about 4-6 hours of content from this first piece of the game, as well as some bugs which will cause the game to occasionally crash, thus losing any progress between saves.VERDICT:An extremely promising game with a lot of fun aspects and potential. Worth supporting through early access. The beautiful environments, rewarding exploration, and cryptic lore leaves you wanting even more. I can't wait for them to add more content.ART/DESIGN/MUSIC: 9/10GAMEPLAY: 8/10STORY: 8.5/1025.5/30 - Should be near the top of your wishlist if you're a fan of survival/space/sci-fi			"

												This is my absolute favourite of the year! And I'm not that into games in this genre! The game grabbed hold of me from the first moment and kept on grabbing. The beautiful scenery, the music, the mystery you at first don't even know exists, and of course the goal you have. At first it presents itself as ""just"" a very pretty exploration game, but hour after hour it pulls you forward wanting to find out what's going on. In the end, you are knee deep in a story that you just can't wait to unravel. In that sense, it is an exploration game twice over!  Oh, and the sounds! You're not human if you're not affected by them! Not going into detail. It's up to you to experience. Just grab the game already!			"

												I would give it 3.5/5 stars. I agree with what most of everyone else has been saying: awesome graphics, and cool exploration. My main complaints are:  1. the voice acting is atrocious (at least playing as a female protagonist) and it is so bad that it honestly kind of took away from the story for me; and 2. the ending was quite predictable and very unsatisfying in my opinion. Overall: Great graphics, cool exploration, alright storyline, bad voice acting and kinda lame ending. And also worth mentioning: the weather system is phenomenal and the music/sound effects are also superb.			"

												I played this exclusively on the Vive. The environments are RICH. The ambient sounds and music cues (and gorgeous visuals) really suck you into the experience.There were some startling moments, but nothing terrifying.It's essentially a dungeon-crawler item-collection fest. Which is normally boring to me, but the environments were so engaging that I enjoyed the ride.The previews show a lot of exterior environments. But you'll be spending half your time underground in caves.This game is long, at least for me. I'm about 9 hours in and I think I'm 90% through.If you want atmospheric SciFi.

												This is the only game worth playing on the HTC Vive/ VR at the moment.I say that in the sense that everything else feels like a demo of what could be a game. This is a full storyline roller coaster ride of an RPG that I can't put down. There are times that I play this game and physically jump out of my skin, get goose bumps or simply giggle with joy at how immersive it feels, while maintaining amazing visuals and an in depth storyline. Reading through the forums, you can tell there has been a tremendous effort and GREAT progress from the Devs.This one is a 9.5/10 for me. In considering solely its use as a VR game - 20/10. It's what you want to be playing.			"

												I liked this game but it did have some issues.Pros Looks fantastic Atmospheric Music and sound effects Survival mechanics including heat stroke and hypothermia Encourages and rewards explorationCons Mediocre and cliched sci-fi story with a disappointing ending Survival mechanics that included hunger and dehydration but the game included so many resources that you were never in any real danger of starving or dehydrating  The game was all about exploration, but there was also a critical mission that needed to be done and wandering off to explore caves and such really took away the urgency of that main missionOK, I really liked this game and the story was OK, but cliche. If you like the whole Stargate/ancient astronauts vibe, then you will like the story even if there wasn't really anything innovative about it. And yes, the ending was a letdown to me. It really deflated my sense of everything that I accomplished and experienced through ther rest of the game. The setting is really immersive and enigmatic, but for a game that encourages you to try to explore every nook and cranny, it seems unfair that you could (on rare occasion) get yourself stuck in a place where you have no recourse but to just let yourself starve to death or just quit the game and reload. I am not talking about glitching through walls or through the floor. I mean that there is a teleportation device that you can use to teleport short distances to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. And sometimes you could teleport into some nook somewhere but you couldn't teleport out. That was frustrating the couple of times it happened to me. I guess another annoyance I had with the game was there was a fair amount of backtracking at times. But at least the environments changed becuase of your earlier actions so that keep things a little fresh as you were going over old paths. I really do recommend this game though, it could be pretty creepy at times, and awe-inspiring other times.			"

												This game was very interesting.  Being chased by what are apparently guided tornadoes is quite the disturbing experience.Also, I love one bit.  A lot of ""exploration"" games push you along a corridor, and show you neat things with varying success.This one?  I think they completely forgot to add invisible walls or kill zones (barring lava, or the result of swimming in subzero temperatures...).  And then, on the very first level, they give you the damn UNREAL TRANSLOCATOR (well, a slow version) and let you explore pretty much anyplace you can chuck a disk up or down to!Now, THAT is an exploration game.Didn't super care for the ending, tbh.

												A very atmospheric, detailed, feature rich and lengthy game for VR at this point.On Vive, I find it frustrating that they removed backward trackpad movement just to add a recenter button, and it's odd that you have to use a button to couch/duck. I'm personally finding it difficult to get into because of this disconnect, and I may end up refunding it for that. (A personal preference that I'm sure differs from many peoples', which is fine. No point arguing about it though, since argument can't change preferences.) If I hear they're definitely re-adding backward movment before my 2 weeks expires, or at least a way to edit the .ini file for correct trackpad movement, I will update this review.Anyway, the game itself gets a big thumbs up. It's immediately captivating, and has some of the most complete and high-quality features seen in a Vive game so far. Highly recommended, if you don't mind the lack of backward trackpad movement. You CAN use controller tilt for full forward/backward movement if you're good at it. For me, it feels off for this game and its tight platforming and jumping, although I loved it in ""A Legend of Luca"" where you only have to deal with walking/running.			"

								This game casts you into the cosmos, stranded on an unknown world. The elements of survival (while basic) make it all the more realistic. I expect them to add a lot more items and functions to that system. That being said; the weather system is the best I have ever seen in a game; the random tornados, lighting and meteors especially knock your socks off! Beyond that the thrill of navigating a (seemingly) dead world is fantastic-even more so when you realize the ancient civilization that  once lived there. Uncovering their history is exciting. I would only say that the game is rather linear (which makes since considering the discover/progression of the game). That being said I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to feel trapped on a planet.			"

Early Access Review
The Solus Project is gripping, harsh and amazingly fun!I bought this game because I liked the look of the game and the promise it made of what it was. And boy was I (and still am) right!The Solus Project is an adventurous puzzle survival game. I made the mistake playing this game on normal difficulty thinking it wasn't really that much of a survival game. But heat, cold, dehydration, starvation, alien traps, tornado's and even meteor showers can kill you as soon as they get the chance. Keep this in mind when starting this game.You are on a mission to save mankind when your ship crashes on an uncharted planet (Gliese-6143-C). Now you have to survive and try to establish contact. But you will soon notice that this planet is not what it seems...The Solus Project is really well made and the environments (inside as well as outside) are beautiful and full of stuff to explore. At the moment of writing this I'm getting a sense of what I'm supposed to be doing, but there are more mysteries on this planet than it first revealed. Am I alone here? Are there other survivors? What happened here in the past? You are slowly figuring this out when playing the game.I for one cannot wait to play more of this game.

												I really enjoyed this game and played most of it in VR.  Here are the things I like about it:1. Tornadoes - The tornadoes are scary and the music that comes with them make them even more terrifying.2. Nice graphics and great sound effects and music.   I loved the cave with all the giant, glowing mushrooms.  I also loved the giant moon, that was my favorite scene.3.  First person and very immersive.4.  Very Interesting story line.  The further you get into the game, the more you learn about the alien race that used to inhabit the planet and what happened to them.Tips on playing:1. When in doubt, use your teleporter.  It serves as more than just for teleporting you back to a cave when the weather gets bad.    2. Food is everywhere, you don't have to stock up on it too much.3. Don't swim with your torch ;)**Warning Spoilers below**Suggestions for improvement (I know the game is no longer early access, but I think these would have made the game even better):1. There should be a suggestion in the beginning to use your teleporter to get into the first cave.  I was completely clueless on this and didn't think I could shoot it in there for some reason.  I actually stopped playing for quite some time because I got stuck on this and couldn't find the solution.2.  The player seems to care less about the aliens he actually encounters.  For example, when you get to the top of the windmill and activate it and then make a log afterwards, he says absolutely nothing about the reptilian/predator looking entity that was chained up trying to literally bite your head off.  I think that would have been important to note because it is the first alien contact you have.  That was not the only instance.  He reported once that he ""thought"" he saw one when in fact it was standing right in front of you.  Unless you really weren't paying attention, it's impossible to miss.  That probably should have been said the first time you saw one for the very first time standing in a window (which he said nothing about!).3.

Also, not everyone thoroughly searches everything, which is why there should be an abundance of the parts.5. There should be manual save options so I can go back to an older save.

												Let's start off with some backstory, just to be clear...When I was 8, the first Unreal game released. Not Unreal Tournament, no... Unreal Gold Edition with Return to Na'Pali. A campaign game, very shooter focused but also many RPG elements. Prior to Unreal Gold, my experience with gaming was purely simulators, mostly flight combat. I never owned a console, never experienced Zelda, but that game sold me on a genre I never knew existed. I completed the campaign and the expansion 4 times before downloading any modpack mini campaign I could find and playing those, too. Since then many games have released that had RPG elements which I've enjoyed. The newer Tomb Raiders, Fallout series, Elder Scrolls. I've loved them all, but none as passionately as that first, little-known game that truly taught me how epic a story a videogame could convey.Flash forward 18 years. I happen to be browsing Steam when a game pops up that seems to have some interest. ""Okay"" I say, as I watch the trailer like many before. ""I'll give it a try, why not it looks entertaining""I had no idea what I was getting.I think the first hint was probably the crosses with the aliens everywhere. Not simple crosses, no... crosses for aliens with 4 arms. But why, when these aliens all have 2? Where had I seen such crosses before? Could it possibly be? Nali?Enter aliens. ""Wait, is that a Skaarj?"" ""No but damn that's similar, and the staff reminds me an awful lot of the Krall..."" Then I start thinking about the plot. A technologically advanced mysterious alien race which subjugates a physically more frail other alien race that is still primitive in development, and uses their technology like magic? Well okay, also familiar... At least they don't have to mine Tarydium.So I complete the game, hyped up and craving more, but also still curious about these glaring similarities... Come to find out in an interview the developer seems to share the same passion I do for a little known old game...Overall, I thought the added survival elements really helped modernize it over the inspiration. They are well balanced if you know what you are doing, and select the correct level of difficulty for your preferred playstyle. The added spookiness over UG was unexpected but welcome, and never quite the jump scare most people go for, but a more subtle reaction in the gut. Walking up to a corpse, seeing it lean upright and stare up at me as I stand next to it... I didn't jump back but had to utter aloud ""Ohhhh no you did not just do that...""Honestly, the only thing I think this game is missing is an ASMD...Needless to say, I'll be raving about this one to friends for a while yet. The moment I get my Vive there will be a second playthrough happening.			"

												Another survival game.Well, not just /another/. Solus Project is different because the surviving is on another planet. The sf backstory is pretty good, and the visuals are truly evocative of being on another world. The Unreal Engine does a good job here. Its not totally at a triple A level but its at least double A. The sound quality is good, music comes in small doses, usually during a ""you done goodly"" or ""OMG"" moment. Setting the game to Ultra really put some stress on my 980 ti, not sure if the game needs more optimization or what. As far as the game play goes, you really are in a survival situation, the planetary temps get horrifically cold at night and you need to keep up with food and hydration constantly. A little /too/ constantly because there is a lot to discover and just when your close to finding some secret you have to stop and go find a plant to eat. The game comes in three levels of difficulty. I've only tried Normal and it keeps you busy, hard must be hellacious. Theres a little phone/computer you carry that gives all your stats and reminders such as ""User cold and wet"" or ""Starvation imminent"". The crafting is pretty rudimentary, mostly using this object on that object to get a result, for example hitting a tin can to open it so you can eat the food inside. For this genre its got a lot going for it in terms of the story, but going back and forth between survival and exploration is a bit annoying. A good buy though, I reccomend if you want a different spin on the survival game genre.System Specs: Cpu: 4790K Gpu: Gigabyte 980 ti G1 Mem: 16 Gigs Crucial TacticalAddendum:I have to add on to this review. After you get away from the crash zone your ""leash"" to thesurvival part of the game gets longer. And theres much more interesting things to discover.I won't put any spoilers here but the feeling of things being /alien/ is nicely done.			"

												This game is amazing! The ""story"", if you want to call it that, is good. It is literally exploration, and only what you seek out and find, that makes the story. What i am trying to say is, you can basically run through the game and not read anything or pay minimal attention to the things around you, but why would you do this?But now a few other, minor things that should be mentioned, for example the performance.It uses the Unreal Engine but sometimes stutters really bad, that has to do with the sky and ocean reflection updates.If you receive these kind of stutters, then there is a fairly easy fix for it:go and open:steamapps\common\TheSolusProject\Solus\Config\DefaultGame.iniin the config find and change following from True to False:AllowOceanUpdate=FalseAllowSkylightUpdate=FalseThis will help a lot, also go and enable FXAA in your driver settings, if you are on an nvidia card, this did help tremendously with my frames per second, boosting it from 45-50 to 90-95fps.TL;DR: Good game for little money for all explorers and spelunkers that know how to basic computer "

Product received for free
												I initially found The Solus Project to be visually enticing but difficult to get into. Interestingly enough, I approached each session of playing it with the same attitude. I sighed at the prospect of starting it up, but once I was in I found myself sufficiently immersed to keep on going until it was finally done. I felt the same about writing this review as well: unsure as to what I was going to write, but found plenty to write about once I started. Its level design and world building are great, its audiovisual style stellar, but it fails in making for a consistently solid gameplay experience. Don’t take that as a too harsh indictment of the game. If anything, The Solus Project is at its worst decent and a mark of wasted potential more than anything resembling a failure. It’s definitely one of the better survival experiences out there and others would do well to take a few pages from its book.Full Review Here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/the-solus-project "

Early Access Review
								I won't go into detail because there are many other reviews that cover most of what makes this game amazing.But I want to leave a positive review as well because the devs deserve it!The quality of the game is absolutely amazing -  no bugs, no issues at all - the only reason this game is in early access is because there are multiple episodes which will be released over time (for free). The mixture of surviving and story telling is awesome and works perfectly well.The visuals are absolutely beautiful and oh dear the sounds and music of the game, they add so much to the game to make it more immersive. Seriously the soundscape of this game is one of the best I've ever listened to in my entire gaming experience.A big plus is also the perfect optimization I have a GTX 980ti and it can handle the game perfectly well of course. But I also tested it on another PC with a 4 year old GTX 680 and I can run the game with stable 60 FPS on every setting maxed out (resolution scale 100%).Last but not least the Story is very interesting and will keep you playing the game because you want to find out and explore everything this game has to offer. I won't spoil anything at this point but believe me, you don't want to stop playing ;)All in all if you hesitate to try this game or not - just buy it, believe me you won't regret it!			"

												So If your looking to play this game I would say go for it when it's on sale, especially if you want to play games that are VR Compatible. I played the game all the way through in just about 20 hours. The game has a set story line which is good in some ways. You are allowed to explore areas to your leisure, but you do have to be aware of how hot and cold it is as well as how fed and hydrogenated you are, as this is a survival game. Something important to note this is also a HORROR/SUSPENSE game. So don't play this game if you don't like going into scary tunnels with dangerous traps and animal/plant life. You may be wondering what exactly about the game is Horror/Creepy like, well let me tell you (SPOILER ALERT), there is a part of the game where you are in a certain underground chamber and there are dead alien babes that are walking around and looking at you and making noise. But they only move when your not looking, so when you look behind you, you see that they have all moved closer. (Don't worry they don't actually do anything if they catch you, it's just creepy.) So if your okay with that then you will be okay with playing this game. Pros: Good StoryGreat Voice ActingGreat Graphics (If you can use the highest)A Lot of MysteryLarge amount of ground to ExploreGreat gadgetsCons:No World MapCan't fight anything.Crafting is limited.No tutorials are given with regard to interactions with certain hostile environments or animals/plants.Some game factors are completely unrealistic or annoyingly stupid: (For instance the fact that you can survive in 200 Degrees Fahrenheit for a while before getting heatstroke, The fact that Heatstroke can only be fixed by going somewhere extremely cold or by using a med-pack. You can't empty out a bottle of gas (Bottle of water with gas in it) unless you are using it to craft specifically. Some puzzles require you to place water in containers to open doors and you can't use the water from the Rare Wine Bottle that says it has water in it to open those puzzle doors.  "

												It might be the whisky, but I'll give a thumbs up to The Solus Project. There are however, quite a few BUTs involved. Why? Because Solus is a bit of everything and that will definately not please everyone. It has a bit of survival BUT it's far from hardcore. There is a lot of food and water to be found and if you build your personal warm/cold orb of doom (which I didn't because I'm a muppet) you should be fine. There's not a lot more to surviving than that. I didn't mind the casual survival as I am more of an explorer. Luckily there's a bit of exploring to be done BUT it doesn't really yield anything interesting. Although I'm a bit of a completionist the game didn't really give enough incentive to go looking for all secrets. The paths to the objectives are quite linear. No fancy-pansy-teleporting-swimming-through-acid shortcuts (yes I tried :).At times the game can be quite immersive. I liked the way down at the start of the game. The recordings your character makes are also quite nice (even though it's not interactive). Face it, you would be freaked out when YOUR spaceship was shot down RIGHT? Helas, most of the pages you find are quite boring. The story is ok, not horribly intricate but enough to make me play till the end to see what would happen. As I am not easily impressed by storylines I assume many people will think it is (and I quote) ""awesome"". The graphics are pretty decent. I enjoyed them but after seeing them again and again they did loose a bit of their splendor. The devs are quite fond of caves. At times it reminded me of the Fallout 3 metro tunnels. Quite exciting at first, but BUT damn there are a lot of them.Should I mention the UI? I probably shouldn't. It feels really consoly. Creating/combing items is a bit awkward. Inventory management if I can call it that is the same. Could've been optimized for PC. Then again, there's not a lot to build/combine so this won't bug you as much as you might think (the fact that there's not a lot to build might).But Elmo, you are the grumpy grump. Didn't you hate anything about this game? Well yes I did, how nice of you to ask! First of all, you are very, very slow in this game. This does NOT bode well for the human race. Second. The teleporter, oh the teleporter. What intern programmed that feature? In a glass half full scenario: you will get pretty good at making trick shots because the normal trajectory is so horrible.So all in all, a pretty decent walking sim. If you're not planning to get into every nook and cranny you might want to pick it up at a discount.Elmo, the grumpy lootmaster signing offps. did I mention getting stuck between pillars of basalt?

												 It is NOT a survival game like Alien: Isolation or something like that. There is nothing to shoot at or kill. I enjoyed the environmental elements and it was not difficult to stay alive, which gave you more time to absorb the story. It is not a game you have to hurry through but can enjoy exploring at a leasurely pace as long as you know where resources are. There were some really interesting parts. I would give it a solid 3.5 outta 5. Make it 4.0 if you like games like this. Good world exploration game. Fun.			"

												TLDR: This game is amazing.I am playing without VR, as a regular first person shooter style. In the dark, with only myself and my glowing monitor even vaguely visible.My first moments in the game was inspiring. I had no idea what I was doing, the world felt harsh and hostile and I was in awe of the sheer scale.I felt lost. Alone.It was perfect.The sound and ambience sucks you in. Audio cues tell you what's going on. I highly suggest headphones, surround sound if you've got 'em.The handcrafted nature of the world is obvious. Beautiful landscapes. Contoured caves. Convoluted secrets.The world itself is your enemy. Heat. Cold. Starvation.Storms.  The storms themselves are a sight to behold of terrifying proportions.Any of these can kill the careless and unprepared.Though the game itself is not particularly brutalizing and there are several levels of difficulty in which to choose from.  I played on balanced, and it was just that. Balanced well.  You don't grind to survive.  You scavenge and prepare and make decisions.I actually made a terrible decision at one point in the game, losing my torch. I battled constantly threatening hypothermia, but with a little tact, I managed to make it past the area.  Even if you make a mistake, not all is lost.Be smart when playing, and it's not a frustrating adventure in finding out how angry a game can make you.  It will take you on a fantastic story driven adventure.The only small issue I find with the game is that it's incredibly difficult to backtrack. The cave systems are winding mazes, and if you're an idiot like me and don't get all the tower pieces in each area, you're going to have a bad time.Because of this, I have not yet finished the ending, but the journey so far has been easily worth what I paid for the game.

Had a genuine jump scare which wasn’t even a jump scare because of the atmosphere and that’s usually a good sign in that department! It is quite a slow game though and those looking for a quick game to pick up and play are probably looking in the wrong direction here!For the full first impressions video.

Early Access Review
								This game casts you into the cosmos, stranded on an unknown world. The elements of survival (while basic) make it all the more realistic. I expect them to add a lot more items and functions to that system. That being said; the weather system is the best I have ever seen in a game; the random tornados, lighting and meteors especially knock your socks off! Beyond that the thrill of navigating a (seemingly) dead world is fantastic-even more so when you realize the ancient civilization that  once lived there. Uncovering their history is exciting. I would only say that the game is rather linear (which makes since considering the discover/progression of the game). That being said I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to feel trapped on a planet.			"

												I really enjoyed this game and played most of it in VR.  Here are the things I like about it:1. Tornadoes - The tornadoes are scary and the music that comes with them make them even more terrifying.2. Nice graphics and great sound effects and music.   I loved the cave with all the giant, glowing mushrooms.  I also loved the giant moon, that was my favorite scene.3.  First person and very immersive.4.  Very Interesting story line.  The further you get into the game, the more you learn about the alien race that used to inhabit the planet and what happened to them.Tips on playing:1. When in doubt, use your teleporter.  It serves as more than just for teleporting you back to a cave when the weather gets bad.    2. Food is everywhere, you don't have to stock up on it too much.3. Don't swim with your torch ;)**Warning Spoilers below**Suggestions for improvement (I know the game is no longer early access, but I think these would have made the game even better):1. There should be a suggestion in the beginning to use your teleporter to get into the first cave.  I was completely clueless on this and didn't think I could shoot it in there for some reason.  I actually stopped playing for quite some time because I got stuck on this and couldn't find the solution.2.  The player seems to care less about the aliens he actually encounters.  For example, when you get to the top of the windmill and activate it and then make a log afterwards, he says absolutely nothing about the reptilian/predator looking entity that was chained up trying to literally bite your head off.  I think that would have been important to note because it is the first alien contact you have.  That was not the only instance.  He reported once that he ""thought"" he saw one when in fact it was standing right in front of you.  Unless you really weren't paying attention, it's impossible to miss.  That probably should have been said the first time you saw one for the very first time standing in a window (which he said nothing about!).3.  I know VR is ""expiremental"" but there was some shimmering lights around plants and some other things that threw off the feel and graphics a bit.4. There should be more than just the 15 components around the islands.  I thought I got them all but was left 1 short.  I tried my best to retrace my steps, which took forever! but was not able to find that last one.  Had to use a cheat command.  Also, not everyone thoroughly searches everything, which is why there should be an abundance of the parts.5. There should be manual save options so I can go back to an older save.  I ran into a couple issues and was not able to load an older file so had to use cheat commands (like the time a pillar got stuck up on a ledge somehow).			"

												I wouldn't really call this a survival game- the survival elements are pretty basic, and the game tends to ignore them.Most of your time is spent underground with food and water pretty much just lying around for you to grab.However, the story here is pretty good, and the environments are beautiful. Even when the environment is trying to murder you in your face.The only thing that really bugs me about it is that, even when taking the time to study all the lore in-game, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. But then again, what horror game does?			"

												I played this in VR and even though VR-mode is currently only in Beta, I found the experience amazing and enthraling.  Would totally recommend it.The sense of presence in some of the areas (particularly the caves) is huge.  And when various monsters appear (which happens only after a few hours of peaceful exploration) then they have a real sense of danger.  Particularly when you are waiting in the dark listening to a monster passing, and afraid to equip your torch for fear it sees it.  And yet there aren't really any jump-scares, just occassional areas which give a sense of dread.  This is an exploration game, not a horror game. --Edit to my original review to state that the VR inventory has been updated and now works great.  And this, combined with the dev's visible work in this area, means that I am confident that the remaining VR issues (which are not so annoying as to detract from the whole marvelous experience) will be ironed out.  I don't want niggling mention of small issues to mar this review and potentially put people off a purchase, so I've removed them from the review and into their proper place as a bug report.So much have I enjoyed Solus that on upgrading from my 770 GTX (which actually ran the game fine on lower settings) to a new 1070 GTX, that I started my 10 hour campain again from scratch in all its graphical quality!

												This game is amazing! The ""story"", if you want to call it that, is good. It is literally exploration, and only what you seek out and find, that makes the story. What i am trying to say is, you can basically run through the game and not read anything or pay minimal attention to the things around you, but why would you do this?But now a few other, minor things that should be mentioned, for example the performance.It uses the Unreal Engine but sometimes stutters really bad, that has to do with the sky and ocean reflection updates.If you receive these kind of stutters, then there is a fairly easy fix for it:go and open:steamapps\common\TheSolusProject\Solus\Config\DefaultGame.iniin the config find and change following from True to False:AllowOceanUpdate=FalseAllowSkylightUpdate=FalseThis will help a lot, also go and enable FXAA in your driver settings, if you are on an nvidia card, this did help tremendously with my frames per second, boosting it from 45-50 to 90-95fps.TL;DR: Good game for little money for all explorers and spelunkers that know how to basic computer "

												Albeit slightly less optimized than I expected, on my gtx970 this game looks and feels absolutely gorgeous, with everything from the natural (and unnatural) landscape to the weather catastophes to the phenomenal star patterns and literally everything inbetween. If a game has ever made me want to buy VR, this would be it. Side note - patience is a virtue, especially when exploring.			"

												Let's start off with some backstory, just to be clear...When I was 8, the first Unreal game released. Not Unreal Tournament, no... Unreal Gold Edition with Return to Na'Pali. A campaign game, very shooter focused but also many RPG elements. Prior to Unreal Gold, my experience with gaming was purely simulators, mostly flight combat. I never owned a console, never experienced Zelda, but that game sold me on a genre I never knew existed. I completed the campaign and the expansion 4 times before downloading any modpack mini campaign I could find and playing those, too. Since then many games have released that had RPG elements which I've enjoyed. The newer Tomb Raiders, Fallout series, Elder Scrolls. I've loved them all, but none as passionately as that first, little-known game that truly taught me how epic a story a videogame could convey.Flash forward 18 years. I happen to be browsing Steam when a game pops up that seems to have some interest. ""Okay"" I say, as I watch the trailer like many before. ""I'll give it a try, why not it looks entertaining""I had no idea what I was getting.I think the first hint was probably the crosses with the aliens everywhere. Not simple crosses, no... crosses for aliens with 4 arms. But why, when these aliens all have 2? Where had I seen such crosses before? Could it possibly be? Nali?Enter aliens. ""Wait, is that a Skaarj?"" ""No but damn that's similar, and the staff reminds me an awful lot of the Krall..."" Then I start thinking about the plot. A technologically advanced mysterious alien race which subjugates a physically more frail other alien race that is still primitive in development, and uses their technology like magic? Well okay, also familiar... At least they don't have to mine Tarydium.So I complete the game, hyped up and craving more, but also still curious about these glaring similarities... Come to find out in an interview the developer seems to share the same passion I do for a little known old game...Overall, I thought the added survival elements really helped modernize it over the inspiration. They are well balanced if you know what you are doing, and select the correct level of difficulty for your preferred playstyle. The added spookiness over UG was unexpected but welcome, and never quite the jump scare most people go for, but a more subtle reaction in the gut. Walking up to a corpse, seeing it lean upright and stare up at me as I stand next to it... I didn't jump back but had to utter aloud ""Ohhhh no you did not just do that...""Honestly, the only thing I think this game is missing is an ASMD...Needless to say, I'll be raving about this one to friends for a while yet. The moment I get my Vive there will be a second playthrough happening.			"

												Another survival game.Well, not just /another/. Solus Project is different because the surviving is on another planet. The sf backstory is pretty good, and the visuals are truly evocative of being on another world. The Unreal Engine does a good job here. Its not totally at a triple A level but its at least double A. The sound quality is good, music comes in small doses, usually during a ""you done goodly"" or ""OMG"" moment. Setting the game to Ultra really put some stress on my 980 ti, not sure if the game needs more optimization or what. As far as the game play goes, you really are in a survival situation, the planetary temps get horrifically cold at night and you need to keep up with food and hydration constantly. A little /too/ constantly because there is a lot to discover and just when your close to finding some secret you have to stop and go find a plant to eat. The game comes in three levels of difficulty. I've only tried Normal and it keeps you busy, hard must be hellacious. Theres a little phone/computer you carry that gives all your stats and reminders such as ""User cold and wet"" or ""Starvation imminent"". The crafting is pretty rudimentary, mostly using this object on that object to get a result, for example hitting a tin can to open it so you can eat the food inside. For this genre its got a lot going for it in terms of the story, but going back and forth between survival and exploration is a bit annoying. A good buy though, I reccomend if you want a different spin on the survival game genre.System Specs: Cpu: 4790K Gpu: Gigabyte 980 ti G1 Mem: 16 Gigs Crucial TacticalAddendum:I have to add on to this review. After you get away from the crash zone your ""leash"" to thesurvival part of the game gets longer. And theres much more interesting things to discover.I won't put any spoilers here but the feeling of things being /alien/ is nicely done.			"

												I initially found The Solus Project to be visually enticing but difficult to get into. Interestingly enough, I approached each session of playing it with the same attitude. I sighed at the prospect of starting it up, but once I was in I found myself sufficiently immersed to keep on going until it was finally done. I felt the same about writing this review as well: unsure as to what I was going to write, but found plenty to write about once I started. Its level design and world building are great, its audiovisual style stellar, but it fails in making for a consistently solid gameplay experience. Don’t take that as a too harsh indictment of the game. If anything, The Solus Project is at its worst decent and a mark of wasted potential more than anything resembling a failure. It’s definitely one of the better survival experiences out there and others would do well to take a few pages from its book.Full Review Here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/the-solus-project "

												I purchased The Solus Project purely to play in VR, and while the controls take some getting used to the developers have been very open to feedback. Things are getting better at a very good pace. They also suggest playing this game outside of VR for a while to get your bearings, which I did. This is an amazing game even if you have no VR headset, but the immersion level when you are using VR is unmatched. If you want to help push the VR version further, buy the game and leave the developers feedback. If you are interested in the game without VR, you are in for a treat. The game is completed outside of the VR implementation.			"

												TLDR: This game is amazing.I am playing without VR, as a regular first person shooter style. In the dark, with only myself and my glowing monitor even vaguely visible.My first moments in the game was inspiring. I had no idea what I was doing, the world felt harsh and hostile and I was in awe of the sheer scale.I felt lost. Alone.It was perfect.The sound and ambience sucks you in. Audio cues tell you what's going on. I highly suggest headphones, surround sound if you've got 'em.The handcrafted nature of the world is obvious. Beautiful landscapes. Contoured caves. Convoluted secrets.The world itself is your enemy. Heat. Cold. Starvation.Storms.  The storms themselves are a sight to behold of terrifying proportions.Any of these can kill the careless and unprepared.Though the game itself is not particularly brutalizing and there are several levels of difficulty in which to choose from.  I played on balanced, and it was just that. Balanced well.  You don't grind to survive.  You scavenge and prepare and make decisions.I actually made a terrible decision at one point in the game, losing my torch. I battled constantly threatening hypothermia, but with a little tact, I managed to make it past the area.  Even if you make a mistake, not all is lost.Be smart when playing, and it's not a frustrating adventure in finding out how angry a game can make you.  It will take you on a fantastic story driven adventure.The only small issue I find with the game is that it's incredibly difficult to backtrack. The cave systems are winding mazes, and if you're an idiot like me and don't get all the tower pieces in each area, you're going to have a bad time.Because of this, I have not yet finished the ending, but the journey so far has been easily worth what I paid for the game.

												It’s pretty fun so far, if you’re into the survival stuff then it’s definitely worth a look. Maybe even for some horror fans since it is surprisingly creepy in places. Had a genuine jump scare which wasn’t even a jump scare because of the atmosphere and that’s usually a good sign in that department! It is quite a slow game though and those looking for a quick game to pick up and play are probably looking in the wrong direction here!For the full first impressions video.

												I've played this for several hours on my friend's vive, and it's one of the most expansive games on there, probably because it was a normal game first and they are working on adding VR support. Most vive games are very short and shallow, but this is a ""real game"" focused on exploration, and VR support makes it a lot more immersive and fun. While I had some trouble with the first part, once you get to exploring caves it becomes amazing. It is one of the deepest VR games currently available.			"

												Set in a beautiful world, with fantastic atmosphere and a real sense of being in a living, breathing enviroment! Although the gameplay mechanics are quite simplistic there is still a definate challenge when it comes to survival, allowing you to really feel like equal parts survivor and explorer. Wandering around a gigantic cave watching your flashlight's battery tick down to 0% is a nervewracking affair, and piecing together the situation is both fun and mysterious.Basically - imagine if No Man's Sky had focused on the survival aspect WAY more, to the point where it had actually done a good job of it, and then also presented you with a narrative to keep the journey moving forward, as well as context.

												Wow.  This game provides a bit more of what I had hoped ""No Man's Sky"" would provide.  Some real unique alien planetary exploration.  For some reason, I thought this game was considered a sequal to ""The Ball"", but you won't miss anything if you don't play ""The Ball"" and it's really a completely different type of a game.  ""The Ball"" being a entirely ball based purely puzzle game, and ""The Solus Project"" much more of an epic adventure survival game.  ""The Solus Project"" comes with three difficulty levels.  ""Casual"" - more for explorers that want to experience the story, but don't want to micromanage for survival.  ""Normal"" - this is what I'm playing.  You have to survive in adverse conditions, things like heat, cold, food, water and wetness all affect your heatlh.  You also have a visual hud that guides you through your most inportant taskes.  And ""Hardcore"" which is like ""Normal"" but you don't get hud icons and hints for what to do next.  I have seen it mentioned on the forums that real survival enthusiests tend to think ""Normal"" is too easy, and ""Hardcore"" is much more enjoyable.  Me...   I like survival, and I like not getting frusterated because I want to get to the next part of the story, as well as see much of the world... so I think ""Normal"" is about right for me.			"

It just feels almost hollow with how the rest of the game was built up.			"

												I will admit, I had a lot of trouble with some ofthe puzzles. There was nothing to explain them enough to solve or to even start solving. I had to look up what to do after about an hour on those puzzles. But, the game has one hell of a story line. I haven't even finished it yet. I love this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Surprisingly good game if you like an exploration game where everything is atmosphere and story based. Although its not under the genre it should be considered a mystery game as well.This is a very good exploration game where you alone are exploring this alien planets surface. Most of the gameplay involves the environment of the levels itself. When it comes to level design and feel this game is unique and i can't think of anything similar to it. The environments design is absolutely cool with full day and night cycles with dynamic weather(plus tornados). The surface of the planet does have an alien feel and what you find on the planet is definantly interesting and engaging. The levels span from beautiful all the way to eerie. The detail put into the alien appearance of the surface and structures is amazing especially when it comes to the alien technology that you will come across.As you explore you find mysterious pieces of a civilization whos history you piece together through writings and pictures. This story requires you to manually put the words and pictures together to get things to make sense. It pretty much is like learning of ancient civilizations on earth through the artifacts we've uncovered. This method is of story telling is not used often so you'll be in for a treat with this one.This is a casual game that is definantly worth a try. Unless you need continious action because it is very lonely on this planet.			"

												I had played the first few parts of this game on a monitor before knowing I would even be buying a Vive. I really like the game then. Now that you've added VR support and I've had a chance to play this game on the Vive I have to say that makes it outstanding!This game is in a unique position as it is a full - complete game!  In a world of early access and tons of people rushing to bring a product to market, this game is a clear winner for anyone looking for a full VR game to play.Super job devs with the quick adaption of VR support.  With all of your great game design experience and now adding VR, I hope you make another game with VR from the ground up - it could only be amazing.My only suggestion for this game is that there are some areas which are hard to spot in VR that were easier to see with a monitor, I'm thinking of a low cave entrance for example.  The last thing I wanted to add -there are some things in this game that playing on a monitor were clearly a problem but now - in VR - have their creepy scary factor upped quite a bit. I like it! "

												Wow.  That's all I can say for what I've experienced in this game with the Vive.  The environment is incredibly immersive and really gives you a sense of being on another planet.  It is just amazing.  There is one particular weather event that really gave me a true sense of helplessness the first time it happened.  I've only played for 5 hours so far so the story line is still unfolding but it really has nailed the core aspects of exploring a new planet while having to survive on what you can find.You especially owe it to yourself to experience this if you have a Vive.Update: Just wanted to give a little update after spending a lot more time with the game and using the lastest updated version tonight.  The game in its current state is one of the best games on the Vive.  It really is an incrediby powerful experience because of how well designed the alien environment is.  Now with the latest update the game is much easier to play and lose yourself in because there aren't any awkward control or gameplay issues to get in the way.   I really can't recommend this game enough.			"

												This would be a case for a mixed review, but since steam doesn't allow mixed I just can't quite recommend.There is quite a bit of interest in exploring this planet. The graphics are pretty good, the planet is errie and a lot of fun to explore at first.Unfortunately, the game eventually runs of how interesting things to have you do. Survival elements are pretty light and don't give much in the way of gameplay, there's a few nice puzzles and creepy moments, but for every good moment there is yet another ""find the next key"" moment.In the end the Solus project is a beautiful and intriguing but fairly shallow game, where you spend way too much time just wandering aimlessly looking for the next key hidden somewhere so that you can eventually make progress			"

								I just want to say - - I'm not the biggest survival game fan - -   But when I watched a ""Let's Play"" of this - I was seriously intrigued - - I only watched about 10 minutes of it - -  basically up til the guy finished talking his head off and built his first torch.    So I decided to pull the trigger and check it out for myself.   I'm seriously glad I did.   This game has a uniqueness to it that really resonates with me.  It's a puzzle game, exploration game, survival game, but it's wrapped into a neat little package that doesn't feel forced or over-developed.  It's very much a game that tells it's story through the environment.  Through discovering remnants of your crashed ship to reading diary's and heiroglyphs left behind by the alien civilzation.  None of this is particularly original, but the way it's handled is very well done I think, and the writing seems pretty well.   I can tell there are some very particular characters being developed behind the scenes and I can't wait to learn more.   I can't wait to uncover the secrets this world holds and why oh why some giant green ball of energy blew up my ship.  It doesn't really feel so much like a survival game as it does an adventure game.  With a sincere focus and direction and an obvious goal.   You aren't just dropped onto a planet naked and left to your devices.  There is a mystery to be uncovered, there are diary's to be found, heiroglyphs to be read, other trapping more inherent with a game like Gone Home or Myst.  The survival aspect I feel just adds to the challenge of solving the puzzles and uncovering the mystery.  The crafting mechanic that's seamlessly implemented into the survival system is very concise and isn't jumbled up with a bunch of silly recipes and experience point curves.  You aren't left fiddling with menu's or having to wait things to happen.  It just works, and it's simple and it's right in front of you. This is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys adventure games.  It's got beautiful world and what looks to be a beautiful mystery just waiting to be solved.  And I can't wait to solve it.   If you're looking for something fresh to play and don't mind Early Access - give this one a shot.   I'm sure you will be as impressed as I am.   Stellar game and it's future is looking very bright.And by the way - - Be mindful of of the weather.   Meteor Showers and Tornados will definitely ruin your day.			"

												Playing on the HTC Vive, this is the most enchanting and atmospheric experience I have had in VR to date. It is also the first long form game I have played on the Vive. The Solus Project has made me even more excited about the greater depth of games that will come to VR over time. To be able to play and explore for hours with a developing storyline uses virtual realities ability to enhance the emotional involvement of the user within games and shows how good development can lead to a very powerful gaming experience. Extremely enjoyable in VR, highly recommended!			"

								I see lots of good reviews, so maybe it's just an issue with my machine/Vive - I tried the game on Oculus DK2 originally, and it seemed pretty smooth back then (2 months or so ago?) - I saw it now shows up for Vive, so gave it a try. The intro video was smooth, but soon as I was in the actual game, the frame rate dropped to nothing and was really jerky moving around - had to shut it down fast because it hurt. I started on Ultra graphics, and then tried with low graphics, with the same issue. So you understand, I use an i7 4790K CPU, and a 980ti video card. It's not a PC power issue. Is this only happening on my Vive? I have to mark it down for now, because it's just unplayable on Vive so far (for my testing), regardless of the graphics settings.--edit-- changing this to a thumb up, since it seems this is a vsync issue they are working on and the game is playable if you disable vsync in the game files.

Posted: November 10, 2016
												This is a Virtual Reality review of the game using the HTC Vive.I usually really enjoy Survivor/Crafting type games but playing Solus felt more like a chore than anything. Finding food and water is actually incredibly easy, so the only real problem comes down to monitoring your temperature (I was hypothermic for hours after swimming in frozen water but there's so many medpacs around that I was never worried about dying) inventory management and avoiding bad weather. Also light sources are important for exploring caves and things, but it's easy to run out and get stuck in a dark cave, forcing you to blindly teleport yourself out. Some of the weather effects are really cool and scary (tornados, meteor showers, etc.) but walking around the huge environement in VR is absolutely not fun at all. It takes way too much time no matter what type of movement you're using.After an hour or so, I decided I would keep playing as I'd already payed the money and wanted to see where the story was going. However, around the 3 hour mark I've encounted some type of bug or issue where it's not showing me the next obective and I've become totally stuck and unable to progress. I could restart the game but I have absolutely no desire to do so. I would refund it but I've already played it too long.I tried playing the game in non-VR just on a regular monitor with mouse and keyboard, and the game seemed a lot more playable, but still somewhat mediocre (and ran like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my decently high end PC).It's too bad because I really wanted to love this game and certain aspects of it are good, but overall it's fairly mediocre and doesn't feel at all like a game that was built with VR in mind.

												This is a Virtual Reality review of the game using the HTC Vive.I usually really enjoy Survivor/Crafting type games but playing Solus felt more like a chore than anything. Finding food and water is actually incredibly easy, so the only real problem comes down to monitoring your temperature (I was hypothermic for hours after swimming in frozen water but there's so many medpacs around that I was never worried about dying) inventory management and avoiding bad weather. Also light sources are important for exploring caves and things, but it's easy to run out and get stuck in a dark cave, forcing you to blindly teleport yourself out. Some of the weather effects are really cool and scary (tornados, meteor showers, etc.) but walking around the huge environement in VR is absolutely not fun at all. It takes way too much time no matter what type of movement you're using.After an hour or so, I decided I would keep playing as I'd already payed the money and wanted to see where the story was going. However, around the 3 hour mark I've encounted some type of bug or issue where it's not showing me the next obective and I've become totally stuck and unable to progress. I could restart the game but I have absolutely no desire to do so. I would refund it but I've already played it too long.I tried playing the game in non-VR just on a regular monitor with mouse and keyboard, and the game seemed a lot more playable, but still somewhat mediocre (and ran like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my decently high end PC).It's too bad because I really wanted to love this game and certain aspects of it are good, but overall it's fairly mediocre and doesn't feel at all like a game that was built with VR in mind.

												I'm impressed with the Vive implimentation so far.  Knowing that there is more development to come makes this game a easy buy.  I'm happy they put the effort into teleport movement, but I LOVE the walking style movenet in VIVE.  This game gave me my first ""OMG, I might die"".  Not, ""OMG, I might need to reload.""   A very WOW monet.			"

												This is the best game up to now (June) available for Vive. It is not just a minigame, its full adventure with nice graphics and story lasting for hours and I havent finished it yet. I will remember the part Caves probably forever. The most emotive experience in VR I have encoutered.			"

												Playing on the HTC Vive, this is the most enchanting and atmospheric experience I have had in VR to date. It is also the first long form game I have played on the Vive. The Solus Project has made me even more excited about the greater depth of games that will come to VR over time. To be able to play and explore for hours with a developing storyline uses virtual realities ability to enhance the emotional involvement of the user within games and shows how good development can lead to a very powerful gaming experience. Extremely enjoyable in VR, highly recommended!			"

								got up to the part where it takes me back to the main menu due to no more content after that point. All i can say is what a marvelous game. I lost alot of confidence with early access games but this hit the ball out of the park. The crafting system is a brilliant mechanic. The weather anomalies are amazingly scary. The whole game is amazing so far. The fact that you find snippets of lore and everything is so mysterious is brilliant. You have nailed the atmosphere as i was bricking myself just from sounds alone. Some things do need a tad bit of work, for example the inventory system is abit simple and could do with improving. Apart from that this game is excellent and promotoes going off the beaten track with secrets you can find. absolutely in love with it. 9/10			"

Early Access Review
								I have started playing this game without knowing what to expect. The thing I was more afraid of was the optimization thing. You know, UE4 isn't exactly canon yet as far as I know. Still, the game runs smoothly no problem, everything maxed. Now back to the game: reading all info regarding your system and the environment that matters in a extremely well crafted and properly designed mobile device is definitely good and helps immersion. You can tell the developers do care about details, since temperature will raise and decrease according to your placement (right under a breaking sun or taking advantage of cooler shades? This matters as well). You sweat? You have to drink more. -15° and you decide to jump in the ocean? Hypothermia, here we go! But what I like the most is that The Solus Project awards exploration while being story driven at the same time. This is not one of those games where ""you make the fun"" (or I'd rather say ""we don't care, so please make your story!""). As far as I have played: good graphics, good atmoshere, decent narrative and good gameplay!			"

								The atmosphere in this game is just superb... You know you are alone, but you're always checking around just in case. The audio is amazing greatly increasing the feeling of presence.The weather will surprise you at the worst of times too. Overall the game is shaping up nicely with frequent updates and a well engaged developer. My only criticism so far is that the game feels quite linear at this moment, but it’s still in early access and I am keen to see how it develops.It’s great fun until you accidentally fall off a ladder XD so far 8/10!

First the story without spoils: You're stranded on a foreign world and need to assemble a radio type tower to signal a satellite all while exploring the mysteries and dangers that lie on it. This story along side amazing gameplay and vastly superior graphics?_____ This is the part where I say 10/10 but I can't really since after all it's still an early access and if I know my early access survival games then this could shoot downhill fast but I highly doubt it with this one. All in all it's worth the low cost and in time a 10/10 worthy game.			"

												[VR Review]I got a Vive VR headset, and this was the first game I wanted to try it on. Anyways, first impressions were very good - the VR experience is very amazing. The controls took a bit of getting used to (although keep in mind that this could just be because I'm new to VR).My current graphics card is an AMD Fury, but even with that I had to lower the settings to around medium quality overall to stop the framerate tearing I was seeing. The calibration and aiming controls for interacting with the environment work well, and I ran into no problems with those.The only major issue I had was that I could not figure out how to open the inventory. All the other buttons worked correctly (i.e. interacting, movement, jumping, etc.), but no matter what I tried the inventory button wouldn't work. I may have been using it wrong I suppose, but I doubt it, as I'm already very farmiliar with the gameplay of The Solus Project. The radial menu for inventory opens correctly for crafting and interacting with other objects, too.But besides that one issue, it's a truely excelent VR experience! -------------------------------------------<ORIGINAL NON-VR REVIEW>[The review was getting so many edits to it, and was getting really messy, so I'm doing a complete rewrite...]First impressions were a bit clunky - it took me a while to get used to some of the controls and elements of the game, but I started having fun after that with a lot of the puzzles. The game reminds me the most of ""Myst/Riven"", and the puzzles are somewhat challegning. That being said, the ""challenege"" of the puzzels is mostly the challenge of finding the next switch far too often lol...In any case, if you are looking for an atmospheric puzzle game with a deep intriguing story, I high heartily recommend this game. It is a lot buggier than any other ""Early Access"" game I've played, though.Some of the biggest annoyances for me are that you get ONE save slot (which can be TERRIBLY gamebreaking for any number of reasons when a save occurs at a TERRIBLE time), and there is no real way to completely turn off the ""survival"" elements of the game for people (like me) who would much rather just ""explore"" without having to manage an absurd amount of ""survival"" elements...Additionally, the falling damage is ABSURDLY unfair and broken - your legs must be made of chewed up toothpicks, because a 3 foot fall causes falling damage ffs, and it scales in damage EXPONENTIALLY fast, so that anything above 15 feet or so just plain up MURDERS you.THANK GOD that the collision detetction is ETREMELY sound, so at least I'm not dying because I slid down a slope all the time like some other games I could mention! n.nUOn the plus side, it's SO REFRESHING to see a game that DOESN'T use ""invisible walls"" all over the place (the ONLY time I ever ran into one was when I tried to swim very far out into the ocean, and I guess that's fair - it's hard to come up with any other way to add a barrier in that situation).Also, the game runs flawlessly in ""Fullscreen Mode"" - it just freezes up and lags like mad in ""Windowed Mode"".So I DEFINATLY recommend you try this game! I've been wanting a fun and challenging puzzle game for a long time (one that DOENS'T include tons of ""horror"" elements, whcih all the morte recent ones usually have, sadly...).			"

Highly recommended for those that enjoy survival games but would like something without as much grinding as games like ARK.A very professional presentation, as the developers already have 2 (?) games (The Ball and Unmechanical) under thier belt. I have no seen any unfinished assets or placeholders as of yet. From what I understand the game is complete, but not all content is fully implemented yet.			"

You begin on an alien planet and need to survive by gathering supplies into your backpack and/or gathering them in a cave.The nights are very cold and the days are warm, so at night you need to keep warm. You do this by finding the necessary supplies then using them to stay safe. Once you do so, you can begin to explore more safely.There are puzzles, traps, secrets, and more along the way. Backstory is provided via pages strewn around from the wreakage. Some story is also provided by alien structures/monuments. The rest of the story is provided by voice.The sound effects and music are all really good and help pull you into it.As this review is from Early Access, there's currently some bugs. Nothing major.But, some annoying things could be better such as when getting wet its quite difficult to read the in-game UI as there's these big water droplets in the way that may not be moving out of the way.The water droplet animation is REALLY bad.And some other things... what they improve or fix in the end just isn't known at this time.You can jump and move around at will. Into the water you go! The ONLY invisible walls I've noticed are deep at sea.There's plenty more to find out for yourself...Overall, definitely recommended. I haven't wanted to play a survival based game until now.

												This game didn't live up to my expectations. I expected a lot of exploration on another planet, maybe some unusual plot twists. Unfortunately while I really had to walk a lot on this planet all the exploration seemed too simplistic. A shrine here, 2 idols there. And why do I have to spend so much time in the dark caverns? It is dark, damp and unpleasant in the caverns. This game is a little too psychological for my taste. If you are looking for exploration and don't want to explore dark caverns for hours this game is not for you. But if you like psychological games with some pressure and a dark atmosphere you can try this game.			"

ALOT of water, i mean come on i need more water then there is in the sea there, it is just too much.If you get too cold you can ONLY warm up again if you are dry. I got hypothermia and jumped into a JET ENGINE to warm me up, I still died of hypothermia.The falling damage is just too much. If i jump down from like 2 meters i get quite the amount of damage from it.These things bug me while playing the game, but overall it is an interesting game and i enjoy playing it.Exept for the dying part.  I hate that (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This game didn't live up to my expectations. I expected a lot of exploration on another planet, maybe some unusual plot twists. Unfortunately while I really had to walk a lot on this planet all the exploration seemed too simplistic. A shrine here, 2 idols there. And why do I have to spend so much time in the dark caverns? It is dark, damp and unpleasant in the caverns. This game is a little too psychological for my taste. If you are looking for exploration and don't want to explore dark caverns for hours this game is not for you. But if you like psychological games with some pressure and a dark atmosphere you can try this game.			"

												I'm genuinely surprised by the ""Very Positive"" review average for this game. I played it in VR using the Oculus Rift and was bored to tears. The problem is that this is a game that relies solely on atmosphere, given that nothing happens 99% of the time, and doesn't have the sense of presence that an experience like this requires. This kind of game can work, and incredibly well when put together in a compelling way. However, what's here is uninteresting and serves as a rare case of a game that makes you feel like you played longer than you actually did. A good game feels the opposite.			"

												I guess this game is designed for PC/xbox play, and I hate to say that I don;t think it translates so well to a VR experience.  The interface is quite clumsy, using 'look' type cursor mechanic in several places that can be an uncomfortable experience to manage.  The scenery looks nice in the videos, and I'm sure it is just as stunning when played on a flat screen, but appears to be quite lacking when viewed through the lower res of a VR headset.   Movement through the VR environment is clumsy, and use of Vive controllers makes menu and action controls unintuitive and cludgy.  I think a bit of a rework on the VR support would make this a MUCH better experience for the Vive!			"

												Goldfish. Yup, you're reading that right. Goldfish. Apparently, they have memories which only last a matter of seconds. How someone figured that out I have no idea. Perhaps someone taught the fish morse-code or two-bubbles for 'yes' and one for 'no' but anyway. They're lucky really. You stick them into a bowl around a foot wide, put in some rocks and a castle and they'll find it endlessly exciting. ""Ooh, rocks! Never seen that before!."" ""Ooh a castle! Never seen that before!"" ""Ohh rocks! never seen that before!"" Repeat ad infinitum.Goldfish would love Solus Project. If they had fingers... and could remember the controls long enough to use them.At first Solus Project appears to have it all. Great atmosphere, interesting scenery, a mysterious planet and spectacular environmental effects which vary from tidal patterns and dynamic weather to tornados and meteor showers. It's a walking simulator with some survival elements thrown in to keep things interesting... or at least, it attempts to. Just for a moment, go look at the screenshots. Now understand that what you see there is what you'll be looking at for the rest of the game. The first island looks like the second, the caves look the same, the alien ruins look the same. It's that goldfish in the bowl but you don't have the ability to forget that what you see 10hrs into the game is largely the same as what you saw in the first hour. When you look at the game, you may think that this is an open world. It isn't, it's a linear environment that ironically loops back upon itself. So not only is it repetitive, it also makes the player retread through areas they already visited. The level design of the game itself also has a number of issues. The translocator teleportation device is intended to allow you to traverse the landscape more easily but handles really poorly. It's like throwing a metal cooking tray with all of the dead weight you would expect but then, almost paradoxically, it bounces off of surfaces like it was made of rubber. Worse still is the fact that it can come to a stop on an angled surface that is actually too steep for the player to stand on, so when you teleport to it you slide down. There are also numerous instances where the translocator will allow you to teleport into a space where you are trapped. This frequently happens with the pentagon shaped pillars you see the developers have reused again and again throughout the environments. When trapped by the world geometry in this way your only option is to quit out and load up your last save game. As you can imagine, this deters a player from exploring which works contrary to the point of the game.As the developers themselves have said, it is the players fault if they get themselves into 'bad spots' and not their responsibility to build the world to prevent these problems as any attempt to do so would be ""even more immersion breaking"". So no doubt there are many more ways for the player to get stuck, break progression by going off the intended route or get trapped in world geometry throughout the game because the devs feel that it is better for players to get stuck and have to reload their last save point or use the command console to fix the problem than to fix issues with the game.It also appears that the world is also ""quite similar visually by design"" which they feel excuses why it feels repetitive.All in all, Solus Project is far from worth picking up even on sale. A lot of effort has gone into the games atmosphere but there just isn't anything to make it interesting to play after the first couple of hours. Hunting around for secret caves and bonuses which give 1% to a stat is also really poor design as the reward does not justify trudging around the intentionally repetative environments shining your torch into every dark corner to see if there is something tucked away off the clearly established route to the next area, I really wanted to enjoy the Solus Project - but saddly I'd need to be a goldish to do that.(edit - updated middle of review to reflect the fact that the devs did not intend to create platforming sections although they exist and that Wrenchse (a developer) has stated that the problems with level design ""might mean that people get themselves into bad spots"" but that ""we do think that is more preferable than having invisible boxes blocking stuff off"".)

												A real diamond in the rough, that I wish I could reccomend. The underlying story is intriguing and keeps you tethered for more, but it's revealed almost entirely through written text. Some of the environments reveal the mystery, but the player direction and dialogue are dumbfounded and entirely disconnected.It would be reasonable to assume that the dialogue was recorded far too early and then neglected. Leaving you bewildered when the idiot protagonist ever opens his mouth. Whilst this alone shouldn't ruin a game, the final act is entirely construed from this. The player is leashed to a moron, sighing every step of the way as we slowly drag our feet to the inevitable conclusion. The ending leaves a lot to be desired, and speaks volumes of the overall experience. ""Why even bother?"" "

The story hypes you up for what would seem like some sort of scary, awesome alien monster but at the end of the story - theres just nothing. Its all so dissapointing. Honestly this story was a bigger letdown for me than No Man's Sky, becasue the game itself was so great.			"

								For Vive owners. Even though it doesn\'t say vive support atm it can be played on the Vive.First review I\'ve done on steam and I\'m doing it because the developers have been so good and talkative about the vive update and progress. I\'ve been waiting for vive support to be sorted before starting the game.I have just tried the new update and to those wondering if it works with the vive it does and it works great! Motion controllers have been sorted out, menu and intro now work in VR, lots of options have been added for controls and walk speed, and it looks great. I have 2 x 980 TI in SLI and it runs a dream all on ultra in the headset. I can\'t say how it will run on lesser cards.Hope this review is helpful, I\'m looking forward to playing the game now Vive is sorted.			"

												Disclaimer:  I played this on PC (non VR)  This game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.On one hand, it's an exploration / adventure game,  which makes sense seeing as it is the spiritual sequel to ""The Ball"" which had a heavy emphasis on puzzles and adventure, with nary a survival element to be found. Unfortunately it seems as though Sjoerd realized that it was 2016 , and survival games were popular, so he shoe-horned in a bunch of ill-fitting survival mechanics which do very little to make the game enjoyable.  I'd go as far as to say that they shoot it in the foot.Swimming will make your character cold and wet, and quickly kill you from hypothermia.  Not that there's much to see underwater anyway, it's mostly just an empty expanse of sand.  Your character will constantly complain about needing food, so you will be forced to bash open tin cans with rocks and repetetively munch on the contents until the suit stops ♥♥♥♥♥ing at you.  There are text logs scattered throughout the world which you can discover with your ""WILSON"" (LOL Castaway reference!) device.  They aren't very interesting. They say first impressions are everything,  and this game doesn't make a very good one. It is fairly mediocre looking with low poly assets and low resolution textures.  It somewhat compensates for this with a stylized look that was also present in ""The Ball"" (textures tend to look hand painted), but the best I could say about it is that it looks passable.  Kind of like a better than average looking Unreal Engine 3 game ( Bulletstorm came to mind in spots)  Given that it needs to run at a high framerate to support VR devices, this isn't a huge surprise.  Don't expect your jaw to be dropping to the floor here.Fairly dissappointed in this one.   It was developed by an indie dev I respect, and I *want* to like it, but It's just not grabbing me.  Maybe I'll give it another try another time, but for now, I'd recommend that if you want an exploration / survival game that is actually decent try Subnautica or The Long Dark instead.			"

								I have been following development on Twitter for some time. The world looks amazing which is what led me to buy early access so quickly. The gameplay is equally interesting. It is still very basic but exploring is already fun. I stumbled into a hidden cave and found two relics. I also like an idiot managed to lose my only rope. I only meant to spend about a half an hour my first play session but easily went over an hour. This was partly due to my surprise at seeing a rocket land in the distance that when I finally came to it contained some much needed supplies. As long as development continues this game totally has my thumbs up.Gameplay:

												So far, really good first impression. I really want to explore more though I would prefer normal game cues vs the obvious ""go here"" early on. Yeah, it requires a bit more effort but it's worth it to the player. (ask Valve about phenomenal player cueing and manipulation). On Vive, very underutilized and shoddy controls by default. I hope that clumsiness changes or we can customize them outright on our hand controllers because with intuitive controls it could be tremendous but the way they have them now is ...  irritating at best.Really looking forward to playing this more (despite the awful Vive controls).

												Short answer:Trite and predictable story, puzzles to solve aren't really puzzling, just busy work, with a survival system that has all the same problems as most do.Heh they even did the predictable 'horror' trope of one part of the game following you around with laughing baby doll things, in space...With hard settings for survival, you seem to barely last 5 minutes without apparently dying of dehydration. Puzzles are mostly avoid bear traps and flame-shooting things to get a key, or other dvice to make another thing open. P.S. why does a supposedly advanced race need bear traps and other floor-triggered things? I mean, the next stage up is leaving out curdled milk for me to drink while I'm randomly dying of dehydration, no?There are also some core issues with the level handling, which repeats areas. But, at a couple points it loops you back through where you came from, where there are 3+ routes to take and it isn't ultimately clear, because sometimes the forward-vector breaks, which means you may run in circles for 30 minutes+ before you find what it should have been pointing at. Fun. Or when something gets triggered but your view of that thing is obscured when it happens and it tells you to follow that thing...so...you wander until you figure it out...equally fun.All-in-all, not worth the money spent on it.

												I'm sure the basic game experience is wonderful, but the barrier to entry for playing this in VR is too high IMO.You are met with a barrage of several pages of text trying to explain the buttons and how to play before the game starts and expected to remember it all at once and just get stuck in.There are no simple usability niceties like labels which appear near the controllers pointing to different buttons labelling their functions (it's something I first saw with tilt brush and have since seen in some games too).I'll come back and try it again when I notice a VR related update and revise my review if things have been fixed, but as it is I would not recommend the game, for VR playing at least.

								Graphics are very good (Unreal Engine 4).Sound effects are very good and some nice scary effectsIf you play on easy the survival aspect is somewhat lost. the game is more of an explorer game. Lots of strange stuff to explore. Also some RPG elements. Like finding boots that give +1 walking speed. There is no fighting in this game. If you like the TV Show called Lost then this game might be just for you. The starters area somewhat reminded me of Lost. All in all very good game so far. Will update more when I am out of the bloody caves.Escaped the caves and shortly I finished the game. I did miss out on a lot of secrets and notes so going for a second play through.			"

								A fantastic and immersive story driven survival game, The Solus Project is something special in a world filled with survival sandboxes. Stranded on an alien world, humanity's dwindling hope for survival must uncover the mysteries of an ancient civilization while battling a hostile environment, and solving strange puzzles.Graphically, the game is amazing. The landscapes are alien and beautiful, and the night sky is breathtaking.The music and sound effects add a level of eeriness to the world that really drives home the feeling that you are not on Earth.The gameplay is survival with food, water, sleep, and body temperature all while balancing the need to always progress and explore.All in all, it is a satisfying experience.

								I dont like games like this as a rule but this one had me hooked. The sound is good, it looks loverly and very atmospheric.The only thing i have an issue with is the movement is very heavy going sometimes, just seems like you have a rubber band around your waist when you try to jump onto rocks or causways.I hope there are many more hours to add as its early access.

								Awesome GameThe Positive:1: Now Vive suported, jsut takes about 5-10 trys to get it to start due to all the crashes (still in beta suport for the Vive)2: Movement is done with your left controllers trackpad (forward, back, strafle left and right) on the Vive, so no Teleporting, wich inhances the immersive play3: Turning is done by you moving about, or clicking the edge on the right controlle (if not, it was the left, cant remember)4: New Game Slot, here you can start a new game, having one for none VR and one for VR, if you want that.The Negative1: Croutch toggle, I wish they had a RL tracking croutch as you play this game, since it would make the game more immersive2: VR\'s \""grainy view\"", this is the downside to any VR game, having those iny black dots that you get from any VR headsett, this affects the PDA reading, wich is terrible, since all the info you need is on it. adjusting the VR headset does help abit, but not enough3: No Option shortcut for the Vive to tinker with settings			"

								This awesome game strongly reminds me of an old good Unreal I so much! Of course - it was made by the lead of Hourences (see wondeful ""The Ball"" game also). You even can find Easter Egg with Nali crucifiction in some secret in the caves:) So i am happy! I really can call it a ""New Unreal"" game! Strongly recommend - this is not your usual survival POS - here we have strong story and plot and game mostly based on exploration and story and mission based instead of those usual flat collecting of junk and keeping your stomach full. So for all Unreal fans - buy it and your will never be dissapointed. Even for EA stage this is a masterpiece already. 11 from 10!P.S. Does someone missed that cool Translocator thing from Unreal Tournament 1999? Prepare for a mighty return:)P.P.S. Also those guys are so serious that they gave us the working console to fun around it. I like such approach so much! For all of your indie devs who disables console in the first day of development but always forgot to add full support of key rebind and other important options. You are the miserable hobos. Watch and learn, watch and learn and again watch and learn...			"

								So I finished up quite a bit of TSP before I decided to write this. The idea is new, and very immersive. I do wish there'd be combat, but the entire puzzle aspect of the game is well developed and can stand on its own. The world is immersive, and there's a very real sense of isolation that is invaluable in bringing the game to life, but not to the point of horrifying. There's  a sense of fear of what's over the horizon, and the weather anomalies really help to highlight that this is a world untamed by humanity.Please finish this game. I want to see what's over that horizon you guys keep hinting at!			"

												I bought this on steam sale hoping that it'd be a good game to branch out with but I find it clunky.  I think that more can be done to make it VR ready, some of the PDA screens clip and it's hard to read.  Also from the very start I found it hard to get into, not entirely sure why.  Maybe I'll give it another chance in the future but so far I don't want to play it.			"

												In VR, the game is incredibly bad performing. On my system it runs with >60 fps on highest settings at 1920x1200 in the normal mode, but in VR it's stuttering when I go beyond the lowest settings. VR needs a serious performance update to be feasible. Lowest options will make UE4 (one of the most advanced engines in existence) look worse than UE2 from more than 10 years ago (which is not exactly furthering the immersion), stuttering will get you motion sickness.Games of this kind have to be played standing (except you have a solution for the headsets cord wrapping around you and your seat), without being able to freely rotate you will get uncomfy very fast. The devs are working on the neccessary adjustments for inventory handling, but at the moment they are not released and you have to rifle through all your pesky items every time you need something. The VR controls do not allow strafing (walking sideways), which is very annoying as you have to rotate all the time to make a step around an object (which may give you a headache over the time), will hopefully be fixed soon.While The Solus Project offers an interesting world to immerse yourself, the technical side of the game in VR is severely lackluster at the moment. I'd recommend to put it on your wishlist and wait for the neccessary patches to be implemented.Review will be updated as the game was.			"

												The game looks amazing, and has it's ""Holy crap!"" moments.  But for me and a few other people, it has one critical flaw.  We're unable to save the game, and when we change areas our inventory completely vanishes.  I put about 2 hours or so on my first playthrough, exploring the world, picking up loot and experiencing what the game has to offer.  Only to progress to the next area and have everything disappear.  ""No big deal.  I saved just before I came in here so maybe it's just a bug.""  I loaded my ""saved"" game found it dropped me right at the beginning in the water, with nothing actually saved.  The only thing it saved was the fact that I was no longer in the drop pod.  But I was going through the motions in the water as if I was leaving the pod...  I spent the next 3 hours of game time on record trying everything to find a fix for it.  Went to the developer's website and tried the suggestions there, went to the forums and got some assistance, but after awhile everything went dark.  So I deleted the game and have abandoned it since.  Buyer beware.			"

												tl:dr You walk and walk and walk and as you get to the end you get hugely disappointed.The begining is absolutely amazing. It kept me on the edge of my seat all the time.However as you get further into the game you realise that you don't really need to worry about food or water (I've never run out), sleeping isn't an issue, controling your temperature only gets problematic towards the end of the game and you don't really need to care about meteor showers, tornados or storms.The game became extremely frustrating somwhere half through. I only finished it because I was curious about the story and how it will end. The ending let's just say was really bad. In my opinion of course.Also the puzzles, aside for one or two, were boring.

												OK FREAKING AWESOME - how ever I can't get the hang of it. (controls are not logical - poorly implimented)  I have to say that VIVE games and demos so far have been so logical that the control is just intuitive.  NOT THIS GAME.  At the start I had a bit of that initial ""AWE"" that I had when I first used my vive for the first hour.   But the frustration of the controls eventually took over and ruined the experience.  I with this was a  ""NEUTRAL"" recommend as it's GREAT - but it's HORRIBLE but I suspect it will be fixed.  I crashes, I made it to a cave, a drank some water, I ate some food, I filled my water can... I was looking for shelter and I saw red spots and died. (I THINK) I seemed to be alive, but I no longer could move.  (or was that the lousy control?)    Graphics are stunning. I used AA and 150% and it was very nice and sharp. SOME text is hard to read on the tricorder but just bring it up to your face and it gets clear. (I had no issue with that and liked the high res text). I really liked what seemed like steam/breath from my mouth - and the VIVE head set feels like you're wearing a space mask.  I felt great, but the movement wasn't like walking and killed the emmersive feel. Rotating was click to turn. (wasn't into that) other games have good movement. (budget cuts!).   I think eventually I will get the hang of controls. But at this point (about 20 minutes into it) I have no desire to try again.  So  NO RECOMMENDATION to buying it.  HOWEVER it's freak'n cool - and I'm sure will have major complaints about control and I'm sure it will be fixed. (do I refund it until then?)  I hate hassling steam... so I'll prolly keep it and wait for a update.   BUY IT give is thumbs down to help make them fix it.    Looks and feels like a AAA title - but has indy (single man dev control) or worse.  ?  so like whats with that? No one beta tested it and complained?			"

I NORMALLY GET MOTION SICKNESS BECAUSE THE MOVEMENTS ARE BUMBY OR CAMERA ANGLE TO LOW DOWN NOT WITH THIS GAME!!

FOR THE PRICE ITS A PRACTICAL GIVE AWAY. OH AND NOT ONLY CAN YOU SWIM IN THE SEA YOU CAN GO UNDER TOO. IVE SAID THAT BECAUSE READING THE OTHER REVIEWS NO-ONE MENTIONS SWIMMING WHICH ADDS TO THE FUN. THERES EVEN TIDES! ITS SO REALISTIC I OFTEN FORGET IM IN A GAME AND YET IM NOT PLAYING IN VR THATS HOW GOOD THIS GAME IS!HOWEVER THE GAME IS NOT AT ITS BEST YET! THE CONTROLS - TOO MANY. PROBABLY BETTER PLAYED ON XBOX. CANNOT SAVE WHEN YOU WANT TOO. IT ONLY SAVES WHEN YOU SLEEP AND AT CERTAIN SHRINE POSTS .

								Nice graphics and  gameplay, but too short game 7.6 hrs and I waste a lot of time doing nothing and the game is finished.Only a few glitch I found. One is the smalls holes you can find in the path and if you use the teleport gun you can pass and walk in the wall. You can try the glitch in the end of this game  before the final temple there is a statue in a room with ice in the flore with 4 big stones, one of the corners in the top have a small entrance and you can find a relic there and you can see small hole as small entrance (but it is not), remember use your teleport gun. Other problem, is the big pilar stones you see close to the mountains you can clime them but if you fall between those you will stuck forever and reload the game.This game lack of tutorial and need more easy way to do fire place or combine 2 object with out throwing to the flor or a video showing how to do it. White color for pick up or orage color for use is not a good way, I have burn my roots or bushes by accident because All this objects are together and you have hard time trying to pick up just one object, we need a storage is look lest meassy.Definitely this game need some telescope or more zoom option  on your helmet, I will not risk falling or walk long distance for just one pipe or something unnecessary object.This game is great with amazing natural disasters and definitely is fun, but you tell us the game is complete? With only 2 more levels for the final release. Please this game have a lot of room for improvement and story, made this game more awesome. "

												I bought this game for the Vive, and frankly, it was horrible. The motion controllers didnt work how youd expect them to. I was so disorientated that I couldn't get past the intro. The hud was also unreadable. I tried to play sitting with a controller, and the controller was also strange. You can only walk forward and backward, you cant strafe and turning with the right stick only ""blinked"" you in different directions. I understand a lot of this was to combat motion sickness, but it only made things worse. Not to mention that when I walked in room scale, the environment around me didnt move at all. Very sickening. But for the pros, it does seem like it would have a good story. Excellent visuals and amazing intro.Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the vr support. May I suggest you wait on advertising VR support until it's a lot more polished. Good luck!			"

												After watching the videos and screen shots i thought to my self this game looks my type of game, loved call of the star seed, but to my disapointment there not even in the same league. This maybe decent enough for oculus users but it just lacks everything you need for a immersive vr game.First of all the controls dont make sense and are awful to use, i could not find away to view all my items in my bag you just have to cycle through them. Interacting with items probably the worst ive ever seen in vr to date (pointing and clicking items with no relation to distance from you just takes away from the experience, which after a while just feels like a really bad cave simulation game.The lack of ambient sound, no foot steps, breathing, any type of noise when you drop otr iteract with items.The only game ive ever had refunded in 5 years on steam.Im sure if i gave this game more of a chance there would be slight improvements later in the game but the first hour bored me to tears. very disapointed.

Covered more ground in a just a few minutes of gameplay with the new nav system than I did in the previous 2 hours with the old nav system.  One of the best VR games I've played so far. No doubt the devs pay close to attention to feedback.

												Don't buy it. Just.. don't. It's not a survival game it's a walking simulator with some minor annoyances added on. The exploration portion of the game is just mindlessly launching a teleportation frisbee around until you find the one percent resistance increasing maguffin in some random cave. The plot just falls apart at the end with no real answers just speculation and mustache twirling. If you don't know the company made ""The Ball"" you will be reminded. A lot.

												Review for VIVE version only, this is no reflection on the base game which by all acounts looks pretty fantastic.I'll get this out of the way first; If youre buying this to play purely on the Vive, unfortuately I do not recommend the game in its current state, for a few reasons:- Many of the interaction nodes are superfluous. For example, if im holding the torch in my actual hand, theres no need to have an extra step to trigger the combination with the oil container - i should just be able to dip it in myself. Same goes for many of the other cutting/combining actions.- Similarly, a crouch control is unneccesary when I have full freedom of movement in real space- The scale of many items, as well as the terrain is far to too large. The PDA is a prime example, appearing approximately a foot long! I can move the thing up to my face so it doesnt need to be that big- Inventory management seems unnecessarily cumbersome with the current contol scheme - this is the main thing putting me off at the moment- It would be nice to have proper positional audio for the PDA (environmental sounds are already vaguely positional), as currently it appears as though the messageas are coming from inside your head rather than from the PDA itself and this is initially disorientating. (As an example, in the game Call of the Starseed, holding the tape player up to your ear sounds as if the tape player is really next to your ear)- I can walk though walls  (again, Call of the Starseed solves this problem quite well)In summery, if youre buying this to play on the Vive, wait a while untill its a little more polished, as in its current state it is not likely to be an enjoyable experience, in my opinion. Ill be sure to check back later to see how this develops as the gme itself looks rather good!			"

												Review for vive:I recommend getting this for the summer sale, but I strongly recommend against playing it for a while. The solus project should be good for vive, but it's terrible at the moment. The button assignments would probably be better if they were assigned on random. And the intventory mangement is the worst I can imagine. You basically have to ""scroll"" through all your items every time you want to switch. 1sec each item. And guess what happens when you get a bit frustrated? You scoll past it. Any way to scroll back? Nope! Have fun finding your item the next two minutes. Lots of fun to be had when you die of hypothermia after failing to equip and light your torch within FIVE minutes.Also, navigating is terribly hard in vr, especially with the teleport switching directions on you if you look to the side. I've spent hours trying to find the right way.But in the end, I still spent 11 hours in the game, which says a lot of the potential.Shame on the devs for releasing this for vr now. And shame on the devs for not removing the vr support before it's ready. I could have been a fan.			"

												Bought this game in the hopes of using it with my Vive. Huge disappointment.It was practically unplayable. I have not had a problem with motion sickness with my vive yet, but this game has a ""walk"" function where it just moves you the direction you're looking. It's the most uncomfortable feeling. There is a teleport mechanic that is less jarring.All the mechanics in the game make the Vive feel like an afterthought. The inventory system is tedious (just the grip button that cycles through ALL your items). The tutorial is just text on a wall. Controls are not intuitive in anyway. I can't speak to the combat (if there is any) because I didn't get that far.The game may be great if just played on a PC, but it was terrible on the Vive. If you have a Vive and are looking for a game to give you a good experience, I would not recommend this.			"

												I don't know why people love it so much. At least in VR, the textures are buggy and the controls kind of annoying. Also, for the time I have played so far, it's not fun because I have no idea what to do other than sit and wait for morning each night, or die from cold if I go outside. There seems to be no objective system that I can see.Would have preferred to have a HUD and to be able to use both hands instead of the stats device and having to drop items to craft with them. Also, the item select HUD should be connected to the controller, not the way you're looking. Or at least an option to use a point-and-click.			"

Early Access Review
								Pure awesome!! I cant stress enough how good this is, especially, for an early access game. Too many times you see altered artwork of the worlds and videos that always llok 10x better than the actual game. So far, this game looks good, runs good, makes sense, et al. Everything that you expect out of a game - the basics - are already done correctly.Now, you crashed on a fairly hospitable planet. Lucky you. Plus you have one main tool and there are survival notes that got scattered all over the palce. So, the main tool you use is a PDA. And its a sweet little tool. It scans an object when you look at it, tells you how your health is, receives incoming satellite messages, recordings, is used as your save tool (sleeping will automatically save), and more. By more I mean after scanning the object you also have the option to pick the item up or craft it into something right there. Its totally fluid and you arent moving in and out of menus trying to do your next action. Centralizing the majority of the information into an easy to read smaller screen isnt an original idea. But this is done well. Its clear, concise, and smart. It sits on the bottom left of the screen. When you look down your hand automatically moves more of it into view. When you need to select other options, like sleeping, it can cover the full screen. What I like about this is that it feels and acts just like an important tool in the field should. Its not cumbersome but it also isnt hidden. Its that fine balance.World design is really nice so far. I didnt expect the caves to be so nicely done and well thought out. Also, after carefully climbing some rocks outside, I was absolutely sure that I would find something very valuable at the top. But I didnt. And I like that even more. It shows me that the devs arent predictable. So what if you scaled the mountain jumping from column to column. You know what you get? A can of food and a journal entry (ie the same stuff you find on the ground)Suggestion to Devs:I am gathering artifacts and other things that can be used for upgrades to my character (and I gueess my suit). However, Im not sure if Im not far enough along to be able to equip those things or if its done automatically. It says that you can upgrade your gear from the ""Stats"" page/option but even after selecting that page, and having acquired upgrades, it doesnt seem that I need to apply them or cant at this time. My only suggestion would be that since they do such a good job starting you off with everything else in the game I think there should be a message in the ""stats"" page the first time you open it. If you open it before you can upgrade yourself then a simple message of ""This is the page that will allow you to upgrade your system, your PDA will notify you when it is time"" and of course, if you dont open the page up before its necessary just having the PDA instruct you how to do it, like it does with everything else.Another cool thing: Ability to set your units of measure in the very beginning of the game. Im from 'Murica, so the metric system always makes me doing calculations on the fly. Two of my cars speedos read in kph so I am used to doing that while driving. But when it comes to liquid measures, forget about it. I can dmetric temps because of my computer rig. But I couldnt tell you what is a safe body temp in C. So I selected standard unit measures to be displayed in the game. Awesome little feature that they couldve easily overlooked or decided to keep out.Conclusion: Im super excited about this game. I saw the price and I didnt expect much at all. I expected bad character movement, glitchy, unpolished worlds, and I thought I would at least experience poor performance and crashes. Noe of that exists in Solus. It feels like a game that does not need to be in Early Access. You know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of ""The Forest"" but in outer space/landing on a foreign planet. Rather than a survival book you have a PDA. It looks similar too. Im so glad I purchased this. I consider the price to be a discount, even if you buy it at full price. And I cant wait to see where they go with this. I imagine that this type of story can always be added to. And Im hoping that the devs do that through DLC's later on.			"

												Frist off the tutorial and in-game help needs lots of work and the devs should consider spending more time on these. It feels like an old game converted to VR with none of the controls I have come to expect from the better VR games. I did not have the patience to try and work out the first in game challenge which is really simple but let down by the lack of intuitive controls. Maybye I will come back to this later when some work has been done on it. "

												I played this for a while, but was really disappointed by how lackluster the survival elements were. I first thought something was up with how much food and water you could easily find on the first island, but later I found out there were sources of unlimited food and water scattered about. There are locations that have a big bowl of unlimited food next to a trough of unlimited drinking water. Maybe it's different on the absolute highest difficulties, but the game just seems to throw an excess of supplies at you, and given that it's a linear experience you'd think resource management would be more important than a cursory exercise. And then I lost all enthusiasm for the exploration when I reached the cave system with identical passageways everywhere and a 'mysterious' black cloud of instant death that you have to run away from.I really regret purchasing and spending time with this game, as both the mysteries and the gameplay challenges turned out to both be shallow in many ways.

												*THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE VR VERSION OF THE GAME*The VR version of the game is poor in its current state, items will fly around you whenever they touch a wall, aiming is very finicky with the teleportation device, having to look around to move can really strain your neck after awhile (Yes there is another way to move but I found that one very boring to play with). The game also makes text very hard to read in some parts, even having them completely out of your view so by the time you notice them they fade before you can read them. The inventory will sometimes disappear completely from one, or both of your eyes if you aren't looking in the exact right spot.Currently I don't recommend anyone looking for the VR pick this up until it is updated, when some of those issues are fixed, it may be worth looking into.

												-VR Review-The concept is cool but it's so obvious this game wasn't made with VR in mind, having played countless hours of VR games it's a real feat to make me motion sick at this point. The interaction and immersion just isn't there for me, picking stuff up and handling the inventory feels clunky and unintuitive. I know the VR implementation is ""WIP"" so hopefully they can improve upon it, but I don't see them fixing everything without reworking the entire game. It's just designed in such a way that it doesn't translate well to VR. Had to refund.			"

												Disclaimer: This review is only based on the first 2-3 hours of gameplay.The Solus Project markets itself as an immersive survival/exploration game. Unfortunately it's hard to be immersed when you're bored waiting for a game to get good.The survival gameplay initially seems promising, tracking your health, water, calories, body temperature and fatigue, as well as the environmental temperature, humidity and windspeed, on a PDA that slides into view when you look down (I imagine this is a nice effect in VR - I played on a standard PC). You have an inventory to manage, prioritising food, refillable water containers and medkits. You construct a rudimentary torch from debris, stock up on supplies, and are ready to explore the nearby cave system. Unfortunately I quickly realise there's always plenty of food and water available (even underground) so managing hunger and thirst quickly becomes a chore. In the week or so of in-game time that has passed by torch (a bit of oil and kindling on a metal rod) has never gone out. The only stat I found myself paying attention to was the temperature. This boils down to using the torch if it's cold and using another light source (flashlight, crystal, glowstick) if it's hot. This game appears to be a walking simulator with survival aspects tacked on. Unfortunately, survival is not tense or difficult, just tedious and boring.Ok, so it's not really a survival game. That's ok, there should still be plenty of fun to be had from freely exploring, without having to worry about dying of thirst, right? Well, the level design itself is fairly linear. Sometimes there are a few different branches you can take from A to B. The main incentive to explore is to discover secrets. These are basically objects that give you a minor stat increase. Only, surviving is basically just a distraction and a chore and the secrets don't contribute anything to the plot, so searching for them is just another chore in itself. Additionally, the areas are often fairly open with lots of nooks and crannies. It just isn't my idea of fun to wander around the edge of a map looking for the opening, or spending hours jumping on rocks to see if I can climb up (you usually can't).""Oh well, maybe I'm trying to make too much of this game. Let's just get immersed in the story and the visuals and get lost in this world."" I gave up on this when I realised how much of the plot relied on 'scattered notes'. When you find a piece of paper on the ground that starts with 'Yuri's Diary - 1/24' you realise you'll spend the next 10 minutes following these breadcrumbs and just hoping you don't miss any or read them out of order. The text doesn't appear all at once, it appears as if someone is typing. Accidentally move your mouse off the note and you have to start again. It is infuriating.One time, I left an indoor campsite, crouched through a crawlspace, walked through a cave, and came outside only to discover it was like 50 degrees and I was going to get hyperthermia if I stayed outside. I had to backtrack all the way to the campsite just so I could rest until evening. Not only is survival tedious, it's actually actively hindering your progress. This would be fine if it created a challenge, but it just creates more tedium.On the upside, the visuals are quite nice (if a little samey) and I feel like if I had stuck with it the plot might have picked up steam. The major problem is this game doesn't know what it wants to be. The survival gameplay, the exploration and level design, and the plot delivery are entirely at odds with each other. They contantly try and pull you in different directions making for a very tiresome experience.			"

												THIS IS A VR REVIEW:  Amazing game, not quite ready for VR though...I had to refund the game as much as I didn't want to. I played the game on Xbox One and I loved play it from beginning to end.  I recently got my HTC Vive and when I saw SP had Vive support I bought it with much anticipation.  The graphics are breathtaking and beautiful in virtual space, but... the game is just not ready for VR.  I DO UNDERSTAND IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, but if you jump into the game expecting a fluid experience then you might be disappointed.  Even with a GTX 1070, 32GB of RAM, and an I7, I was experiencing frequent jittering, my person shifting slightly, and other errors that made the game unplayable in VR for me.  This caused me to get headaches from the jittering and motion sickness from the shifting.  I've played about 30 VR thus far and haven't had this problem until now.  So in it's present VR state, I can't recommend, I suggest waiting until it's fully optimized before jumping in.  Outside of VR the game is still an amazing survival game full of exploration and mystery and I recommend playing it.			"

												If you're a millenial this is probably awesome. If you love VR this is probably awesome. If you're like me, old and tired, it sucks. Great marketing once again. NMS got shot down for being different and innovative and yet, ten minutes into this game and I'm dungeon crawling. All those gorgeous vistas and orbiting planets (very present in NMS) are replaced by cavern walls and Tomb Raider doors (without the fear of a horrible spikey death which might have added something)Not my cup of Darjeeeling I'm afraid. Very over-rated. Gotta have my 2 cents heard here, not that my opinion matters, but seriously, it aint that good. No wonder developers don't release demos anymore. Sorry, Devs, wanna support ya, but I just can't on this one. (Note to self: Paly, stop reviewing games you don't care about after a hard day and two beers)			"

												Played this on a Vive for a few hours and I don't think I'll play it anymore because it's just feeling so tedious. Got into the caves and it feels like I was spelunking through a low-poly mess of jagged tunnels with an occasional low-res model feature.  I had the graphics settings cranked too. The survival aspects only add to the tedium. Got to remember to pick survival items up, eat, drink, sleep, stay warm. Super boring after a few cycles of this.Maybe outside of VR this is ok, but it just hurts to look at in the headset. The immersion feels really low.Had to backtrack through said featureless caves to get fire again because it turns out I would die of hyperthermia without it and I wandered around in the dark for a while getting totally over this experience very quickly.The interface in VR is very unintuitive, I kept having to visit the controls screen periodically. Jumping and moving in VR is just the worst as well, why even keep this feature? Remove them and remove the amount of controls you have to remember. Inventory was exceedingly clunky and hard to use. Most of the time I felt like I was missing some trick as to how to use this intuitively, but I don't think it's there.Some suggestions for subsequent games:* Bumbling around dark featureless caves is very unrewarding, add more detail to caves, or make them shorter* Overhal the VR interface, check out Vanishing Realms or The Gallery for how to do it rightI've watched some videos as how this game plays out and there's some really good stuff several hours in, but I can't bring myself to slog it out to get there. Also checked out the ending because I decided I'm not going back to this game and I would have been majorly disappointed with that if I'd stuck it out.			"

												Don't buy this and expect a proper virtual reality experience. I can't and won't comment on its content as I took only a quick look at it before issuing my first steam refund..As others said, you'll navigate menus by ""looking"" at buttons and by using the controller's trigger to pushIf you like to use the locomotion ""walking"" style, you'll walk in the direction where you're currently lookingYou can't walk backwards or sidewards, except you'll turn your head to the left or right (locomotion walking style)To crouch you'll need to press a button on one of the controllersDid I already said you'll navigate menus by looking at them? This continues to ingame menus like your inventory..The developers obviously replaced the mouse input with the HMD. And, on top of that, the official HTC Vive instructions are out of date and are missing an update since about four months.In its current state, this game doesn't deserve the label ""VR ready"".Edit: Well, the developer corrected me (see comments) and stated that these are technical issues. However, the walking style I described (now cut through) is still a somehow strange default. And whilst the menu navigation is due to the used unreal engine it still hinders me from enjoying this game in VR, in its current state. Let's have a look once there is an VR related update incoming.			"

												Of the 7 games that I brought when I got my HTC Vive, this is the only one that supported both the HTC Vive controllers and a standing play area (as opposed to room scale, which I just don't have space for) - so that is a massive plus for this game. The down side - I just don't enjoy the game. The graphics are very very poor on the Vive - as if you are rendering at 200 x 300, everything has an ugly white edge around it. And there is only so much time I can spend wandering around at night trying to complete mundane objects like cutting some burnable stuff with no knife before I get bored. Also, spend some more time working out how to better use the Vive controllers - because what you have is convoluted and difficult to use.			"

												I played for ~3 hours and made some meaningful progress in the game, but I honestly just didn't like it.I didn't have any fun exploring the world.  The survival component was simplistic and tedious, and it detracted from exploration rather than contributing anything desirable to the gameplay.  I also didn't find the world to be immersive or suspenseful or even particularly aesthetic.  It felt transparently artificial.  I was not amused by any of the puzzles either.---Who Might Enjoy This Game?---If, in the year 2016, Myst still excites you as much as it excited people in the early 90's, then you might enjoy this game.  But even *if* you're part of that niche, I actually think you may prefer The Witness, which I thought was a much better game than this.  I can't strongly recommend The Witness either, but insofar as open-world puzzle games go, I think it succeeded in all the ways that I wish this game had.			"

												The game is fun, looks amazing, and had an interesting story.For the money it is really hard not to recommend. Take that statement with a grain of salt.The story was strong at first but the more you play you end up figuring out exactly where the story is going to lead and then you end up feeling like you are going to end up spending another 3 to 5 hours finding out something you already know. I have not beaten the game myself, but ran into some issues that made me stop because I didn't want to progress any further. My drive was completely gone and so I ended up looking up what the end was and it is exactly what you expect it to be half way through which is boring. Anyway my issues with the game is that it can get repetitive by the time you get the 3rd island and how much bigger the level design gets. At the rate you, as the player, go each area you come to is bigger than the last. The caves and the islands get needlessly bigger and it takes way to much time to get from point A to point B which drains you. My other issue is meteor showers.			"

												I didn't like this one...I feel sorry because the exploration of an alien planet seemed very promising. I am not very fond of survival games, but I really love exploring and using objects and inventory. Survival is not really hard in this game I think, but the exploration part really lacks in terms of entertainment. In 5 hours what I saw was pretty much always the same, and the story was developing in a very ""meh"" direction....not very immersive and scenery is pretty much always the same. The beginning was great but then I just felt I was getting very unattached to the game, instead of the opposite.			"

												After you adjust your movement setting to all ticked on for the Vive plus change wine to strafing this game becomes a hole different ball game. The controls aren't quite up to onward but they are close enough(besides if you touch the side of the touch control still turns you).I sort of hated this game at the start, as you could cheat with the teleportation system and it was broken. With the above settings and update this game is now a must. Hopefully they do one more update to bring it to onward movement.			"

												If you like games that are snooze fests, this game is for you. If you want a game with 'cool landscapes' to see what VR is like, be prepared for disorientation. This game is full of shiny surfaces, an annoying restricted field of view, objects at all depths and a weird player perspective. the 'crafting' system is litterally just cary 10 things and click on other things every now and then.

												The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Very crudely, in this case.The Solus Project is a lazy effort that fails at being even a decent game, not to mention a good story-driven survival game.Survival: Food and water are plentiful, the torch you build within ten minutes of starting the game is permanent as it never runs out of fuel and gves you heat and light for the entire game. The torch can be extinguished if you dive into water while holding it but if it's in yout inventory, it's completely safe. Being frozen is a real danger unless you wisely choose to nap for 10 hours so it's +30 degrees outside, rendering the soaked/frozen part moot.Puzzles: They are not. The extent of puzzles is ""Press a button"", ""Put a rock onto a button"" and ""Throw the teleporter disk into a narrow opening"".General design: It's an Unreal fanfic, and a mediocre at that. Everything reminds of Na-Pali, including the two races, crucifixes made for a four-armed victim (although race C7 has two arms) and the ""stone tablets translated by your PDA"" plot delivery. It's also clearly visible that the map designer simply loves cloning hexagonal pillars with the same size and texture.Plot: It's seriously bad. Firstly, the entirety of the game is ""gather parts for a radio tower to phone home"" with no deeper reasoning and, more importantly, all the writings on the stone tablets that you decipher have no influence on the protagonist's actions even if they... REALLY should. And there's no intrigue whatsoever. The voice acting from the radio operator is quite good, though.Exploration: You don't need to. The only really useful items are the backpacks that allow you to hoard more stuff, but you don't need most of the ""very rare"" items. On the other hand, in a few places the game devolves into Item Quest. Because the only way to break weak stone walls is a mighty hammer, useful only for breaking weak stone walls and taking up inventory space otherwise.So: Bad design, an excuse plot, poor puzzles, a poor survival mechanic and, ultimately, confusing and needless lore. Good intentions, bad paving.			"

												This game is great graphically, and it is kinda creepy. However, navigating the map (in the inevitable underground areas just sucks) since there is no real mini map and your waypoints are no help (As the point may want you to go down or up but you can't always tell). Although immersion wise it is pretty cool...from a ""fun perspective"" i just can't recommend. I like games to be interesting and challenging...but i don't like it when i need to google how to get past specific parts of the game because it is just not intuitive or even remotely easy to identify the next steps. Early on i found a place where i obviously need a key..but have no idea where it is. Travelling around would be fun...if there weren't random things trying to kill you, nighttime temp that kills you, random lighting storms that kill you, aliens that kill you, sun rising (super hot temp) that kills you...getting the theme here? it is a survival/exploration game that forces you to put aside the exploration and really just hide at regular intervals bc of all the stuff trying to kill you. YA it is a survival game i get it..but that's not its only tag...it was also tagged as an exploration game with mechanisms in place to lower the survival elements, but you can't lower them enough. It is frustrating to have to revisit teh same spots over and over again to do simple tasks because of the near constant environmental effects trying to kill you. it just gets old after going back to the same place for the 10th time and only having precious moments to search around (and try to remember where you already searched) before you run and hide in a cave for 10 minutes waiting for the storm (or whatever is trying to kill you) to go away, then you rinse and repeat again and agin.  In the future on a new planet, might this be accurate depiction of what you would face trying to survive? possibly..hell i don't know. But for now...as a game...is what i described above actually fun in a game? No..it's not. i wish there was a way to turn off all the random enviornmental effects so i could actually focus on exploration...(you can do this somewhat with the hunger/thirst meter but not the enivronmental stuff. so it just got old...search around..find something cool..run away and hide from alien/environmental event..then try to get back to that spot (rinse and repeat) till you find what you need to get to next area. or get stuck and spend time on internet trying to figure out how to do what game wants you to do next. good atmosphere, nice graphics..but just not that fun as is. If you like survival game elements above all else..then ya this is your bag. If you were hoping for more exploration and less annoying survival elements artificially prolonging the game bc you have to revisit the same places repeatedly to accomplish anything..well then you are like me and its not your thing...in that case, stay far away.

												Well to beging this review I would like to mention I purchased this game at a discounted price. Even that wasnt enough to justify the purchase of this game. Here I go....This game is literally a walking simualtor. maybe two or three creepy encounters in the game. The story is so bland, stake, and boring that I almost wanted to break my laptop. The only story you get from the game is through transmissions. If you like running around a huge island looking at pieces of paper reading about people on the ship that crashed and PMS about being lonely, this is a game for you. You always start at point A and you need to reach point B. Once reached you must walk all the way back to point A. If you are a fat lazy person that cant walk for himself, definetly purchase this game. You are always walking and solving dumb child level puzzles. Nice Graphics though. 10/10 IGN. lol			"

												I'm reviewing the HTC Vive support, so that's experimatnal, keep that in mind.I read the mixed reviews, decided to plunge in and see what it's like.Not good. Not good at all. If you want to like this game, you can probably adapt to do so. But it requires some effort and a leap of faith. Unfortunately though, at this point, it's not a very good VR game.But, please keep in mind that VR support is experimental. No one is promising you great VR support, so they really tell you that up front, and it really is not ready for prime time.I guess my advice is tread carefully and keep your expectations low.			"

												This game doesn't explain how to do anything really. It just expects you to know what to do to progress through it. In some cases those types of games can be great games but this one just gives you nothing to start out with and expects a lot from you. I tried to sawim to a windmill like objest on another island but I met the edge of the map in the middle of that body of water. I went back and tried to explore the cave, it said to find a way in. So I go above it jumping my way up the inclined terrain. I see that theres nothing on top so I make my way down and slide down a 45 degree smooth hill. That's right a ♥♥♥♥ing hill, No sharp rocks here but guess what I die. Subnautica is game of the year compared to this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Early Access Review
								I love a good survival game, too bad this isn't one.The map limits you to a few narrow corridors. What passes for the survival element is your fading food, water, and sleep meters. Replenishing these feels more like a chore than an adventure. There are no real options available: just hunt around for cans of food, refill your water bottles time and again, and try to figure out how the designer intended you to worm your way into the next area. Rinse and repeat.The opening and cut scenes are tedious, but the game play graphics are great.I wouldn't recommend this game. Well, unless you think it's fun to look for keys to unlock the next area while gathering conveniently placed food/water to reset your food and water timers.If your idea of survival involves wide ranging choices, random discoveries, random dangers, and the freedom to venture into the forest or scrounge along the beach, forget it.

								The premise and the presentation of this game's trailer are very good. The execution, however is VERY sloppy and in some aspects downright unprofessional. The music is decent, but the amateurish voice acting and UI design make it very difficult to get into the game, as it is constantly reminding you of how rough and unfinished it is (it also literaly reminds you constantly with an ever-visible white text caption at the top of the screen).I was very tempted to ask for a refund, but since the game is very cheap I'm going to hold on to it and see if it improves over time.For the moment, however, be advised that in my opinion the game needs to mature and right now all it does is ruin itself and everything it promises. It was impossible for me to forget I was playing a glorified tutorial.			"

			Views: 15,103		

			These are my first impressions of The Solus Project for PC. This is not intended to be a full review. Please keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to pick up the game.		

Summary: A beautiful and sadly quite shallow narrative driven game. If you go into this expecting a traditional survival game you will be disappointed. Instead what you get is an exploration game with some survival elements. Crafting is virtually non existent and the puzzle solving is far from taxing. At it's core it's a linear story driven experience that didn't pull me in.			"

												I really tried to like this game. The trailer looks amazing, and so does the overall design. But that's about it, otherwise the game is just plain boring.  It's basically a science fiction walking simulator, endless levels and neverending caves, and you have to search every square inch of it like a lunatic to find the rare items that give you upgrades...It could be considered relaxing for people who are just to lazy to go out for a real walk, but then you have to constantly satisfy your needs for water/food/sleep which makes the game terribly annoying. you leave an area and get a message, e.g. ""1 of 10 secrets discovered"". so you turn around and spend another two hours searching everything upside down while running out of food and water until you give up and just move on.

												You never know until you try, but this one is a must pass for HTC Vive owners. The game intrigued me, but only minutes into playing it I could tell it must have been hastily adapted to VR. The ""walking"" in the game is instantly disorienting, and very soon after, nauseating. The walking mechanic they implemented using the trackpad to move around has the sensation of the world suddenly moving around you - basically virtual vertigo at the press of a button. I couldn't recommend this game to anyone wanting a VR experience. It's definitely overpriced compared to other more polished VR-centric experiences on top of the vertigo problems.			"

												Don't buy if you're planning on using this for VR. Everyone who enjoyed this as a VR experience must be utterly delusional. The controls are HILARIOUSLY bad and counter intuitive. Everything is ugly and badly optimized for VR. There are many far better games designed for VR from the ground up.			"

												This game doesn't seem to work right in VR.  It has a slow, boring start.  The controls just don't feel right.  I find that I don't care about the story at all.  I think more game developers should try to port a game into VR, but it should be a game that works well with the format.It might get better further into the game, but I really don't feel like putting work into it.

												Looks great,But the game is so vague, the controls are non-intutitive, and what you are supposed to do and how to craft is just painful.There are a ton of items everywhere, you only have 12 slots to apparently figure out how to do the terrible crafting system.You are confronted with a blocked cave, with absolutely no hints on what to do, or where to go to even get you started to under how to play this game.Would not recommend this to anyone...

Early Access Review
								Played for just under 2 hours so far. It's very pretty and fun to explore at first, but the scenery quickly gets somewhat repetitive (especially in the caves) and the survival/roleplaying elements feel very tacked on and pointless. I think I'd PREFER it to be a walking simulator, rather than a walking simulator that sometimes makes you press b to sleep or build a fire. Also the teleportation device is stupid and frustrating: there are constant barred doors you could BLATANTLY stick the disc through if the game would just let you.			"

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR VR!!I noticed this game under the Game Preview category for Xbox One, so I though why not try it? I absolutley loved what was given to me, it felt very immersive and made you want to keep playing and uncover the secrets within this desolate planet. Then I noticed that it released on Steam with VR support. I was very exited and bought it immediatleyfor my Vive, but to my unfourtunate surprise it was honeslty♥♥♥♥♥♥ The controlls are so wonky, for example you can't even walk to where you are looking, you need to change your view with the controller then you can walk in the direction you want. Not to mention the graphics got a bit of a downgrade. They just overall totaly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the VR portion for this game which really sucks. I'm very dissapointed because I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. So, in conclusion, DON'T get this for VR but its pretty solid for playing normally.			"

I'd say hold off for now if you were hoping to play this on your Vive.EDIT 8/24/16:Game is still broken on the Vive. It's not even possible to get out of the intro area that you start the game in because multiple features do not work correctly in VR. If you want to play this on your Vive, wait another year and see if they've made significant improvements. I feel that I wasted my money.			"

												In a survival game where the hardest difficulty provides no challenge and the game feels like a walking simulator, the player questions if the developers threw the survival element in just to increase sales while having no idea how to properly create a survival game. I appreciate their choice of game engine, but I don't think they utilized the tools that they were given by Unreal Engine to make their game look pretty enough to warrant a purchase.			"

												Had high hopes going into the game after all the reviews. I only have 40 min and that's because I could not take another moment of this. Graphics made my eyes tired and dry. Gameplay was boring and really lacked anything interesting. ""Story"" is avarage at most, it does very litle to get you intriged or interested. The game feels like a railroad ride with tiny mechanics atached to make it feel less like a game where all you do is walk. Trully hoped it would be much better than this. Might give it another go after a few more updates and maybe even change my review, but as it stands this is simply something I don't have any desire to play.Pros: -Story-PuzzlesCons: -Story is nothing interesting or new. Could not keep me interested.-""Crafting"" Not the best, really plain and blend. -""Puzzles"" are nothing that will get you thinking. Feels like it's just there so you don't just walk around the entire time.-Controlls, The game doesn't have the best feeling to it.			"

												Perhaps good enough on the rift, but not ready for HTC Vive.I am always cautious when buying something that says vive and oculus rift capable.If it's made to use with xbox controller, then it's use on vive controllers may not be polished.This game definitely has alot of potential, but I can't play it because movement using the xbox controller is actually better than using the vive controller, makes me nauseous. Having a proper teleporting system or even better a moving platform to get around the game world would  help. The controls and movement are broken in this game in my opinion. This is basically a seated experience with xbox controller, doesn't truly support vive motion controls. The game also gets kinda boring after a while just searching for stuff with long walks that makes you nauseous.			"

Early Access Review
								The Solus Project comes as a fairly placid game in 2D despite the promise of mysterious adventure and hybrid gameplay. However, in VR it takes on a whole new level of detail and immerses the player into an impressive sci-fi adventure that’s very much a must have game for those who are looking for a more laid back adventure experience. Action fans need not apply here as this game isn’t for you, but if you have an open mind to explore and survive then this comes highly recommended, and with its low price point you’ll certainly get your monies worth.

												:VIVE Owner:I wish I could return this. It's just not fun. You walk around picking stuff up, that's the game. After hours of gameplay I got to a point where you have to assemble a communication tower. The catch is you have to walk around collecting 17 individual peices of this thing scattered around an island. Who thinks this is fun? Who's birght idea when they were making this was to have the player spend an hour walking around picking of SEVENTEEN peices of junk.  Besides that you spend the first few hours just walking though dark caves and there's so much contrast you have constant issues with lens halo's and blurriness. Edit: they let me return it :). To clarify, I just did'nt find it very intersting. The environment is not compelling enough to keep me entertained while picking up stuff here and there. For an ""exploration adventure game"" I need something more then a different colored sky, red trees, and the occasional odd plant to keep me entertained. I go hiking frequently in RL and spending my free time walking around a bland and sterile simulated environment picking up junk to maybe use later is not what I got a VIVE for.			"

												I played the normal PC version.  This game is basically a frustration simulator with some terrible design decisions that prevent it from being an enjoyable experience.  The premise of being an astronaut stuck on an alien world having to explore and use your ingenuity to survive is an enticing one and here the developers have created a beautiful looking and sounding world to wander.  However, I have played for three hours now and have become increasingly frustrated by the janky movement and jumping mechanics, the regular occurences of being stuck in the environment with no way out (except to reload your previous safe) and dying because your character's spacesuit is not hardy enough to tolerate a 6 inch drop.  The worst moment was probably exploring up to the top of a mountain and dropping down into a secret cave below full of giant shells.  I found some new items there and an interesting headstone but when I went to leave I found there was no way out of the cave.  45 minutes later and I had to reload the game and lose those items and the time I spent.  That kind of thing is just not fun and I simply don't have time to play a game that punishes you purely for doing so.			"

												You combine rocks to make a sharp rock that still looks the same.  Neat.  Are you holding the sharp rock or is it the one on the ground still?  Who Knows!You can only walk forward with a vive controller using a d-pad.  Because the other 3 directions on the d-pad were too difficult to figure out how to program.Some use interactions are indicated by an orange glow, others aren't.  Can you eat the food in your hand?  Probably Not.To sleep, you press the right controller d-pad to switch the left hand PDA screens, then change the hours indicated with the laft controller d-pad, then go to sleep by pointing the right controller at the pda and pulling the trigger.

The keybindings break if you try to change them and cannot be restored (you ahve to REINSTALL the entire game)  movement in the game is hilariously bad, Many of the games features are poorly explained if explained at all, and the oculus rift that they claim is supported does not work (supposedly there's some overly complex workaround to get it to work, but it has not ever worked for me, and I've done some janky stuff to get my DK2 to work with stuff before)I guess they spent all their time on the story but I'll never know because the interface is so awful that I doubt I'll force myself to trudge through long enough to find out.I would get a refund ASAP.

												This game is in desperate need of some in-game objectives! I crash landed and had no idea what to do. I spent 30 minutes walking around with nothing to do. I guess you can say survival is the objective, but I can survive by conserving my energy and just staying put at the crash site. Now how is that fun!?! In terms of exploring, there were tons of things there, but all of it pretty useless to getting me off the planet. When I stopped the game it told me I had not built or found a communication tower. Well thanks for telling me when I'm quitting. I wish you would have told me earlier. Not that I know how to build a communication tower or where to find it, but at least I would have something to try to obtain. How am I supposed to know that is what I should be doing?			"

												In it's current state, for Vive gamers I can only recommend against this. The movement scheme is terrible and nausea inducing. The controls don't make any logical sense. I wish the developers well but saying this supports VR... nope. Please implement controls similar to The Lab, which I consider the current gold-standard for Vive.			"

												This is a genre that I really enjoy. And up until 18.8hrs of game play, I really enjoyed this game. In my book, that makes it worth $20 if that was the end of the story. However, just before what seemed to be the end of the plot, a glitch took me back 3hrs of game play and my inventory lacks the item to continue since it was already removed.			"

												Restarting my review because I made a rookie mistake: I played Hardcore Mode right from the start. That's because I was expecting a hardcore, sci-fi survival experience mixed with discoveries that felt rewarding, and intuitive enough of UI, UX, story and gameplay to get me through the game, even on hardcore mode. (""Hardcore"" after all, refers to ease of survival, not intuitive player gating, progression, quest & waypoint systems, and puzzle hints)What I got instead was a handful of deaths, and I never once figured out how to get out of the ""starting area"" (again, in Hardcore Mode)—so this is my fault, and I should dial back a bit on my criticism of the game. I'm sure if I played an easier mode I would have had more guidance.But what *still* troubles me is finding out that *spoiler alert* --------------------> the starting area isn't what the whole game is like. That's, I guess, why I was jumping around on basalt columns. I thought it was an open-world experience that was meant to continue on the other, nearby islands as I continued to discover beautiful shrines and etc. Instead, apparently, the cave is pretty much where you *have to* go to get anywhere, and apparently the cave leads to nothing but more cave-ness.Imagine playing Skyrim, but by the time you get to the first ""dungeon"" of the game, you never go back out into the outer world to continue exploring. That's how the Solus Project feels (as of yet), and that's why I asked for my money back. I paid half the price of Skyrim for what I thought would be an indie, sci-fi, survival/suspense version of ""half the game"", so to speak, but that is definitely not what I got.I think I was jumping around on basalt columns because I was hoping that WOULD cause me to get somewhere and make progress in the outside, survival-world. Maybe the developer should implement that, because according to most reviews, once you enter the ""main cave tunnel"", the whole survival element goes out the window.Why not expand on the outside world, and put some fallen ships with treasure in them at the top of a path of basalt columns? That would be a much more rewarding dynamic than what people are finding in the game as it is.I still want my money back for this game, but I don't hate it. A lot about it was very good, but it was *not* a final release for VR or for PC, and it should therefore not (yet) be sold at the price it is sold at, unless it's declared an early-access price. I found plenty of bugs and so have many others.This game needs more time in the oven for VR development and more focus testing for the PC version. I will keep an eye on it and re-purchase down the line if it is A) sold for the price of an ""unfinished experience"" or B) brought up to the standards of a true $20 ""final game"" in the survival game category.

Too many keys to remember, and i made very little progress in this game. inventory managment is annoying cause you can only carry so much, and yet you have to have water, food, a torch, etc just to stay alive. so not much room for extras.so i'll start a new game, since i died already from over exposure to the cold, but i don't have high hopes.i probably haven't given it a fair chance yet, but so far i'd give it 2 stars out of 5.

												I don't want to be overly critical, but I was unable to continue forth with this game. On my vive, the navigation quickly turned my stomach. I've logged plenty of hours with my vive across 50 different games and experiences, but this was the first to make me feel uncomfortable.The visuals were also not on par with what I would hope for $20. The abundance of small text seems like such a poor choice  for a VR game, and staring closely at my hand to read quickly removed me enjoying the world around me. I may have been willing to push through the queasiness if the game had been more instantly engaging, but unfortunately I will be requesting my first Steam refund ever. I'm sure many people will enjoy this but I personally would spend that $20 elsewhere.			"

This is not a game where you can just start playing blind.  It is not terribly intuitive at first.  The rest of my concerns are mostly on par with the other Vive users that do not reccomend this game.  I will wait a while for some polish.EDIT - words, now that i am not suffering from VR sickness			"

												Sorry but i don't see this thing being a ""real"" survival game. I played it, for an hour, and nothing attacked me and i couldn't ""hit"" anything. Basically, i don't see a survival game as having no enemies to deal with. It could be that, later, they show up but this game seems more like a ""puzzle"" type game with explorative elements. The crafting isn't really what you can call classic crafting, it's too easy, to controlled, and too drip-fed for it to be any real kind of challenge. I know there is somebody who is going to want to argue. In fact, there was one who actually did and these people just can't understand that it's my take on the game. It's not there for debate/attack/defend...it's just how i saw the game. A review is a personal take on a game...not a factual ""set in stone"" writ that will be a guidelineforever.....Geez, let it go.Like i always say: If YOU like it...PLAY IT. Don't ever let something someone else says convince / dissuade you on playing any game. A review is simply one person's take (their view) on the game and by NO means makes them any kind of ""authority"". And this is WHY i've wondered (from day ONE) why there is a ""comment"" option on a review. No one person's take is written in stone and comments only serve ONE purpose, to allow a person to be ""attacked"" when others don't agree...because a review isn't a test, it's someone's own take on something.

												Imagine you're playing an amazing game, which is very immersive and impressive graphically. Just imagine that. Then open your eyes and realise you are actually playing this game.That is this game.			"

												UPDATEAfter the July update controls are MUCH BETTER. Menu works much better (hey, I can turn on anti-aliasing now!). PDA is finally usable. Congrats!Now I can start playing... Oh no, dehydrated and died... :P- - - - - - - -PREVIOUS VERSIONNo, this game isn't ready for Vive (yet). Can't get through the main menu w/o a pad, can't navigate easily and the use of controllers isn't intuitive. I'll give it a chance a month from now. Today, it's negative. Anti-aliasing is non-exisitng.ps. Non-VR gameplay still OK.			"

												**Update** YES!  Fantastic, so much better - this is the only long-form game you'll find for the Vive so far, and it plays so well with the new improvements!**Updated** Still Not quite ready for Vive just yet.This game definitely has potential - the intro is really cool, and the environments (what I've seen so far) look pretty good.However, this game isn't quite Vive ready yet - here's what's broken or is needed to get this ready for a Vive release:Different movement scheme - a simple point in the direction I want to go and click and hold the touchpad to walk in that direction would suffice.  As it is now there are several movement options, all of which rely on treating the touchpad like a joystick, and none of which work well.  Don't do this - it's confusing (especially when trying to suss out how head-decoupled steering should work - the point and click method above gives you that 'for free')Inventory - there is no UI (in the vive, not sure about on a monitor).  Cycling through the inventory is no good.  Check out Call of the Starseed's backpack system - it's pretty straightforward, and doesn't require any additional buttons.Having the tricorder thing in one hand with all the info is cool - but why is that the only thing I can have in that hand?  I should be able to pick up anything with either hand and use it (so the control button maps should be symmetrical).Don't need a crouch button.  I understand that physically crouching will be difficult to resolve (adjusting the colliders in UE4 dynamically... I know), but don't do it with a button.So, for now, if you want to play on a monitor or seated VR with a controller, it seems fine, but with the vive controllers, it's not quite there yet.Other than that, from what I've seen so far, fantastic job!  I'm looking forward to updates!**Update 1**:This last update did some to improve the experience, but it still isn't quit there yet.Movement: - Teleporting is good, however it breaks a few places in the game (I can teleport through barriers that I clearly shouldn't be able to).  Personally, I don't mind 'artificial locomotion', and in this case I would prefer it if when you pressed forward on the left touchpad, the pawn moved in the direction that the teleport marker is facing (since this faces in the direction the controller is facing).  This would allow the movement not to be locked to the head rotation or the 'forward' vector of the play space (the latter is super unintuitive).  This might not suit people who are more prone to sim sickness however, so the teleporting is good - but I think it's resulted in a few content bugs.Tutorial - It's helpful, and informative, however, reading lots of text in vr is unpleasant.  A show-then-do approach might be better - similar to the beginning of the game instructing you how to build a torch.Control Layout - I still feel like a more symmetric approach to the control layout for the vive is better - I keep having to refer back to the control layout diagram to remember how to do things.  This might mean removing button-based interactions in favor or more 'physical' interactions, which generally 'feels better' in VR than complex button mappings.Glad to see the progress though - I'll definitely keep watching for updates!

												7/17/2016 - Finally revisited this after the feedback below and this game hitting release. I am changing my marking to positive for the following reasons:- Excellent Experience on Oculus Rift (Very atmospheric), with one exception*.- Cave ""go back to beginning"" problem no longer seems to be there- Excellent graphics- Preliminarily (need to play through game) - the story seems interesting.I look forward to playing more shortly!.*Devs: There needs to be a way to retract the tracker/info device even further away from your face.  Even 'lowered' it still feels high on the rift, blocking a large portion of the ground.2/21/2016 - Have to go the negative route.  This game is beautiful - the sound is great - and attention to details are generally good.  But... this is a completionists game -- find 1/115 items, sniff out 1/60 secrets, etc etc..  The cave in the first mission requires you to go back to the very beginning if you don't pack one item.  Too.. much.. work for a ""fun game"".			"

												buy this game if you like cool weather graphics,long storyline,dungeon exploration it also does have quiet a memrable experience id recommend it , its like no other game a few cons is one of the textures they use for a dungeon wall kinda sucks and the ending imo also sucks but the weather effects are 10/10 and storyline,exploring makes it 100% worth it im thinking of replaying it soon but it just takes so long to play through			"

												This revision 4 of the game after another play session in the recent past. I have to grudgingly admit that I have about gotten my money's worth from this game and then some. The atmosphere is great and the glitches got less and less. The devs really did work. At some point I might even finish the game.So here I am, changing my review to positive. It deserves it. Not an AAA title, but then it doesn't pretend to be. For what it costs, you do get a nice experience - probably even better if you have VR.			"

												As of 3/3/17:I just started playing tonight and WOW! It's amazing in VR. I'm using the Vive and just WOW! It's going as one of my favorite games on it. It's not even my type of game (I prefer fantasy/action) but in VR it just looks so amazing that at night I just wanted to sit down and relax enjoying being in an alien world. Bravo, just bravo! The trackpad locomotion works really well too! I honostly didn't want to get off but it's late here.			"

												Really good game, definitely worth checking out. The story gets more intense and interesting as you keep playing, the views in this game can be really impressive, and the game has its own unique climate. The negative side of the game is that some of the puzzles or riddles can be repetitive.			"
