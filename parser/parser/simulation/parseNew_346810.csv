												This is fine for what it is.  A fun little strategy game with some nice history and mechnics built in.  Nothing amazing, and not a lot of replay value after a few campaigns.  If you enjoy the period or just want something light to spend a few enjoyable hours with this is interesting.I would be aware that it only plays in a 1200X800 window or so, which is annoying, and the graphics generally are pretty minimal.  BUt it works and seems to lack bugs, which you cannot say for tons of games.Of the 200 games I have bought on Steam I think this is likely in the top half, and definitely in the top half in terms of fun/dollar.

												The simple truth is that this game is effectively a ""one trick pony"".  It's billed as being turn-based combat/strategy... which I guess it is, since you advance by clicking ""next"".  Overall, though, if you want to have a genuinely successful campaign, there's a proscribed set of steps for you to take.  Build X by turn ____, have Y by turn ____.  Sure, you're ""free"" to have things go horribly wrong... but most people don't play to fail their way to the end of the game.  In other words, it's less about strategy and more about just learning whatever build order the game expects from you.  It's not bad for a time-killer... but (as might be expected, given the developers / price range), it's not at all a worthwhile purchase.			"

												Not bad. Casual, and a little cartoony but I sort of like the personality. It's simple with just enough depth to keep you interested and playing to find what will happen the next turn. It's a fun little slider manager type, with minimal twitch action and cause-effect results. The grammar is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious though, ""You are leaving city and losing everything. Without your wise rule, the city will soon be absorbed by more luckier neighbors."" Just read everything in a Borat voice and this game will have been worth every penny and then some.

												There's not much I can say about this game, since it's not just essentially, but LITERALLY a glorified flash-game, but I will make an effort at pointing out just how miserably bad it really is.First of all, the gameplay. Wait... gameplay? I didn't even know this game HAD any gameplay! Yeah, no, to be serious, the essentially only thing you do in this game is to assign/reassign your villagers to different tasks. That's it. No, really, that's it!Okay, sure, you can ""research"" some new ""technologies"", but unlike tech-trees in actual games such as Civilization or Endless Space, the ONLY thing the so-called ""technology"" in this game does is to raise the amount of villagers you can have, and how many villagers you can assign to specific tasks.But frankly, that's about as substantial of an addition to the game's overall value as a single, paper-thin slice of cucumber is to a foot-long sub. In other words, none at all.Then there's the fact that despite the seemingly ""culture neutral"" nature of the name, you can ONLY play as the greeks. No foolin'. And unlike certain other greek-centric games, like Master of Olympus: Zeus, you don't get to explore greek myth, culture, legends or hell, even architecture!No, you pick between Spartans or Athenians, and then depending on which one you picked, you either prepare to go to war against literally every single foreign party you encounter, or ragequit to the main menu and restart as the Spartans after losing 80% of your population after the first raiding party when you're the Athenians.The insanely poor balance between the two barely even functionally different ""factions"" you can play as is laughable at best, and borderline depression-inducingly tragic at worst. Spartans get an invaluable military bonus, and the Athenians get just about bugger-it-up-the-ärse-all by comparison.Adding insult to insult and injury (that is, twice the insult to once the injury), the game has literally zero replayability. The game-world is STRICTLY pre-determined, down to what foreign parties you encounter, and their so-called ""personalities"".If you can't have the mind-implodingly vast random-factor complexity of the Civilization series as a whole boasts, then that's fine, but really, if you're going to make us PAY for your shïtty game, then at LEAST give us ANY kind of incentive to play it for more than an hour, and then thank GabeN for the refund policy on Steam, simply because we could play better games literally for free on any flash-games site that's ever existed since before the words ""Call of Duty"" was any more than an actual military term. 0/10			"

												I picked this up because it looked fun from screenshots.I wasn't wrong.Pre-Civilization Marble Age is a rather simplistic turn based historical simulation game.It took me 90 minutes to go from Athens to being the Byzantine Empire and winning the game culturally.The game is easy to learn and in a short amount of time you'll know what you are doing.Even if it is simplistic,it has depth and you can approach the gameplay differently.You can either be a diplomat,trader or a warmonger.Diplomacy in this game was surprinsingly good.I didn't expect much from it,but it has enough options to make it interesting.Even if I was surprised by it,I found it lacking because it is way too easy to form an alliance,and the city states/civilizations don't have relations between themselves.Trading is simple.You choose what you want to buy/sell and select the number of ships you want to allocate to that trade.Battles are nothing special.It isn't like in CIV games where you control your army and so on.Your job is to build soldiers/make alliances and then attack someone.A window will pop up with the estimation of the fight and you can choose to flee or engange in battle.What is fun about this game is the random scenarios that pop up.It's a historical game that respects the history.You play as either Sparta or Athens and you are faced with various challenges like natural disasters,plagues,Persian invasion,Roman territorial expansion,Hunnic invasion,Arab territorial expansion,various barbaric tribes invading and so on.Once a scenario like that threatens your city/empire,you are given some choices and depending on your judgement,you will exit the crisis better or worse.Graphics are caroonish and pleasing to the eye,the UI can be adjusted and the main menu is also lacking but good enough to get the job done.Pre-Civilization Marble Age has some weaknesses in terms of diplomacy,replayability and balance(some civs,cities are absurdly strong when it comes to army)but even in its current state,I think it is worth a shot for the ones passionate about those kind of games.I can see this game becoming very good with some updates,tweaks in terms of balance and even some DLCs.

												This is a casual turn-based point-&-click 4X game where you attempt to take supreme control of the Greek Empire by way of ""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.""I must stress that it is merely 'casual' in it's play-style, distinguished by it's simple rules and lack of commitment required; in contrast to more complex hardcore games such as Sid Meier's Civilization turn-based 4X-type strategy games.I recommend this game if you want something casual to play when you don't feel like getting in to a deep 'CIV V' style of gaming at that moment. You can build an empire, conquer neighbors, go to war with Romans and Persians, and win or fail all inside an hour or two.The game also has achievements for each stage of Greek history that you survive; and this game has re-playability, too, with an alternate campaign.There is a Tech-Tree that is simple, yet entertaining; if you choose the wrong tech and get too cultivated and artsy, then you might get beaten by an army of barbarians, Romans, Persians, or others.This game is not complex, it is simple; look for it on-sale and grab it if the price is right for you.I got it on a 50%-Off sale and I am delighted with it; easily at least 20 hours of 'casual' game-play to be had here. Check out the Demo, first, if you have doubts.			"

												If you are a fan of strategy or economic simulations then this game might be the one for you. Basically you start off in the early history of man and you can be Sparta or Athens, both of which will completely change how the game plays out. This game is as much of a puzzle as it is a strategy, each time you play you want to do better than the last time by remembering specific events that happen, quests that you have to make ready for, the order that you want to research in, and what buildings you want to build first. Don't expect to be able to choose one resource and just go for it either, you really need to constantly be adapting to the changing needs of your civilization or you will quickly find yourself falling behind. The diplomacy and trading also offer another piece of the puzzle, and they are well done in that your choices will  have a significant impact on how the game turns out for you. As a whole I would say that if you like games like Total War or Civilization then you will really be able to appreciate the subtle complexity of this exceptionally entertaining game. 10/10			"

												Many people seem to be complaining about Marble Age being a ""glorified Flash game"". Well, it really quite literally is, considering that is the technology it uses (and you can find an earlier position in the series on those Flash games websites like Kongregate). But this isn't really a problem. In fact, The Binding of Isaac was a Flash game, too, and so what?No, the problem with this game lies in its mechanics. The simplicity, combined with cute graphics, pretty nice music, and semi-educational content would have actually made it a great little title, but Marble Age's convoluted and unpredictable gameplay is what ruins everything about it.To put it short, I have never seen a game this unbalanced. The progression of numbers (e.g. resources being required, your city's population etc.) is exponential, like in so many browser-based MMO strategies and other titles. But it is also so variable. Rather than being a smooth increase, it jumps all over the place. At one point you're suffocating, your city can't grow anymore, your tech research ground to a halt and you're passing turn after turn just to regain some military power. Then, you complete a goal and suddenly you have twice as much population as you had a moment ago, tons of new resources and several free technology levels. This pattern repeats from time to time, though you never really see it coming. It means that all the strategy goes to trash since the real way to progress is to fulfill whatever goals you have (or count on a lucky random event). What you're trying to do otherwise just doesn't matter.In fact, the whole game is built in such a way that there is an invisible path you're supposed to be following. You don't quite know where it is, so you'll always stumble a bit. Stray too far from it and you reach a place you can't get out of. Manage to stay on track and the whole game becomes really easy. This is actually quite extreme — you can essentially lose a game if you do one thing wrong in the early stages, for instance.(Here I'll note this isn't about following historical events or simply playing in an optimal way. The game is just constructed in such a manner that you have to make arbitrary decisions at right moments to be able to win.)To be fair, the game does try to rescue you if you stray, giving you gifts through random events, but this only exposes the gameplay's faults even more — if the only way for me to get back on track is to accept those gifts, which are just enormous, then this just shows how big the difference between the ""right"" play and the ""wrong"" play is, even though what is right and wrong is decided arbitrarily.It might seem like I'm complaining a lot about this subject but that really is something that ruins Marble Age for me. The game has more flaws than that (maybe I'll list some in the comments) but this is what makes it an unplayable rather than flawed title. Stay away from it unless you like gameplay that's about trying to guess what the developers intended for you to do at any particular stage.			"

												This game is charming and simple, but has a lot to offer beneath the surface and is surprisingly challenging.You start with just a few villagers and have to manage resources via sliders similar to Democracy, the first main goal is to keep a balanced economy capable of growth. As you play you'll research various upgrade paths that can unlock new buildings and improve your economy and army. Occasionally you'll be presented with a challenge, often the challenges will test your military and your economy, and often failing them still allows you to play albeit with penalties. As you play you get scouts that can explore the world, and settlers that can build extra colonies to provide bonuses to your capital. As you uncover other civilizations, you can make peace with them which allows for trade, form alliances with them which helps your army during military events, and eventually buy land from them which can increase your population capacity. Alternately, if your army is big enough and buffed enough and you have a few generals, you can conquer them.As you expand and unify Greece and Mesopotamia, you'll get to decide whether to form an empire or kingdom, and the world map will expand, what started centered around Greece becomes centered around all of western Europe, north Africa, and the middle east, and you encounter whole other civilizations. There are a variety of choices you get to make which can impact how you win, or lose, the game.Overall I'd say this is a great casual game, it's simple but endearing, and considering how cheap it is you could get a really good deal for your money.

												ProsEasy to understand the interfaceCute styleConsThe translation from Russian is in small patches grammaticly odd, and if you press continue game after finishing the final quest a message box pops up in Russian. Felt very linear, and completed in 3hours and that was with me wandering off and leaving the game running for over an hour.Not sure on the replay value, you can play as Athens or Sparta and pick a starting perk, but once Greece is united I don't think it would have a huge impact.Clicking next turn a lot without doing anything just to build resources up is quite boring.OverallNot bad for a steam sale 1.50 purchase, but definately wouldn't have paid full price for it. It could be better polished and needs more depth to what you are doing. Maybe a good one for younger players?			"

												Yes, it IS a glorified $5 flash game, but that doesn't mean its bad. This isn't the first (nor to be the last) in the series of Pre-Civilization games by a dev that knows broken English.  Its part of the enjoyment when you're informed you have too much workers.Go online, play Pre-Civilzation: Stone Age.  Its a free flash game they made before this, and it was a flash game I loved quite a lot.  Eventually a bigger release went on steam for $5 bucks and I thought why not?  I like the game, I want to support the dev, and I want more in this series.Its a simple resource allocator game--You have people, you make them become farmers (to increase population further), warriors (to attack other civilizations for plunder), miners (to build upgrades), as well as a few more. The game is pretty challenging on medium difficulty, and I still play every few days trying to beat medium with something better than the worst medal.  Its enjoyable, simple to get into, has a demo as well as an online flash pre-quel so that anyone can play enough of the series to know if its worth their few bucks.			"

It takes into account a good deal of historical events (which are depicted fairly accurately) and is even occasionally challenging. If you don't mind spending 4 dollars, it's got several hours of play in it and might trigger an interest in reading up on ancient greek history. It did for me.			"

												The gameplay wasn't bad at first. But when I tried to play as Sparta on meduim difficulty, I found the campaign forces you to play in a very precise way. AND be lucky with the RNG. Otherwise, you're going to lose every major challenge. Worse still, said required strategy makes a major shift roughly halfway through the campaign. It goes from forcing you to focus on military strength to forcing you to focus on economic strength. And this shift happens in a very short amount of time. It seems too short to make it feasible without plenty of special favors from the RNG.What would've made this better is if each major challenge had at least two different ways to beat them. That would've provided some flexibility in strategy.Oh, and did I mention you only get to play as either Athens or Sparta? It's not like a player can choose between many factions to fit their own playstyle. Granted, each of these two factions gets to choose between six perks at the start. But those perks make little difference. The campaign requirements are still too constricting and unfair.And while I'm griping about poor gameplay balance, I'll also mention the ""overpopulation"" mechanic in the late parts of the campaign. Even on easy mode, it becomes way too cumbersome. It feels like a hastily tacked-on way to increase end-game difficulty.Overall, not a good strategy game. Even for it's price range, I don't reccomend it, at least not without a major patch. But I doubt that will happen, considering the developer has already released another similar strategy game called Predynastic Egypt. Having only played that later game's demo, I can only hope it's gameplay is more flexible and better balanced than Marble Age.			"

I'm not saying this isn't a fun or good game, because if you want a game you just play once or twice to just mess around with for $2-$5 this would be GREAT for you! I just was hoping for more of a diverse building system. I still think the devs did a good job for the limited scope that they had, but I just want to warn people who enjoy strategy and building games that this DOES NOT have great features for that genre. However, if you want a game that you just play once and put down, then I would recommend it. For others like myself I would NOT reccomend it.			"

												Pretty neat game. Got it on sale for $2.49. It's a short strategy game and you'll probably get at most about 6-7 hours out of it. If you're really into it and are willing to replay the game you'll get a good 13 or so hours out of it. I'd say it was worth it!			"

												Really Interactive Game! I have played the browser Pre-Civilization Games and they are really fun with tons of events. This one has the Persians, Alexander, Romans and more! Honestly they say Sparta is harder than Athens but Sparta is easier for me probally because you start with more citizens. I highly recomend this game. If you cant rack up 5 bucks try the demo!Excuse all my grammar mistakes if there are any.			"

												super fun for a very manageable price tag.  replayability isn't very high once you master it, but there is plenty of fun to be had while getting there.  no save files makes it slightly less fun to experiment, but you learn and you just play another game.  games aren't too long, so you don't feel like you're wasting too much time.  like others said it's kinda like civilization lite, but still really fun.  i am totally thrilled with my purchase, which is saying something.

												The sliders for trading bugged out, forcing me to trade 20 billion gold (millions of times what I had) for 20 billion production every turn, forcing me to rob my nobility, then my populace, then everyone else I could for loans, retarding my city's growth until the impossible debts could be paid (never, because I could not stop the trading). Plus side, the billions of production points let me build the world's greatest defensive wall to stop the huns. Take that, ancient China.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game, in fact I have played it mutliple times on both Athens and Sparta. Theres lots of pros and little cons to this game. Its a simple game that is relaxing and easy to understand. My only complaints are that you can only build buildings twice and can only use your science points two times through. I really just want more from this game. I think they should let you advance further and explore more. Instead of stopping with Europe they should let you explore the whole world.			"

												A great example of the phrase ‘the whole is more than the sum of its parts’. Marble age at its core is just a number of sliders to control different production types of an empire. But it works so well. As you develop your empire you are tasked between growing your empire and meeting certain milestones/quests that the game throws at you. The challenge comes from trying to optimise your empire in order to grow it as fast as possible – appealing to the min/max child in each of us.  Note:Can be difficulty can be off putting to newcomers. Hard difficult is HARD.Random events can be too powerful (really help or hinder your empires).This is available on android. As far as portable games go (I consider most to be premium junk), this is highly recommended and if you are someone who has lots of time to kill due to travelling you should consider buying on android.

												Edit: Only 1 day after posting my complaints the developer has already added a fullscreen mode and made easy difficulty easier. The game could probably use some more balance improvements but seeing how quickly changes were made I would gladly recommend this game to fans of the earlier flash games.Earlier Review:This is definitely an improved version of the flash games and is very addictive. It could be well worth the cost but as it is now, it's only frustrating. Sadly it has the same issue as the earlier flash game Pre-Civilization Stone Age, it is much too difficult. I played 3 games up to now and the best I could do was survive for 301 turns on easy difficulty.  The lack of full screen support is also a huge annoyance which needs to be patched up before I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This game has much more than what it appears to be.I mean if you are looking for a good game to relax it's a very solid choice,and also if you want to try to master the game and get all the achievements you are in for a world of hurt.The game is on turns and there's some random events but overall you can make a sequence and try to find the perfect oneto get all the hard achievements.It took me about 20 hours playing and about 100 restarts to get them all and to see pretty much everything the game has to offer but I really recommend it especially if you get it on a sale.The Highest price I would value this game would be U$5,00 so any value you pay less for that is a very good buy.Overall 7/10 - Just cause the sad part is there's no replay value after you try all the strats. So pretty much you will shelve it.			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupDisclaimer: The copy of this game was provided by Orlygift[www.orlygift.com]. Thank you for making this review possible!Few words about the gamePre-Civilization Marble Age is a quite complex but peaceful strategy game. You goal is to expand your territory, make alliances and just explore around your world. It's a really entertaining game, mostly thanks to being based on actual history, but still it's a nice way to spend free evening. It might not be the best strategy game around, especially with all those restrictions imposed by game as alot of potential development is wasted, yet it's one of the nicest I've personally playedAdvantages - Lovely cartoon(ish) graphics and practical, adjustable in-game UI - Surprisingly composite technologies tree that boosts up replay value of game a bit - Lets players refresh their knowledge about Greek history (which I like even more than my own) - Price is fair enough, especially when discounts are going on - ""Hundreds"" (In about 2.5h gameplay occured only few of those) historical events makes gameplay a bit more varied and interestingDisadvantages - Sounds are crappy and music doesn't fit in game - Too flash-like feel of a game - Short and limited in capabilities of itSummaryIt feels a bit like this game was left out too early, devs could give it a little more love, it deserves it. It also might be overwhelming for newcomers but after max. 1 hour, most of players should understand mechanics completely. Anyway, it's a pleasant game, with decent price tag, perfect to take a rest from bigger titles and just have fun expanding your little city with loads of random events on the way. Worth at least trying out!Personal score6.5 / 10If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games! "

												It's like a board game with more rules than a board game could ever have. Like Civilization board game (and PC game), you are constantly encouraged to specialize and then punished for your weakenesses. I can't tell whether the random events are intelligently helping me catch up where I'm weak, but I suspect it is so, because on normal, I am only inching my way forward on highly iterative playthroughs.I love this game for its balanced asymmetry.

												The game has a good fundation, but a few hickups that ruined my game. The fact that I got punished for prosecuting Christianity and keeping it's believer to 0% is okay, but whats not okay is to reduce all my ressource income by 96% because of this. Nowhere in the game do they tell you the victory conditions of the trials that pop up. Along with the poor transation the game is frustrating and punishes you for unknown reasons. The game if however really fun otherwise so you should buy it, it's especially worth it at the low cost.			"

												TL;DR 5/10 A 1-track forced development of a civilization. Turn-based exponential clicker game.5/10?  That is not great. Why am I still recommending it?  Well--I enjoyed myself for what it was.As another reviewer warned before I played, this game plays like a clicker game, except turn-based.  Like all clicker games, the game goes through obscene levels of growth.  The result is that all of the action and growth that were done previously are quickly made irrelevant by the present state of growth.The first time I played, I layed out a carefully managed plan of my resources.  Timed events occurred expecting me to be at a certain level of the growth curve.  I failed most of the challenging event (invading civilizations) because I thought that I could play the game at my own pace.  Since I conceded each of these overly unfair wars, none of my people died, and I was allowed to continue with a 40% reduction rate of some resource.  So, I lasted through half the game until the Huns came in and utterly wiped me out even with conceding the war.  During this first playthrough at my own managed pace, the game would feel sorry for me at certain checkpoints.  At least 8 different times, the game simply said, ""Your neighbors are progressing well; so you benefit from the collective prosperity. Here is a reward of XX population, XX money, XX culture, XX army.""  Literally 4 huge boosts to my present inventories of resources to try to level the playing field for where the game expected me to be.Like other clicker games, your own army is irrelevant (when playing Athens, not Sparta). They participate, grow, and die in wars--but they are only meaningful as 5% of your army strength.  Your power comes from allying with neighbors and using their armies (20% of them) through treaty.  So, often, your army is your least important resource.  (The booster %bonuses to your army are very important, because they apply to your allied army)Since it is a clicker game but turn-based, growth is mandatory at a certain time pace.  You must grow your population as fast as possible.  You keep them fed, while boosting 4 other resources--Production, Culture, Gold, with Army mostly irrelevant.  The only way to grow those resources is by allocating your population to each of the various tasks, fully changable each turn.The second playthrough, I knew and could anticipate the non-random pre-timed events.  You shift your population into growing whichever resource is more important for the temporary challenge of the time.The Production resource will purchase booster Buildings for your civilation layed out in a progressive tree of choices (along with a maintence fee to manage from your Gold resource.)  Culture will purchase boosters from a progressive Technology tree.  Both trees are mostly an illusion of choice.  You cannot purchase anything other than 2 or 3 options, and you are forced to purchase the other options soon afterwards.  Especially in the Technology tree, you are not allowed to purchase a more important technology from a different branch of study--the game forces you to purchase the remaining options first from earlier availability.  So, your only choice is what exact order of purchasing do you make in a forced, linear consumption track.Many random events occur over the course of the 280-330 turn game.  ""Here are some free armies.""  ""Here is some free culture.""  ""A city was poisoned; XX population die.""  In a progressive game, these one time events are manageable and mostly shrugged off as a 1-3 turn delay.  However, I just hit mid-game the Starvation problem again.  You must have your farmers keep up with your growing population; yet because of the controlled expansion of farmers by the purchased Technology and Buildings, they can be maxed out.  So, my population got slightly ahead, with no ability to increase my farmers yet.  So, a few people die off and the population returns to an equilibrium of sustainability, right? WRONG !!  No joke--0.05% 100/200K of my people starved.  So, the game presents 3 punishments:  Give up some Culture growth for 10 turns, Spend an exhorbant amount of your Gold balance, OR murder 30% of your population.  OK--fine.  I took the Culture punishment.  However, next turn, the same problem is still there with no ability to rectify the food with increased farmers.  Again, 96/200K of my people die.  The game forces one of the remaining 2 choices of punishment.  So, after a few turns, the game forces you to murder 30% of your population because 0.05% were dying.This kind of absurdity is the norm for this flawed game.  Well, I suppose it is similar to real life.  In RL, you planned and managed your resources, got an education, worked hard at a vocation.  Guess what?  Today, a truck hit you OR you got fingernail cancer.  You may not be dead, but which crippling result will you now manage for the rest of your life?Grow your civilization along the path that the game expected, not much deviation is allowed.  Do this, and you will win the full achievements.  Almost.  Now do it one more time with the other Home city. (Athens or Sparta)FATAL FLAWS:#1 When conquering a city, you must beat them 3 times.  However, after each fight your armies lose an appropriate number in the fight.  However, for the target city, their armies magically respawn instantly.  Did they enlist more from the population?  -9M population, +16K army.#2 When trading, other bonuses stack onto your commodity trades.  Unfortunately, this means that it makes sense to ONLY BUY when trading.  The bonuses do not boost your return of gold when selling.Pay no more than $1.25 on sale for this.			"

												 A massive accomplishment in the gaming industry. There are many things I liked about this game. Here's a few strong points: Accurate mapping, large degrees of micromanagement and lots of real events happening at the real times gave a bolder illusion of reality. It made me feel like I was a real ruler. I loved the cartooney graphics; when the models are on this scale they look really good. I enjoyed the variety of boosts and debuffs that you could have. The call the legions was great if you were Sparta (lots of generals so you can really take advantage of the 100k more units) and it was funny how on Easy you could use call the legions to get equal troops to the Romans and then overthrow them. I couldn't find many bad things to say about this game, but they are big enough to make a point of: Real shame I couldn't play as a different city in Greece/Different country. Maybe open up a mod workshop so this is possible? The fact that I couldn't specify EXACTLY how many people I wanted doing a thing really annoyed me (Major OCD). The biggest nagging problem I found was that the Justinian Plague was REALLY confusing. For some reason sometimes things were unusable and sometimes they were and I think that because it's the least straightforward of the events it should have at least a LITTLE bit of prior instruction so you don't fail on your first time getting to that point in the game. All in all though, great game, I'd rate 9.2/10 in it's current state, and 9.8/10 if the issues are fixed. "

												Very tough call here, but I played it for enough hours to consider I got my money's worth of entertainment. It is not easy to beat the game, even on easy difficulty, and I've done these kind of games forever ( played my first computer game in 1976 so you can do the math ).The game exhibits a wildly random events generator but also, beyond that it is built to be against you every turn. It really felt like the computer was cheating trying to make it where I would not win. Sort of like the developer couldn't figure out how to make it real strategy so he just made up wild numbers of enemies to kick you hard. In other words, some people may easily rage quit LOL.I'm not going to be able to recommend it based on the down sides, but if you like this type of thing, or S&M, hey it may be for you. Especially if you can get it cheap.-------------EDIT: Even though the game still feels like it is cheating, you can win easily once you play enough times. I'm changing to yes recommend the game, it provided quite a bit of entertainment ( some frustration, yes, but value was good overall )			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  It is a flash game bundled into a steam app that they charge you for, but you get what you pay for.  The game plays a lot like a euro stype board game, moving workers around to collect resources while interacting with the rest of the world.  It is a lot like managing only one city in Civ.  The game does have a new game+ function that lets you carry over Civ points to make the next game easier.  First play through, I got the lowest victory and learned a bunch.  This gave me enought new game+ points to get 2 bonuses in the next game.  The second play through, I got the second best ending.  I think with the points I earned, I could pull off a top rated game in game three.  I will try here shortly.  If I do, then I can play as the second race, and I assume I will get the top score on my first try on that, then I wil be done with the game.  So, yeah, 4 play throughs and I will be done.  Was it worth the $5.  Completely.			"

												(07/10) - A Decent Casual GameSure, this game is just a flash game, but that doesn´t mean it´s a bad game for Steam. The controls work fine so i don´t see why i should judge the game for it´s port.The gameplay is what really caught me. You´re just sliding some sliders to assign your workers but the level of depth behind it is pretty amazing. Seeing if you can´t get that building one turn earlier or defeat the incoming enemy wave this time, there is more strategy to it than it might seem at first glance. I enjoyed boardgames with this mechanic so i had no problem to love the polished version of it in this game.That said tho, beating the game is hard and will take multiple tries to finally do so. Luckily a decent variety of starting perks and two different factions give a nice replayability.Onto the bad parts then. This point would usually mean i don´t recommend the game as i hate the word: random. There are some random elements that might or might not happen on which your success is based. Now as i think no game should have randomness in it, why am i still recommending it?Becuase those things felt miner and are not what i took from the game.If you´re looking for a casual game to spend some hours on to finally beat and then set aside, i really had fun trying to figure out what comes next and how i could improve my play...

												Marble Age is a fun game, particularly if you enjoyed games like Colonization, Civilization, and maybe a bit of Capitalism / tycoon-ish elements.  There is some resource management and governance things, but the interface is streamlined and idiot-proof enough that you'll figure out how it works in a jiffy.The game runs through about 300 turns and various events based on history pop-up throughout the campaign.  The goal is to achieve victory before the last turn, and there are awards / achievements depending how early you succeed.  This may seem repetitive, but there's a lot of variance with how you build your empire, allocate resources, conduct diplomacy, and quite a bit more.  The slick interface makes all of this very easy to manage and there are helpful indicators when events need your attention.  As an added bonus for beer-and-pretzel gamers, this one is 100% mouse-controllable.  :)If you enjoy strategy games and maybe tycoon games, this one is an easy buy--heck, it's worth a lot more in terms of dollars per hour for me already.

												This game is an on-rails glorified Flash game that's simply not worth playing more than once.  Its roots are in Flash and mobile games and it shows.  You can't affect history, you can't significantly alter the track of the game, you just go through the same handholding through history, trying to build things just a little bit faster each time.  No choices, just execution of an optimal strategy that's not fun anymore once you figure it out.Even on sale, this game simply isn't worth the time you'll spend playing it---you'll see the whole thing in five hours, tops.

												This game looks and feels like a Flash game.  There is a definite beginning and end to the game, but it doesn't feel like a complete, compelling experience.  You can choose between two different civilizations to play as, but there is no real variety; it's the same thing each and every time.  Normally, there is a degree of randomness and variety in strategy games that doesn't seem to be present here.  While there are extra screens for managing things like diplomacy and science, turns play out on a screen that represents what your civilization is doing.  You have a certain population, and you use sliders to increase or decrease the number of people assigned to particular tasks.  Each task generates one more resources for your civilization, and new tasks are unlocked by building new ""buildings"".So, aside from dipping briefly into other screens when needed, all you do is adjust resource production on the main screen with slide controls, and click end turn.  I'm not at all opposed to games that use a minimal style--my favorite strategy game is MO1.  But something about it just doesn't work here and I can't recommend it at all.But, as with all games that have demos, I recommend you try it for yourself and see if you like it.  I ended up buying it because it was heavily discounted and I wanted to see if the game improved.  I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it either.			"

												I have lost track how much time I have playing this game over 100 hours. It has almost all been on my phone. For a PC game it is decent still one of the best stragey games made for mobile to date. It is actually a fairly deep game because it is all about trade offs. Due you save up money and have a small miltary so you can expand your pop, due research, or expand military so you  can gain allies or attack. My only beef with the game is that there are very limited choices in now you game play  to beat it at the hardest levels, unless you get some great radom events. Really the best smaller size game that really is good at their being downsides to all your choices, in you can't have it all.			"

Even once I knew where stuff was it still disrupted my enjoyment of the game because everything just felt less natural and didn't ""flow"" as well.

												a dissapointing little game, telling the player quite nothing about the most fascinating time of the beginning of the western culture. lots of short text, which makes me not care for what i am doing at all.there are 3 sections to this game,one map, one technological advancement tree & several screens regarding relationships with other regions. that's it. more content is not there with every Next click time passes. as far i know history of that time the events are historically correct, still, delivered absolutely dry, enough for a small mobile game but not really a satiated turn based strategy.i wish someone would make an actual historical game about that time, its changes & development of the western culture consisting not mainly of permanent war.Pre-Civilization Marble Age isat a very low price, playable for a very short time.to lower the rating from Very Positive to less enthusiastic i vote Not Recommended			"

												(English Review, Translated russian review below) This is well develpoped, and accessible for many.It is not bad for a four dollar game, it is very well develeoped and quite alot of effort was put into this game, assuming a two person team made this. It has a website, video gameplay example, good user interface, fun graphic animation, relaxing music, and good sound effects. Also, because of the cheap price, very fast download speed, and simple graphics, it makes it playable for many people.However, It is not that replayable because it only has two civilizations you can play, and after beating the game you cannot continue, but since it just got released, they have enough time to add more. Also, it did inherit some ideas of other games, and is not a new thing. But overall, this game is quite good and the develper(s) have potential to create more, easily assessible, and well develop games in the future. I look forward to it.---Это хорошо develpoped и доступными для многих.Это не плохо для игры в четыре доллара, это очень хорошо develeoped и довольно много усилий было вложено в эту игру , предполагая, чтодва человек команды сделал это . Он имеет веб-сайт, пример видео геймплей, хороший пользовательский интерфейс , весело графической анимацией , расслабляющая музыка , и хорошие звуковые эффекты.Кроме того, из-за дешевой цене , очень быстрая скорость загрузки, и простой графикой , это делает его воспроизводиться для многих людей.Тем не менее ,Это не то, что replayable , потому что он имеет только две цивилизации можно играть , и после прохождения игры вы не можете продолжать , но, поскольку он только что получил освобожден, что они имеют достаточно времени, чтобы добавить больше. Кроме того, он сделал наследуют некоторые идеи других игр , и неновая вещь . Но в целом , эта игра является достаточно хорошим иdevelper ( ы ) имеют потенциал для создания более легко assessible , и хорошо разрабатывать игры в будущем. Я с нетерпением жду этого.			"

This is not strategy.All you have to do in this game is move the sliders to assign workers and maybe click some stuff during the events which themselves are rare. The technologies which can be researched and the buildings which can be built doesn't do much other than increasing the limit of the sliders.			"

												This game is terrible, All you do is move bars to change numbers. OH and now and then you get to apply science points to pictures that unlock buildings that apply more pictures to the screen and increase the max numbers you can have in different parts of the screen. You don't really get to choose how you want to do things because 'as the game will tell you' your suppose to do things in a specific order or you will be defeated. And the game tells you the order it wanted you to do things. So well... if you suck at strategy and want to be told what to do without ANY complexity then this game is for you, otherwise buy something better.			"

												What is the best part of gaming?If you answered ""moving sliders”, rejoice!Who needs all those AAA graphical or sound settings screen: with this nifty little game, I can move sliders around all-day long, without having to worry about ruining the planet too much as it won't be taxing my GPU or CPU in any way. I always thought trying to compute the best frames/second by moving sliders was too taxing for my brain. Problem solved: there is next to zero thinking required in this slider-moving feast. Let's move my sliders, here comes a breakthrough! I can increase the number above one of my sliders tenfold and move those sliders again, but wait! A bad event! One of my slider has been set back to zero: I will have to move the others around next turn, until everything gets back in order and I get the next upgrade which will increase the numbers above one my sliders tenfold! Unless it is a bad event that set back one of the sliders to zero!And I am sparing you the excitement of having to move some of the sliders (which scale crazily high) to the exact pixel they need to be, or else you'll have to cope with big letters pop-ups telling you are doing it wrong.That's another theme of this endearing game: it loves to tell the player how much he is wrong. And what better way to do that than by throwing in predetermined events the player can't do anything about the first time around? Please, enjoy reading the big old dialogue box telling you what you should have been doing all that time, 'doh!'....In short: unsatisfying and predictable.			"

												The game just doesn't feel well thought out. The talent tree is very linear. Although it seems that there are several choices, in reality you will unlock 90% of the talents in a mostly linear fashion due to being limited by ""Tech level"" requirements. The same goes for the Production tree. They're not well thought out, they only provide limit increases, and you're not really allowed to spec into certain parts of the production tree while ignoring others like a good talent tree should allow. You're basically limited to unlocking the entire first row, then the entire second row, then the entire third row. There's no ability to really spec into any particular strength or weakness. If you wanted to make a colony with no army and become a massive trading civilization, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck because you're basically forced to make a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥army since your talent tree in both culture and production incentivize doing so. Idunno. I had really high hopes because I played the other two free games several times through, and the overall steam rating was high. But this game doesn't deserve it's ""Very Positive"" rating in my opinion.			"

												This game is not all bad, but after 15h, I will abandon it for those reasons :- it's quite repetitive, you will always encounter the same events.- you earn ""civilisation points"" during your game, and you can spend those in future game... (who had this horrible idea ???).- the game is insanely hard, I do not think you can get good results without spending those ""civilisation points"".Combine those 3 reasons altogether, and you can understand my frustration.Appart that, if you like civ games, and just want to walk through the game twice (once with Athen, once with Sparta), I would still recomand it.

												An interesting diversion, but in the end you succeed or fail based on things that aren't really very clear. It doesn't help that the translation is bad. The ""Plague"" event seems to be completely glitched out or missing a ton of instructions, because you can do literally everything you're given the option to do and still fail the event, which destroys your chances of succeeding for the rest of the game. Needs work before it is ready to play.			"
