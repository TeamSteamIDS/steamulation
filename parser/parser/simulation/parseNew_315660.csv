Be sure you have a higher-end computer that can run this simulatorThis is a pretty decent train simulation program but...I DO NOT LIKE their modding community structure.  If you like to download mods, you will have to PAY[www.auran.com] for a 1st class ticket to remove the download caps from their proprietary Download Station[www.auran.com] (subscription is $10 for 1 month, $15 for 3 month, or $35 for 1 year).  Bloody Blokes!  And I'm pretty certain the modders are not receiving any of those funds.  If you do not have a 1st class ticket, your number of downloads are limited each month and the download speed is HEAVILY capped (my speed is around 4.80 KB/sec; that's slower than dial-up speed folks; you'll have babies, watch them graduate from college, and have children of their own before anything downloads via the Trainz content manager).  Both the Trainz Download Station and Content Manager are absolutely horrible in comparison to the Steam Workshop.  I will change my review to a thumbs up if they remove the capped download speeds without paying for a subscription.  Aside from that, this simulator is great and a must have for anyone who loves trains and doesn't care about mods.			"

												Conclusion: Loads of features but only glimpses of a game to be seen.For all of you who have not played any Trainz version before, be aware you are buying a pre-BETA train sim engine that is just declared 'release ready'. This must be developer speak for 'most feature we wanted to put in at this time and mostly working'. Don't be fooled, you are not buying a complete game with content. It's more like a game engine + some demo levels in various states of completion. Also, do not buy unless you have a good internet connection.. every new iteration comes in at 8Gb or so and I am expecting a few to come. There's no smart updating. Further, be aware that the Trainz developers are seemingly not interested in any element of normal convention in games. Easy to learn, hard to master... proper feedback (you'll get points added or deducted without explanation).. gentle on mistakes: you will find non of that.Pass a red signal by a hair and after having played for 3 hours... the session will end - a subtle fade to black and that's it. Sorry you should have saved... which deducts points from your session, so you can't get to that 5 star rating. But don't worry there's a DLC coming with proper sessions!!!I found the same attitude in buying a first class ticket. You pay and you will not get an email to say we will activate this in 5 minutes or 10 hours... just give the money and they'll do their best... presumably.For those that know Trainz like myself off and on since TRS2004.. This is no new era... it's same old, same old. You'll know what you're in for, except I think community development has slowed down.On the positive, it looks a bit better and I like the new guidance for sessions and what to do, where to stop, .. but it needs refining. I got completely stuck a couple of times, with no chance of recovery.The best bit I found is the enormously impressive 400 or something miles London - Edinburgh line... which wasn't really done by the dev team anyway. It lacks a bit in sessions and rolling stock through it.. but if the game was finished, had a bit more gentle gameplay and more play-tested content .. it could be a massive showcase. It also basks England in an almost Queensland (Australia) like spring-summer hot weather haze that is just beautiful. It runs very decent on my GTX970 at 2560x1024.The trains also seem to break and accelerate very realistically and it's pretty cool to moderate your speed so you loose the least amount of time being behind a slower train in front. However issues with such as the AWS not always switching off and many niggles throw dirt on this feast. Zoom in map does not work when coming from cabin view, floating repeating houses in scenarios. the cabin and HUD disappearing / restarting... and lots of irritating ALPHA-BETA kind of stuff. A letdown and a really I think just unwise communication of the team to declare the game release ready. The engine may now be getting there, the game is certainly far from being a game. In the end, I think this team is mostly let down by poor setting of expectations (Look at Dirt Rally to see what BETA means!!), lack of content, and a lack of focus on gameplay... with as a result that I think it misses the mark for many. This is disappointing for all of us wanting a great realistic train sim that we can actually ENJOY. The reactions surely will also be a disappointing lack of love for all the effort put in by the devs. Features just don't make a great game. Let's hope we'll see lot's of improvement in polish, gameplay and a dose of realism in the team's communication. "

												Like many others I bought this game for a few reasons:First, I enjoyed Trainz 12, it was the best train simulator I had ever played.Second, Trainz: A New Era was tested by thousands of players for a full year.Third, I ignored all of the bad reviews about this game before I bought it.The third was a huge mistake. I am not going to repeat the hundreds of bad comments people made about the game, but I will say that I agree with almost all of them. At the very least, to avoid wasting your money, wait until the game is fixed and optimizable.			"

												Hey, are you kidding me ? A ""New Era"" was promised, but what you get is million miles away from the standard, which is TS  2015 setting. Yes, i am one of the backpackers who financed this project, but it is a big disappointment not to say disaster. First look at the whole design, the menus - nothing new. Is the whole thing made for children only? it looks  like. ex. how could you choose a train from the free driver menu.  the display is simply awful. No change compared to the app. the drivers cabins are looking still terrible a.s.oGuess, the whole thing needs a complete makeover, which I expected while announcing in big words ""A NEW ERA"".Even the game graphics are still worse and buckling and are not to compare with TS 2015, which I discovered in the meantime. This is the real deal !!!If I coudl I would claim my money back for this so called ""NEW  ERA"".Very disappointed!!!!!!			"

												Wow. Talk about lipstick on a pig. This ""New era"" they're talking about is identical to the old era, with a tiny improvement in graphics and a huge decrease in performance. Pretty scammy, if you ask me.The cab sway (finally!) is nice, as are the other physics improvements. That's pretty much the only good thing I can say. But I won't be playing this. Even the somewhat lacking Dovetail TS2015 is miles ahead of this poor sim. The only reason I had Trainz 12 still installed was for some bit of community-created content I liked (the moscow metro lines, mostly), and that doesn't work with this version anymore. If you were hoping for a ground-up overhaul, like I was, save your money. This isn't it.P.S - For full disclosure I will state that I did not play the game for 17 hous, like steam says. It's just that this stupid thing took forever to download and install content so I left it overnight... and it counted it as hours played. I spent at most three or four hours on it... yes, it is that bad.			"

												This is one of the poorest versions of Trainz ever released. Despite the much hyped new graphics engine it's necessary to turn off virtually all shadows and water effects to get even a half decent performance (and then it's still sluggish). Without the extra effects it looks no better than its prececessor (TS12) but manages to run worse.Under the hood it's still just the same old Trainz with a few enhancements, such as track which draws points with proper switches and frogs (MSTS had those in 2001) plus superelevation (Railworks-TS20xx had that some years ago). Buy the standard version and you get a route which is virtually unplayable (Hinton) due to lag, a reasonable Aussie route, the behemoth Kings Cross to Edinburgh which despite the scope of the venture came ten years too late and looks state of the art for 2004 (but still runs like a slug on the N3V graphics engine). That leaves Kickstarter County, effectively a small demo layout but compared to the plethora of routes from previous versions is very paltry selection. Word is, N3V didn't want to pay content builders to supply routes or assets and it shows.Although there is supposed to be advance despatcher functions in the pipeline, operations are pretty much as in all previous versions. Except for pre-scripted scenarios which seem to be in the purview of a select few who now how to script them, you just plonk your train down and do glorified free roam. Nothing approximating the MSTS activity editor or RW-TS scenario tools.Don't even think about trying to run this on a laptop. I just had mine perform a thermal shut down while working on a small test route. Okay it's only an I3 but it can run the RW-TS editor (or MSTS) for an extended period and nothing like that has ever happened - heck even TS12 didn't nearly set it on fire.A disappointing end to what promised to be a genuine breath of fresh air on the train sim scene. The Dovetail TS20xx has nothing to worry about from this competition unless N3V can set to over the next few months, get some new coding talent in and turn this poorly optimised mess into something resembling what they promised and for which many KS backers (not me, I was a bit more savvy and saw this coming) many AUS$1000's. If the Dovies can push on and release their UE4 sim in a couple of years, Trainz will be dead and buried.			"

												I too was a backer of the Kickstarter for this and I really hoped it would be better than it turned out. This review is based on the latest version as of 14-06-2015, and my list of gripes are:* It looks nothing like the Kickstarter 'teaser' video we were shown.* Performance is terrible, I have to turn down all the settings and run at a resolution smaller than my default 1920x1080 desktop just to get 30FPS. I have a GeForce 760 and at max settings your lucky to get out of single digit frame rates and this is with basically nothing on screen. See my screenshot gallery for images.* Stuttering as the camera moves around the world due to resource loading. Which has got better with the latest version.* Culling of objects is bad, just rotating your view and things will pop in and out.* Varied object quality. Most objects seem as if they are pulled straight from previous versions of Trainz, and even the new ones are inconsistent with some rail cars allowing running numbers and some not. Texture resolutions are mixed ruining the look.* The supposed main improvment, that of 'real' switches, doesn't even work most of the time.* I dislike the UI they use, a lot of thumbnail images they use aren't even at the correct aspect ratio and are blurred, making it look unprofessional.I could go on, but it's depressing to do so. On the bright side, shadows do actually work.If only I had Doc Brown's time travelling train, I would pop back and tell myself to steer clear of the T:ANE Kickstarter.			"

												***Disappointing*** - I expected a lot when I heard that the SP1 patch had been released, game fails to live up to expectations- Graphics are frankly awful, flat, bright colours with very basic lighting and poor 3d modelling, routes are sparsely populated with objects, textures are bright and basic-looking.- Included content is pretty barebones, I was looking forward to driving the full ECML route London - Edinburgh but find tehre are only a couple of scenarios available, if I want an all stops (or more than one stop!) scenario I have to go about creating it myself, time consuming when all I want to do is drive a train in a sim, not become a game developer!- Content management is ridiculously convoluted, the download station doesn't work in the Trainz portal for the Steam version of the game, and searching from within the T:ENA launcher is time-consuming. God help you should you want to import resources from previous versions!Very disappointing, if you have a few hours to learn how to edit routes and create new scenarios then possibly the game might liven up, as it is it promises a lot but fails to deliver to those of us who just want to drive a train and follow a scenario.

												For now it isn't even close to graphics level, shown in trailer. It's worse than in previous part of the game. And something tells me two month aren't enough to fix it. It's TOTALLY the same game as Trainz Simulator 12! Now i think that 2006 looks better! New engine? Where? There is no any NEW ERA.  But there are: big troubles with the optimization, endless time of loading of session or appearing of launch window, shocking texture quality and a lot of bugs. I didn't see anything in common with the trailer video on Kickstrater. Nothing! Oh, I'm sorry. It's true, all objects have a shadow now. If to be honest I was very disapointed. It looks like they sell us the old game second time. It's all about beta. But it's only two month before release. I don't belive in miracles. Think twice before buy.			"

Posted: December 4, 2015
												This is a quick review after only using TANE for a couple of days.My main interest is in building my own layouts and operating trains under a free roam environment. I purchased TS2015 approx 1 year ago - and though impressed, it didn't seem suitable for free roam.I reloaded TS2015 again a month or so ago - and tried again. On forums I saw some suggestion as to how one could switch from one train to another - it was cumbersome and didn't work. I asked directly on the TS2015 forum and no-one could give me an answer. WIth TS2015 - I could only swap ""free roam"" locos if they were close to each other - and if I did select a second loco, the the first one simply stopped moving.Went on a TANE forum and asked the same question. Had a same-day answer - that the functionality I wanted was available and easy to use.Was a little doubtful if it really would work.Have also seen concerns about frame rate etc with TANE, but decided to give it a go.Have run through the tutorials - and I'm fine with frame rate and general presentation. I have an NVIDIA 570GTX graphics card - which was deemed good 4 years ago - but if I upgrade, I'm sure I could get better performance now.The critical issue for me is the ability to develop the equivalent of a large train set,  that I create,  and where I can drive different locos  at the same time, where I want to, and at the speed I choose for each loco.As indicated it's early days for me - there are numerous tools to learn (as indeed with TS2015 ) but that can come in the weeks ahead.The key test was yesterday. Without any study of the manual or on-line help etc, I went into surveyor mode - and created 3 separate tracks - one roughly oval with one set of points leading to a side track and the other two were just single curved lines of track.I put locos and on each track.I started one loco - at slow speed, selected another from a simple menu - and started that at a quicker speed.I started a 3rd loco at another speed and moved it in and out of the siding from the oval track.It all worked - 3 locos running at different speeds that I can control.From a simple menu I can jump to different parts of my layout - to wherever my locos are present- and I can get control of any one of them without impacting on the other locos which continue to move around at whatever speed I've set for them. Effectively 3 locos in ""free roam"" that I can control easily and independently.As indicated above, there is an incredible amount to learn - both TANE and TS2015 are impressive, but the ""free roam"" functionality is what I wanted. Rather than simply drive up and down long albeit impressive routes created by others, the magic for me comes from creating my own railway.TANE offers this to me.I was fortunate to purchase this game on cyber-Monday for £15. It's worth a lot more. Over the years I've pondered whether to invest in a model train set. Locos here might be around £100 each. A spend of around £1000 or more might give  me a good layout with a few locos, track, buildings and scenery etc but would seem very restricted to what I can get with a computer program. There is infinite potential if I want to explore it.The base cost for TANE and TS2015 (now TS2016) is very small - I'd encourage anyone to buy both and see what aspects appeal.As I said above - for me, the ""free roam""  capability is critical. As I understand it, TS2015/6 claim that most users don't want ""free roam"". That surprises me - but the bottom line is that I do.HENCE I will be staying with TANE and spending a lot of time on it in the months (and years?) ahead. I'm happy that TANE can offer what I want - and I'll now invest the time with manual and any other source of learning that I can find. Subject to anyone checking their computer spec and their graphics card in particular, I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in trains.     "

												Trainz: A New Era (or T:ANE for short) was a Kickstarter campaign to create the next generation of Trainz. After more than a year in development and after a full refurbishment of the game's core engine, disappointment couldn't be anywhere as high as it is at the moment.What went wrong? Wasn't supposed for this to be a New Era? Yes. There are tests that show how much potential has been inserted into T:ANE, but, unfortunately, it came out with one huge flaw: A huge quantity over quality content.There are some few assets that really uses A BIT of what the new engine is capable of in terms of visual perks. Also, there's very few content that uses the new technologies implemented into this game. If you haven't read the 4 basic kickstarter goals and understand what features each one has, you'll probably miss out the point of T:ANE.Remove those ""new"" assets and all you get is the classic Trainz we've got used to since... 2004. Old trains, old buildings, old splines... pretty much old everything, or at least how the assets were designed and modeled couldn't be anywhere more close to how things were done in the past. The quantity of assets doesn't complement the very lack of quality.Think of it like this. Would you buy Dovetail Games Train Simulator 2015 with nothing more than the routes from the old Microsoft Train Simulator, all with the old assets as well? No? Then that's what T:ANE is right now: An high tech refrigerator full of rotten food. So much that the door finds it hard to even close.And when we get to routes, the story seems to be the same. They are, really, BIG and LONG, but get into the cab and, besides the old assets they still rely on, you'll probably find it hard to find much detail anywhere near the track. Routes feel empty and deserted, and even with full cities with street signs and public lights, it still feels like riding trains on a small desert populated by cubes of very low resolution textures and a sea of SpeedTrees a few dozens of meters away from the track.Comparing, for example, Ipswich from T:ANE to Ipswich on DTG TS2015, you'll find a complete lack of attention to detail and of original assets. Everything seems to be recycled of anything already available, or are very original assets... which also look rubbish.Technologies like new shadders, new effects and superelevated track are not explored in any of the routes available. Only a few number of track do have the new technology of procedural junctions. Only two locomotives have been fine tuned, and one had a cab overhaul, while everything else still work and feels like toy trains on a scale model railway.And, to finish, the UI... HUD... in a era of Metro Language and Minimal Design, the graphical menus from T:ANE couldn't look anywhere more terrible than this. And it is amazing how the same low-res fonts are still in use after more than 10 years on the market! Has N3V forgot to hire a graphics designer!? Because, as a designer, everything since Trainz 2009, in what concerns the UI, looks like a grenade explosion right in front of my eyes!The amount of scripts... urgh...Multiplayer is also available on T:ANE so... if you fancy that, here's something that only OpenRails features at the moment.To make it short, T:ANE has a lot of potential. Now, does it explore that potential? The answer is: No.Until N3V picks up a version of T:ANE with zero assets installed and starts doing a route and trains from scratch, it will never be able to convince the skeptics, and make the fans happy.The menus are still the same horrible mess. If they are trying to compete with A-Train 9 for UI complexity and quality, they're winning!To sum up, a question: Are you a 3D modeller and content developer?If yes: Buy T:ANE. The N3V wiki has everything needed to explore the new technology and the community has lots of tutorials to do high quality content for Trainz. You'll be delighted with the results you'll get once you start to export content to T:ANE.If not: Maybe you'll should keep the money from when there's something worth the attention. People will probably be adding new free and payable DLC which will change the face of T:ANE. Once there's enough content with quality that brightens your eyes, it might be a good time to get T:ANE. Until then, let things settle down.			"

												Sorry but not can't recommend this game.   They promised a new era yet everything still looks the same and frankly the performance is just as bad, even on a decent machine can't play one of the routes without turning everything off or to  low (Hinton division something).   Textures pop in and out and objects appear and disappear at random.Routes and assets still look bad nothing appears to be updated there, and ouch at the loading times.   I understand the appeal the game to some but sorry I can't get past the dated graphics and engine that has badly needed an update year after year but unfortunately did not get enough attention this time around and just like prior years a sub-par product was released again.This may be Trainz New Era but they certainly did not mean the current era.  4/10 and I hate that because I was hoping for something better.

												To echo others thoughts - this is hardly any different than the older version, just worse. Volume of sound is totally inconsistant, routes take forever to load. The Drexel Sub Scenario - in cab view the engineers head is in the way of the camera!! I can't find a way out of DCC mode that most of the scenarios are in. At this point at least, Goat Simulator is a MUCH more entertaining and well polished game. I REALLY hope the this stuff is cleaned up for final release. At this point, I am going to have to go with a ""Do Not Recommend This Game"".			"

So I spent a lot of time fiddling with the very-limited graphics settings to achieve a mind-boggling 15fps without having to kill myself over low texture settings. I finally get a train moving, then bam, it f@$&ing crashes. Not happy, Jan. I think I'll go back to TRS04, it has the same assets anyway.  "

												The New Era doesn't exist. It didn't even exist in the beta I've bought, but I've let that pass since, well, it was beta. But they didn't even reach their goal at release! Optimization is horrible, while I'm able to play GTAV on Ultra 60FPS but I can get T:ANE only on High ~37FPS? Much seems recycled back from Trainz2004, 2008 and 2012. I only see Trainz2012 under a new skin and asking for another 37€, which is outragous if I may add, if a game that didn't even finish its goal in about 2 years and has been tested by the public for 1 whole year, it should be 10-15€, not 37€! I could just as well get TS2015 and maybe Cologne-Dusseldorf with the ICE 3 aswell and have more fun and having actual  amazing graphics which is promised for less of a price than T:ANE which uses recycled models back from 2004. Pictures don't match, where you see shadow in the picture, it doesn't exist in the game. See amazing graphics? Doesn't exist. See awesome routes? Only available in the Deluxe edition so give them 70€! If you're really a hardcore fan of Trainz, go ahead, buy the game, I won't stop you, but if you're looking for a fun but at the same time serious train simulator, go and get TS2015.			"

												Absolute junk. Even for a Beta. Just paid twenty four quid for A TUTORIAL (you don't get any of the routes in the description). Takes 5-8 minutes to load the engine. No widescreen, lowest frame rate I've ever experienced. Engine is beyond words. Looks and feels like it was coded by a bunch of GCSE students for their first coursework assignment in 1998. Don't fall for the screenshots. Don't make the same mistake I did - stick with Train Simulator and AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I hate myself right now. I'm off to take a shower to try and cleanse myself from what I've just witnessed. This might be the last time I ever buy a game from Steam again.			"

												Well I'm not sure what the devs thought they were making, but a good train sim doesn't appear to have been in mind. I don't know where to start with how cr*p this is, it feels like you're playing with a train set with an onboard camera rather than driving a real train, the train control is just wrong.  They seem to be very proud of their graphics but imho Train Simulator is way better & at least in that title the cab interiors are reasonably HD & realistic, these are just pants. I have a new system with 32GB ram & a GTX980 card & I still need to dial down the quality to well below that of Train Simulator to get a reasonable frame rate. Maybe I've missed something (the menus are weird & take you into multiple windows, they seem proud of this too for some reason??) but playing scenarios seems like an afterthought as well, I couldn't find anymore than 4 & after getting a UK passenger one started it just felt so wrong as a driving experience I gave up. Hopefully work will continue & in a year or so they will have something to be rightfully proud of, at the moment though it is just a Toy Trainz-Set simulator so I'll go back to their competition.

												This game is just Trainz 2012 copy and pasted! I dont see any change in graphics or realism WHATSOEVER even at max settings... Not to mention its completely unoptimised meaning that my monster rig with a titan can only push out a max 9 FPS... its unplayable. And in 2 months... There is no posibility of it becoming like it was in the trailer.And do you want to know whats the most bull****iest? EVERY ROUTE NEEDS TO BE PAID FOR. (Appart from 1 track) Meaning that you need to create your own route to play or try the free route which is laggy as f***. (For some reason) And that route was just a copy and paste of the one used in TZ 2012. There is also NO Collection option... Meaning that you cannot view the trains which are in the game. Instead, youve got to use the small window inside the route creator to place the train and have a look at it. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS GAME SO FAR...? probably the bare multiplayer, but i havent even tried to see if its even there...Ive recently brought Train simulator 2015... And it smashes this game into the ground.EDIT: Some features may have changed... But i cant be bothed to even go on this game again.			"

Or B they at least update the cab model they use for it to look in place but they are still using the same cab model from Trainz 2004 or possibly older its hard to tell but by no means is it good looking so for now unless they do alot to impress me i still dont reccomend this game to anyone			"

												Support for this product is limited at best.  You are on your own to find answers to common glitches and problems.With that said, N3V does appear to be addressing some of the more glaring stability issues with one service patch already released less than a month after launch.To those familiar with Auran/N3V's trains simulator series (Tainz, TS04 to TS12) stick with your current products until the bugs are ironed out.To those unfamiliar with the above mentioned games, I recommend looking for Trains Simulator 2012 for the time being, you'll have more content, more stability, and more fun.Simply put: ""Trainz A New Era"" hasn't started it's era quite yet.

												Supported this sim with the kickstarter and have not regretted it one bit.   Have seen a lot of changes (for the better) during the beta time to retail release. Some of these are the  amount of bugs and other quirkiness that have been fixed. eg. the database hanging and not finishing the repair, numerous random crashes, graphic glitches etc.  Settings should be set realisticly for the pc that is used.  As with any game, each one is different and what one game will run on low/normal/high/ultra does not mean the other  will as well as no game is identical. The sim will make the pc work, but a lot depends how much content is in a map, the pc's hardware, good air flow and how well maintained the computer is and of course the users expectations.The surveyor is where Trainz really shines if you are an established  route builder or just starting out.  This is where I spend most of my time.  My work in progress route that has been moved from Trainz12 to T:ANE now blows me away as to how good it looks (in my eyes anyway).  Even just by altering the time of day and then watching the shadows move as time goes by is wonderful.  The reflections of trees on the loco and carriages as it passes by is very eye catching. Oh and there is sway with carriages and loco - very cool.Pros:  Excellent surveyor (editor) tools which make creating your route vey easy.           Can be manually optimised for using hdr, bloom, depth of field and other goodies which          can make a route look very realistic.          Compatible with majority of content from previous trainz versions.          Thousands of free content on the download station,  A First class ticket will enable faster downloading and no                                         restriction on amount of downloads.            Shadows are great.  Can see object shapes on the ground, reflections of clouds/vegetation in the water, etc.          Has backward compatibility with previous trainz content.          Devs are working on patches and seem to be very passionate about the sim and sorting things out.          More goodies to come in the future - weather elements (thunder lightning) is just one of them.Cons.  Still the odd ctd, but seems to happen mosttly (for me) in quickdrive when changing graphic settings while in this     mode - has  been bug reported.  Restrictions on altering  fog, ambience or water colour with inbuilt routes.  Would be nice if this feature was availableSome custom textures look overbright  (using the replacement tool will fix this easily).I will not say whether you should buy or not buy, but it does pay to look further a field than just focus on the negative.With the update patches T:ANE just keeps getting better and better.  :)			"

												**PLEASE READ**After the release of Trainz: A New Era the reviews were terrible simply because the game was terrible and still is. If you're thinking to yourself, ""why does it say mostly positive"" here's why: Before you're done with the tutorial they offer you a small free DLC for writing a review. It doesn't have to be a good review, but you do need to write a one. After you write the review and start playing you'll quickly figure out the game is terrible in almost all aspects. IMO I think most people end up leaving the game and don't come back to edit their review. I pre-ordered Trainz A New Era and I really gave it a chance and time before writing this review. If you want a Train sim, I'd go with Trainz Simulator 12 or Train Simulator 2017. I really don't think you'll be happy with this game.			"

												Now ive only played a few hours of the game but alas, i have to agree with all those who have reviewed the game already... It feels exactly the same, just with a gui update. For the money i was expecting ALOT more from TANE. Half of the rolling stock is a direct copy from TS12 (whether or not more content will be included for the release date or not is not clear), same sounds, same same same same... I am HUGELY disappointed with this at its present stage as it is so well sold in their trailers.There are some HUGE leaps and bounds to be made before i would recommend to anyone, for the mean time, stick with TS12, there isnt much difference...

												First off, let me say this. You WILL NEED A POWERFUL COMPUTER TO RUN THIS. If you're running on a toaster laptop, don't buy this and write a review saying it sucks because it's a lag fest. That is your fault for not doing RESEARCH to learn what hardware is good for a game. Some people even say that the game runs terrible with a top quality machine, so caution is advised before purchasing the game.As my account would suggest, I am quite the train fan. So much as that I've been playing Trainz since I was a kid, all the way back in 2003 and 2004. I have also purchased most of the major releases up until Trainz: A new Era aswell. However, before you start screaming that I'm a ""Trainz fanboy,"" let me mention that I have in fact left the simulator for a while went to the competitor, Train Simulator aka Railworks. I stayed with the simulator for a while because of the improved graphics and physics but returned due to the horrid process of content creation. I heard about A New Era before and watched it while it was in development. I passed on the Kickstarter and decided to give it a go during the 2015 Christmas sale.For those of you who are new to Trainz, let me explain the basics of this simulator. The main features of Trainz are Driver and Surveyor. In Driver, you can drive trains and in surveyor, you can create routes, sessions among other things. The game also features a content manager that allows you to manage your content downloaded from the developer's server called the Download Station, or from third party websites through .cdp files.I for one have never played any of the sessions before, so I honestly cannot say how accurate the Train AI is. I personally just hop in with my models and screw around for a bit and close the game down. If you want to read about sessions, look at a different review.Those of you who know about Trainz and are wondering if this is a good purchase, let's find out.What does Trainz A New Era have that previous versions of Trainz do not have?The main difference right off the bat are the graphics. TANE has real-time shadows that help to lift the look of the simulator, with a bunch of post processing effects to help make it stand out from it's older brothers. These shadows look fantastic (mostly), but they come at a great cost, performance. Currently, I am using a GTX 690 with an i5-2500, and I am barely able to get 30 fps with all settings maxed out except for shadows. These shadows require ALOT of power, almost too much power in fact. If you want this game to run smoothly, do your research to get the best possible combination so the game will run great. Oh, and if you want 60 fps, make sure to set V-Sync to off in the Launcher to enable that. Otherwise, the ""half"" setting will cap the fps to 30.The post processing effects range from SSAO to HDR Tonemapping and give you lots of options to play around with. Personally, I can max out the post processing effects to Ultra and have no major performance issues. The effects look nice, but nothing compared to big AAA games such as The Witcher 3, GTA V, Fallout 4, etc.One feature that I must add is quite fantastic is the ability to add trains while in Driver. This is a feature you wouldn't think is that helpful, but it's a feature that you depend on.What about third party content Tomix?Well, this is where it is a mixed bag. Some content may work, while others may require lots of TLC to get running again. This is especially gruesome with content from a previous version of Trainz. You may be there for hours or days fixing content until everything works! Not optimal, but this is not necessarily the simulators fault. Many errors are the user's fault for not fixing in previous versions of the game. Don't understand what I mean? Let me explain.In Trainz, your content can either have an ERROR or a WARNING. ERRORs will not let the content work in a game, while WARNINGs will let the game run the content. Some WARNINGS that were once fine in previous versions turn into ERRORS in a later version. This is the case with lots of faulty content in TANE.Remember Content Creator Plus? Yeah, that's gone. As a content creator, this by far is one of the weakest spots of the simulator. Content creator plus saved many hours of painstakingly fixing syntax errors in notepad and had many of the tags you need to make content. How do you do this with TANE? ALL IN NOTEPAD AND THE WIKI. Seriously N3V, why did you remove this? This feature NEEDS to return, otherwise people like myself will have to run back to older versions to make content and then port to TANE.On the bright side, the new Content manager is quite nice. It's confusing at first, but there is a viewer that allows you to view the model as it would appear in the game, without even starting the game up! It is all around easier to see how the model will work in-game, and as a model maker, I adore this feature.At the time of this review, Service Pack 1 Hotfix 3 is the latest update. One can assume that more patches will come and make the simulator better and better. I honestly want this simulator to survive and be successful. Unfortunately, N3V need to follow through with more of the stuff that they promised.Moral of the story, it's the same old Trainz you're used to but with more extra frosting on it. It's your choice whether or not you think it's a good idea. I'd say wait for it to go on sale, or buy it from a third party website.Keep in mind, there is a bunch of features or bugs that need to be worked on. This is NOT a master piece, but then again, there seems to be no Train Simulator that has everything we all want. This simulator meets my needs, but it may not need yours. If any of you have further questions or want to make a comment on what I said, comment below.			"

SummaryA lot of wasted potential, but if it's available on sale (I bought it for -75%), it's definitely worth it. Don't even bother to purchase it at full price. It won't be as good as Train Simulator or Train Sim World, but has several strong elements that can make it interesting. Nevertheless I cannot fully recommend it - I will still play it, but would definitely never buy it for the standard price and I will not buy any DLCs as those seem overpriced too. As the week long deal ends in less than 24 hours and the review will be here after that, I don't want anyone to get a wrong impression about this game's price-to-quality ratio which is really poor. For more details, read the full review of what works and what doesn't below:Note that I only have it for a couple of days and I have no optimization problems. I don't know how it's been in the past but it seems all right now. What works1. A lot of different goods and great ability to customize what you're carrying. You can easily set up a route where you can take whatever you want - coal (and A LOT OF different variations of it), cattle, general goods, fruit, vegetables, fertilizers, cement, cars, almost anything you want, and you can even customize how much to take. There are also industries that produce goods or need them which is a very nice touch.2. Making routes and different sessions is insanely easy and offers a lot of customization. 3. Routes available for the base price are really nice - you get Australian route from the 1910s - I don't recally any TS route from this period which is a shame, a 1950s American one which is great too, and probably the best one - 1970s British route that covers the ENTIRE route from London to Edinburgh - almost 400 miles. I don't think there's any route for TS that even compares to that. Those tend to be a lot too short unfortunately. 4. There are a lot of great routes and assets available online and there is no problem with dependencies - download center checks what you'll need and downloads it. But at the same time, don't expect top notch quality - many of them are pretty dated. What I liked the most are old routes that Train Simulator lacks - England, France and Silesia from the 1930s and 1940s wartime Germany. 5. Performance is really good and there are three performance presets that you can change on the fly to find what works best for you. It worked pretty well for me.6. Free Internal Camera - it feels almost as if you're walking around the train like in Train Sim World. What doesn't work1. First class tickets. You will need one to download community made routes (otherwise downloading is capped at 10 kb/s, and most of the time around 9 kb/s) and it costs as much as $7.49 for 30 days or $26.99 for the whole year now. FOR SHAME!2. Graphics are way worse than TS ones and way way worse than Train Sim World. Even no moving passengers waiting for you at the station. Just static figures. Kinda breaks the immersion for me. 3. There are very few DLCs and those are worse than TS ones. 4. TS has a much better GUI. 5. It lacks quick drive feature of TS - you can't just set time, season, and weather and drive enjoying AI traffic and in the world that feels alive. You have to either set everything manually or download a session, and those are really hard to find. AI schedule for the London-Edinburgh route I downloaded failed to show up in the game's menu.6. One that was already mentioned a few times - asking price. Train Simulator 2017 is cheaper and at the same time much better than TANE. I'm sorry but this is the main reason why I cannot recommend this game. It's price-to-value ratio is poor to put it midly and DLCs are no different. 7. Steam train physics and handling are worse than TS's. And the last thing - does it feel like a new era?It's been a while since I played Trainz - Train Simulator and now, the Train Sim World, are so much better. After a few years, I don't feel like that's really different from the old Trainz. Sure, some things are better, but overall, it feels pretty much the same. It's quite stale and feels moving nowhere, and all that for a pretty hefty price. Train Simulator does it better and there's no real reason to change, except for a good discount. For about -75% it will be fun, otherwise it's a definite no-go.			"

												My first review of T:ANE gave it a thumbs down for the poor quality of the sim at launch-- stuttering, graphics issues, not matching what was shown in the kickstarter videos and with graphics comparable to Railworks 2 (c. 2009).  Since that time, N3V have been promising a decent patch in Hotfix 2 and from my perspective they have delivered-- the sim plays without stuttering, slideshow, or CTD'ing on my curently mid-range machine (geforce 760, 16G ram, I7).  Graphics look somewhat better since lighting and shadows don't seem to cause the same problems they did before although they are  still far from what was shown on kickstarter (again more likely because my machine is not top-end).I'm not all about graphics as I run a railway simulator called Run 8 and love it-- the graphics are okay but not the main feature of that simulation-- I am more of an operations simmer so if ops/activities function without causing distress and I can lose myself in that for a few hours then the sim is worthwhile.  In Hotfixed 2 T:ANE I can run activities, such as loading and unloading coal without a slideshow happening which is pleasing and bodes well for more ingame hours.I will recommend this because N3V is still fixing it and it is running way better than at launch.  I will add though that YMMV (your mileage may vary) with results better or worse than mine.			"

												Now, I have played Trainz since about 2005, so this review may be a bit biased. If you have ever dreamed of building and operating your own model railroad, but never had the time or money? If so, this is the game for you. With controls which are easy to learn, and an actual driving mode that simulates how a model train is operated, anyone can quickly master this game. Heck, I built my first route, albeit a bit unrealistic, at the age of 11 back in good old Trainz 2006! If something like Dovetail's sim seems too much, this is a perfect choice. If you are looking for hardcore realisim, however, I would stay away from this one. This is more of a model railroad sim than an actual train sim, but prototypical operations are possible as well.Also, if you are worried about content, there is trainloads *hehe* of third party content on the DLS and other websites. Third party content is easy to install, and 98% of the time does not involve messing with the game files. Actually, I've never had to!TL;DR Easy to learn model train sim with loads of third party content avalible.			"

												Update 7.5.2015... Wait until they update more until buying.  They just emailed me they pushed a couple more trains for kickstarter county out but should have been pushing performance and quality fixes instead.  Concentrate on fixing the problems then push out your DLCs. Even with new video card the fps is close to same as below.  Also Steam buyers are the last to get patches and last to hear about things unless you goto their site.  If you sell on steam you should support equally on steam.Better graphics then TS12 ,  the routes are pretty good.   But  still has the performance problems from before launch ( with most settings on low like , 3k view distance, low shadows, 2048 res shadows,  post process crap off,  trees low and also medium,  LOD levels are crap(to short/low) can see textures snapping in about 1-2 inches infront of engine Even with texture streaming on,  visuals arent the same as what they have shown when they started asking for money and in current pic of engine with the rust and effects on it,  starting with CE1.2 they added some sort of fog and i cant get rid of it ( no settings for it even in post process).Kickstarter co is the only map with these settings i get 50-60fps, all others are from 10-35fps.The gui is still the same as the older sims just with a different color and a different icon, pretty sure it was suppose to be a hyped up big change just like all the other aspects of the sim.Save your money and buy a different sim, its past the weekend for them and we havent heard from them about the FCT or about the performance problems and how they are going to correct.The state of this ""sim"" isnt ""release"" ready.  Heck a lot of ppl like me dont even have the First Class Ticket yet that was suppose to be added also on launch day.  ""Their working on it"" said 2 days ago.Computer specs i7 5820k 4 ghz,  16gb 2666mhz ram,  gtx980ti 1445mhz 3700mhz ram, samsung 840pro ssd install and cache.  asus vg248qe 24"" 144hz monitor.

												     When I get in the mood to throw my money away, I prefer to do it at a gentlemen's club because at least I get to see some skin for my time and trouble. Having thrown your money away when you were actually expecting something tangible in return is the height of aggravation. If this is a new era, I'm glad I wasn't around for the old one.      Considering what is on screen at any given moment, the game is poorly optimized. Even after the service pack, which boasts big improvements, it plays at 30 FPS with a 980Ti. The track and ballast doesn't even sit down on the terrain in many places creating a shadow under the track that makes it look really phoney. There was only 1 route included that interested me, and zero locomotives that interested me. I also found out that the areas that were as beautiful and nicely detailed as the promo shots were few and far between. Most of the map I eventually played looked like an unfinished layout at a model train show in rural Kansas. The interface is subpar, the camera controls are horrible, the physics are unrealistic, and both versions of the train controls gave no sense of actually driving a real train. If I had been introduced to this game with no prior knowledge and was told it was aimed at small children, I would have advised the developers to step it up a notch. (No pun intended)     My visit to the Trainz Portal and the acquisition of some of the highly touted ""free"" community content was also as pleasurable as a trip to the dentist. Navigation from the game to the portal is clumsy and the portal itself is even clumsier. After the fairly laborious process of actually finding something I wanted to download, I began to wait for the data transfer at a whopping 5K. Yes, 5K. 1/3 of the speed of a dial-up modem from 20 years ago. I waited an hour and a half for a locomotive to download, only to find that key files were outdated, corrupt, incompatible, or removed by the user who uploaded them, and the locomotive would not work in-game. This happened several times in an attempt to assemble a small train to play around with. All told, I had blown 11 hours before really getting into the game. Those 11 hours were also logged as playtime because the game was open, so when I asked for a refund, Steam refused. Seriously, if you're going to offer me a handy from Evangeline Lilly, but in order to get it I have to get pounded in the tush by three ex-cons...I guess I'll have to pass.     This industry has really gotten out of hand. When you buy a kitchen gadget that sucks, you go get your money back. When you buy a power tool that's crap, you go get your money back. Why must we be forced to accept software that is crap? I'm pretty much done buying software I can't demo first. Tired of being a beta tester on post-released software. Do yourself a favor and get Train Simulator 2016 if you like trains. Despite it's many flaws, this game makes it look like a work of art.			"

												The game is actually quite good, even though it\'s a bit laggy on my computer, the game takes like 5 mins tops to load in maps and things, there is new DLS content coming out that works with the game, and I commonly see a mod for multiplayer in the map \'Kickstarter County\' that has improved things that even the developers didn\'t have working for the base game in quick drive, sessions, and even multiplayer. The bad reviews are mostly because of the recycled content and sounds in the game, and that the author\'s computer can\'t really handle the game well. I fully recommend this game for people who want to go right in, also, it has good tutorials that are not confusing, as where Trainz 12 had very confusing tutorials. The only thing I don\'t like is how the Kanawha doesn\'t use the whistle from the trailers, it uses the big boy whistle from previous titles. Most whistles and bells are recycled even for the new content in this game.			"

												I gave the previous version of this game a big thumbs-down. However, Version 1.2 is a huge improvement, so it is only fair that I update this review to reflect that. Whereas I could not recommend Version 1.1, I can recommend Version 1.2. The maddening bug where your train got ""hijacked"" has been resolved, or at least I never encountered it playing several different sessions, including the ones where I encountered the problem before.One issue that you do have to look out for is very slow and choppy performance when shadows are turned on. However, when you disable shadows, the game performs extremely well, although sometimes the cab view cuts in and out, which is rather disconcerting. Still, the overall performance of the game and general gameplay have improved massively on the previous version.Overall, I still don't like this game as much as Train Simulator 2015, which for me has better graphics and performance, and also more user-friendly controls. But whereas the problems with Version 1.1 made it unplayable, the improvements made to Version 1.2 mean that it is definitely worth trying out.Bear in mind that the game is still in beta mode, but with the full version due to be released in about the middle of this month, that's another good reason to buy it now and then get the update to the full game.

												So I finally decided to give this game a chance, hoping that it'd be a better expereince than Train Simulator.... I am by far not impressed in the slightest. For someone who is new to the world of Trainz the entire setup to this game is terribly confusing, as well as misleading. How you may ask? Well those photos you see on this product's page ARE NOT in the game. Yes I saw it said that downloadable content was in the photos, but I can't even find where to get said DLC. One photo I refer to is the photo of th LIRR engine's pulling a freight. The route and rolling stock are not in the game, and when I look at the store they are nowhere to be found. If anyone can tell me where to find these specific items that'd help a lot. The game only comes with 4 routes and is incredibly hard to navigate through. The graphics in this game look like they just enhanced the mobile version's to fit the PC, the controls to the engines are also rather cumbersome in DCC, something they really don't need to be. Now I only spent $15 on this game because of the saleand I feel pretty ripped off, God only knows what i'd be feeling if i paid the full $40. I would really like a refund anhd DO NOT recvcommend this game to anyone until they make it absolutely clear on WHAT exactly you are paying for. Waste of my money, waste of time, waste of hope. I don't want to bash the developers so much as they probably worked extremely hard on this game as really all I ask is for a more clear and easy system that doesn't confuse people, and if a promo photo does contain DLC tell us where exactly where to FIND that DLC.

												I'm on an older Dell Inspiron laptop:Intel Core @2.40 Hz8 Gigs of RAMWin 8.1I don't have a lot of time in with TANE, but here's some early thoughts. Trainz 12 played ok, but was laggy (I'd get a screen freeze for a few seconds every few minutes.) Trainz 2016 (TANE) is 100 percent better. No lags at all. And it switches views quickly, including coming in and out of the map. The physics engine (how the trains react) just feels better too. There are new navigation aids that keep you from being surprised by a station stop when you don't know the route very well. And with the sliders in the default positions the scenery is much better than the previous version and gone seems to be those funny looking wiggling trees. However, now and again when moving the view around with the mouse I'll get a few trees and such popping up out of nowhere, but again not as much, or as bad, as with T-12.You could easily go broke buying DLC for this sim but there's more than enough right out of the box to keep you busy. And although I haven't tried it much the route builder (Surveyor) works better according to what I've read. One thing that's gone from the previous T-12 (at least for me) is when looking ahead there's a point (like a horizontal line) where the track's wooden ties are rendered but passed that line they aren't. And I found that really annoying. But that's gone now in TANE. One thing about sims like this is you have to be really into the subject matter to get the most out of it. I can't tell you how much time and money I've put into flight simming over the last 30 years or so and I know I'll never get that deep with TANE, or any train sim, but it has that kind of depth if you go that route. I would have liked to see a way to “free move” around the engine cabs like you can in most flight sims, and I think I've heard of a mod for that but haven't taken the time to look into it. However, I've read in the TANE manual there's a way to customize the various view points so that's somewhat of a  improvement. The passengers on the platforms are still the same lifeless souls (that could have certainly used some improvement.) And while some down-board say there's no new sounds I'm pretty sure I've heard a few new engine and track noises right off the bat.IMHO, If you put a lot of time into Trainz-12 even with all the lags and flaws you deserve to get TANE!

												When I first saw this game on greenlight, I was extremely exited. However, this game is not what it promises to be. The title ""a new era"" is misleading, as the dovetail simulator has better graphics and gameplay. The price is also misleading. Now, I understand that this is a small company, and needs to generate enough money to survive, but this game is worth a lot less (in my mind) than I paid. To list an overview:. UI is user freindly. MOST of promised content is available. physics is as promised. gameplay is as expectedSpecific Pros:. Large sound library. Coustom and realistic physics engin. Interesting routes and content. powerful route builderSpecific cons. Bugs  . session UI sometimes fails to fully load  . spawning of incomplete consists  . missing textures/assets. Crashes. Not all of promised content is included  . test tracks not included. Relatively low amount of content. Graphics quality is okay, but could be better. Interiors on most trains are very poorly madeAlthough this game is not what one would call the company's greatest acheivment, they have done better. Including more content, the same to higher graphics, and fewer bugs, Trainz Simulator 12 is the better alternative. I highly suggest that game over this one. (you will not see ie in my library, as I got it befor I had steam)Please keep in mind that I am not trying to offend the developers in any way. If any of you dissagree with me or think I could do better, please let me know for future reviews.			"

												More like slightly new era. overall it's really nice very appealing but compare it to the previous and with my personal favourite the Trainz 2009 it kinda lack the excitement.i've played the trainz series since it's like trainz 2004 and  i've seen that on every new game, the builtin content is getting reduced and reduced i mean look at again Trainz 2009 and 2004 from canada,britain,europe,australia,and the USA with lots of routes and contents to explore. my point is please don't reduce the builtin content just to sell some DLCs. Dont be like dovetail with their $3000 worth of DLCs. The main thing i love about trainz is the content, the community and the modesty yet very fun to play so my verdict 8/10 there are still room for improvement. one more thing, the old content manager is better.

												If you just want to drive trains, and are looking for the train sim with the better graphics and presentation, I suggest Train Simulator 2016 over this. Still here? Ok.If you want to dig deeper into a more hardcore railroad sim, are a model railroad enthusiast, want much more free content than what you can get in TS 2016, or want to do more than just drive trains I suggest this simulator. TANE, IMO has the best route editor and content creation tools of any other railroad simulation software. There is no debate or contest, it is the best in that respect. Period.The community is more involved with the actual development and design direction of Trainz than any other railroad simulator. The developers are much more engaged with and respond to the community much more than say Dovetail (the makers of TS). The Download Station has a vast amount of content that is free of charge and can be downloaded by anyone who owns the sim and has a free account from their (Auran's) website. If all this sounds like your cup of tea, then I highly recommend TANE to you, especially after the service pack 1 update. The sim has come a long way since it's release last year, and it is much more optimized than it was then. If you have been sitting on the fence since release, I can with confidence say that it's a great time to jump into Trainz. So come on! What are ya waiting for? All aboard!			"

It's full of glitches and problems that the older games never had. Content not loading for reasons that don't effect the exact same content in older versions of the game. The game even refused to load at times! Certain built-in content even causes the game to crash. It doesn't run well and I have a gtx 1060 6gb, an AMD 8350, and 8gb of ram, and I'm runing 1080p.This game is just bad, the worst version by far.			"

												I love Trainz. It was my first Train Simulator. I played ""trainz"" even before I discovered (MSTS) Micorsoft Train Simulator. I had such a great time with it up until around Trainz 2009/2010. They were good games but not optimized, glitchy and overall just a pain from just running it to 3rd party content installation. Ts12 had amazing content (thanks to Jointed Rail) but a very old engine so it was even more of a mess. Now with T:ANE I thought my dreams would come true and the engine would be reworked so it would look and play like a modern gen game. Wrong. T:ANE is just as bad as 12, dosent even look that great and its just a huge let down. I though id be taken back to the glory days of 2006 with all that amazing content and pretty decent preformace but now its just too much. I think Trainz is going to die soon, its sad but true, its on its way out. Dovetails games ( previosuly RSC ) Railworks - Train Simulator 20 (whatever one there on now) runs better than this, and even that game has it fair share of issues. Enoughs enough. I used to love MSTS and Trainz and despise Railworks due to its lack of 3rd party content and poor preformace but now Trainz has fallen a rung under, and Railworks had risen above by slowly improving the game engine and providing decent products (albiet high prices). As far as the best sims now? Open Rails. A reboot of MSTS/Micorsoft Train Simulator that has everything that T ANE promises with the silkly smooth frame rate (I can average around 200 FPS) and taking advantage of the biggest library of virtual train content that was created for MSTS. FREE with a pre installed MSTS. Yes thats right, free. What are you waiting for?  http://openrails.org/Train Simulator/Railworks. Graphicly the Most stunning train sim on the market with pretty decent realism and decent (depending on the route) preformance. Addons are expensive but most are very impressive and are worth it. However it still has bugs and no 3rd party content support. http://www.railsimulator.com/The entire Trainz series from the 1st tilte to Trainz Railroad Simulator 2010. Can't go wrong with these versions of Trainz. Might not have the graphics and realism that some sims have but has the best route editor of any Train Sim, pretty large content selection and its certianly a unique experince. Liked the Trainz Jointed Rail content but hated how it preformed bc of Trainz? Jointed Rail is producing a new sim that runs on the Unreal 4 engine. Amazing stuff, check it out.  http://crosstiestudios.com/ "

												Consider this a first impression, from someone who has easily spent well over 2000 hours in previous versions of the Trainz franchise (all the way back to 2004).The usual load times seem to be getting longer and longer.  With my previous version of Train I had the default content, plus about 20 custome routes and about 10,000 extra DLC items I had downloaded using a first class ticket a while back.  I enjoy making my own routes, and so I had a lot of scenery items from which to play with.  Yeah, back then all that extra content sure loaded down the start up of the game.  But I understood it, as there was a lot of content.  Loading up this new version, I thought for sure there would be a lot of content to play with.  Sadly, however, the pickings seemed very slim once I did get in and see what I had available to me.  So imagine if I imported all my old content, it would probably take 3 hours to load :)So I load up the sessions, and notice that now you have to pay to access some sessions.   $39.99?   Really are they fooling anyone by deducting that one cent?   $40 for a single play session?  WTF.   I would say about half of the sessions that come with the stock routes, you now have to pay extra for.  Here is a question...   If I published a route, could I set a price for sessions too?  And will I get that money as the route publisher?  I somehow doubt it, but damn...  That would be nice.Anyhow, I loaded up the editor.  I have spent most of my time in the editor, so I can usually throw together something fairly quick.  And alas, nothing has really changed that I noticed throwing together a quick route to test some trains on, in the editor.  I saw that they has a FEC GP9 locomotive.  Oh sweet....   I love GP9's   I have been waiting for an official highly detailed GP9 model.   So I plopped that down on the track.   The outside skin was indeed very sweet.  So I ran the session, and went to drive the GP9 around...I get into the cab view of the GP9 and...  I can't believe what I am seeing.   No detail at all.  This looks like the stock SD40 interior from 2004.  Nothing has changed!   Seriously?    Very unhappy about this.Luckily I have been working on a physical real world model railroad, in order to get my train fix as of late.  If I had to rely on Trainz much longer, I imagine I would develop a real bad taste for train simulations.			"

												I would recommend T:ANE for train sim fans but with a few caveats. I probably have had more enjoyment with this version of Trainz than I have had with previous versions, partly because I am semi-retired now and have had  more time with it. I have seen steady improvement in the sim from the early betas through HotFix 1 and 2 (beta) and expect it will continue to get better.That's not to say that the game has been without its problems. Along the way I have upgraded my video card to an NVidia 750. which made a big difference in frame rates and the level of detail I can use. Shadows remain problematic. On some routes, I can use them; on others shadows really bog down performance.Finding T:ANE compatible content can be a problem. I spent a lot of time floundering about on the Download Station until I discovered the freeware routes uploaded by Bob, msgsapper. His routes and sessions all work well in T:ANE and are all available on the Download Station. Since I don't have the ability to create my own routes or rolling stock, I'm looking forward to more T:ANE payware and freeware that take advantage of T:ANE's advanced graphics. Overall, if you love trains and have the time and patience to work through T:ANE's quirk, I think the average user can have a lot of fun.			"

												I am a huge trains fan. I used to illegally play Trainz 12, but now decided I'd fork over the money and buy Trainz: A New Era instead. I wish I hadn't; I've been had.Buy Trainz 2012 instead, for LESS money you will get MORE rails types, MORE scenery, MORE locos, MORE rolling stock. The base game is more value on all accounts, without the download station. With the download station even more... Do you know how many locos there are for this specific version on the downloads page of the creators? ONE. That's right, the extra, all new rolling stock and amazing graphics it promises comes down to ONE poorly built and textured locomotive. Oh yeah, and a whopping EIGHT pieces of rolling stock. Whee.Don't believe the BS about how 'everything looks better', aside from a bit of shadows these two games don't look any different from eachother. No, switches don't actually have visable, animated parts, they look the same as they did three years ago.If I could get part of my hard earned money back for a downgrade (read: upgrade) to the previous version of the game, I'd do it.DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy Trainz 2012 instead! Or better yet, just buy actual model trains. With all the paid for DLC, that will be cheaper too.			"

English Version 英文版本The Trainz: A New Era did not make me overjoyed,But let me down.Frist,The game for the Trainz Simulator 12 compatibility is very low,This is the most disappointing.Secondly, Poor optimization and poor UI design make me feel bad.But the game also has advantages.Better picture quality and camera control than Trainz 12.I am an old player as Trainz series.Not recommended to buy this new Trainz.All in All.I hope that N3V can improve the compatibility of TANE for Trainz 12Chinese Version 中文版本这款Trainz: A New Era并没有让我喜出望外，而且让我很失望，首先，这款游戏对前作Trainz Simulator 12的兼容性很低，这是最令我失望的，其次，这个游戏烂的离谱的优化和跟前作不一样的UI给我的体验很差，但是这款Trainz:A New Era画质和物理效果方面比前作好了很多，并且在视角的控制方面比前作舒服了很多，作为Trainz系列的老玩家，还是不推荐现在买这款新的Trainz。总而言之，希望N3V能提高Trainz:A New Era对前作Trainz Simulator 12的兼容性——尤其是对插件贴图通道的兼容！！！！！			"

												Now first I bought this game based on the brand name, then I read a ton of bad reviews after the fact... hmm - I really should check reviews first in general... :D Anyways... I get the game... and it does take forever to load ... but seems like its loading faster now - like it was one of those first time use delays or one of those delays you get when you change your resolution for textures or something. Ok - phew -loading not fast - but not worth complaining about. Ok... hmm major chugging.. ut oh - the reviews were right?!? Darn - I was hoping not... wait - hmm.. a little tinkering - AH - ok - cranked up graphics to full, lowered the rendering distance to its lowest I'm happy! AND I NOW KNOW that this game will still look awesome with my current PC and perhaps the next two game machines I buy! Yeah I think they gave us more than we are usually even expected to be able to use. So let's quickly complain that we have more software than our hardware can handle... with the safe guard that you can tweak it and make it run just fine. Have I seen any sluggish bits? Yup. The menu System seems to chug the game - yeah - a little - but - I don't mind - it's usually pretty smooth... depends on the views - definitely is directly proportionate to your current view's number of polygons (models, trees, trains etc) ... but yeah the menu seems to do that regardless of view - but its not all the time and not bad ... really - for what I'm seeing so far - I couldn't care less.People say the lighting system isn't all that, it was professed to be awesome and it's not different than TrainZ 2012 or whatever - um - I think it looks great. I'm a developer and 3D guy too - and I think people want the darn holodeck for crying out loud...so do I but I don't expect that for forty bucks :D So.... Lighting? Looks great to me. Graphics? look great to me!Game Play: So far so goodAbility to do simulator or treat this as a model railroad? Yup! Does that. (But I don't think it does electricity circuits and remote control engines...like really simulating making an actual model train layout but then I haven't played this long enough to say that but I haven't seen any hints that might lead in that direction yet either. Rule The Rail - Old - DirectX9 thing does that and is awesome! 3600+ free user addons too haha - Side note! ) But yeah this looks awesome! My Rule the Rail game doesn't nor is it intended to compete with these graphics.I think this game has an open platofrm, you can complain about DLC or just give them a message: Buy if you think its worth it, don't if you do not...simple!) There will be tons of community stuff coming, and there is probably tons already. I think this game looks great! I have Train Sim 2015, its great - but I like the brighter colors and the basic direct x 9'eske brighter look - (I even love the marvel comic look of Rule the Rail but - fact is - if you like it then yay! I love it! I think it looks great.)Now so far I did find one thing in this program that is 100% stupid that my (still!) favorite railroad game to date ""Rule The Rail"" does perfectly - even over a decade ago! When the Turn Table turns... THE RAILS FREAKING DISCONNECT from the railroad ties and the turntable mechanism UNTIL the turn table turns enough to be say the amount for a rachet (wrench) click - then the rails snap into correct position... as the turntable keeps turning those rails stay stuck...until that same amount of turn ( a notch?) is reached then the rails snap into position there... I found that laughable HOWEVER....While I was laughing at the screwy turntable.... I sat under a tree that was hovering about 12 feet over the tracks in a certain bend on a hillside... whie contemplating these few things that seem out of place I figured: They don't know what the heck they are talking about! This game looks freaking great! I mean really - making this stuff run is harder than standing in front of a camera with makeup acting like you someone your not - yeah - making code like this purr is hard than making a movie! [in my subjective opinion... your results may vary] haha  - As a developer I know what goes into this and see this much work as the symphony it does - whatever quirks remain - darn - how about picking out the worst ones and see about getting them fixed in the next patch.I admit at first before I started tinkering with the graphics settings and stuff - I thought I had a lemon. When I saw how well the graphics looked with the stuff turned up and the viewdistance turned way down - looks awesome - and I kbnow if I want to go even smoother I can turn other things down.Already just using this game for a few hours I've seen more cool viewpoints, vistas, more working hardware on a train (swining chains, the hardware on the steam engine wheels looks awesome) the trucks on the rolling stock, the engine trucks on diesals - I really don't think you are getting ripped off getting this program.  I am convinved it will run for years perfect if Microsoft doesn't continually make their operating systems slower and continually drop support for stuff we all bought into just for them to take it away.... but again I digress.If you get this and hate it...and you read this review - sorry - I really think its awesome and for heaven's sake - some high-five the dam developers and the money handler who managed to get this thing out the door! Woo Hoo! New TOYS! I must go play now!Where is that stupid...um...ICON...Got IT! !!! TRAINZ !!!....LATER!!!!			"

												Some people say it doesn't have content. I have over 50 routes, no joking, and I haven't payed for them. And let me tell you, they are really better than the ones included in the main game. I also have a bunch of model layouts, from philskene and other, if someone interested. Over 1k locomotives. So yeah, this game has content, you just have to know where to search. I have stuff from france, Uk, US, DE, Japan, Belgium, Spain, Romanian, a lot more. The graphics for me are ok, depending on the content. The framerates it's true, you need a good computer to run properly. I run on a GTX GeForce 660, and 6 GB Ram (I know, not enough RAM), but I run really good (20-25fps) on normal settings and low shadows.RECOMENDATION: i really suggest to tick the option ""process objects behind camera"", and then the loading objects on the fly disappears. Also, enhance the PhysX simulation option and put the Draw between 2500 and 3500, depending the route. In respect the comparison that everyone says about Trainz and Train Simulator (Railworks). The important thing to understand it's not one or the other. I play both. I think Railworks it's better in quickdrive, going from point A to B, stopping at some stations. It's better on driving, and in graphics. And when I want freedom, to do whatever I want in my route, or i want to build, then I go for Trainz. It's depending on what I want in a precise moment. For example, I can wake up and say: man I want to do some operations in some model layout. Well then, I go for Trainz. Or I can think: I want just to drive and that's all, then I go for Railworks.I recommend TANE? Yes. The main problem that happened to TANE is that people thought it was a new era of train simulation. It's not a new era of Train Simulation, it's a new era of Trainz. And it is.			"

												Almost a great sim.  Not quite.  The ""almost great"" aspects:  serious train-buff attention to details of engines, cab controls, realistic railroad rules and signalling, grades, mass, inertia, acceleration etc.  Decent sized map to start with.  Excellent tutorial introduction.  Terrific sounds -- very convincing and immersive.  Reasonably challenging gameplay once you get into it.  I could definitely enjoy this game for many hours... BUT...The ""not quite"" aspects:  graphics are pretty crude/simple by modern standards.  In a gaming world where Dear Esther and Euro Truck Simulator are widely popular (and not super expensive), it's kind of hard to go back to old-school low-res, cartoonish landscapes and objects, bright sun shadows even when it's supposed to be overcast, rain falling inside railroad tunnels, engines that break down into weird isolated shapes if you zoom in too close.  Nevertheless, given the sim's other charms, this ""retro"" graphical quality could be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is extreme instability -- on OSX anyway.  I have not been able to play this game for more than 10-15 minutes without a hang or crash.  Another issue is inability to recover from an autosaved position;  if you restart after a crash and try to resume a tutorial (some of the tutorials take 10 or more minutes) you can't.  You have to start over from the beginning.  This gets frustrating fast, especially since the game won't run for long enough to complete the tutorial!  Given the lacklustre graphical quality it seems to be very hard on the gpu, too.  I can run ETS2 at Ultra without much jitter, but Trainz (with its primitive graphics) makes my gpu jitter even at medium settings.  Whatever they're doing is expensive and/or inefficient, but without any surface glitz to show for it.If the devs can get TANE to run reliably under OSX it will be worth playing if you like trains, even without improved graphics.  If they can get it stable under OSX *and* improve the cosmetics at least to, say, XPLANE 10 standards, they have an attractive sim even for people who aren't train buffs.  If they can get some pretty scenery packs to emulate real railroads (Canadian Rockies anyone?  California's Coast Starlight run?) then they may have a real winner.  Right now I would have to say mixed-to-negative review from me, mostly because of the extreme instability.  Feels like a beta release.			"

												I wish there was a button for: ""unless you seriously enjoy this genre, don't get it,"" because this is it. I've been playing the trainz series for around 8 years now, and this is below average in terms of quality and quantity. This game isn't that bad, but the game is priced $40 for four routes, and $80 for eight routes, so it is important to find out whether this game is for you. I reckon that only people that are either train-enthusiasts or simulator lovers like myself would enjoy this game, so stay away otherwise.Certainly, if you are actually buying the game, i recommend you do buy the deluxe edition. It is just not worth it to buy the one with only four routes, as you will have such limited game time.The pricing system for DLC is so strange. It's $35 for a brand new 100km Warwick to Wallangara route. It's $35 for a remake of the TS2010 Avery-Drexel route. It's $35 for Bideye Traction Railroad, a route that is so small, I think it probably took one person less than a day to complete it. Why are they all the same price for different amounts of quality and quantity? It is ludicrous!The locomotives are overpriced. $17 for a regular looking diesel locomotive nearly identical to those available in the base game. $9 for some passenger cars. $9 for some freight cars? Are you kidding? Don't get them.If they really wanted more people to buy the locomotives and stuff, then why couldn't they just utilize the bundle system and make it genuinely affordable to regular people. (i.e. buy 5 locos for $25 or something.)I once again want to stress that the game isn't bad, it is just not for everyone including the average gamer joe.			"

												They basiclly took TRS2006 and tried to polish it up with better graphics, while taking away most of the content. 4 routes and a few engines. Horribly optimized, like for crying out loud I was only getting 10FPS on a PC that can run Battlefied 1 on ultra settings with no problems. And I can see their going to take the Dovetail way of doing things and charge you an arm and a leg for the DLC. Video gameswere once sold complete..before the dark times..before paid DLC. The sound was horrible, like their still using♥♥♥♥♥♥from TRS2006 for ♥♥♥♥ sakes, UI is clunky and a little confusing to use (especially the camera modes while in a session) lol a new era?

												Why did I buy this game, the local content mainly (NZ, AUS etc), but there is international content too!Having played other games with similar performance, I am used to the FPS that this one delivers.Overall the game is still in need of polish, but has some potential and will appeal to some people.Graphics have improved considerably over the last Trainz game I owned (Trainz 2006), but the derailment physics are not there. Cab sway exists but it no where near the level of realism of that found in TS 20XX.One must also remember that trainz appears to be more of a model train simulator, rather than TS 20XX's lifelike sim feel.The DLS (speed limited to a horrendous 8 ish-kb/s, but with First Class Ticket, the speeds are unlimited)Has over 300,000 assets in total. Summary: This game is not as perfect and polished as TS 20XX, but will still appeal to some audiences. I have faith that N3V will be able to fix problems with this game and will deliver a decent game, eventually.			"

												Out of every game I've played, I have to say that this is the biggest let down I've ever played[/b]. I'm gonna go ahead and list the pros/cons to make this easy to read.Pros-User made content-Easy to make maps-Basic controls and arcade-y feel good for new players-Graphics are pretty good-Has a simple model railroad-esque feelingCons-User content isn't necessarily high quality-Some user made trains are split up into different components when you download it so it makes it confusing-DOWNLOAD RATES ARE 10 kB/s... unless you pay (starting at $10 per month)-Downloads for a single asset can take between 20 mins - 1 hr which is how I racked up my hours. I spent at most 2 hours playing the game-(For me) Downloads failed much of the time-Driving feels really heavy and awkward, even on relatively small trains-Braking is awkward as releasing train brakes on relatively small trains takes a long time, also braking intensity goes from a coasting feel to intense braking within a blink of an eye-UI is basic and not very helpful-Some recycled sounds date as far back as Trainz 2006-Game is too expensive for what it is-Routes are too small and sessions are too lengthy-Everything feels small and free fly camera is awkward as camera cannot face upwards-No extra train controls (no platform lights, step lights, ditch lights number lights, etc.)-Ditchlights not even available on developer made locomotives-You can't ""feel"" when a locomotive is about to lose traction-Routes are fairly smallAs you can see, the cons clearly outweigh the pros.tl dr;Only buy this game if you want to simulate model railroads, rather than simulate driving a train. If you want a good Train Simulator, just wait another 9-ish days for Train Simulator 2017 and get the Train Sim World Early Access Beta alongside it. It might cost a bit less, similar to this or a bit more, and will have more content. "

												Technically TANE is pretty good. I reckon that it is about as realistic a simulation of train driving as can be on a PC. It can even be fun if you can figure out some goal to achieve - otherwise you're just drivin' about aimlessly. Tutorials are excellent.Graphics aren't bad at all - just not optimized terribly well - but - getting better and way better than the earlier TRAINZ product.That said: the cost of each DLC (routes or engines) - most of which should be included in the basic price of the game - is the cost of most AA quality new games - $39.Want all the DLC - prepare your self to lay out $749 US dollars to get it. And there in lies the rub. For this product to have any real value (unless you want to spend the time and effort building your own routes or locomotives - very time consuming) you're gonna lay out a lot of money.The developers are overly proud of this very, very niche product! Sheldon (the autistic/Aspergers character from the Bing Bang TV show)  would probably like it.NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS ONE IS A TRAIN FANATIC .			"

												I'm gonna make this pretty short.Having owned Trainz 06 and 12, I can say that the game has been stripped back quite a bit (this is not in any way refrencing the DLC which is another matter altogether). There's a lot of things this ""game"" is possible with, but isn't even used in most of it's content (DLC included) despite being in the game since at least '06. The DLC is too insanely overpriced to the point that they're almost costing as much, if not more, than ACTUAL model trains. HOWEVER, this doesn't matter for the most part (only for game completists) because of the MASSIVE amount of easily downloadable FREE user-made content (that is usually better than the stock game content).Overall: Don't let the DLC prices fool you. This is actually a decent ""game"".			"

												*Note Steam hours are much less then I have played*So this reveiw is without taking in DLC, just the base game.Content lacking this has been becoming an issue since Trainz 2010 and for a loyal fan is a bit depressing. Now I do know there is tons of free content out there but for a base 'plug in and play' so to speak it lacks and while is not a put off for me others this can easily turn them away.DLC: Need I have to remind any of you that Trainz has a massive amount of free content OUTSIDE OF STEAM so ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the DLC at this point is dumb becuase have you even looked at Train Simulator 2017 or whatever it is now. Now granted I own quite a lot of DLC for this game simpily because I have the money and I wanted to, I feel people are burning it too much for it.The game itself after SP1 runs great and I really have no more issues with it as a game.

												A New Era or just Polish?There is a lot to be said for the improvements over TS2012, which despite throwing a GTX 970 and an 4th gen i7 at still had me on mid quality graphics with a lowly 2500m draw distance and still ran clunky. Now the ECML runs smooth at high quality with only a little jittering in some areas. I'm yet to try the other routes but a quick peek at Kickstarter County, plus the High graphics settings aren't so different from Ultra but with a slight FPS benefit :)Graphical improvements (well, same old on a new engine) aside, it looks like N3V (formerly Auran) have gone all Dovetail  with all stations to DLC which is a bit of an insult, not to mention the brief selection of rolling stock you get with the basic game - not even the big Santa Fe or Indian Pacific, let alone the TGV that were stock standard just 4 years ago. Seriously, guys, not cool :(Thankfully I look forward to the created content to beef up my rolling stock library, routes, sessions and sales to pick up some DLCs (I'm grabbing the massive Canadian one when it's on special), but don't expect me to fish out for particular rolling stock unless the sale price is worth it.As a long time (since TSR2004) fan, this meets my expectations for the sale price ($9.99 USD) and I have a good gaming rig that can handle this as well as things like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Fallout 4 with the pretties near the top.

												This is a bust. Game crashed during DLC download and subsequently refused to download any further. Tried to reset by clearing appdata folder, game now won't authorize, and trying to rebuild the database just sits on 'waiting for engine to start'. Two hours of stuffing around trying to get this to work properly, so requested refund before I am no longer eligible.			"

												Don't get this game.  You'll be VERY disappointed.  If you're use to any of the other Trainz  sims 10 or 12 you will kick yourself.  And if you do buy it, by the time you determine that it is a  piece of crap, Steam will stick it to you and you won't get your money back.  So if you have 39 bucks to throw away....go ahead!			"

												Yet another train sim that is NOT for newbies.  The guides are slightly better than TS2016 but not by much.  Do not buy this thinking you can learn the ropes easily. Also, be aware the hefty price tag is just for the initial game with a few routes.  Most of the routes you would want will cost you a lot more.This is strike 2 for me and train sims.  UGH.			"

												Well what can I say you look at steam and there are people saying this train simulator is better or that one is better. I took a chance on Trainz new Era because Auran stopped supporting my old classics download station etc. I would have to say I am not dissapointed as a casual gamer and train enthusiast I would say Trainz a new Era is awesome fun. I mean no game is gonna be perfect but this does what I want it to do and is quite relaxing.			"

												Any Game that advertises ANYTHING in its standard gameplay trailers and then makes you pay extra for it is rediculous.  The main video that plays when you reach the page, I'd wager 75% of that isnt in the basic game.  Those are add ons, each being half the main game price A PIECE.When I purchased the game, I got it on sale, like most Steam users would do, and I noticed that if I paid the ""Full Price"" during the sale, I would get a couple of the DLC items included!  So I did.  Game Loads.  On the bare bones, you get 4-5 routes, thats it.  I play the Healsville, Australia level first, because I personally like 1920s era stuff.  I don't care if it may have been a ""Community Addition"" to include the route and equipment, but to put it bluntly, its broken.  The engine they assign you to drive doesn't work half the time, the signals don't change untill you are within 20 feet, and the air compressors run at such a pitch, volume, and consistancy they drive you mad!!  To have something like this ship with the ""Default"" Game, the game that isnt even represented proplerly in its own videos, is wrong.  To top it all off, it is still the same PC hogging tank that it was before, so unless you have a live in your parents basement super computer, good luck having it look any better than previous versions.I had Trainz 2009 in Highschool.  Loved it to death, mustve put 100s of hours into it, untill I moved away and lost the disc.  To see it become this...SO TL:DR.  Looking for a train sim? Run.  Run Away.  Becuase unless all you want to do is build routes (Which was nailed down before with previous versions so that at least works), its not worth it.  PS: TBH, the shaking of the cars and engines while moving is a nice touch.  I will give it that.			"

												The graphics are good, would like to see more of a selection of routes and different railroads.  Operation of locomotives is realistic and is hard ot keep a locomotive at right speed with regular controls   Love to create my own layouts in the builder section and then run on them, just cant' t seem to have more than one loco operating, doesnt let you add any that will operate .  all in all am enjoying the game.

												-UPDATED REVIEW-Just hopped back on T:ANE again hoping the new SP1 pack maybe fixed most of my angry errors. I'm pretty much satisfied with the results SP1 has, and i'm ready to transfer my TS12 content onto T:ANE.Except for the fact once I start transferring, I might crash this computer due to the ginormous data files for TS12 (Hehe)I'd reccommend that if you enjoy this game alot, but it feels bare and boring to be stuck with the same content over and over, try out some DLC content that people create online and import into your T:ANE Content Manager.Who knows, you could re-create some amazing routes that exist today, or just play it nice and simple and create a roller coaster that eventually derails the train :P-OLD REVIEW-Overall, T:ANE is a huge step for me since I enjoy TS12 a lot. Here's the things I was unsatisfied when I played the game: Same boring hornsounds! Ok, some sounds good for certain locomotives but it's just the same exact ones from TS12 and below. I had a somewhat higher standards for better horn sounds and whistles. Content being removed every new game! The ATSF GP60B, and C-44 in 12 certainly surprised and awed me. Hoping to find the same in-game content, I could create a good route in T:ANE with these locomotives.. Sadly, not. Here are the Satisfactions: Texture, graphics and better performance. Better routes and certain updated specs. Lastly, we can transfer TS12 content to here since it supports it! I would say the overall review is a +50/-50 but it leans more to the good side about the graphics, routes, textures and so on. Now I'm waiting for those guys who make high quality locomotives, objects, and rolling stocks to start creating some for T:ANE >:3			"

												The graphics in new Trainz looks very well. If we go in postprocessing settings there we will see more advanced graphic options. With a proper combination of them the game will look much better than on trailer and screenshots. Just realistic.Now let's cry about bad things...Performace - I understand its a beta yet so I hope in final release it will be better optimized. For now, with my i5-4670K, GTX 760, 8GB ram and SSD I have something like slideshow instead of fluent game on higher settings. Hope that additional 8GB RAM will help a bit.Maps quality - landscapes - they are really beautiful, but if we look on details on map, then it isn't so sweet. Tracks are flying in air, turnouts are too sharp, sometimes distance between parallel tracks is too low, no grass around a track (it would make a bit more realism). Animated junctions - they are okay, but I hope this feature will be supported also in double switches.Trains - there are many vehicles, higher and lower quality, but there isn't command to turn off/turn on an engine (or maybe I'm wrong?).So I can recommend this game, because it already looks better than any Trainz series. It's got realy many advantages, that i didn't talk about. I hope some things that I listed above will be improved in the final release or updates.			"

												Sorry, I can't recommend this game at this stage. Train Simulator beats TANE hands down, no question. Engine cabs are very very basic and graphics engine is more toy-style, not going for realism. Game play and graphics engine is very laggy at best and far too much constant graphics refreshing, even on a high end machine. I don't know where the 1,000's of hours of Beta testing has gone, maybe on downloading the slow updates.			"

												Trainz offers so much to train fans that I really can’t call it simply a “game.”  It can be a full-fledged hobby if that’s what you’re interested in, and I am.Not only can you learn to drive realistically modeled rail vehicles on beautiful developer-created routes; additionally, choosing from a vast supply of built-in asset-content (and from a treasure-trove of free user-created downloadable content), you can design and literally build your own virtual 3D-world of colorful, seasonal, and environmental real-world sights and bring it all to life with railroad sound and motion. You can populate your world with interactive industries and task your rail creation to meet their needs.  As engineer, you can yourself perform these tasks, or you may build and set AI Trains to handle the job, or—with multiple trains running simultaneously—you can schedule both AI’s and personal tasking.  And, of course, with AI’s you can sit back and watch all the fun you’ve created in the world you’ve created. You can even become your own director and set cameras along the routes to capture the action from all angles.The more I experience Trainz, the more I see it’s incredible range and potential.  Driving detailed locomotives and rolling stock on working and lovingly created routes in simulation, learning all about railroad life and tasks is only the start. But it’s a great start that has obviously benefitted from it’s 15 years of evolution. When you watch the You Tube fan-based videos and tutorials of previous offerings and compare them with today’s T:ANE (“Trainz: A New Era”—the latest offering in that evolution), you can clearly see the continuous dedication involved.  As the graphics and computer capabilities have improved, Trainz has taken advantage of that by improving the game’s qualities of realism. I find that growth exciting and something to continue looking forward to.But Trainz is about more than a software developer’s product, their ongoing refinements, and your individual creativeness.  Indeed, it’s about a worldwide community of enthusiastic players and knowledgeable hobbyists who are online and only a button-click away. Whether you’re ruling the single-player rails or playing in multiplayer, push that chat-button and you can interact with others from all over who have discovered and are enjoying Trainz.  Also, from the help button, you have immediate access to n3v’s Internet Wiki.  From there you’ll find all kinds of developer-information and can ask questions from other hobby/game enthusiasts who can and do respond with valuable information to help you.  I have personally found the response to be really helpful, timely, and truly there from other train enthusiasts!There is so much to talk about.  If you think you’d like to rule the rails, become a Trainzer and watch a whole new world open up to you.Best Wishes,                       Froglegs "

I decided to try it and my Geforce 680 runs it great.  I'm excited to get a train for Christmas, just like when I was a kid.If you liked Trainz, or even have never tried it, it's a pretty cool program.  I love building my own layouts, I've even built my own rooling stock, (with Blender) and imported it.  It takes a bit of modeling to do but it can be done.The older versions of Trainz hic-cupped once in a while and froze.

This game is broken mess of♥♥♥♥♥♥more focused on old broken content then a New Era of gameplay.Do not buy in till its fixed. Even trains 2012 didn't run like this crap.I want my money back for a broken product.In its current state it shouldn't have been released as a full game. So I will count it as a Pre Release Alpha because it needs some updates and more improvements. They need to stop focusing solely on Nivida and I7 people and focus on the spectrum of other chipset bundles.This is what a New Era of graphics looks like http://images.akamai.steamuserconten...BE9CEDC6394FB/vs http://images.akamai.steamuserconten...E8C4E07877976/Now do you understand my complaint?

												If you've bought Trainz 12, have a grafics card from the past 2 years (Nividia 900 series/1000 Series) you should be good to buy TAN:EThe bigest learning curve is the new content management system, its works ok, but i still prefer the T2012 verstion of the content magager. my main issue is the removal of content creator plus. without it you have to go into config files and edit things like that. the great thing about the old content manager is that it was easy to use and understand. lets hope they find a new way to fix content without going into configs.The lighting in this game! 2012 and older had really bland lighing but here its like the devs have given it it a new setting...ultra mega awesome!basicly if you've got a good enough grafic card, previous experiance in Trainz then you'll like this new verstion of Trainz7.5/10			"

												Bought the game, bought the rails and each sleeper, bought the train, had to buy all the wheels individually, bought some daylight, bought the trees, had to buy the leaves separately, didn't have enough money left to buy audio or graphics, couldn't uninstall as had to pay to uninstall. Luckily, it's still free to review so getting in quick before they change that too just to cash in.If you want a mediocre sim with very limited content out of the box where it will make you feel depressed and used, like the world is just after your money (quite an accurate simulation of life then, I guess) then go for it. If you want an accurate simulation of buying a train set where you pay a crazy amount for a very basic set and then have to pay even more crazy amounts per item you want to add, then also go for it. If you want to play a game and have any kind of feel good factor afterwards, perhaps try somewhere else. Personally, I prefer a game where I can buy the game honestly, with everything up-front, and then play the game, not where I've got a marketing team trying to lure me into parting with ever more cash to have something basically functional. Up front, you're paying full price for considerably less than a full game. I bought it on sale and I still resent it. Very, very limited out of the box, and the graphics are dated - it's a small, second hand train set at best.			"

												I'm writing this review now because I've been promted I will recieve a free locomotive if I do. So far, it's good. There are some cons that I don't like, such as it won't run at my native resolution, perhaps because of my gpu (gtx 560ti). But it does look good, and on this card I'm able to put the settings on second to highest settings. Also I'm doing the tutorials now, and the controls is set up like it is on a model train. I'm hoping this can change later. But despite these, so far I'm having fun. I can't really compare it to Train Simulator 2016 just yet, I will need to put more hours into it.I'm giving this a positive review for now. So far the fun factor is outweighing the cons. I will update my review later after I sink my feet into the game more.EDIT:On the 5th or 6th tutorial (can't remember), I noticed the scenery had fog, rain, sun, and harsh shadows at the same time (really is that a joke?). After that I started to notice all the other graphic details, such as no rain drops on the windows, trees look like plastic figures, water has no damn reflection, no lights emmiting on the ground when I turn on the train lights, resolution on cars is like something from 2002, etc, etc. Then I started noticing how the game plays, it's slow, clunky, and controls are horrible. After, I tried the scenarios, still no improvement.I then exited the game, then tried Train Simulator 2016, Marias Pass, and wow! How beautiful and smooth Train Simulator 2016 is!So my conclusion, perhaps I was distracted by the fact I bought a new game thus I gave it a thumbs up, but after playing it further my experience got worse and worse. Avoid this game at all costs and get Train Simulator instead.			"

												Being unable to authorise the game I just can't recommend purchasing this title. This company can't get its goddam registration right and this has been going on for years. I purchased this AWHILE ago and just tried it expecting they'd have kinks worked out. Good work, arséhøles! You'll need a MyTrains account for this to wo—oh wait, it still won't work even after it successfully connects via the game client to the account—STILL CAN'T ""AUTHORISE.""			"

												What a piece of crap.  Any of you can say what you wish, But I've had all the other trainz and this one is crap.   I bought it installed it, then installed the Sp1 patch thats supposed to make things work better and everything went faulty.  After hours of messing with it I finnaly gave up, deleted the game and tried to get my money back.   Wouldnt you know that spending hours trying to make it work counted as gameplay so no refund.			"

												I have thought much whether to buy or not as I always felt something wrong in what N3V has been showing us since release. They tempted me by 50% discount during XMAS and I just could not resist...PROS: - quite potential E2 engine delivering nice fog and lighting- some railcar soundsCONS:- terribly empty worlds- inconsistency in assets, some interiors look like back in 1998- water in Drexel - ugly static texture???? - deluxe content in general... well, are you kidding me?- only two hours for trying prior to ask for refund on STEAMP.S. I really hope that SP1 or SP2 will upgrade this ""sim"" to sim or I will be very sorry for spending my money for T:ANE.			"

												As far as rail simulation goes, I have been involved since 2004. Fiddled with several, and mostly ran out of steam (pun intended) with them. Trainz is detailed, hardcore, full house. The community is great (read: mature) on the forums, and the content is phenominal, free and payware. It's not a game, it's a modelling and simulation system, so I have no idea why gamers and gimme-pigs are rating so low.Performance is a bit chunky, but TANE is a whole lot easier on resources than T12 was for me. I am maintaining a solid 30-60fps (environment depending) on mid-to-high level settings, which is OK for my GTX760, 16GB, 4790 system. Things are getting better however with every SP and update. If you want full scale gaming experience graphics and arcade fun with action, this is not for you. If you are a rail fan, train lover, railroad modeller (Prototype or not), then it is. "

A little disappointing. the details are pretty good but the game overall is confusing to navigate.

												Sorry, I can't recommend this game at this stage. Train Simulator beats TANE hands down, no question. Engine cabs are very very basic and graphics engine is more toy-style, not going for realism. Game play and graphics engine is very laggy at best and far too much constant graphics refreshing, even on a high end machine. I don't know where the 1,000's of hours of Beta testing has gone, maybe on downloading the slow updates.			"

												-One Year Review- As of today (4/24/16), it has been one year since I have purchaed T:ANE.Within this time, I have logged 550 hours + and still adding more. When I had gotten T:ANE, it was in the later state of the Beta builds, when I had gotten it, I find it was pretty well set up, but could use more, or minor tweaks here and there.I forget exactly how I had the money at the point, but at that time I was looking for a good train sim to get for myself, it was a toss up between TS2016 at $30 and T:ANE Deluxe Edition at $70. I'm glad I chose to get T:ANE.I have recently gotten a copy of TS2016, and I honestly feel a touch confused with it, to me it doesn't seem to be as user friendly as T:ANE. Maybe I need to do a bit more digging around on TS2016 to find out how it all works, it's editor is weird to me anyways, it doesn't have the nice tabs along the side of the screen for exactly what you want like T:ANE does, it won't let you place custom consists or make custom consists while in editor like T:ANE does.In my mind the only things TS2016 has going for it is graphics, steam workshop, and the amount of centralized DLC, which costs a fortune. T:ANE may not have a lot of routes, or locomotives, or content in general, but it has one of the biggest things any game can have, user friendliness.I have seen this game rise and fall with the updates to it, I honestly don't understand the hate towards T:ANE. Granted yes, there are a few things they could do to improve the game. I have seen them starting to centralize the DLC a bit more, give to the public what they want, and doing what they can to keep the game series alive.To sum it up in quick points of what I feel T:ANE is:Pros:- User Friendliness- Easy to understand route surveyor- Flexability in what you can do in the game- ""most"" models are pretty outstanding in detail and fleshed out (e.g. the SP SD45)- Staff are helpful- Tons of free stuff (300,000+) on Download Station- A test track to test the limitations of your locomotives and see a readout of performanceCons:- Some models need to be fleshed out a bit more (e.g Payware DLC TUME BN SD40-2)- Not a ton of base content- Needs more centralized DLC, easy to access.Suggestions:- Keep centralizing the DLC for ease of access.- A separate DLC tab on the main screen, rather than going into a route to check it out.- Put a Visit Test Track button on the launch window.- Remove 'Connot Edit' lock on DLC routes, We bought the route, I think we should be able to edit it.DLC Suggestions:- We need a Union Pacific Dash 9 44CW- We need Union Pacific's Moffat Tunnel Subdivision.*hint hint* ;) Overall review 8/10.Thank you for the work and keeping this series alive.-BT			"

												        The game lags a bit for me, even when it's the only program open (aside ""Steam"", of course); I'm not sure why it wants to lag.  Also, DLC content (such as the PRR T-1 ""Fleet Of Modernism"") that says it is compatible with T:ANE, and other add-ons I have, do not seem to want to install.  The ""Download Station"" as I remember it used to be called, now the ""Content Manager"" does not seem to want to recognize or install the DLC.  I do wish that the routes (when in multiplayer) would allow you to run more than only that region’s trains, and that when advertising the base game, they would not include the payware DLC in images of the base game:  you end up thinking that content is part of what you're buying, and to find it's not; and that you have to pay for that content being shown as part of the base game; it's a real let-down.  Other than that, it's a good game; a lot like the older versions: you have fun, you drive the trains, and all that jazz.  You learn to master every locomotive over time and can enjoy your railroading experience.  The multiplayer is a nice addition as well.        My biggest concerns, and my main concerns, are that A: DLC from earlier versions of the game that say they are compatible with T:ANE, do not seem to be so, B: not all of the content in the images is in the base/default game--videos can use DLC and add-ons, to show how you can expand, but the stills should be only default content, & C: the game lags on even the lowest settings (Steam and Trainz being the only open programs), whereas a game like ""Railworks"", and older versions of ""Trainz"", I am able to run on their highest settings, with multiple programs open at once.        Once these issues are fixed, I am sure this will be a great game for anyone.  I do miss the ""Railyard"", and ""Favorites"" menu/options, but those are just nice to have, but not needed.  I would recommend this game, definitely, with the warning that it does lag, not everything shown to be default-content is truly there, and not all the DLC that claims to be compatible, seems to be truly compatible.  “Buyer beware”--I suppose.  I must say again though, even through it's faults, I do like the game, and I do plan on keeping it, and using it; heck, if everything gets sorted out with this game someday, I might end up coming back to Trainz, from ""Railworks"".

												Aside from the fact that it keeps popping up asking me to rate it, it's a good solid game!The graphics are not up to the same level as Train Simulator 20XX, nor the Steam Screenshots for that matter (though my settings are sitting comfortably at whatever they default to), but the mechanics are fun to play with and it's certainly less buggy and more helpful (tutorial-wise) than TS, though the objective system doesn't feel as easy to use as TS...I'd recommend T:ANE to people who like trains. I'd recommend it to people who like simulators. I'd especially recommend it to people who like both... Plus it supports multiplayer so you can share the joy of driving trains with your friends, and you can download community content that isn't just re-hashing of existing paid content *cough TS cough* and the series has had a thriving community producing such content including new trains, new maps, new scenarios!

I payed $37 for the Deluxe version which was on sale, and waited 3 hours  to play it. Once I got it, It lagged very bad. I'm on a basic laptop but I had a PC too. The game wouldn't even start. It just told me render failed and that I needed a better computer. Honestly don't let 79% positive fool you. You have to have a high performance computer. Even with graphics on low. The only non laggy view I had was cab view in the C&O route. Even surveyor lagged. That was a shock. I have TS2009 and TS2012 and both of those have more in depth graphics, neither lag.			"

												The BETA Hotfix (Build 78248) has made significant improvments to performance and has resolved game crashes for me. If you've written off TANE, check the steam discussions for how to patch the BETA Hotfix (or wait for it to go live) and try the game again. That being said, if you're on old hardware or using Intel Integrated Graphics don't expect much it's time to upgrade your hardware.			"

												I highly recommend this program for anyone interested in building train layouts or just driving trains. It is your choice. I have been with this franchise from the very beginning. It is my favorite PC software. I have spent countless number of hours over the years. This is the only trains software where you can easily create and build your own layouts. The developers have done a brilliant job in cfreating a most enjoyable product. The graphics are quite decent as well as the player control. The sounds of all the locos are authentic. This franchise has constantly made improvements since the very beginning. There are millions of users of this program from all over the world. You can create your own content and then upload it to share with others in the trainz community. If you have any interest in being able to drive various locos and create your own layouts or download real routes from around the world, then you owe it to yourself to own the best train frfanchise in the world.

												I've used trainz before (UTC). but this version is a great improvement. The graphics on my laptop (windows 10) are fine despite not having the correct GPU.  The software will not run on my PC (also windows 10). I have debugged this problem and it is not caused by the Trainz software. My PC is Intel i5 using a Graphics 2000 driver, which cannot be upgraded for windows 10. So I have to wait to use it on a bug screen till I next upgrade my PC. Disappointing, but at least its OK on the laptop. Everything else has been fantastic!			"

												Update:since my first review, I have upgraded my video card to a single EVGA Nvidia GTX Titan X super clocked GPU and now I get decent FPS with all settings on High or Ultra.Note that I updated the video drivers and did a complete fresh reinstallation of the latest from the manufactures website.  I wanted to make sure there were no bugs from my original GPU drivers, so a fresh install was performed.  It is an option when performing a custom install.The first few times I ran this with the new video card caused the system to load the game slow enough to make me think the computer had locked up, and I prematurely used Task Manage to shut down the program.Then out of frustration, I just let the system to load the game without intervention from me.  I just walked away from it thinking I would come back later to see if anything changed?  Although I was expecting it to still appear stalled; Sure enough, the system was up and running as if there was nothing abnormal.I thought if it is going to take that long every time I want to play, then I would just dump the game and chalk it up to ""Live and Learn"".Turns out, the system started loading the game in a reasonable time of less than a minute.Now I enjoy the game with an average Frame Rate of 25-35 FPS with the occasional dip to the low 20's and peaks as high as 48 FPS.  Wow -  What a difference.  The game is what I was hoping for.  Is it perfect - NO, but the frustration of constantly searching for a tweak or Over Clock that would work is in the past.  Now I enjoy the experience and am exploring new things all the time.My one complaint now is that I can't get the HotFix-2 to install which I think is more a problem with STEAM than T:ANE.Previous review:Trainz: A New Era is definitely a next generation Train Simulation that takes advantage of current CPU technology and can challenge even high end Gaming Systems when visual settings are pushed towards their maximum - It brings whole new capabilities and exciting feature with one significant drawback in the Graphics department, even high end Graphics Cards will produce slow FPS often less than 10-30 (Frame Rates per Second) when visual settings are adjusted towards their maximum settings.The fix is to adjust the settings down until you get an acceptable Frame Rate for your system.  This can be a huge disappointment to a majority of end-users who upgrade from previous versions hoping the visual presentation will be everything the software developer says it will be only to be forced to reduce visual effect settings to prevent poor performance or system crashes.It is unfortunate that the developers produce videos promising stunning visual performance, but have not put more effort into solving these well-known and long standing visual performance issues for the majority of users.  Eventually, I believe they will solve these issues, because it is a major selling point that Trainz: A New ERA  is a true enthusiast’s next generation simulation software taking advantage of newer more powerful computers with what could be Outstanding Graphics and Realism once they resolve these performance issues that prevent users from getting the best experience possible.As enthusiasts we understand the possibilities, and sometimes catch glimpses now and then before the software crashes the system, but for now, I recommend those with older systems stick with previous versions until they can deliver on their promise to give us a true Next Generation Simulation as promised in their video’s.Obviously there is a wide variety of systems out there, and not everyone is going to have the same experience.  As for me, I have a high end system, and thus far I have been spending a lot of time trying to tweak the settings to get reasonable FPS and visual experience – but that shouldn’t be happening based on their promises deliver a stunningly realistic experience.  Perhaps someone out there has a system that just knocks it out of the park, but they are the exception and not the rule.Please comment to the developer’s about not delivering the experience they advertise and perhaps it will motivate them to solve these issues sooner rather than later.

												I don't normaly right reveiws but sadly I had to write this one. This game just lacks new content with barley any newer rolling stock, sure I'm ok with some trains from trainz 12 is on this game, but the fact is they barely added newer content and sure they added train swaying which is cool, but in my honest opion, its just trainz 12 again, I was hyped for this game, but after playing for 44 minutes I quit. Sure 44 minutes isnt a long time but I've been a trainz fan since I got the trainz complete collection that included paint shed, ultra collection?, trainz 04 and 06. I had so much fun with those, 2 years later i found out about the download station, that extended the games life time for me for many more years. Finally years later I got Trainz 12, and I had more fun with that due to the fact so much more content was on it(note I didn't know about steam about that time so I didn't buy the steam version) After downloading more content for Trainz 12 I was set for a good years of play time. Hearing about this game I was hyped, now I regret buying this game. I recommend if you have trainz 12 dont buy this game it's just the same thing with barely any new content.			"

												Horrible performance.$1400 laptop with i7-4710HQ + overclocked GTX860M, 16GB DDR3 1600, ~30fps in Crysis 3 with all graphics settings max + FXAA at 1080P, and in this game, 5-15fps if all settings at high/ultra without AA at 1080P. (forgot to list resolution, sorry)I can accept such a bad framerate if Trainz:ANE could deliver a stunning visual quality, as promised by themselves, however,  it's not that case, even after the SP1 update. Nice overall rendering style, water quality is above average, but seems no real-time environment reflections, quality of trees and other objects is below average, texture is good but you can notice its annoying loading lag during your play. So overall visual quality is just OK, I'm wondering why there are some comments noting that visual quality is good, have to say I definitely disagree on this point.UPDATE:Now the Hotfix4 has released, and I got a new 6820HK + gtx1070 laptop. This laptop has the performance on par with a GTX980TI desktop, FYI. As for the visual quality, still the same, and the performance, now I can get 48fps if all settings at high/ultra with AA at 1080P, thanks to the powerful gtx1070, but note that, texture loading lag still remains! That's impressive, I'm wondering what kind of cards they were using during the TANE beta test phase, Titan X SLI?Nearly state-of-the-art hardware requirement, and below average visual quality. Disappointing.			"

It is still being worked on to get more options and a few bugs fixed. I would recommend it to anyone who likes trains and wants to have fun with them. If you are a nit picker or bolt counter, it may not be for you.			"

												I thought I would just try it, even though the reviews aren't that impressive, but I fear the reviews are only too accurate.Much was made of the coming New Era back when Trainz 12 was current (I still have that somewhere) and yet, it seems that not much has changed... Here's what I think of T:ANE -1) I looked at some tutorials.  Graphics look pretty basic for what is supposedly a new game on a new engine.  Looks more like Trainz 10/12 to me.  Flat, cardboardy models, no obvious shine, shadows and shading appeared not to exist despite turning them on in the game settings to begin with.2) Interface isn't all that great.  3) Tried to open Avery-Drexel route, which I liked a lot back in Trainz 10/12.  Although in the package, I had to download/install it from someplace, WITH THE GAME RUNNING.  Steam's crappy refund policy means this is eating into the 2 hour limit where you can get a refund (I've been caught too often by that before).4) Avery-Drexel inlcudes no driveable scenarios, just the basic route.  Start ""quick drive"" and it dumps you into the scenario editor (I think, anyway) with next to no instruction.  By the time I put together a train and actually drove it, I would likely have run out of the 2 hours play time (see above)5) running the advanced controls tutorial, graphics didn't run smooth, with just one engine moving.  Doesn't bode well for complex scenarios with a lot of scenery.  I never found out how to get a framerate display - I have an external overlay for it but that refused to play with T:ANE.So I've made sure to request a refund, well before the 2 hour limit this time.  Not getting caught again.  The price is pretty high for what you get, too - OK, it was a bundle, but not cheap (GBP 55) , and I couldn't see much in the way of scenarios to drive.  Really, N3V?  Is this the best you can do in *how* many years?  Trainz 10 and 12 weren't bad, back in the day, and I found them overall better than the opposition.  But the opposition has moved on, and from the amount I got to see in a the time I wanted to spend, I don't see much evidence of the promised marvels.OK, Dovetail's TSW has some problems, but at least it *looks* like a modern game with realistic looking graphics, not a rework of something from about 2005, and Dovetail appear to be working hard to fix their issues.

												The performance of the game would be much more better. I hope the developers will optimize it more and more in the future service packs.I've got TS2009 and TS12 also and I bought this version becouse I tought the graphics was improved as mentioned everywhere. But when I first played it, I tried the british line at first, I thought it is the same as TS2009 or TS12!I think, the older contents looks the same as before and there are some newer content in it whats looks better now.Overall, I do not think, it is worth the money. I bought a steam key somewhere else where it was way cheaper than on steam now. I think the developers will improve the quality of this product over time, so I suggest to wait when SP1 will come out and after that buy this game or look for a cheaper steam key somewhere else.It is positive, that I've got a 6 month FCT too along with the purchase, so I can install a lot of content from the download station in no time... Truly, most of it older content too...			"

												When I saw this game on sale during the Black Friday, I didn't think twice and got it. Since I was already tired of TS and the reviews of this one were pretty good, I decied to give it a shot and got the deluxe pack.This was my biggest mistake.First of all, I have a decent computer. Core i5 with a nVidia GTX 760. I usually play games at ultra without much struggle, so I decided to do the same. After I launched the game (which took almost 5 minutes), I got inside the tutorials and the game was lagging like hell, the grafics seemd something from a PS2 game. I googled what was going on and some people recommended turning off shadows (?!) so it would run better. I did it and helped a lot, although the look and feel were still terrible. After the tutorials, got on some tracks and man... the sound ain't nice, the tracks are somewhat confusing... the only thing I liked were the controllers, which I found more interesting than the ones from TS, but the latter beats this game in several aspects. I really didn't think it was anjoyable at all.It's a pitty Steam doesn't have a refund policy, otherwise I'd have asked for one right away. If you want something with good looks and an enjoyable experience, get away from this game.			"

												They bribed me to do a review for a free train so here is an honest review of my experience so far in 8 hours of play. I have so far only covered the UK routes as they're more my thing but so far it's not too bad. I'm disappointed vastly because it isn't what they claimed it was going to be a year or 2 ago with the videos showing it looking unrealistic in it's quality, it's not bad though but needs optimising still very badly, if I could rate neutral I would for that reason but don't think it deserves a thumbs down, not quite.My system is top end and runs this at 60fps at 1440p but with distance set at 3000, nowhere near the top, shadows are on low, the game looks really nice though and makes TS 2016 look terrible, the only problem at the moment is the workshop makes TS the much better choice as well as the sheer selection available on DTG's offering, a lot of catching up to do, but like many railfans I think both are needed as both have their qualities. The length of the routes is certainly a forte for TANE though, being able to go from London to Scotland in one run has always been great and now even more epic.A lot of work to do here though, i'm not convinced TANE will ever run great like it should, hopefully one day they'll get on top of it.I have changed my mind and edited to suit, the limited supplied scenarios are unforgivable and means that even DTG would offer more as standard for your money, that says it all. Without making a lot of effort this game is very limited, frustratingly so.			"

												I'll keep it, but only because it was 75% off.  I donated to this, then changed my mind thinking they'd never deliever on the high sounding promises.  I made the right choice.  Load up C&O and it looked quite nice, then a car drove right though my train like it was a ghost...  Tried the Milwalkee route - looks like a cartoon (IE old assets NOT updated)  Bad enough you can get old chunky cartoony assets on the Download Station, but as a PAYWARE ADDON!?!?!  Come on...At $18.74 this mixed bag of lovely and laughable is OK - it sure ain't worth no $71.99 (the full retail as of this writing)			"

												 Trainz: A new Era:While there are just a few simulators out there, this one really has a working staff. The ongoing process of trying to make the game run as well as possible is a daunting task. The support of the staff and comunity is what really stands out, by trying to make it the best sim on the market.  TANE as it is called is a very well put together sim. The amount of customization is out standing, albeit a learing curve is expected. The graphics are out standing and so beautifl that you almost forget you are in your game room.  NV3 Games I give them a thumbs up. Thanks for a wonderful sim.Sincerely, J.R.			"

												I only bought this game today, took a bit of a chance considering that a number of people are reporting low framerates/choppiness etc., but I have had no issues so far, the game seems to play pretty smoothly. My rig is based on an i7 4790k, Gigabyte SOC Force Z97 mobo, 8gb RAM, GIgabyte G1 970 graphics @ 1080p on a 27 in LPS monitor and the game is installed on a SSD.My graphics settings are Draw Distance 3000m, Shadow Quality: Off, Main SHadow Resolution: 2048, with the remaining settings at Ultra, High, High, High, Low. I would say that TS 2016 graphics are superior to TANE's.I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far, hopefully we will get more UK locos and routes as time goes by but to be honest if I want plenty of UK routes and locos right now I can switch to Train Simulator 2016 or go back to Trainz 12 or 2009 for a bit.

												I love this game, the number of engines that you get right off the bat is more than what Railworks will ever do, and the number of FREE locos and cars are mind boggiling. Details are pretty good. I run this game fine with my Windows 8.1. My final rating is a 8/10. The only issues are starting the game takes a while  for me, and the graphics and shadowing are not as good as Railworks. All that aside I think you will enjoy this game for hours and hours.			"

												After getting the game just before it was fully released on May 15, 2015 it was a little buggy but as of November 25, 2015 most of the bugs have been fix.  If want to get this game you will need a good graphics card as the game is very visually instense.  Other than that there is very little to suggest that the game is not any good.  As a railfan I also like the fact that the two american routes are some of the more visually stunning routes in the US.Update 3/28/2017: If you are going in on this after playing Railworks or Train Sim World, don't expect a huge leap in graphics.  This game keeps that old Trainz Charm while at the same time adding a few new things to the mix.  This is not like Railworks!  It is a simply simulator that doesn't try to be too realistic.			"

												I have used both Trainz as well as other Railroad related simulators for years. The fact that Trainz is now on Steam makes things go much easier when it comes to communication and Service packs or updates. The main advantage to Trainz is in Surveyor and building qualities, which are much more user friendly than other simulators. Trainz large displays on the right side are much easier to notice from a visual perspective. All simulators have both positive and negative ratings, but because Trainz has been completly upgraded with new features; I think that Trainz is headed in the right direction, which makes for a much more enjoyable experience. I have only used the New Era version for one day before writing this review, but I am really impressed with how easy it is to find where your going in the program. I can't wait to expore further within the solftware.  Lee			"

												In Short Yes, but only if you have a pc that can meet or exceed the recommended gam specs. I have used trainz since the 2004 version and what I have always enjoyed the most is the ability to so easily create your own routes from nothing, and that makes up for some of its shortcomings in my opinion. It is such a versatile game, with so much to offer anyone who loves trains and loves to create in so many different ways, build a route, build content, drive , operate your routes, control environments, weather, industry and so on...Trainz a new era maintains all of this and does look a little better than previous versions, so if you like train simulators, this one is the best, may not look as good as certain other titles in the train sim genre, but more than makes up for it in versatality, glad I bought it			"

												I can't believe it! They actually did it! Trainz actually topped Microsoft Train Simulator, Railworks, and Railroad Tycoon 3! This is simply amazing! The graphics are beautiful, the models are perfect, the sound effects are great, and the Doppler effects are great! The multiplayer works, perfectly, and I have a lot of fun on it! I also love the DLC's! And the official release trailer for T:ANE perfectly represents how great this game is, using the shots, the angles, the effects, and the song! I really love the song used in the trailer, by the way! In my opinion, this is definitely the best game in the entire Trainz franchise, the best train game on Steam, and the best train game I've ever played in my entire life!!!			"

												Recommended.In short: -the railsimulation game i have looked for  -good fun, much to explore, scalable difficulty and gameplay-some issues in performance, sound and game content-definitely better then the other big railsim (that punishes its players)My hardware: -4 year old gaming PC (no SSD drive)-Nvidia Geforce GTX560 (old)-16 GB RamGame performance:-purchased: End of November 2015 after HF2 Patch-time played to review: 20 hrs-program crashes so far: 0 (zero)-GFX settings: mostly low detail, visible range: 2500-3000, texture streaming on-Screenresolution: 1600x900 (performance tip!)-framerate: acceptable for me, moslty fluid, depends on Route (ofcourse)-loading times: the first runups took very long (felt like 5 minutes), directly after first launch more content was loaded down, but it was possible to play during that, currently it launches in about 1 minute, some more time to load when entering a session/route, loading times depend on route size (ofcourse). -loading times are better than on the other big railsim.Gameplay matchwinner for me:-easy and realistic driving mode, both fun-physics simulation very good-shunting and long hauls, both possible-Quickdrive Mode in 'Kickstarter county'-set complete trains onto looped main line and tell the AI driver to drive-add more trains, they will all follow the speedlimits and signals automatically-add even more trains, tell the driver to go to a specific point and he will drive there, including direction changing and junction setting, all other trains will wait if that train blocks the track. Awesome!-plenty of complete trains to set on tracks, my favourite: 'The blue planet' diesel train-click on a red signal in front of you and the focus jumps th the cause for that.-switching junctions is straightforwardNot so good details in gameplay:-questionable price for addon routes, better purchase at bundle with the main game (deluxe version)-3D-sound is somewhat awkward at some points.-very good content on one and somewhat old/messed up stuff on the other hand (locos, routes, assets)-only few missions(2-4) included in every route by default-some missions surprisingly long (2hrs) with lot risk to mess up on a goal-map mode feels a little bit chaoticDocumentation:-about 10 good driving tutorials, 5-20 mins each, good learning curve, good fun-250 pages manual in english with every topic handled Building tracks and sessions (Surveyor):-just tried shortly-possible to set a track with a train within 20 minutes for basic operation-easy Interface-(to be honest:) not real fun because of vastness of possibilities, reading documentation mandatoryNOT tested so far:-login to developers online service/website-multiplayer-downloading free content from 'download station'Remark:-everybody writing a Steam review will get free DLC, no matter if it is a good or bad review.

												I've been playing the new game for a few days now. I like the new models and routes but I think the sounds especially the whistles and horns need to be changed as they are virtually all the same. Old models need to be udated for the new engine. I haven't had a chance to play multiplayer yet which is upsetting because it's one of the main reasons I play this game as opposed to sticking toTrain Simlulater by dovetail games. As a final note the scenery in developed areas is a bit static people on platforms don't move, theres no traffic, and industrail areas and towns appeared abandoned.			"

												Im enjoying Trainz New Era. For a beginner it may take some getting use to but it offers alot. Since Im into model railroading Bidye Traction Railroad was my primary reason for purchasing Trainz New Era. The deluxe version was definetly worth $37 during the Holiday Sale. If you have a descent computer thats able to handle the graphics I think youll enjoy it. Last thing I wonna say is I cant wait until we are able to use the Rail Driver Desk Top Controller with Trainz New Era "

												I'm a big fan of Dovetail Games Train Simulator 2016, and have spent way too much on DLC for that game already, but in the fall sale I was tempted by Trainz as well. This is a fun train simulator so far. It seems slightly less complex a simulation model than TS2016, though on the other hand the interface is less intuitive than its competitor. It is easier, however, to find working 3rd party content for Trainz, which the developers have centralized in the download station website. Tentatively, I give this game a thumbs up. I'll probably edit this early review once I have more game time.			"

												I've been a user of Trainz since the early days of 1.3. I held off on buying T:ANE until the most recent winter sale, so they've had time to iron out a couple of bugs. Service Pack 1 is right around the corner as well, so now would be a great time to pick it up while it's on sale.I've always preferred Trainz to the other sims because it has a very robust route and session editor that is extremely user-friendly, which I've found not to be the case with the other sims on the market. Trainz also has a massive 3rd party network.  There is content available for almost every facet of railroading worldwide in some form. The N3V forums are also full of supportive community members who are always willing to help users new and old with any issues that arise.The features that T:ANE adds may be minimal, but IMO they all add to the experience. Improvements in the graphics engine which allow for different texture effects, a proper 3D sound environment, and updated lighting and shading effects all help make the sim world pop a little more.T:ANE does still have some teething issues with optimisation to work out, but that's to be expected. It gets my recommendation, but if you're uncertain, then I would at least wait until it goes on sale (as of the time of this review, you can get the Deluxe version for the normal price of the game).

Graphics of naure could be also better. Waiting forward til the rea scenarios come up. I definetely not going to use the easy mode, cooz it's harder to control the train with it.			"

												I have logged several hundred hours on N3V's own version of T:ANE as a kickstart supporter.  Just shifted over to STEAM since I had some DLC from TS12 which I wanted to use in T:ANE.  I would highly recommend this program for any Railroad Simulation fan who wants to create their own routes or sessions and has new higher-end hardware (particularly the graphics card).  The locomotive cabs for the most part are quite primitive compared to those in TS2016 so driving from within the cab isn't as enjoyable, but if you want to edit any route or session (except the built-in ones) it is quite easy.  The team at N3V are working hard to make the program smoother to run with lower-end hardware but realistically the ""recommended"" hardware should be listed as ""minimum"".  They are also adding new features and chasing down bugs, so new versions have been released quite frequently lately.			"

												The game is awesome. I've needed a train sim multiplayer fix for some years! You can setup private games or leave them open to the public. My only complaint is the First Class Ticket. You need one of these to download stuff at normal speeds. If not then you're looking at 4 Kbps. Which if you don't plan on checking out the mod scene you'd think you'd be fine. BUT these speeds also apply to ingame updates (not steam updates) like playing the multiplayer on each map. So I wasted my 2 hour trial period (refund period) downloading the multiplayer updates. So I give it a 6/10. Great game, terrible business model??			"

Content Manager, although buggy at times, was far more user freindly and showed pictures of content as well as just line descriptions which made it easy to locate and download free content.  Graphics are better and on my new Alienware laptop, it runs better than previos versions.  Without something akin to old Contact Manager,  I would rate it a 7 out of 10.			"

												I recommend this game because it massively improves on The Trainz Series. I have seen complaints about stuff like that the game does not create the junctions that the trailer showed, but it is actullully possible to create them if you use the track that starts with TANE and it should make them.  The lighting is more impressive then in the trailer when you look on the DLS on My Trainz (Planet Auran) there is not a lot of content but when you look at it in Trainz A New Era Content Manager there are tons of downloadeble content From Trainz 12 but the auther has updated it for Trainz A New Era and the fact that there is pre installed enough content for lite users and there are a lot of good payware content on Simulator Central. All in all I'm saying that this game is better then TS 2016 (2015). Well for those who want to drive a train and nothing more Ts 2016 (2015) is the game for you, but... if you want more then that, like a full Railroad Simulator then Trainz: A New Era is for you and this game is worth the money including the delux version.

												The game is not optimized well. I get good frames only on lower graphical settings. Sounds, graphics, and physics are improved over the previous Trainz games. Doesn't come with a huge train selection like previous Trainz games did, but quality > quantity in this case.			"

												If you like tranes, get it. The Sime is a great game. The only think I didn't like about the sim is the starting load time... Start the launcher, go get a cup of coffie and come back. That kind of thing. Oh and 1 peace of advice. Dont turn all the graphic's up all at once. you'll lag so bad you'll have to crash the game to get out. start out in the middle and work your way up... :)			"

												Well, it plays well, I havent had any performance issues with it (outside of some minor frame drops here and there) Some new assest are very nice, the whole Victorian Railway route is very nice. However, it isn't what was promised at all, and aside from one or two things, it looks exactly like T12 before it. Aswell as the fact that theyre seems to be less and less content with each new version. Which wouldn't be that much of an issue if it wasnt such a pain to download custom content through the content manager. I do reccomend it, if you like Trainz in general. But if you already have 2012 then dont bother.			"

												I have over 170 hrs on Train Sim 2016 plus dlc I decided to buy Trainz ANE because it seemed to give a diffrent aspect to a Train Sim.So my review is not to compare the two but how i feel about TANE.Firstly after looking at good or negative reviews and youtube vids i decided to buy the Deluxe Edition.My P.C. GTX980 Ti. i7Skylake CPU. 16GB Ripjaw.Acer Predator 32 inch Monitor ran the Game at 3840x2160.Put the settings on Ultra and High did the 9 Tutorials very enjoyable indeed no problems at all.( Tut 8 may have a bug so if you do it remember at the end reaching the Station/Yard 2 small red lights hold you up go in to free mode right click to the other end of the Station/past the Passenger Train find Switch 49636 and switch it over, lights than go on green and you can finish the Tut 8 many thanks to the player that worked that out )Did my first run Edinburgh to London and it takes hours in real time thought it was excellent.Finished 2 more same thoughts.I am realy happy that i bought this game and play Train 16 and Trainz ANE in equal measure.The New patch SP1 seems to have sorted most things out.On my experiance of the game a big thumbs up,if you buy it hope it goes as well for you,its allways sad to see fellow gamers having bad problems but we all have it.May peace be with you my fellow gamers.

												Im a railfan guy so i thought this would be amazing casue i love the Trainz simulater games. HOWEVER! this game did not get me any fun cause of the following. 1. you cant play the game unless you have a beefy computer. 2. even if you do manage to get it to start you still cant play evrything you see in the video cause its not there you HAVE to buy the more expensive version if you want the full experice(that i dont have) and that is some stuipedity! we pay the money we do for games there making with this amount of negativity and they expect us to have fun!? NO THANKS! however despite what ive said its still a really nice looking game so if you are reading this and still want the game get the full version and make sure you got a beefy computer so it will play. im really considering getting a better computer buying the full thing anytrying again. but! if who made this does not wake up soon and stops focusing on money and graphics im going back to trainz 2006-2010.

												i love this game after being unsure for so long i ended up buying it i miss this game more then ever getting to play it again made me feel great tihs game is still one of the best i know a lot of people say go the other trian one but what i don't like about that one is they make you pay for everything around $20 per map and train who does that i worked it out that its dlc comes to over $2000 why would you buy all that this game comes with everything and i have never had to much fun doing this again i can't wait till it fully comes out and i can use to download station MORE TRIANS don't get me wrong i love all train games but  N3V Games has the best one out there when it comes to this and yes i know that the it doesn't look at great as the trailer but is that really a big deal they do som uch to keep this game going after 2012 yea you could buy 2012 and play it and think it the same fine do that if you want but i like this one and if you have a problem they always help you to fix it so it not like  N3V Games are not they are alway watching the post and and they make sure you have the best time in they game and they told what the game with before i even bought how many trains what i get all that so yes i would recommend this game its great :)			"

												This game is completelly inadequate to release date. It looks like 15-20 years old, and it is complettely ugly and boring at all. Maybe if it will be for free, it may be ""good"", but for this price, when there is high quality Train Simulator for better price, and Train Sim World with close to photorealistic graphic and very good physic model? If Auran will not make complete new game based on actual graphic and physic models, there is nothing to buy from them now.			"

												In terms of how this game pans out, it's a bit too early to tell for certain, but so far, I'd say it looks better than Dovetail Game's equivalent for this type of simulation, and runs much better.  While T:ANE has a lot that needs to be added/improved, it currently is in a stable enough state that I am able to find much more enjoyment out of than I honestly was originally expecting.  I will be keeping an eye on this game, as well as the updates, and will be updating this review as necessary, but, for now, I'd say if you like simulators of this type, I'd definitely reccommend this out of the options that are currently available, though keep in mind that it will require hardware that is a bit on the more powerful side.

I like the 0-6-2 broad gauge aultrailian engine it remineds me of thomas the tank engine my childhood icon. If it hadnt been for that blue train, I wouldnt be hear. Totaly recamended.			"

												first off i would like to say this is not train simulator 2015, if you came here looking for that type of sim, don't bother.trainz is a much more in depth train sim that has many more features than ts 2015 offers.i for one enjoy driving, creating and building my own model railroad setup.you can setup a whole train route very quickly once you get the hang of it.if you are after just driving, that is an option also, you will just need to download payware or freeware routes.there is 10 times more freeware for trainz than other sims.i would also suggest jointed rails that make great payware u.s locos and content.as far as performance, if you go in eeven with the highest computer on the market, you are unlikely to max all the sliders out.this train sim is 64 bit only now and much more future proof.if you have a low to mid range pc,expect to have sliders turned down to low.if you are running a high end pc, expect normal to high settings, and try a few different settings, before you come here and say the sim sucks.it may look alot like trainz 12, but its not trainz 12.content is gonna need a little time to mature before you will see large amounts of content on the download station.i hope this helps some of you that read so many negative reviews and put off buying because of comments on here. give this new trainz version a try and ignore what alot of people have said.obviously they haven't done there homework before buying.i put off from purchasing because of these very same bad reviews, and i would say 90 percent of the negatives are flat out wrong, good luck.i am really enjoying it so far.grab the delux version while its on sale, you get 8 routes.

												What can I say about Trainz: A New Era... I was stuck between this game and Train Simulator 2016. After seeing how much DLC TS16 wanted, it was about 5 thousand dollars worth of content, that was a big turn off. I went to this version of Trainz because Trainz 12 still had the graphics from previous versions. I wouldn't waste my money on that because I could just play 06 and call it even. The game is slightly slugish at times, it's nothing major but seems a little noticable. The graphics though are a plus over the previous versions, it truly adds to the gameplay. The trains are good looking, detailed cabs, of course. The only thing though is the world feels dead when playing this game, there are a few animations but nothing else moves. There are no people, hardly any cars in the Sessions, and alltogether it just feels bleh when driving through this barren wasteland. I still do enjoy this game though, I was looking for a Train Sim and this won over the overly expensive TS16!			"

												Recommended but with some caution:In some of the starting tutorials, the locomotive used has the driver positioned in the middle rather than to right (or left) in the inside cabin view so one cann't see the outside track/signals properly unless one moves to chase or any other outside viewsUpdate:Hopefully [ or ] should allow me to change to a better view, haven't tried it yet with that locomotive/Tutorials. It should be mentioned in the tutorial session where the locomotive used has a default view which is middle of train engine cabin with no proper outside visibility (rather than in the steam engine tutorial, which is where I learnt about [ and ], if I remember correctly).What Could have been better1. Graphics Quality seems to be amiss a bit in some cases (unless there is some setting tweak required/hidden somewhere)1.1. The track about 200m or so in front of the train is not plotted at all.1.2. There were jerks in external view in one of the tutorial. However haven't noticed it in other things which I have tested.1.3. The trees appear to be being viewed from a wire meshed window or so 2. Routes2.1. Only 4 routes available by default. I had expected more in the default setup. May be there are a lot of downloadable free routes (have to check after creating a account), but quality of these will have to be cross checked individually and some could be good and some bad.  Would have expected a bit more curated long routes by default.2.2. Each route in turn has only 2 or so engaging scenarios by default. Again would have expected 10 to 20 interesting scenarios/activities per route to keep a new comer to train simulations engaged.			"

												yeah , i bought this game thinking it would be great. . i was wrong on all accounts. even though i read bad reviews i thought that , ""Meh , it cannot be that bad"" , well , the graphics look like 2005 , the sounds are great. and the frame-rate kinda blows. My computer is beefy , it can handle just about anything on steam game wise , but this game needs work , Optimizing . I rate this game 3/10 Reason :  Pros - Great sounds- nice cabin shake- Buttons and levers work - Windows open , and sun shades moveCons : - Needs more optimizing- Frame rate blows- Needs more trains / routes ( Unless you pay a fortune )- Cameras suck - Fuzzy textures (2005-ish feel)All in all the game is nice , but the bads way outweigh the goods and to me , that means the game is NOT WORTH THE BUY.  I Do not recommend this game.			"

												I honestly don't get why people dislike this game after having little playtime with it. I think this game is a positive step in the right direction with the new ""built in switches"" used on the new track. However, I dislike the amount of content thie game lacks. I van assume that the game needs more work, and that the old content will eventually find its way into the game. The other interesting feature is when you zoom out all the way, and the camera mode changes to ""map"" mode. If people want to think of this game as a load of garbage, then let them, but I am not going to give up hope just yet. I'm waiting on YOU, Developers, to fix what's wrong and add all the content that was in previous versions of the game! The only reason I gave this a thumbs up is so tha we can back a game that can improve instead of ditching a title that might actually have a chance at improvement.			"

												After getting a refund for Train Simulator 2016, I decided to try out Trainz…  Big mistake.  All of the failings I found in TS2016 were right here waiting for me in Trainz.  The fact that there is very little included content, I believe only 4 or 5 train routes.  The controls are locked in and I couldn’t customize them to the throttle lever of my Thrustmaster Hotas, which would be PERFECT for a train simulation.  The DLC library is huge, and most prices are outrageous ($35 for a single bloody route!)No, no… I’m sorry.  I’ll continue to wait for a train simulator that’s more than just an arcade game.  Refund please!			"

												It one those game I do like it something that I used to play as a kid in the old day and it company has a really good. They dont give up on the game if it had a small bad start it later become good. So let talk about the pro and con.Pro:It has 250.000 freeware on dls and on some website.it has multplayer.it not rubbish.it made to be fun to see train on the chair or if you have a projector watch on the on a relaxing seat.and the service of the company treat the customer really kind and not treat the customer badly.Con:it may be a slow start on the game it will take a little bit 10 or 15 min so if you are not in a rush then at ok if not then do some else.the game has some bug and issueit a little bit pricely but it in decent priceso that it I may had more pro and con but I think that all can think of about this game and last on I think of it has is it company legecy and was the game was a great game even the old game from Auran to N6V.

This however doesnt really look much different to Trainz 2006, and has hardly any content compared. Its certainly not worth £29.99. If you thinking of getting this then check out Trainz 2004 and 2006, you wont be disapointed!			"

												Still in the testing phase with a New Era, but I'm fascinated in intergrating my favorite content into it. I must admit, I'm a little iffy on the current version of Content Manager, as its distinctly unlike the methods used from 12 back to 06 (yes, I've been using Trainz since 06!) I'm glad that the speedtrees have been cut back, so to speak, and that water realism is being used with shadows, although I wonder if the water is almost too blue, as if it was in a pool rather than out in a muddy river. Like I said, still testing, but I'm glad that Trainz is upping the ante in simulator realism.			"

												This is my first train sim and I'am really enjoying it so far. Besides a little bit of a glitch at the beginning, the graphics are excellent.

												Love this game as a stepup from trainz 12. Has a few issues but graphics are remarkedly improved, physics are better, multiplayer is much more stable. It just has a more releastic feel about it. Highly recommended if you like trains. Routes are based on rl routes. After almost 12 months I must alter my review. There were some glaring game stopping bugsback then which I highlighted on forums. Apparently the devs dont read or care about the forums because the same bugs are still unfixed several patches and hotfixes later. Now the devs have announced on their website they are making a new game to replace this one. A subscription based game called Trainz Next. Talk about a slap in the teeth for the ppl who paid good money for A new Era believing the hype and crap that was spread by the devs before release. Not even 12 months later they have abandoned the game in favour of a cash grab that is subscription. Unfortunately I have to say if you are thinking of purchasing A New Era, I would higly advise against it. You will be buying a dead game. There are more bugs in this game than an alpha release and the devs have abandoned it. Dont waste your money. Another point I must highlight is the DLC. They will bombard you at every chance to buy the thousands of dollars worth of DLC that is available. Some of it at higher price than the game itself. Dont do it. They have a history of releasing buggy, unfinished, games then patching the DLC, while largely ingoring the core game. Then when sales start to drop they come out with a ""new"" game and the cycle starts again. Run away, don't get scammed, deny them their money and shut them down.			"

												I completely can't recommend this game solely on one major issue that breaks most scenarios. This issue being that signals are buggy to the degree that you are likely to end up  stuck forever waiting in one spot for the signal to change from red, which it never does. Also another issue is that the game is so dismissive if you make just one error. Instead of docking points for mistakes it ends the session and even sometimes is so patronizing as to tell you it is doing so for your own ""safety"" which is infuriating. It's a amazing looking game that runs well and is stable, but it is completely rendered unplayable due to the issues I've mentioned. Also another bad issue, is that they do a dreadful job of explaining how to drive a steam train in the expert mode tutorial. Basically you are left having to guess what has to be done since things are so poorly explained, and good luck with that.If they did eventually fix the issues I have mentioned, then I would very much change my rating to that of recommending the game, since it could be so perfect if it were not for those issues I mentioned that ruin things.I've decided I won't even attempt to play this game again till after SP2. At that point I will see if they have fixed the issues I mentioned.			"

												I only bought TANE Deluxe as it was heavily discounted. So far, it seems mostly similar to TRAINZ 12, with only a few visible improvements. To me, the graphics look basic and almost cartoonish, compared to TS 2016. Having trouble logging in to MyTrainz/Planet Auran. The included content isn't very exciting for me; there's nothing contemporary, only historic scenarios. I'll give the game some more time, but the general impression thus far is underwhelming.			"

												I purchased this in a Steam sale so I'm not too bothered about a bad purchase, however I would be very upset if I had paid full price for this lemon.A lot has already been said in previous reviews and I do agree with them, this is more of a demo with just 4 routes that will cost you hundreds to make anything of, the included routes are quite boring too.The engine sound effects are more akin to something I would have made on my Amiga 30 years ago, in fact if your like me you would find yourself turning the speakers off as it's so annoying it drives you crazy!The graphics are EXTREMELY demanding and I don't know why, they aren't as good as Railworks for example and that runs fine. To me the graphics look a little cartoony but I suppose that is to each's opinion.This claims to be a New Era with better this and that but it's not, it's just more of the same re-released under a new name.I can't even force myself to play this for more than 10 minutes at a time it's that boring, and at least half of that is in silence because of the really annoying sound effects.Railworks is a far better product, graphically, audibly and in gameplay. But if you must have Trainz go for the 2006 edition, it's a better product with some enjoyable routes. Its a real shame those routes don't work in this version, at least then it would be playable, although in silence! "

												I thought this game would be great but, nevermind.Reason 1: The game sucksReason 2: waste of money, just get Trainz simulator 12.-----===== EDIT=====----- 5 months ago, I purchased this game thinking it would be amazing, but I was wrong and was clueless about my computers capabilities. I'm finsihed building my currnet PC and can't wait to play. Before you play Trainz: A New Era, be sure you have played past installments.                      - Memestar			"

												A new era in costs, what was a good old game is now pants at a price, I mean £27 for a single map and I counted 6 for sale, are they mad!!!. They once stood out but now they are just like the normal greedy money printers, not only that but this game is a lot worse than train simulator but at least they have copied the DLC profit marketing idea from them.2/10			"

												Coming from a guy who has been playing Trainz since about 2008, it seems clear that Trainz is following the footsteps of everyone else. To sum it up:-98% of all content full-priced DLC (even if you owned the game BEFORE the DLC was added...)-(I want to point out that while the series has had DLC in previous games, it was never this much or this pricey...)-They were all like: ""ensure there is just enough content included to allow just enough enjoyment that someone might actually purchase more DLC""-Most content is unoptimized (in other words: graphics are rendered extremely inefficently, and often visual glitches and problems exist)-Glitches. We need glitches. LOTS. OF. GLITCHES. (Mostly texture/shadow and sound glitches, but still glitches no less)-Did you like the Download Station in the previous games? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, we don't like you getting free stuff. (While the DS still exists, it has been downgraded to a system no longer user-friendly and is really just a mess.)-This game has multiplayer...I can't figure out many people who would want that.-This game also has Co-op. Again, no clue what that's doing here.-Variety of trains is down to about a handful of steam engines, no electrics, and six or so diesels. So much for making things fit into the surroundings...hope the Mid-West is fine with seeing Union Pacific slapped on everything. -The variety of vans and trucks (freight cars) is mild at best. Good luck moving anything, honestly.-Variety of coaches is even worse. Hope the passengers all enjoy second class cars with identical running numbers.-You get one route in the UK, one in Australia, one US routes, and one or two ""universal"" routes. Everything else is DLC. (This includes a single German route, which is the only free DLC avalible. You get no missions with it; literally just the route and the ability to spawn a train. All missions are spammed as Pay-to-Play content)Overall, a game that promised great potential, but really just derailed the series (pun intended). It is a shame to see that yet another company is taking the DLC route. It's gonna get to the point that years from now, games no longer exist, but rather it's just a bunch of DLC bundled under a single title. (Come to think of it, games are already starting to take that route...)I liked when the series was so open ended, and allowed one to cram their harddrive if they wanted to with all sorts of stuff they'll use in-game maybe once. At least there was no shortage of content, no lack of things to do, and plenty of hours to be melted and burned into making routes. Now I feel like I can't even do THAT. I can't drive trains, I can't build routes the way I'd like to, and variety is nearly none. I'm sorry to say this game is such a disappointment, but sadly this is the case.			"

												The company continues to fix review scores - the glaring discrepancy between the recent and overall ratings means they have to fudge some more false reviews, and soon.As for the game... ""The Best Train Game Just Got Better."" LOL. Just LOL. ""Stunning Heights of Realism"". LMAO! I think I peed my pants!How this product has not been pulled based on blatant misrepresentation is stunning. And its DLC strategy makes EA look like the girl scouts. From insane load times to clunky controls and graphics that are 15 years out of date (yes, 15), it's a stuttering, ugly, mess - even with a high-end PC and post processing you don't have the kind of quality the commercials suggest. There's a reason that the camera is moving so fast in those - it's so you can't see the horrible quality of the graphics.This king has no clothes, and he's warty, fat, and outdated. Avoid this game. Enough said.PS: When a game is still proudly announcing in its main description its major patch from 15 months ago... you know there's a problem. And when the latest patch after 2 YEARS is still only basic fixes and crash reducers, not enhancements, you know is a complete pile.  This is a $5 game at best.			"

												The original Trainz was a the desired concept for me.  It was anchored on a theme one might choose for building of a model railroad and could be used as a template to try out concepts for the table top version.  One by one product animation models left the program.   Today it has drifted away from this operations  theme to a  engine driver theme  along a route already built with the option to build one as a left over concept.  Getting into a engine to control it  was never  the simulation goal for me. The rail dispatcher and model building aspect has faded away so that there is  no need for yard shunting operations, train routing and other similar tasks, to be a part of railroading simulations any more.   My question to those who have aquired the original Aron Trainz is why copy the competition  train drivers when you had an unique approach to trains of your own.			"
