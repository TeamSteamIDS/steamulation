												This is not much of a game and even if this is trying to be a funny April Fools joke on how Indie Devs work... it wasn't funny at all and doesn't really work like it should.  Let me explain by telling you the Pro's and Con's.Pros:♦ Cheap ♦ Graphics looks pretty good♦ Has Steam Trading CardsCons:♦ Game tries way too hard to be funny that it's lame♦ Game content isn't even long enough to unlock 1 Steam Trading Card♦ Game crashes if you click the ""Work on the Game"" option on Day 1♦ Game crashes to Desktop if you finish the game with any option♦ You can litterally skip everything and get 8 out of 9 achievements in under 1 minute♦ You can skip every stage of the game and not watch any of it♦ There is only one playable mode and it's boring as♦ The main game is soo lame all you have to do is click the corner of a circle that shows in every row of circles (Like it's not even fun or funny, it's just lame)♦ The ending for developing the indie game and playing through minutes of boringness is soo lame and unfunny♦ No replay value♦ Filesize seems like a joke (999.9mb). Feels like they set it to that even though it doesn't have 999.9mb worth of Content anywhere in this game... Only way it could be that big is if it's soo unoptomized it's not funnyIn my opinion this game has an awesome concept with high potential with many aspects that could have been forfilled that weren't (Concept seems to be implemented poorly with limited content). Like, there is soo much more the Devs could have done with this to add to the content, the gameplay and even to make it funnier that they didn't even look at. Instead we got a miniscule length game with limited possibilities and unfunny jokes that all end before it even begins. Therefore, on a whole, I finished this completely by getting all achievements in 11 minutes and the only reason anyone would play longer is if they wanted the Steam Trading Cards. I don't even know why this game has Steam Trading Cards as I don't see how it could even have good emoticons, badges and backgrounds! Also, I found this game extremely unfunny and boring not to mention broken (It shouldn't crash on day one if you try to make the indie game and it shouldn't crash once you finish it). It is one of the shortest, most unfun games I've played in a while and I'd recommend you only ever buy it if it's free or you really had 89 cents you had to get rid of.			"

												This is not a game, this is a collection of videos and one minigame that's so boring (I know, it symbolizes the monotonity of developing, etc) and so simple in a bad way, and lacking in terms of any fantasy that it would be underwhelming even for a mobile game. Again, we can make the arguement about ""But so many indie games are the same, or so hard to make an original game""But this is the problem.  This is not a good game. I wouldn't even say that this is a normal game, by it's standards and contents.This ""project"" could be passed for a movie, or short films, collection or an anthology, call it what you want. But this is not a game. This is not an enjoyable piece of art, neither self-reflecting enough to be called in the traditional, thought-inducing meaning of art, neither of the ""So grand and rich piece of gaming that it can be classified as art"". Though this could be passed as a development diary, for example.Only buy it if you want 100% achievements in ~10-20 minutes and/or if you know what are you buying.			"

												I'm guessing whoever made this was on something and/or extremely bored; so they decided to bore the hell out of everyone else as well.It is an interactive story, not a game, probably meant as a joke, but it is not that funny, and it is too short.You can waste 20 min of your life ""playing"" this through, or you could skip everything and ""complete"" the ""game"" and all of the achievements in under 2 minutes. The only reason left to have this running is to get the trading cards.As for the price, most people got it for free so I guess there's no reason to complain, but this definitely is NOT worth spending time or money on.Overall: 1/10			"

To be taken serious, or not?Make it Indie has received a LOT of negative comment since its release on April 1st (ahum) of this year. The description on the Steam Store page explicitly asks not to take it too seriously, and so people have mostly jumped in expecting some fun and entertainment. Which the game ... does not provide.At its core, this is a (slightly) interactive story, which ""teaches"" the player how to succeed or - more likely - fail at becoming a developer of Indie games. During one week you're every morning presented with a choice: to work on your game, or rather do something else. If you work on the game enough, and you succeed at the fairly stupid but not that easy clicker-mini-game, then you finish a game and it may be published. Goal accomplished.If you choose to other things, you're presented with one out of eight different full-motion video's, which feel like being directed by a decent amateur cinematograph (or first-year student) and are shot in Russia. They contain some nice images, but are mostly unsettling in their vagueness. There's no interaction at all in this part of the game: you just watch and wait (or skip and proceed to the next day, quickly getting all the achievements, but that would completely beside the point).Now, based on these all-too-meagre contents, it could be a straightforward affair, and I could dismiss this little ""game"" as  an utter failure. But the game has stirred something inside me while playing, something I've been thinking about. Maybe there is a ""deeper"" meaning to it, such as: if you do what you're expected to do (working every day on your project, in order to succeed), life is boring as hell. Which, to me, makes sense, and not at the same time. It all depends if you can put something of yourself, of your dreams maybe, into your work. But if you choose not to focus, and to do whatever you feel like doing on a given day, life becomes unsettled, even upsetting. That's where the nightmares come in: every night, there's a short but disturbing dream. Nothing spooky or horror-like, no, just unsettling. It's difficult to describe it so I suggest you just pay the dollar or euro, and go and watch (play) this.Try to do it with an open mind, not expecting some quick fun, and maybe you'll get the same feeling as I had: that this game wants to tell us something, about life, about dreams; surely in a clumsy and unpolished way, but stll: I feel there is more to it than just ""a game not to be taken seriously"".Recommended for the really curious, but definitely to be avoided if looking for some easy fun.

												It’s been months since I first played this, and my first review was the worst review that I’ve ever wrote for anything in Steam. Rearranging that old review and looking back, I find my opinion not to be changed. Sorry, this is not a game.Ok, I'll try not be annoying with this one - but I am annoyed to say the least. HOW THE FRIGGIN' HELL IS THIS EVEN A GAME??? Ehm, sorry for the caps lock rage. It tends to burst out when I remember this particular abomination.The 'game' consists of short movie crops made by some 'artsie' movie students - which takes a grand deal of optimism to call as art - , some snarky comments far from being funny and ‘a mini game’ which takes result in meaningless random clicking to win. Yaaay, you have developed an indie game! Is that it? If it is supposed to be even funny, it ends with being insulting for the genre only.I’d say even with the change under your sofa, this game doesn't worth neither the value, nor the 10 minutes that you will be losing from your lives. Okay, it is as cheap as it can be, but there are actual games that you can play for a dollar in Steam. Make it Indie! is neither creative, nor commemorative and not even fun to play. But it is sure %100 on achievements with some free trading cards for a dollar. So who am I to judge?Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												What I like about Make it indie!:+ Trading cards.What I dislike:- It can't be called as game.- More like the creator's way to express his boredom when creating indie games, but it's lazily done.- Boring, although there are achievements, but with this thing, it's a deadly combination.Do I recommend it? Of course, if you can get it for FREE, and for the trading cards drop purpose only. So I think it's a no, then. "

												This ""game"" obviously came out April the 1st for a reason. This is one of the wierdest interactive novels, simulators (or whatever you wanna call it) things I've played. All you do is basically watch some russian guy do random stuff, I really have no clue what is going on. You can complete this thing in about 30 minutes and there is no such thing is replay value. But for the cheap price tag I surely had some fun. Watched this entire thing while I had breakfast. All achievements are unlocked just by watching and clicking on a few things. Also, trading cards is included, so if you want easy 100% games and cards this should be something for you.At least the videos are recorded in good quailty and theres some pretty good russian songs, even though I have no idea what they are singing about. Also some dubstep included.If you pick this up, don't expect to much, except lots of wierd things.			"

												Make it indie! Is an 'interactive' story set in some Russian city?You are an indie developer, you have one week to develop your game, each day you decide what to do from a list of available options: from watching rain, to listening music, playing with your friends, developing you game, etc. Because you can only do one thing in a 24 hours day (obviously). There are two endings, you either developed enough of your game to release it, or you don’t; every activity is just a short video with music in the background, you can do each activity once per playtrough, except for developing a game, which is a mini-game. There are no variations or interactions between what you did yesterday and what you're going to do tomorrow.Every night you get to see a shameful try of experimental video, sadly, experimental doesn't mean just a bunch of weird overlays and blurry images, that is a wrong perception, to do anything experimental you need a concept, something you want to prove, something you want to communicate. Otherwise, you’re doing something as artistic as the doodles in the back of your notebook.★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it "

If you're after something which gives insight into games development, then please check out indie game the move or some other behind the scenes of a certain game.

												There isn’t much of a game here.  You watch videos based on your selection and the only interactive parts are choosing what to do and the simplistic game (click on the quadrant of a circle that is in every shape) that you play in order to ‘develop’ your indie game.You can choose to develop your game or other activities like listening to music, play with your cat or go for a walk.  The videos are on the whole fairly well done with good framing and lighting.  The best videos are the Creative Commons licensed ones that play whilst you are developing the game.  The music consists of many Russian bands/acts that you wouldn’t have heard of unless you are a native.  The game has a quirky sense of humour which tends to fall flat.  Fortunately, all the videos can be skipped, which is a good metaphor for the game. You will unlock almost all of the achievements on your first time playing - all of them if you get the good ending.  Within half-an-hour you will have seen everything the game has to offer, and there is really no point in playing it again, unless you want the trading cards.  In the information about the game in the Steam store, the developer/publisher asks you to “Don't take this game too seriously!”  I was sent a key for the game; if you want to pay for it, bear in mind that there is not much game here, seriously.Review copy provided by Sometimes You.

												That was a really short game-movie. I did 2 playthroughs in 34mins, & that's without skipping anything.It reminded me of a student film. Kinda grainy picture. Vague shots slightly out-of-focus at times. Some were really nice though, & i'll play again to take more stuffed animal pics (& get the trading cards owing of course).Music was good in parts. Different scenes had various music types, techno, pop, industrial.The story (or goal), is too make an indie game, over the course of 1 week. You choose an activity from a list that includes Work on Game, every day, then watch a scene about what you chose, followed by a Night scene, that i'm guessing was meant to be showing your dream (???). You can't watch all scene's in 1 week, so i guess that's a small bit of re-playability, & you'll need to finish the game twice to get all of the achievements.It's only $1 (i used a coupon & paid 66c), so i think it's worth a try if u want something different, but this isn't what you'd call a game in the normal way. More like a choose-your-own-adventure short-movie. Also, it's over within 15min's per playthrough, so the usual $1 per hour of game = good value, dosn't work here.			"

												First of all, ""Make it Indie"" is not rly a game but appears to be an art movie project for college... at least it is the style of one (since they claim it is a game: bad choice)To the minigame:The Minigame would be a nice small game for its own without the theme of an indie developing team, it is so simple that you can definetly find something similar for free. Though it is a cheap game so ... okay.The Videos have a good quality, but all together it does not feel like the day of an indie developer at all somehow..Questions:In the game you can choose to read a comic... does he own the right to even show content of the comic? Knowing that showing anything from a comic, even if it is just 1-3 pages, without agreement is strictly forbidden... Maybe it is otherwise in communistic rusia though.Also it appears as if in the ""play with friends"" scene he is playing with 1 friend poker but notes scores for 4 people... if you count the cameraguy it is still 3 for a 4 player poker match.The idea of this game was okay, but sadly it did not rly reach me..probably 2/10... maximum 4/10Dont realy regret the buy as it was 0.90 only anyway and got quick achievements and cards but it realy does not look like a proper game..The cat was darn cute though			"

			Gameplay of Make it Indie! A indie game about making of indie game. The ""game"" has a low price tag. And it doesn't endorse smoking. The only two good things about it.		

The music is somekind of awful techno and way too loud.And the gameplay is pretty much nothing.It starts of as a choose you'r own adventure book but all the choices that are presented to you are pointless.You can watch outside the window as it rains for example.Wow.The only choice  that seems to have any point is to develop you're indie game.In which you play a very very simple puzzle for a arbitrary amount of time and then you move on.Between each choice/day you get nightmare scene in the nighttime which don't even seem to be that bad.Sure nightmares are subjective, but those just don't seem like nightmares.There is though one thing that I loved about this game and that is th cute little cat that you can watch :3So cute.So if you haven't guessed yet, I would not recomend this unless you enjoy artsy stuff.It is cheap I'll give it that.Do take a look of my video of the title if you are curious:

												This boils down to a VERY straight forward puzzle game with a VERY thin story around it.  There is also the 'night' which seems more window dressing to try and be edgy than anything related to the puzzle.It doesn't suck, as it was kind of fun to do the puzzle, but more than an hour you will be bored and there is little replay value.In short, get this in a bundle for a few cents or 50% off or more for those wanting a quick 100% achievement game.Within those parameters, its 5/10.Otherwise it is 2.5/10 "

												This ""title"" was extremely disappointing. There is simply no game play other than mindless clicking if you choose to develop the game. Note that it doesn't matter whether you answer the puzzles correctly or not and most of the later puzzles have no right answer so you have to just click randomly!There is no interesting documentary video into the insights of indie developer life either.100% achievements in 15 minutes, and now I have to leave the game running in the background to earn the trading cards with no option (that I can find) to disable the music.

												So instead of a Visual Novel in the traditional sense, this is a visual novel in the very visual sense.... only almost no reading.It features sequences of movies clipped together to simulate a week in the life of an indie developer. There were a few movies or text between movies that actually made me laugh, as the game even pokes fun at itself. Some of the movies in the beginning seem to try to stress the feelings you might have being an indie developer, but toward the end they just get very abstract and I think the dev on this game, just went for random strange stuff that people would interpret in strange ways. Music probably could have been more interesting, but most of it was in Russian(?), and so I couldn't really understand it. Controls only exist really in the mini-game which consists of you spam clicking.... Really kinda boring and one dimensional. Visuals - I would have to say interesting, though when you're wondering if something you've seen is the same thing or if it's something different, you tend to start realizing how bored you are because you want to analyze the waking up bit. WARNING: while the game says that smoking is bad and features scenes of people smoking, what it fails to mention is that it could possibly cause someone an epileptic fit. While you have the ability to skip most movies, which would be fine if you realized in time, this particular video sequence occurs when you are supposed to be 'developing' the game (read as playing mini-game to beat the game). Was extremely short, achievements are easy to get... But still not completely what I'd call a game. Overall 4/10 - Just skip it :/			"

												More effort has been put into the developer's home movies (and stock footage) than the gameplay of Make it indie!. There is no game here, which is ironic, considering the whole premise is to decide between making a game or procrastinating. It would seem that, in the end, procrastination won over this developer but they still decided to mail whatever remnants they had left to Gabe Newell. Too bad that, in this reality, the world didn't explode and relieve the human race of this tragedy.			"

												Every time I get a game free from a giveaway, I would try my best to play through it, see all that it has to offer and if possible, complete it in earnest. Then I would take the time to write an honest review, because for good or ill every review extends the exposure of the title in question, which is what most developers would prefer giveaway winners to help out on.This title however, takes the absolute cake since it was just a bunch of movie clips mashed together under the pretence of a “game”. I fail to see any meaningful messages as I sat through the duration, I failed to see how this managed to get on Steam, I failed to see how moving pictures of a cat can be seen as any point of relevance to game development.I am glad this title does not represent the indie field at large, and that games aren’t meant to be churned out in a week’s game, as this abomination suggested. Seriously, this is the first time where I genuinely felt like I’ve wasted my life on a giveaway.			"

												My playtime: 26m (based on steam)IntroMake it Indie! is a game about a man (you) who wants to make an indie game in a week. You'll plan on what the man will do in the 7 days and your choice will affect the result. During game development, there will be a mini game to ""simulate"" how the making of indie game works. There are 2 endings in this game; all depends on your choice. This game mostly consists of videos which i think make the game size to be quite large, around 1 GB.GraphicsThe graphics basically is just a text which is placed on several places with an image to fill the screen with (and no, i don't think it looks good except the image in the scene where you have to choose what to do during the day). During the mini game, there will be several images changed as a background which will disturb your concentration. If you choose to not working on the game during the day, you'll be presented with a video which is.. terrible. It seems that the video is skipped every few seconds and my head hurts because of it. I ended up skipping the entire video after i watch 2 videos.MusicThe ending music sounds pleasant after hearing all those terrible sounds in the game (especially in the videos). Other than that, there is nothing to say.Mini gameYou'll be prompted to do a mini game if you choose to work on your game. The game will provide you with circles which has been cut in 4. Some parts in the circle will be missing and you have to find the part which is on the circles provided. You'll receive good ending if you find the right parts 77 times during the whole week (and you can't track how many you did it right). However, the background can make you crazy. It keeps on changing every few seconds and some has a really bright color.Pros:- 2 endingsCons:- Terrible videosConclusionThis game mostly consists of videos with a mini game on it.Should you buy this game?No.This game can be finished in less than an hour (it can be finished in 5 minutes according to a guide if you choose to skip all videos. Fyi, this game is around 1 GB, and the videos are terrible. "

												TL;DR: A game making the point that you cannot make a game unless you devote a big chunk of your time to actually do it. There, I spoiled it for you. But then again, Make it indie! has very few actual gameplay features. It advertises that it's a game about surviving as an indie developer for a week. The problem is, it's not really a game about that. It's hardly a game at all.The concept sounds awesome. What do you have to do to make it through the week as an indie developer, to push for that deadline? Maybe you'd have to make a timetable and try to manage your time between game development, designing, art work, writing, sound design and also free time and relaxing. Require the player to put that into the right order to come up with the game. Perhaps even require keeping your hunger, exhaustion and focus at bay. Throw in a couple of events you need to take into account, like a birthday party or some special holiday. Voilà! So how's the execution of that anticipation in this game?It's poor. It's outright appalling. It's the bare bones of what I expected with fluff all over it. In the game, every day you have a choice of basically two options: either use the time for developing the game or goofing around. There are eight kinds of goofing around. Choosing any shows you a video of the developer goofing around: e.g. playing with his cat, being at a party or playing poker with his friends, with no gameplay whatsoever. Then the night comes and you get to see videos of weird dreams. They are potentially epilepsy inducing with all the flashing lights. All in all, no games were developed that day.I found these videos to be ""artsy"", in that bad way where you get bored and awkward and feel tempted to skip but cannot in case you miss something interesting. There's some angsty, varying music on the backgrounds of the videos. It varies from heavy metal to eerie ambience to some experimental stuff and unfortunately I liked none of it. At least every video grants you an achievement.If you instead choose to develop your game, like you probably should, you get a taunty hint of how meager your attempt is and then get to play a tedious game of ""developing"". It's the same game every day, just more difficult and more tedious every time because of the horrible music and varying background that camouflages the game pieces you are trying to identify. A cringing sound plays in the background making the experience agonizing (it made me take off my headphones). That seems to be the whole point too: the game developer's life is hard and boring work.I watched all the videos and played the game through to its two different endings (""bad"" and ""good"" one) in 40 minutes and still have to idle it to get the trading cards if I care enough. It costs just 1 € so you don't lose much anything but time for it. Fortunately, its Store Page itself warns you not to take the game too seriously. My warning is this: it is not a game developing simulator. In fact, there's no game here to begin with.			"

												I think 'this thing' can be broken into several scenes, so it would be easier to rate.The 'wake up' scenes are something I can do by myself aswell, every day, even in a better way than what was presented here.The 'development' phase was something I just clicked through, nothing worthy, beside 1-2 pretty background pictures.The only positive side I would highlight: I liked the 'night' videos, along with the moon scenes, which comes every day after the calendar.Those videos are really atmospheric, like some kind of contemporary art.The 'watch for the cat' scenes, with that music is just hilarious.And the rest of the 'attention diverting activities' videos?Just exactly the same, what you would expect after the previous items, nothing remarkable to mention about them.If you read this review through, you already put way too much effort into this 'game'.Your attention deserves better.Ps.: Did it for the achievments, (and later idle farm for the cards), no regrets.Sorry guys, who made this thing: 'Maybe another time...'

												‘Make it indie!’ isn’t meant to be a game. It is one of those completely out-of-this-world college art films which try to be so non-mainstream that nobody understands them. And it somehow ended up as a Steam store item.In our case this product is a collection of about a dozen of 1-2 minute collage videos that represent the everyday life of a Russian indie game developer who struggles between his self-imposed obligations of creating a game or just living life as it is. If one really wants to analyse it as an allegory, maybe interesting discussions could come out of it. Although I highly doubt that this was the intention of the developer.

   It's said, in some places around the world. That some forms of art. Like paintings, and many others. May only reach the feelings of a group of individuals, or even just one. But, since art is something that changes from person-to-person. Even  if 95% of the worlds hates it. It still can be called as Art.  This game is like non-other that you might have played in your life. In Summary i would actually say that it's an Interactive Story. With two almost certain endings:1. You create a new Minecraft. And fail with your friends, and therefore with the things that makes you a human.2. You fail with yourself. But, you will still be able to be called as a human.Now, there's another thing that this game has which any other hasn't. And maybe, not even it's developer know's that it has. And that is... This game indirectly abords the ""Procratinating Act."" ~~Not Wikipedia, it's basically living without producing anything, and in idle mode,~~  Now, you might be asking yourself. Especially if you already have played the game. How can this game talk about procrastinating... Well, as you start the game. You'll receive some options on what to do with your time. That's--- let's say.. some are from the ""have fun type"", and the other's about ""wasting time./letting the time go away."" And, the most important of all, work in your game. A game that have to be ready in 7 days.  Make it indie, has one of the most unique approaches to creating a game in a personal and psychological approach. Since, it talks about something i've always felt and thought about when working. And i'm sure a lot of other folks have felt it too. Which is the idea of.. Why must i do this, if i can go elsewhere and have fun?... Why must i work on this game if i can go out with my friends? Why should i dedicate my time and life into making a game, if i don't even know if people will buy it?A lot of indie developers, really go through this, since some of them have family's. family which is going to need them. along with parents who need's their support or this kind of thing... Also, you get this feeling when you are starting to work with games, and start trying to ""Breach into the business"".   For real, this game is unique. It has not only showed me a new vision about how i'm wasting my time/ how i should invest my time. But also made me realize that i'm not the only one with this vision about working.  The only real problem with this game is that, it's not a game at all. And, as i stated before. Some sort of intective story. At long last, If you are a developer. Or someone that likes some pretty cool russian rock. Or someone who think's that has been only procrastinating. You can buy this game. With no fear, it will be worth every coin. Besides all those negatives reviewes are it's page. ---//----Brazilian Portuguese version.---//__\\---Versão Português do Brasil.---\\----  É dito pelo mundo que formas de representação da arte, como pinturas tendem a atingir apenas um grupo de pessoas ou até mesmo uma pessoa. E pela arte ser algo subjetivo, a mesma pode ser interpretada diferentemente por cada um... Mesmo que odeiem a sua pintura, ainda será arte.  Este game não será como nenhum outro que jogou. Eu diria que é até mesmo uma historia interativa com dois finais premeditáveis.1. Você cria o próximo Minecraft. e falha com seus amigos e logo o que te faz humano.2. Você falha consigo mesmo. Mas, mantém suas amizades assim como as coisas que te fazem feliz.  Agora, o que este jogo tem que nenhum outro tem. E que talvez nem mesmo o desenvolvedor sabia que estava fazendo.. É que esse jogo aborda de leve o tema da Procrastinação. ~~Em palavras baixas, não produzir e só esperar~~  Você deve estar se perguntando como.. E se já jogou principalmente... Bem, o jogo lhe dá algumas opções para se fazer que são ""do tipo diversão"" ou ""deixar o tempo passar."" Ou, e a mais importante. Trabalhar em seu jogo. Jogo qual deve ser terminado em 7 dias. E o mais único desse jogo é que, ele aborda diretamente algo que eu sempre senti e achei muito importante e que muitas pessoas também sentem. Que é a ideia de quê~~ Para que vou fazer isso se posso ir me divertir.. Para que vou trabalhar no meu jogo se posso sair com meus amigos. Para que me dedicar nisso, se provavelmente ninguém comprará meu jogo.  Muitos desenvolvedores indie realmente passam por isso. Tanto quando você não tem muitas preocupações, como quando tem várias... Como família para cuidar, ou parentes doentes. Assim como você está começando e querendo entrar no mercado.  Este jogo é único e me mostrou que não só eu que tenho essa visão sobre desenvolver e sobre como gastar meu tempo.  O único problema deste jogo é que ele não é um jogo em si. E sim, como eu disse acima. Uma forma de história interativa.  Enfim, caso você seja um desenvolvedor ou alguém que goste de uns rocks russos bem♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pode comprar sem medo, vai valer a pena cada moeda. E caso queira confirmar o que eu disse, compre também. E tente ver o jogo com bons olhos e não com os olhos dos haters que largam análises negativas.			"

												What can i say about the game.  It is rather unusual and specific. You play role of Indie developer and have 1 week to complete the game. From the begging the game tells you to do something. You can play poker with friends/ listen to music or of corse create the game. What would you do? Waste time with friends waiting for the deadline or work hard and reach good results.I cant say that this game would make you happy. To my mind it's main idea is to make you think about you time/abilities/duties. Make it indie made me think over my free time. It can be compared to cinema. Some films dont entertaim you but gives some themes to think about.8/10 in the genre of such games			"

I got 64/77 developer points at the end, hoorah! Sound like a pretty good score to me, but it looks like it isn't, since I wasn't able to develop a game. And I only ""worked on the game"", no ""playing with friends"" or ""watching the rain/for the cat"" at all! Blasphemy! P.P.S.

Few videos (boring and useless if you ask me) and music tracks and a sort of game with not much sense (spam random clicks works better than follow the instructions ...and i'm not joking).You can do all the achievement in less than 5 minutes.Don't worth the 0.99€ they ask for it ...probably don't worth your time even if you can have this ""game"" for free.

												Make it Indie, is a very abstract game. It is quite fascinating, but sometimes confusing.it describes what an indie developer feels like. I speak from experience. It however comes very close to a telltale game, however the small touches are very cool. The nightmares however could be tweaked much more.All n all this is a great game, worth a dollar. Its something small, for when you feel in an indie developer mood. ;)			"

												This isn't a game as such, it has interactive elements but they are more of an allegory for the development process than an actual game itself.I think people are under appreciating what this actually is. It's an artistic expression representing the life a an indie developer. Working on the game option is how you come to a ""good ending"" but alternatively you can chose to witness 7 days of activities, normal things like watching your cat or listening to the rain. Things that might make you stop and daydream for a while. After each day however, the night ensues bringing with it the obscure fragments of discorded sounds and a malaise of out of focus images. Taking influences from every day activities is a ways of formulating ideas. Drawing from everyday life and dreams is how fantastic creations are made, be it works of art, music or games.It's an important reminder of the developers who have the skills to create but the agony of translating the realms of imagination into a format people can enjoy as a playable game.Don't be too quick to judge Make it Indie! Try to enjoy it for what it is.			"

You can spend it by either making an indie game(which you are supposed to do) or play with friends, draw thing and watch your cat.

												DISCLAIMER: I received this game for free, I'm not sure why.Make it Indie is a game which claims to be about surviving seven days as an indie developer. In reality its like a piece of surreal art with shape matching thrown in.If you like either of those things you will probably enjoy this game long enough to get the steam cards.I personally didn't.I played through it twice, once for the Good end and once for the bad. I made sure to click each option at least once to see it what it was.I found it fitting that the game itself crashed multiple times when I ""tried to work on the game"". It also automatically quit at the end and had no real menu.The music wasn't anything special. The videos would have greatly benefited from a fast forward button in addition to pressing zero to skip them. On the plus side, it was creative. It wasn't creative enough to make me recommend the game, but still its a point in the developer's favor.			"

												Is this game worth the .66 cents i spent on it? I guess so only for these reasons. 1. a look in to Russian society with a little bit of a filter but no traveling...interesting 2.  Watch some amateur editing and hideous music tracks. 3. 3 cards 4. Two things i thought i would never say in a video game review a) The ergonomics of your desk and chair without armrests is painful to look at. How do you do it? b) Could you hang-up that picture plz? I was hoping during the 60 minute game if part of it would have to do with hanging it up :) The 3 cards are almost worth the game if sold, I did have a steam coupon.			"

												Just as stupid as the other reviews indicate.  If you just want 100% achievements, go through the list of actions(aside from working on the game) from top to bottom, and it '0' to skip everything.  Then, if you have an autoclicker, just let it run on one of the corners of the 'puzzle' game for the good ending.  Only recommending this since I got it 50% off ($0.49) and I got 100% of the achievements in 4 minutes flat from install to writing this review.			"

												Make it Indie! Is an Indie game about making an Indie game, sounds fun, well.... it isn't really, you don't really do anything, except click.First off, spam “0“ on your keyboard, this will get you the “Bad Ending” in about 20 seconds!Next up the actual game, trying to make the Indie game of your dreams!Wake up, make game, how do I .. ? click the wedges in random sequences, day over, night time, watch random cut scene (Or press the infamous 0 key), rinse and repeat.That's it basically, what  I will say is the game has a pretty good retro/chip tune soundtrack, cheap price and Trading cards, but otherwise, it tries hard to be funny, is about 10 minutes long and ultimately isn't a game, more of a “click here to get over and done with” "

												I am not as dead against this as many people are but it is not something that I can recomend to anyone. It is clearly intended as more of an interactive movie than a fully fledged game so bear that in mind if considering  a purchase. Make it Indie is a russian game designed as a jibe at the process of indie game development and can easily be seen as a take-down of the current indie game market. It contains a lot of poorly translated english but that's not surprising considering A) It's an indie game B) it's a Russian game, they were clearly not going to have enough money to get a decent translation performed. Gameplay there is very little to talk about as it consists of a manu that links to several different video clips and a singluar mini-game where you click on one of four segments of a circle. It's very basic but the 'gameplay' section is clearly intended to reflect the monotony of developing a game, this does not make it good or enjoayble however. Clearly effort has gone into this game, however it's also clear that it could have been made in a 24 hour game competition without loosing much. As for the fact is was developed using Unity Personal, so what? Unity Personal does not mean that it should not be sold. Games devloped in Unity Personal can still be sold commercially as it says in the license when you download it. CONCLUSION - 6/10Although I cannot actually recomend this game it is not at all bad for 79p (I assume prices will vary outside the UK) It is very basic but what do you expect for what it is. There is no gameplay but you might extract some pleasure through playing through it once, and if you want some quick cards/achievements then you cannot go wrong.			"

And these videos are so f ucked-up, psychadealic b ullshit of which the developer may think that they have a deeper meaning, or he just wanted easy money. He was probably drunk devolping the game. Or on drugs. Dude, you need some serious help if that's the case. The Music is as awful, terrifying and as cringy as possible and I had a headache after 20 Minutes of this torture.

												I think where this developer went wrong is making people expect something that it isn't .Saying ""survive the horrors"" makes people think its a survival horror game- it's not.Saying ""Make It Indie! is an indie game about making an indie game."" makes you think you will be constructing some sort of game as part of the game. You don't. Saying ""Over 30 minutes of HD videos that immerses the player"" makes you think it will be artistically beautiful and atmospheric. It isn't.Saying ""An intuitive gameplay experience."" makes you think you're going to be introduced to some unique gameplay mechanics. It doesn't.Saying ""Truly diverse music tracks."" makes you think you're going to hear some engaging and immersive game music. You don't.Saying ""P.S. Don't take this game too seriously!"" doesn't change much.If you set your people up to think the game is something completely different than it is, you're setting yourself up for a lot of disappointed and negative reviews. The game in itself, while it is very arthouse and probably not to everyone's taste, has nothing really wrong with it. It's just that people were expecting something very different. Be more accurate in describing your next game and the people who do choose to buy your game will most likely be positive, as it will have been aimed at the right audience.			"

												This is the first game I've actually bothered to use the new refund system with, and that's saying something, because I've played a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that most would refund straight away but I tolerate for some reason.I sure hope they approve it... I've learned my lesson now about leaving games for a while after buying them.I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥ even is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ For starters, it has the ""developed with Unity Personal Edition"" thing still in the intro. That's how you know this is going to be good. And then you have a full-motion video that tells you absolutely nothing about... anything at all, really. Apparently, this is supposed to be about how making a game works. But it's just a random clip of.... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I couldn't really tell. So you have a week apparently to make a game (who's setting that deadline?), and you have options to choose from including ""Work on game"", and things that aren't ""Work on game"". Why in the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ would you ever choose things that aren't make the game? I can procrastinate in real life and it has much better graphics and gameplay than this.So you choose that, and it's just... some weird thing where you have three circles and some of them have quadrants taken out, and in the bottom you choose a quadrant that all three of the circles still have. That's the game. The whole ♥♥♥♥ing game. That, and the cutscenes which have nothing to do with anything and convey no information, entertainment, insight, or whatever.This is game? I have seen game, but this is not game.Update: They didn't approve it. Fair enough, Valve doesn't want to admit they even sold me this game.			"

												I got a coupon for this game for %50 off (The game cost $0.49).  I thought I'd give it a try so I went ahead and bought it.  I would rather watch water evaporate.  It was horrible.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Instead, I suggest going out to your local store and buying a gallon of paint, and painting it on a wall.  Grab a nice chair and set it in front of the painted wall and stare at it until it dries.  After it's dry paint more paint over it and watch it again. Repeat the process until you run out of paint.  Surprisingly it would be more fun than this game, or actually, it's not even a game.  It feels like I took 49 cents and threw it on the ground and then an bird came by and picked it up and flew away with it.  I feel like I was ripped off.  This game should be free only because it isn't even a real game, and the videos are horrible too.  If you think you want to buy this, don't.  Even if you have a coupon.  I wouldn't.			"

												My biggest problem with this ""game"", is that I'm not sure if it's a ""artistic"" critique on the gaming industry, or just a lazy work...Feels like a rushed, lazy school project. Good consept, uncomplete result... It also feels exactly like many uncomplete games out there that come with heavy marketing and steep prices... So as a game, its absolutely not worth it... It doesn't have anything, only two possible endings, and each day you actually get to choose between two posibilities, work on the game, or don't work on the game. Whether you make a perfect score on the minigame (which would mean a great result on the game you make) or you barely make it has no difference, in both cases you get the ""good ending"". Just like this game barely made it, but they still charge you for it...In conclusion, it's either a very good ctirique, or such a bad game, that it becomes a good critique...!  I'll have to downvote it, since either way, it's not worth paying and playing... I praise the critique though, intentional or not!			"

												I literally got an email claiming that I got it for free when I don't remember singing up.I found out I did later, but that's beside the point.Normally, I would make a funny comment or do something stupid, like if I reviewed Bad Rats and how it's worth card farming.This game is not worth it.First off, were introduced into some weird narrative with quality ripped from a PS1 compressed video file, then we're told of some guy who wants to develop a game in a week.Simple enough.The only thing is is that it gives you the option to do other♥♥♥♥♥♥Why?I dunno.Either way, I played through it doing what I would do and apparently, I failed.51/77 developer points, whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that means.You get an artsy cutscene for anything that isn't working on the game, and working on the game is a snore.You click quadrants on a circle.That's it.No fun.No purpose.They didn't make it tasteful.They didn't make it funny.They just did it.And it failed.Oh did it fail.All in all, if this were free, I'd say hell yeah, pick it up and give it a go, but to even put a price on such an underestimated, content flimsy piece of crap, it's not worth your time.I wouldn't suggest pirating it either.Not worth the effort.

												Despite the fact that it has quite a few negative reviews and it is considered as an April's Fools joke, I had fun playing this not-so-much of a game but more of an interactive story.You are given 7 days to develop a game; as gameplay, each day you can choose between: working on the game - you have to play a mini game for a few seconds; you get points and having enough points in the end will unlock the ""Good ending"" (this requires you to pick this option every day) doing another fun activity (watch the rain, watch over the cat, play with friends etc.) - you will be shown a 1-2 minute video, artistically edited; picking this option will still award achievements, but you won't get enough points in the end towards developing the game, so you will unlock the ""Bad ending"".If you didn't take part in the WGN promotion (that offered free keys for this game), then you might want to decide if this game is worth $1, considering that a full playthrough is only 15-20 minutes.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												So, this game had everything I ever wanted out of a 39p game in the steam sale. It contained sick wall art of cats, vapin', and a guy walking down a snowy road who looks like he killed a dude. The plot touched me in a way I never expected due to the terrifying dolls in the exhibition. I think I may infact have PTSD, I am seeing those dolls in my dreams and they make my cry a bit from the bottom of my soul. This is bad, because this will involve long sessions in the hospital and in front of therapists, but I am sure I will make it through.On the bright side however, since I only .39p for this game, it is infact possible to spin a net profit on it through selling steam trading cards, as there is one that is listed at 11p. That comes out to a nice 5p profit! As such, this makes this a game of superior quality than Assassin's Creed: Unity, or The Witcher 3.I give it 80/77 developer points. As evidenced by the points I have given you, this game is infact perfect, so please release a Game of the Year edition with horse armour packed in.			"

												Wouldn't really call it a game, it's more like a video collection and a casual clicking game. It's pretty easy to beat. I got it for free, and includes Steam achievements and trading cards. So there's nothing I can complain about, it's good for killing some time and if you want a 100% steam achievements in a game. As far as I know it was free on Desura.PS. I have to admit that I really liked the russians rock songs in the game.			"

												Lacks a great deal of substance, provides no real insight to indie game development, and is basically a short clip show. Achievements are earned every day no matter what you do, and aside from one minigame, nothing you do has any bearing on the game or its ending - only your performance on that minigame does and even then it is underwhelming.  Would really recommend avoiding this unless it is in a bundle, as I can't justify paying for it.			"

But, as it stands, this game is a collection of photos, videos and random sounds very loosely held together by a matching game that makes up the actual gameplay, with little to no replay value. You will 100% the game in one playthrough, and the game closes when you finish (making getting the trading cards a little difficult).1/10, seems either 3deep5me or like it's the first elimination at a game jam.

												This game is such a waste of money...The only game play is you click occasionally and then it lags to determine what you just clicked.  The funny part about that is that sometimes you only have the option to click one thing so what's up with the random lag?  The rest of the game is random video clips and low quality music (that happens to not be English).  The achievements are given to you for watching your real life waste away as the game ""plays"" itself.  Don't spend any of your money on this even though it is cheap because it is cheap in every way including but not limitted to: cost to purchase, cost to make, graphics, music, sound, gameplay, etc.I was looking forward to a game with substance and the developers tried, but if you want substance look elsewhere for a game.

												If they wanted to make a game about making games. Why not just do stuff like Game Dev Tycoon. Overall, I just hated it.There is really no gameplay involved. You just clikc a few buttons to watch a video recorded with a crappy camera. Also lots of copyrighted music for those who wanted to record this.			"

												Well, this game is a bit special. I did like it, the concept and all, but it's way too short, with very little replay values. Also, it's quite repetitive, if you actually decide to work on ""your"" indie game. Just like in real life. Just to say, it took me 15 minutes to get everything, and I spent the rest of the total time waiting for Steam Trading Cards.It's a really simple game. You have a week, a total of 7 actions, which consist pretty much as ""Work on your indie game"" or ""Do not work on your indie game"". Obviously, it's not /that/ obvious, but with little to no thinking, it's almost as obvious. If you decide to work, you get a little puzzle game that's quite simple at first, getting harder day after day. While, if you decide to have fun, you get treated to a short video.Basically, it's ""video or logic game"". You also get to see a video every night.Thought, I do have to give the game some points, since it gives a great moral lesson: ""You can do everything you want, if you actually spend time towards your goals.""Even if it's repetitive, boring, uninspiring, if you work toward what you want to do, if you work to do what you want, you only need to invest time in it, and eventually, you'll do it. Maybe not in a weekend.You can actually finish the game in 5 minutes, since the author thought about making a skip video button, which is sometimes a real time saver.This game is quite original, there's some place for improvements, but it gets bland and repetitive way too soon. If you're an achievement hunter or someone who wants a really cheap game on steam, this is the game for that.			"

												This ""game"" thaught me that playing with friends leads me to an alcoholic/gambling party where everybody smokes and get stoned (again), that if i watch a cat, later i have to draw it, cuz im so high (still). If i go outside i may meet strange people who speaks crappy language. That an exhibition is, a creepy store for Antiquees (most of them cats). and...wait what is this?...im high (again) so better continue my review....If i listen music, maybe there's the same crappy band that play along my journey (in that crappy language= ahh yes... is the soundtrack o'my life...  but: i must work on a game. Developing a game... wait: Am i a developer? wait: what? ive been watching this guy awakening  every morning ""with a bone"", after nightmares involving sex with cats and toys, and a band that sounds more stoned than as i am right now!nice trading cards!ps:I know what U did here...    10/10 ill become a developer as You !

												I wish Steam had a ""meh"" icon, especially for games like this.This is one of the many video games that can be used as evidence that video games are, in fact, an art medium and a method of expression. That being said, it is a wonderful piece of art, and I applaud this piece wholeheartedly for reaching that. However, as a video game, it is quite lacking.			"

												Technically this is just a movie and the only thing that could even qualify this as a game is where you try to make your indie game,but even then,that little mini game is way too easy to master and gets boring really fast. The main reason I even own this game is cause I got it in a bundle with a ton of other games that I actually wanted.This game could have been way better as it did have a tiny bit of potential of being a good game. Other than that this game is literally 99% cutscenes and no game play what so ever unless you only continue to work on your indie game,which is where you just playing a minigame that has a differenct background each time.Though if you really do wanna get this game to try it out,etc. Just try your best to get it in a bundle with game you want like I did or wait till this game is put on sale,cause this isnt worth full price,personally to me this game should have been free to play,since you can't get any enjoyment out of this game literally.

												So, this game is supposed to be an april's-day-joke. And it is one. And I am not entirely sure, if it is a good one. This thing is one of the few few exceptions where I really sturrgle to consider it a game. it is hard to say. It is somehow funny, but I have no idea if it is good funny or only sad funny. So, let me tell you one thing about this game: it is very likely that you will hate it. Really really hate it. So don't try it or you will feel to rage in the forums and in your review and anywhere else on the internet. Or else, if you have 1 € and 30 minutes time left, you can try it. Maybe you won't like it. But it may be interesting for you., it sure was for me.			"

												as crazy as it may sound... I kind of liked it. I got it for free (and you can too, there is a link for review/press copies in the steam forums for this game) and even if I were to pay a dollar for it, I wouldn't be too mad with what I got. It was a nice little experience. I wish it was a bit longer but still. I enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for artsy kinda stuff like this. The game you play when you're ""making your indie game"" is kinda fun, I wish there was some kind of endless mode where it kept track of your score.overall, Don't buy this if you think this is some cheap alternative to ""Indie Dev Tycoon""DO buy this if you enjoy artsy little experiences. It took me around 15 minutes to get both endings but still. I like it. I may come back to it just to see all the little movies again.			"

If the game was longer and had a more thought out storyline it would be interesting, it took me 10 minuets to complete the whole game.As well as that the music is very loud and some of the grammar is off.It is a really cool concept for a game but the execution let it down.(I feel so mean sorry x)			"

												Possibly one of the worst games I've ever played. The only mechanic is a simple puzzle that you don't even have to complete. Simply sit back and wait for the ""music"" to finish and you've completed that segment. I'm not even sure if I beat the game or if it simply broke when I got to the end. Either way, I've selected uninstall for my ending. Would recommend to absolutely nobody.			"

												Tags : Adventure - FMV - Photo/FilmTags : Delete Local Content & Hide from LibraryTLDR : Its trashReview : Make it Indie is an interactive FMV movie with a clicker game mashed together. The whole game are 7 sections in which you can play the clicker game or watch one of the dev's amateur footage out of his russian hometown. I found the footage rather entertaining and he did put some rather neat local russian music to go along with it. The footage is meant to represent what you would do for fun activities when not actively trying to develop a game, as you are after all, an indie game dev supposed to be making a game.The first option, game development, is thus a clicker game where a circle is divided in four pie parts, you click on the pie part that all 4 pies have in common to earn a point, you must earn 77 points over the 7 maximum attempts to be ¨rewarded¨ with the ending in which you actually complete an indie game.In between each section is an abstract dream section, there are only 3 or 4 dream footages so it is very easy to see the same ones over and over again and since they are random expect to have to use that skip button.Either way in the end the game tells you that you either made a game or didnt, does not really seem to care if you did or not, and gives you the end credits. It is not all that hard to complete the game and see the totality of the content and takes about 30 to 40 minutes if you watch all the footage and replay twice I would estimateThere doesnt seem to be a very strong narrative, or message, or social commentary about game development. It is for better or for worse, exactly as I stated above, a clicker game, amateur hometown footage, and a game that tells you that what you are doing is pointlessAs an adventure game it falls flat, and provides little to no entertainment over doing nearly anything else, and it begs to question how much of the intent of this was serious and not just a cheap cash grabArtistically I will withold my commentary as I do not critique film making, but I am sure other reviewers will be helpful with that "
