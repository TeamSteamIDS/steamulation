												There are a few things to take into account when buying this game, 1:  This isn't an indepth racer or car modification game2: The purchase price reflects what sort of game to expect, (although I was actually pleasantly surprised)3:  If you remember playing Street Rod 1 & 2 for DOS this game is kind of a modern evolution on it but with more hydraulics, bling and much less frustation (remember Mulholland drive races?)I enjoyed it.

												I'm just gonna make a list of the good things and the bad things in the game;Good things- CustomizationBad things- Horrible handling on all cars- Repetitive races (Drag races most of the times, or just some small track)- Sometimes impossible opponents (They just have a faster car than you)- No controller support- Graphics are not that great- Only a few car models- Steam overlay doesn't work ingame- The songsOverall, I would recommend this game, if you like to customize old cars into lowriders.But if you want to buy a game which has good car customization and decent races, you shouldn't buy this game. The game is 5,99€ at the moment in Steam, personally I think that is a bit too much for this game.If you get it for like an euro or two, then you should think about getting it.			"

												I've reached Rank 1 and finished the game, here's my view.The handling is terrible so let's rule out all the circuit racing etc. Drag racing is incredibly easy. I slaughtered everything in my path every time. Betting full amount I can each time I had copious amounts of money, bought the best I could and once I reached the boss, well... he was too easy.The customising part is minimal. Has a few set things you can do. Things such as wheel size can affect speed so there are small factors that can come into play but you're never that close in races for it to matter other than you own personal best 1/4 mile times etc. As for styling you can do a few basic things but nothing major. Paint, wheels, tires, ride height, window tints, and some special things like gold trim.There is a mode where you can use hydraulics to complete in competitions. I can't get it to score any points in the freestyle no matter how much I try. Probably bugged. It's fun to play around with hydros for a few mins in the test mode but it gets boring after that.It has a score system for reputation for each race. No idea what that does. I think it might affect multiplier in the hydro mode but again, can't score, so useless.I was hoping it would get more difficult as the game went on but nothing changed. It was the same from start to finish.			"

												Allright, lets cut to the chase. If you are buying this for the drag racing and the one on one racing, dont. It will dissapoint you in that category. However, if you like to screw around with customization and like lowriders then i suggest it. The game physics are kind of odd, the cars are nearly impossible to steer. The money is way too hard to earn, and usually the races are painfully repetitive. That being said, an external program can cure the money earning issue, i wont disclose the details on that though for obvious reasons. For the 5 dollar price tag, i could say thats a little expensive for a game of this caliber but if you can find it on sale that is a better idea. If you like lowriders this is the game for you, and until someone else releases a game like this on steam this is the only game purchaseable on steam that focuses on lowriders (as far as i know).

												This game is amazing, but in order to enjoy it you have to know what you're doing. Cause this game is REALLY DETAILED. It involves a lot of modifying to your car. I love the hydraulic competitions and the racing. Im walking out of them with a ton of money to add more to my cars. Yea, a lot of nice cars; they give them different names though. Like the Impala is called a Gazelle and the El Camino is called a Walker. Fun and addicting game overall, get it!			"

												Before going into Ride 'em Low, you must realize and accept that it is a low budget niche title. The production values are very low, and the mechanics are quite limited for a racing/driving game. Being a fan of racing games and having grown up in a city where modified cars were a part of its culture, this game quickly caught my attention. Sadly, it did not fully satisfy my expectations. The pleasant surprise arrived when I noticed the many parallels to the Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2 DOS games I played many hours as a kid. The premise and mechanics are very similar, and all three games also share similar problems and limitations. You start the game with a lump sum of cash, head over to the car dealer, and buy a classic muscle car of your choice. From there, you will begin racing other drivers and then modifying your vehicle with your race earnings. You will also be able to gain respect points with each race win. On the other hand, races that are lost will decrease your respect points and decrease your savings. I have found little to no value of having any amount of respect. What matters most in Ride 'em Low is money. It will get you part upgrades, new cars, cosmetic changes, and best of all, it will move you up the drivers' ranking. The game relies heavily on your income while driving skills have nearly zero impact on the outcome of races, unless you are competing in the top ten. In addition, car part upgrades do not scale well at all in comparison to your direct competitors in the driver ranking. Because of these flaws, progression in Ride 'em Low means you will be forced to grind wins for money against lower ranked drivers with much inferior cars in comparison to yours. After a few hours of grinding, the game suddenly clicks together, and you will be progressing through the ranks and acquiring upgrades enjoyably. After much racing and climbing up the ranks, you will quickly realize that maxing out all available upgrades for your current car are not enough, and you must purchase a better automobile. The feeling of improvement as you buy new parts or upgrade your existing ones is satisfying. There are even subtle audio differences depending on what parts you have equipped. Edging out an opponent for a win that you have lost to previously is quite fun and rewarding. As I mentioned before, winning races has very little to do with your gained skills as a driver, but everything to do with how expensive and powerful your vehicle has become through part upgrades. With that said, there is some minor experimenting with tweaking your car's gear differential in order to achieve better overall performance. As you calibrate this, you will be able to go on test drives and find out how well the changes have impacted the car's acceleration. This can be fun after each major upgrade, and depending on the parts, differential configurations do make a difference in beating an opponent in certain events. Which introduces another major flaw in the game. There is a severe lack of tracks to race on. Even though there are four different race modes, each utilizing alternate track variations, they are far from exciting, and do not feel like an actual event. There aren't any city drivers around, ever. If the developers had added city drivers throughout the tracks and some interaction with the police, the game would have been so much better. This goes in line with the rest of the game's lack of polish and content. It's also very clear that there is much to be desired graphically. The car models have had the most attention, while the tracks and other objects around them have low resolutions and look like they are about fifteen years out of date. Competing against your opponents as you go up to the number one rank can be fun, but not in all race modes. Strangely enough, drag racing is the race mode I prefer to take part in. It's fast, satisfying, and puts your parts tweaking to the test in their purest of forms. There are three other longer race modes around very bland and uninteresting tracks, but I resentfully participated in them. The cars available to the players are all very large and heavy beasts of classic machinery. They handle, feel, and move like massively heavy boats on quicksand, and racing them around tight corners and chicanes is not fun in any way. The car physics while racing are decent, but the weight and feel of the cars as you turn are not fitting to how they should handle and perform after being fine tuned with expensive, maximum performance parts and engines. In Ride 'em Low the only simulation aspect is left to car part modification and upgrades. I have hit a solid cement wall going over 215 miles per hour a few times, backed up, and continued on the race without any problems. I have also been involved in or witnessed some extremely unrealistic but funny crashes, only to see the cars land back on the road and continue driving to win the race. Going back to the game not requiring very much of your driver skills and track experience, the true opponent challenges will only exist when you reach each of the events' top ten driver ranking. Then, the developers opted to provide you with some artificial difficulty, as many of your opponents will be driving the exact same or inferior cars and go much faster than you, even if your top of the line car has maximum upgrades and the absolute best parts. There is also some senseless performance instability coming from your opponents. Sometimes you will have to drive the same challenger more than once, and their performance will become better or worse, seemingly at random even though they are the same driver with the same car as before. The uninspired tracks also suffer from some bugs. Sometimes your car will be stuck to a light post or even a sidewalk. The only way to continue is to go to the menu and restart the race. The game client itself also has some awful problems regarding the occasional crash and the operating system's sound. After each time I play Ride 'em Low, it causes severe issues with the system sound, completely muting most of the channels, in addition to producing some very strange noises during gameplay. The only way to get the system's sound back to normal is to restart Windows. This is clearly an issue tied to Ride 'em Low alone, as I have not experienced anything like it from any other game or software. Besides the main racing events, there is also a hydraulics competition. In this event, there is no racing involved at all. Your task is to equip your vehicle with hydraulic suspensions and perform for a high score. While the idea is novel and there aren't that many games that provide the player with such a genuine lowrider experience, once you do three or four of these, there isn't really a reason to participate again. The main event in the game is truly the actual racing, and your objective is to reach the number one spot in all four racing competitions. There is a surprising amount of fun to be had tuning and racing classic muscle cars, and the game thankfully does not outstay its welcome. If you can ignore and overlook some serious flaws, and if you liked Street Rod 1 and Street Rod 2, then Ride 'em Low is at least worth a try.Ride 'em Low is okay.			"

												I had some hopes when trying this game out, I shouldn't have. I don't know what is worst about the game, but I'll just point out some facts:- Specs are pretty high, had to turn some graphic options down on my notebook (i5 with Nvidia 3100 1 Gb and 8 Gb DDR3) to run 100% smooth. I expected good graphics when I saw that, I was wrong- Graphics look like a 90's game, some light effects and shadows that seem to be more modern, but it still sucks.- Gameplay seemed promising from the description but it's just awefull. Racing sucks, car control is bad, turning just makes you lose speed, which is low anyways, you can't hit or do anything to your opponent, you will always race in straight lines, car upgrades have sick prices and you get close to no upgrade. you have to bet your money on races on straight lines and you will lose to opponents with weaker cars if you don't upgrade enough. There is no fun in the gameplay, that's the worst part. Play it only if you want to see some low riders cars and if yo uare bored to look at google images (which have a lot better graphics btw).One of the worst games I ever played			"

												Ever wanted to play a low budget version of Need For Speed Underground? Probably not, right?GraphicsEven though it has been a while since i've played NFS:Underground, I would say graphically Ride 'Em Low is somewhere on the same level as NFS:U was back in 2003. Personally, I don't mind if a game is not up to date on todays standards, as long as it brings something new to the table.GameplayRide 'Em Low starts like most race games these days; Buy a second hand car, tweak it and start racing. Unlike NFS:U, you do not get to drive around the city (as in freemode). The races themselves are pretty boring compared to other race games and I can't even name anything great about them. It seems that if you tuned your car well enough, you will win the race otherwise you will simply lose.Sound/MusicObviously a low budget game can't get the licenses for music like EA could with NFS but in this game the music is worse than the original Need For Speed game. Uninspiring Music which will most likely annoy you after a few game rounds. The  other sounds are nothing special either.ConclusionRide 'Em Low is only interested to people who do not own and have never played any good race game over the past 15 years or own the game because of some bundle like I did.

												It is hard to recommend this game someone, only if they are die-hard Low rider or car buff. You get what you pay for though and it does have room for improvement, like having a cruise mode, burnout competition, customization(pin striping, custom trim, murals, custom paint jobs like lace and panel, custom interior, custom character), car shows, car clubs, create events, change keys for controls etc. . . I have to say this is a challenging game, you have to know what you're doing in order to win and trust me you will lose and even when you have no more money the game gives you $250. In the beginning you really have to choose if you want your car to be a ""Racer"" or a ""Hopper"" for you can not have both. If you choose to go with a Racer, modify engine, gearbox(A.K.A. Transmission), fuel, tires, suspension and differential, Bet wisely. As for a Hopper buy the best or second best hydro kit and practice like crazy. Also another important thing is to NEVER SELL YOUR CAR, you get jipped and end up with not enough for another one, if so delete your game profile and start over. Trust me you are gonna have to work really hard to get anything out of this game.On the other hand if you want a game based strictly on lowriders, I would recommend ""TheLowriderGame"" IT'S FREE ---->www.thelowridergame.com/index.php "

												This game is kind of endearingly awful. It looks like something that came out ten years ago, the UI is terrible, it's full of typos, and it doesn't have much to pass for gameplay. You get to pimp out non-trademark-infringing knock-offs of classic cars (Gazelles and Walkers instead of old school Impalas and El Caminos) and then race them or show off how ridiculous your hydraulics are, except both types of events have very little depth and kind of iffy controls. If you don't win, you will have absolutely no idea why you didn't win or what you should've done differently. The rate you do get money from winning is quite low and makes it feel like it's meant to have microtransactions so you can actually afford to upgrade your car in less than six months of playing. It's also very easy to completely run out of money if you buy the wrong stuff and then lose a couple races, and the amount they give you to get going again if that happens is so low that you might as well just start over.That said, the keyboard controls for driving are still somehow better than the keyboard vehicle controls for a lot of mainstream games, especially console ports, even though they're kind of meh, which should make a lot of major publishers/developers ashamed of themselves. And I still can't entirely dislike this game, because it has that kind of charm to it that only comes from people trying really hard to make something and completely and utterly failing to succeed.

												This game is fun, but I feel that it lacks content. I think the developers should release an update or even a DLC. I mean really four tracks? Of course there are different varieties of tracks but they all feel unfinished. There is also the lowrider competitions in which you have three modes: hop, freestyle, dance. The more points you score the more cash you get.There is also a multiplier that you get by applying upgrades from the ""special"" section in the modification tab. But I must say there alot of upgrades. Still with four tracks and one lowrider arena I still managed to suck up countless hours of fun from this game, just annihilating every car in sight by taking over the lead from the start. There is no greater feeling then that. The game is a MUST HAVE for lowrider lovers, but it is fun for average players that just wanna race n' stuff.I have to say that I recommend this game, it can't be fun for everyone but it can be for some people (and lowrider fans).It still has potential. With maybe a few updates and tweaking it could be great!			"

												Basically you race ""low riders"" on a few diferent tracks and modes. Then you start upgrading your car(s) and winning alot of money and buying many cars. 10/10 its got better graphics then cod.			"

												OKAY I AM NOT A MUSCLE CAR MANIAC sorry cpaslock because i've ahve actualy Had Sex (well ok i havent yet but i maybe will some time and i dont refally plan on editing this review to annocuen it so its sort of Like an IOU for Sex that ive had, unlike Musclecar Maniacs) but theres alot of Numbers and Cars and siht in thisd gfame that if your a Muscle Carf Manic you might like or maybe the numbers arefnt Right Numbers and the game is terribly unrealsitic I DONT EVEN KNOW not sorry for capslock that tigme i was shouting. but ok Riddle Me This batman:: prety sure if i crash my nineteen 1949 Frederick Mercury Low Rider into a telephone pole at 80 Miles per MPH it will explode or something but NOT IN THIS GAME NO SIR instad you justg sort of bounce off aned it breaks immersion. so the game probably isnt worth it in that regard. oh also the wentire experience is tedious and monotonous, Race A Dude and make a bit of money and it takes dlike five hundred races deto get a new engine and all the tiorher upgrades are incremental In THier Approach so it's tedious and boring and frustratering and Who Fuc­kin Gives A CRap!! Not I, for one. also when you challenge people it takes like ten seconds of stareing at a blank screen for the car to pull up, woo hoo very relaistic feature, gfame that doesnt even have damage mmodelling, good job. and then sometimes they say No Sir I Do Not Wish To Ride so congratulations you just wasted an additonal ten secondsd watching them slowly drivfe away and then you have to wait ten seconds for the next guy to come up after you choose his name on the menu and tis stupid. Also when you Challenge Them they say things like ""Okay Sir I Accept"" and no low rider person talk like that, ive listened to a Rap CD once or twice and it'd be more erealistic if theyre like OOOOOOH SHEEEZ DADDY-OH I BE ALL OVER DAT CHALLANGE LIKE FLYS ON THE BEES KNEES or soemthing i dont care i dont know this game suckds. its godawful.you CAN make your car bright pink and glossy as a High Gloss Topps Trading Card so thats a good feature but the rest of the game is tedious. HOPE YOU ENJOY HOLDING THE UP ARROW KEY SUCKA BECAUSE THATS ALL THE DRAG RACES ARE and ok so what.GamePro Feature BREAKIDOWN:graphic-  8.7 the car looks good and the street looks like a streetMUSIC - B- its the same five n9otes of a Hippy Hop Boot Shake Song and tis not very interestingsound Effect: 94% sounds like engineys stuff and you change the part and the sound changes VERY GOOD WORKgameplay: noCrash Effects: 0/10 there are nonerealism: not reallyWould I Reccomend It On Game FAQs: yes i would because that sight is full of Fantastic Morrons ahhahahahahahahsghghwdefguihsdghdsghisdehgiudschghhafhhah ah hahhahahahahhhhhFinal Rating: 2/5 It Runs But It's Boring And I'd Wager The Garage Mechanics Are Probably Incorrect But I'm Not An Low Rider Life Addict (because ive had sex (someday)) so i dont know about that for sure, all i do know is that theres Very Little To Grip This GAmer Sushi-X Hot Take: dahh durr me sushi x Buy Game Profession the magazien i liked the gamel Pro Tip: try to avoid pits. if your Car has lasers use them wisely. bye			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Ride 'em Low 

			Views: 27		

			The game sets out to bring the player into the world of street racing and car dancing. While the goal is noble the implementation is lacking and leaves the entire experience feeling hollow.		

The game sets out to bring the player into the world of street racing and car dancing.  While the goal is noble the implementation is lacking and leaves the entire experience feeling hollow.Some of this is on the content being presented, a drag race is by definition going straight so the play can just numbly hold down the accelerator.  Races are against single cars without any rubberbanding so you know early on if you'll win or not.  This may be accurate but in game form it's uninteresting.The hydraulics gameplay of car dancing is hilarious as you DDR your car through a set routine.  Freestyle events appear to be bugged which was dissapointed due to it being so ridiculous to make the car hop around.			"

												Its a decent game with customizing thats fun, but thats the only area where this game feels good. The driving is kind of hard since it wouldn't map to the Xbox 360 controller and I had to use the keyboard. The game felt very repetitive and each race was pretty easy if you just stay on the track and on the road. There wasn't really much competition or strategy. It was decent but I wouldn't fully recommend buying this at full price.			"

												This is really fun and although you ride 'em pretty low, the game itself sets the bar pretty high. Also, word to the wise: My stepdad works for Red Dot Games so I already had this before it came out. He told me to tell you guys to stop talking so much crap about his game if you know what's good for you.			"

												This game is abseloutely dreadful, uninspired and most importantly boring. Your low riding career starts you off drag racing before you even get anywhere near the horrible steering controls, and as many will say, ""Don't get mad, get good."" it's probably easier just to get a better game. If you're looking for games which let you customise and race your cars in a more fun enviroment there's about a bazillion other games out there.			"

												Ummm, yeah racing low riders.  My expectations weren't that high in the first place.  It is weird though that the ""Race"" is just going in a straight line: you can't hit other cars, and turning causes you to lose speed so don't turn.  Even though you just have to hold the up arrow (Go) I still can't seem to win a race... There must be something I'm missing.			"

												Update- Played more of the game and still say its not worth the money. Pros: Customizing the cars and racingConsBad Controls.Very repetitve Only career and single player with random cars.Video quality tends to be average but sometimes the frame rate drops. It could be the computerRecommendation- Get it if its on a bundle or very cheap like less than 2 dollars.  Early review : It gets repetitive real fast and as well as pretty buggy on video quality. . Will play more to see if i change my mind of the game.-			"

												D O  N O T  B U Y  T H I S ! ! ! This is an absolutely terrible game. Clearly the makers of it just ripped off GTA, and then bailed on the project, leaving an unifinished game while still trying to sell it as complete. This game is remarkable bad, do not give them money you will only regret it. Words cannot describe how bad this is.~Sound track is terrible, and is edited incorrectly. It's off time~Controlls are terrible~Loading time for something as simple as racing a different person is pathetically long~The description or ""title"" of diferent buttons doesn't change when they are supposed to. I.E ""Go to Dealership"" to go to dealership, and then you click ""Go to Dealership"" to buy the car. High school level stuff~""Career"" Is a joke. It's a bunch of ""quick races."" Seriously there is no difference.This is a HORRIBLE GAME.  D O  N O T  B U Y  T H I S			"
