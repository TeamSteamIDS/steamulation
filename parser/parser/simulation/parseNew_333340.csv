Early Access Review
								Right.. with not a lot of game time my first impressions are this game has super potential. There is a lot of polishing to do regarding mechanics and bit more transparent controls and physics.My quad bike was bouncing around with suspension that would make a bunny envious!. The starter island should have extra batteries for that thing as it ran out quick,Which brings me to food, either i couldn't see it or it wasn't t here at all. Unless those Tomatoes I planted were supposed to do it for me.. but wait could I wait that long? I was  just exploring about I curled up in a ball from hunger loss? who gets that hungry in a span of 1 hour you are on the floor dying? Wow I'd so get fired from my job in real life if that were the case.Next part was the bunker with the underwater printer. Again thanks that I endured my grinding of teeth but the print and pick up blueprint was mind boggling. They need to fix that. To the avg Joe looking to see in the tank that I had to piece the parts together could have been a bit more transparent in getting across to the player.Fun none the less. kinda reminded me in a kerbal kinda way.. if you squint.Right brings me to the station. Game mechanics again shot me up though the bulk head to get out i think? well that's how I got out. Only to show up in a station that was designed with the same software from the early 90s. OK early access and all but the amount of people backing this game (Bill I'm looking at you). You'd think they'd throw a few more coins at the Dev team who would be loving a upgrade from windows 95.Still I'm looking at this as Really early alpha (beta is so way off people). Anyhow I see a lady there walking and talk to her.. um well imagine speak and spell (for those who remember it) and Steven Hawking. yup it's as if Steven and speak and spell had a child. Bingo.Anyhow I'm not abandoning this as I enjoy most space games, it's just that this needs a wee bit more hours in the polishing stage. I don't mean visual, hell best simulators out there had basic graphics (battlefront games). This needs work on its physics engine and more.Can't wait to see what they will do with it! I've put my 8.99 in for a hope for the best! I'll  be watching all those patch notes hopefully!would I tell anyone to buy this yet... nope, not unless you like to support developing companies. then yup!would i tell anyone this game is fun?... maybe, I can see it but it's like I can see the mountains in the distance but yet not close enough to enjoy the stunning awesomeness of them.4/10 because of the offspring of Hawkings and missus Spell.

Early Access Review
								First I must disclose that I have been bug/beta testing this for about a year or so now.Firstly when I first heard of this game as I am a fan of simulation games I was excited,secondly the young me was also excited as I had always had a fascination with space and everything to do with it also I do not know any one who did not want to be an astronaut.The game is an as close as possible simulation of some of the things which NASA scientist have been developing and postulating for future missions to other planets.Featuring a complex and well refined resource/production system for building necessary items,habitats and vehicle.Featuring a Player vs. Player mode (who can build the biggist base first)As well as co-operational games or simply make your own and then build a rocket ship and lauching pad and go to the next planet.Over the last year the dev's of the game have addressed serious issues quickly with little fuss and a dedication to there product.I look forward to what the modding community does with this game so any Dune fanatics or Red Dwarfers get on it.Resources are plentiful they require mining to extract from planet surface ,you have to research items before you can craft them there is not a crafting bench there are how ever Mineral Ovens and the 3D printer there are effectively like crafting benches- with the mineral oven handling basic refining and the 3d printer handing habitats and more complex refining.The user interface is very natural to use , once you have picked the printer or oven a list appear telling you what resources you need to print each thing and once you have enough you print said thing it appears in your inventory and you can then deploy it>You unlock more advanced items once you have crafted and deployed certain things so to gain access to say the science lab upgrade you deploy the science hab research the new things available from said hab then you will be able to upgrade,The player VS. player mode is a base construction race who can set up a base and acquire a certain amount of points and the winner would take victory I think this is going to be revised as the game goes forward so do not quote me on this just yet :)The Co-op games are hosted on server I assume via the Dev's but if you do not set a password on your base all bases are visible from the start menu and it is simply as it says on the tin you and a friend building a base together until you end up being able to launch off planet again and move on to another planet.There is as we know no hotile life in our Solar System and as I said this is a realistic simulator so no saldy no hostile life.

								This one is hard to review.   First off, its buggy.  Not like a little buggy, but very buggy.  The tutorials are not much help and the character moves around clumsy a little like a Kerbal.  I actually bought this hoping it was going to be a little like KSP, but except for landing on mars (which was basically just hitting the thrusters to slow your decent, its not much like that at all.The game is also crashing a lot.  I really want to like this game, but the crashes make it hard. The tutorial is very unclear, too.  It might be enough to frustrate some, but the game is fun once you figure out whats what. I will say one thing...even without the crashes and if all the bugs were gone, there is no way this is a $25 game.  This is a $15 game tops.   Today is July 7 as I'm writing this review.  I believe it was relased yesterday.  I would say put this game in your wishlist, and wait a few months for the next sale.    This game has a lot of potential, but it really needs way more work than your average alpha released game.			"

								Wow, where to begin.Pro's:Has potential to be a good game.Sound is decent and very realistic.Con's:Very very early access.No tutorial currently.Character disappears and then have to quit.Ok So I start game and talk to NPC and then my character vanishes and i have to abandon game or save a restart.If I dont talk to NPC I can go a bit further before my character vanishes and then have to save/quit and restart.Cant do anything as I get about 1 minute before my caracter vanishes.I purchased this game and I got it on saleso less pain then paying full price.I see great potential in the game but  it will take some time.I like supporting game development but i wont be playing again for some time.I hope following updates fix the issue(s) i have and make it playable.Personally I find the game needs more work and should not have been released yet.So for me i would wait until more updates are released and bugs fixed before I would recommend the game currently.

								They have a long way to go. There are things badly broken that should have been fixed before public access. As with every other game out there, they set all volume levels way too high and as with most, you don't get access to the controls until after all the intros. In this case, you have to get all the way into a game only to find the controls don't seem to have any effect.Controls are also a mess. First off, it set up be default 5 sticks (0-4). Problem is I only have 2, a T.16000 and an Edtracker which is a head tracking device. You can't change those bindings once in game. you have to do it in a little popup before it starts loading the game and the settings are cyrptic at best. Got in and couldn't stop my char from running until I restarted and messed with the stick bindings. Stearing the char is also a pain. you have to hold the mouse button to use it to control direction. Basicly, it's a mess. I'll try it again when they get the basics that should have been done in before showing to the public fixed.			"

								My congrats to anyone who has stuck with this game long enough to get anywhere. It's a painful process. After 4 complete restarts, finally got the ATV built. Rides nice, but was prob in 1st gear until battery died, Walked to hatch, printed rocket parts, dropped one on my head, can't escape, so restart number 5 from the beginning? No thanks. Maybe in a week or 2 when I've forgotten.  And the text is unreadable - 3 pt red on a gray backgnd? Speech choices finally became visible with some camera changes.			"

			Have a second look at the game Star Rangers, how long do I last? Would like to support? Then please hit that subscribe button or either of the following: http://Twitch.com/PlaythenSay...		

I do not last long this time.Original ReviewNot for now AT ALL, little rough is stretching definitions;The engine? Controlling any part of this game feels delayed and has some unusual choices for controls. Felt not in control during most of the game.Game play? Did you enjoy minecraft during its free days? you know when nothing was explained and you just had to figure it out, then try this game. Menu options are bare, and help or even descriptions in the menu is randomly there for some objects but not for many. Example: Built a workbench, good item? create more items? no it was decorative but had no way other then the name to tell really.Game allows you to explore, mine, grow, build on planets. Fly in orbit. Fly between planets, with so many different controls needed and engines to run them by not getting one right makes me question the ability to get the any right.With the ""mini"" parts of the game the way they all seem to work seems unnecessary fiddly and complex, without offering realistic outcomes to compensate for such a silly way of doing things. Construct a space rocket, click and place the parts, except there is only one way to do so making another part of the game (ie here constructing) overly complex without the rewards.There is a lot of game here for the price tag but it seems to me to be all half a good idea type of game that is available, as I have seen people eat 4 Big Mac Meals in a row then I guess quantity is the aim of the game for some people..The sounds in the game are over bearing to the point I shouted ""WTF"" about every 5mins, with the levels being all over the place, if you play this open the menu (also because it defaults to low graphics) and turn volume down so you don't need to fund your doctors new boat.Maybe fun with friends but the level of interaction between characters in game is limited.Last promise that may be too good to be true, explore the planets? unless effort is put into planets to discover items? ie nice scenery, caves or areas that provide challenge to explore and give something back even if its ""oh look we found this cliff with shiny stones all over it"" but that may be a level of imagination and design above what I have seen and makes the exploring part mundane.

Early Access Review
								The controls are crazy complicated.The gameplay is very non-intuitive.Character movement is very... underdeveloped? my view faces one way, my character's head faces another and I walk in a third direction.My first impression of this game is that it is meant to be a teaching tool, it has ""Teaching moments"", like that part where you  have to answer a question in order to build an ATV right at the beginning... Annoying, especially when I had to do it 4-5 times due to running out of power... took me awhile to figure out that the Wind Generator recharges the battery when you get close enough to it.I was able to leave Earth fairly quickly... i stumbled upon the Launch Facility in the Lagoon by accident while looking for something to do on that starter island.I got into space... in an apparently deserted and broken down/abandoned space station that just didnt feel right at all. i wandered around a few seconds and found an airlock... after jettisoning myself. I wasted all of my ammo shooting debris trying to figure out what to do then decided to steal a spaceship. So, there I am, Sitting in a cockpit in a ship that wont do anything...I eventually gave up and tried to exit the ship and found a Cryogenics Pod, figured that was what I was supposed to do... did that.Took 12 attempts to land safely on the moon, nearly died getting to basecamp, get abandoned by my only means of transportation... then I set up the camp and it unfolds, clipping into one of the crafting stations lifting it high into the air so I couldnt reach the durned thing.spent a few RL hours wandering around trying to figure out what I can do... not much, end up breaking my tools and never found the ore I was looking for...at this point I resort to the forums.I find the answer but end up breaking the One tool I have that can do the job and have No Way to make more of that tool... I just dont have the schematic? Blueprint? whatever... and I cant research it, it just isnt available at all.But hey, It's a great start, it's just too early for me to start recommending the game to new players.I will be trying it again in a few months, and I will update this review.I sincerely wish it improves, I want to love this game... or is it a teaching tool for middle school students?

								Game has potential but this shouldn't even be in alpha stages. The first 2 minutes of the game I fell past the surface when landing my ship on the Mars Tutorial. I just glitched past the surface and fell into the void forever. Started up the map again, same issue. Text getting stuck on the screen, clunky menu system. This game needs tons of work, especially after playing 8 minutes total and everything I did I encountered a bug or a glitch.			"

								Early Access Review: as of 7/7/16.I started to play this game and put only a couple hours into it playing the Lagoon Training missions. There are 4 parts to this mission before you head to the space academy. First part is talking to a hologram, second go to another lab on the island and  talk to another hologram, run an experiment, build an ATV, drive to next station. at next station figure out how to grow plants and  then drive to next station ( which I drove around the island three times before I could figure out where it was), build a rocket ship then blast off to the space station in orbit. Once I got there......??? At first I had no clue, there's nothing there when you arrive to tell you to use the computer in the room you just spawned and it didn't seem obvious. (second time round I seen it and that's were i got the mission to go to Mars).So, what I find the game currently lacking is telling me what I'm supposed to do. The instructions are not very clear, in fact the first time i joined a game I was in a drop ship and falling to Mars Surface and die three times before I figured out the controls to the ship. but just as soon as I landed the guy who's game it was left and it closed on me.... so.. that was when I tried to do my own game but found the Lagoon Training missions instead that will lead to the Mission to Mars!Update 7/10/16Got a chance to play a little bit on mars building. Once I got the hang of the controls its not too bad but the Camera needs to be fixed in first person view. The Base building and crafting system is unique. You can research blueprints and then using different equipment you can build other items, habitats, tools etc... the game in it's current state is glitchy and i've experienced a few crashes which is common for very early access games but the Devs have been communicating with me and doing a good job. Thanks Astronicus! THIS IS A WARNING! IT'S VERY EARLY ACCESS! IT NEEDS LOTS OF WORK! The game is very rough but looks like it has a good team behind it to get things smoothed over. At this time I still would recommend it but with Caution. It needs a little more time to get the controls smoothed out and maybe a little better tutorial.  Graphically, it looks pretty good, Physics in the game still needs some tweaks, that ATV on the island is barely controllable. as I continue to play i'll update this review.			"

Early Access Review
								Star Rangers is a surprisingly interesting game.Space exploration games are slowly demanding the spotlight, and this title is successfully shaping its path to success.The game is still in a very Early Access stage, with many features and details to be added and fixed (which have been planned by the devs). Due to its current status I am unabe to properly label the negative aspects as such, hence they will be listed at the bottom of the review as a mere feedback and advice.You start off by creating a character, modifying his appearance and picking a class, which will give you a bonus on several stats, along with unique skills and perks.There are various missions available, accessible from a text based computer (you actually have to type the commands, a little feature that I found brilliant in terms of involvement), and they range from space exploration ones (planet discovery, debris cleaening etc) to planet related ones (build a particular structure, collect materials etc).The game is vast, hugely vast. You have the chance to explore your favourite solar system planet and much more. In your aid there are different vehicles with their own particular function.In my current game experience I only visited Mars so far (I've always been fascinated by the Red Planet). Reaching it was a wonderful experience and the landing process is brilliant, with speed balancing being a vital factor to properly reach the planet without destroying your ship.Without further ado, I would like to talk about the exteremly positive aspects of Star Rangers, which also are the reason why you should definitely give it a try:Space Immersion: who wouldn't love to explore the planets we could only see in books or tv channels? Star Rangers offers this incredible opportunity! While the majority of space exploration games are based on fictional planets and galaxy, this one takes place in a realistic universe.Survival: I am fond of survival games, I like the mechanism and the thrills that such titles offer to the player. You normally have to survive in an island, a forest, a city, or in any other place on planet Eart. Imagine how could it be to survive in another planet? You can build structures, inflate pre-made ones, gather materials, explore, but always remember to have a shelter nearby because oxygen and suit stability can be replenished by staying inside your base.Every electronic apparatus needs to be powered with a battery (which has its own durability), making every decision important, as they aren't that common to have.Updates: as for every Early Access game I review, I put the stress on the updates, which are the reason why a title is labeled like that. The devs do actually listen to feedbacks and they constantly keep the game updated.PC Requirements: my PC isn't an high-end one, thus I feared I couldn't run a game of this calibre. I could easily set the maximum graphic options without having an issue. Yes, we aren't talking about extremely realistic texturing, and visually speaking it may not look like a 2016 title, but it still looks great! In the end, I would like to point out a few aspect that many need an optimization (which I am sure will be fixed as I have read them being planned in the future).Tutorial: the in-game tutorial currently still feels a bit incomplete as it looks like a real campaign without a real lead to follow. It's not a great issue though, as the missions accessible from the computer clearly shows what to do. What it lacks is a proper control scheme tutorial.Voice Acting: even though it's just a minor thing, I think it may need a revamp, since it is a game about immersion (and trust me, it's very immersive). Am I recommending the game? Yes! Even though it may feel like being in a beta status, it's definitely worth the price, considering you will be paying for an in-development product that will only get better in time!			"

My biggest issues is with the controls.This game doesnt know what control scheme it wants to be. Sometimes it fuctions well as a third person game but it shouldnt be. It should be a first person game but the controls are so wonky that its impossible to even enter a habatat in both camera types..The gameplay is interesting but its hindered by the poor camera and controls.

								I want to like this, but I can't say that I do yet. The controls are intensely awkward, in some cases hard to see, and non-obvious.I echo another review in that I had to restart several times to get a working buggy. Evidently with the battery mounted on the deck the wheels will move, but not enough to actually get you anywhere. Nothing I've experienced so far has been what I'd call fun, which seems like a miss for a game.			"

								I think it's a bit too early in the dev cycle to really enjoy this yet. I may come back to it at a later date but at the moment it's just too buggy. I had a few issues without even getting through the tutorial including: - Hair colour didn't show properly (chose dark hair at character selection but is ginger/blonde in game)- Avatars feet disappeared through the floor in buildings- Unskippable dialogue (with terrible voice acting/script) that I had to watch three times in the hour I played- Experiment feature that wasn't really explained- The hologram for the experiment feature was barely viewable and doesn't always display properly - The ATV wouldn't respond (apparantly due to a battery being misplaced despite correct placement not being explained)- A random Trike spawned where I was supposed to be crafting the ATV- An ATV frame got stuck in the ceilingThat would be bad enough if it were for a consecutive hours gameplay, however these were over three seperate attempts to play this from the beginning. After all this the basic graphics and general clunky feel of movement and the UI made me think this needs alot more work to even be in EA.This may all change in the future, it is very early at this stage but for me this was too much wrong in such a short period of time so I got my cash back until a later date			"

								This game is not bad.  Its not great(yet?), but not terrible either.  It does have a lot of room to grow at this point though.  At the moment there is not really a lot to do but build HABs.  The more advanced the item you are crafting, the more complicated it gets.  This can be good and bad.  It is good that this much thought has gone into the crafting of items but gets tedious when trying to build something.  An upgrade to a hab may only take 2 items.  But to get those 2 items you have to build a hundred other items.  What woule really help in this aspect is the ability to build more then one thing per button click.  As it stands you have to click build for every individual item.  So if you want to make 100 plant fibers, you have to sit there ant click build 100 times.  Then you have to make polymer and then the polymer item.   (Polymers are used a lot)The game does try to be a little too scientific at times.  I wasn't bad at math in school but I am still trying to figure out the Coeficient of Friction on Mars..  Yes.. You must science in this game.			"

								You must be aware that it is an Alpha release, meaning that everything is still in early developement stage, there will be a lot of bugs and functionality will change. It also seems that the releases are compiled in debugging mode so don't expect speed optimization. Server is almost always online, that's a very good thing.Said that, it's a very interesting game, you can fly and build in space, fight against space debris lika a pro space janitor like Roger Wilko or Hachimaki, build your own base and ships in Mars and explore it's misteries, fly to  the Moon seeing your dead clones scattered if you forget to feeed them or even explore the oceans of Europa.It reminds me a bit of Moon Base Alpha, I liked it but this is more build and quest oriented.I recomend this game to those who want to see how a game is developed and evolves.

								A cool game in it's own right. Still underdevelopment - so don't go in expecting a completed product. But cool none-the-less. For those space sim freaks and people who dream of a future on other planets this game is on the hit list. But there are some obvious things that are lacking in it here's my opinions on the Pros/ConsPros:FunReally Easy to useRobotic Mining and Assembly gives the game a real ""In Space"" FeelTerminals that use real computer OSes from ""The Days before Windows""MultiplayerThe dev team has a level head on their shouldersNew Content with just about every patchPlanetbound and 3rd Person* (*I hate space sims that are only showing the ship at any given time and not the planets they land on or interiors at the    very least)Cons:Heavily in developmentSomewhat Infrequent Updates (Not months but certainly not Daily or Weekly)Buggy sometimesAFAIK the Terminals do not retain data between saves - yet.Sound Effects are kinda datedGraphics are kinda low-spec (this can be good if you can't run better games but since I have a decent computer it's kinda a turn off for me)(I honestly did pay for this game - and I didn't know the dev team until after I got involved with it which was after they took my money; which I have to remind myself not to check that box because the majority of my games are free-to-play and thus received for free.))

								I have one reccomendation, for the Mars tutorial level, I think it would be fitting to have the food and oxygen levels be set to unlimited, essentially meaning that it doesnt drain while your doing the tutorial mission, however, if the player wants to stay on the level and continue say building a base, then what the devs could possibly do is once the player has completed the tutorial, is have an option appear on the screen, asking them if they want to continue playing on the level, or if they want to leave the level. And if the player choses to remain on that level, at that point then have the food and oxygen levels be returned to normal, so that they will drain over time. Now if the player wants to remain on the level and say want to mess around, such as in a creative mode, then maybe if the devs want they can have another option come up after the player choses to stay on the level whether they want to keep the food and oxygen set to unlimited, or have it changed back to the normal ""survival"" setting.Now, keep in mind, this game is a very, very early release, and is still in development. But this is a game that has very high expectations, and I firmly believe that this game can meet those expectations. Yes you will run into bugs and glitches, but thats to be expected with any game that is released early. But the best thing everyone can do when they run into these thngs, is let us know, tell the developers, report it, because yes we may find some of the bugs ourselves, but we wont run into all of them, therefore if we dont know about them, we cant fix them, this game is being developed in cooperation with all of you, the community. So if you see any bugs or glitches, let us know, so we can deal with them, this game has great potential, and if the developers and the community continue to work together, this game will easily reach that potential, and likely surpase many of the communities expectations. And remember, you, the community, have a strong influence and impact on this games development, cause we are making this game for you, and as with any developers of any game, we want to make sure that we satisfy the community that we are working together with the development of this unique and high potential game.

								Space Rangers is a great game with a great team of devs behind it. Although it is in early access the game is improving quickly, many things are rough around the edges at the moment but given time this game could be amazing. I would rate the game a 7/10 but that will easily be 8-9 once it is out of early access!(My only suggestion to the developers is to condense the tutorial level so that newer players have an easier time learning controls and how the many systems in the game work!)

Early Access Review
								All in all, its a pretty interesting concept, kinda like space Rust and for an early access game its looking sharp compared to others. The construction system is pretty cool if you're into crafting games. While a little convoluted in the steps you have to take in the inventory, once you get use to it, it's pretty fun. You gotta open the inventory and drop the items, it feels a little strange compared to other games with simliar features. It'd be nice if you could just hold it from the inventory and place it on whatever you were trying to build. Cruising around on vehilces is a good time too but you've got the turning radius of a bus when you're driving an atv. I'll be following the updates on this game for sure!			"

								While still in early stages, the game showed tremendous potential. The best part of the game is the team behind it. There is a definite love that translates into the game itself coming from the creators. the amount of research and development being put into this will bring nothing but positive growth along the way. I highly recommend getting in early to watch the game grow over the coming months/years.If you love space, science, really intelligent game play and potential, get Star Rangers right away!			"

Now the game has better design and its less buggy than before, obviously sometimes strange things happens but after that the game turns funny and promising.

			Lets take a look at the latest space exploration game. I'm looking to seteup an offworld base and get some zero G lovemaking in the process but maybe I have set my sights too high?		

I want to like this game but as many have said it is far from complete at this stage which is fine for early access but only if it gets to a more complete state in the next 6 months.It's certainly has ambitions but lacks in almost every area.My video is a comic look at it but does give you an idea of what to expect (10/7/2016)I had high hopes for this being a mix of the sims and kerbal but it is more like an early concept right now.This is really a borderline recommendation if you want to support a sci-fi space game of this type that does have some promise but otherwise stay away for now			"

								Good game, has promise. Controls are buggy which makes it hard to play. In normal mode mouse panning is spotty.			"

								Its a good game, however it still has far to go.the UI is a bit buggy, and i found myself having to fidget around to select what i was looking at, however, everything seemed to, at least from my perspective, to function as planned, maybe something to look forward to playing ni the future, but as for now, this needs a few points to hit on.Major FPS fluctuationsLoading screens taking foreverNot mutch to do outside of hanging out with friends, maybe a mission line?from the short ammount i played i couldnt see if there was a way to travel inbetween planets, maybe think of adding that, as well as the potential to have player made and run space stations and refueling points?A player fueled market system, much like elite dangerous? with fuel, building supplies?a tip/hint system for those who didnt play the tutorial, with the option to turn it on and off in the options menu			"

								The potential with this game is limitless and would be interesting to see were this game ends up.As this game is early access it does come with a lot of faults, some of these faults, bugs glitches will have you feeling frustrated. However you can see were this game is sort of heading and even with all the bugs players get to sample the playability and potential. I like to think of it as a sneek preview of something that could become huge. Read to many unjustified bad reviews regarding this game whom clearly slate all the bugs as the problem, without looking at the bigger picture. Over time these bugs will disapear further content will be added as it moves into beta then onto final release. The developers are keen to listen to the feedback left and act upon the many problems they face. It's not very often to hear back from developers which is refreshing. These developers are keen to listen to ideas as to were this game should go and what the community expects from it. I am excited to see what this game looks like in 1 month 6 months 1 year. The game in its current state is cheap enough to buy, however playability is still restricted until more content is added.The creative mode looks interesting with the ability to create custom maps though again early days in the making.Looking forwards to the next update and the many more to follow.If you want a sneek peek at this game in it's early stages then yes I would recommend it, if you get easily frustrated and like throwing tantrums give it a few months before trying.
