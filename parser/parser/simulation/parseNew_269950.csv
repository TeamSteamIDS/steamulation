												This game is so realistic compared to other flight simulators. I played FSX for a while and i'm going to say goodbye to it. You can't get any better graphics in a flight simulator then x-plane 11. I didn't installed any other freeware airports and by it's default, it just looks beautiful. The night lighting of all these highways my god... I can't say any better. If you want to have a fully packed flight sim with outstanding graphics, very good default airplanes and ""yet"" no 200 euro addons, buy this game!!!!			"

												Excellent upgrade from X-plane 10. Just purchased so I do not have a lot of time with it, I did not try the Beta. My first impressions have been excellent thus far. Setup and usage is much more intuitive than 10 was. I especially like the joystick setup now which included a visual representation of my Saitek X52. Setup was very easy and I was flyimg with the default aircraft in no time. The 737 and MD80 included aircraft are very well modeled and surprisingly detailed. Weather has been improved and clouds and visibilty look very realistic. Flying through clouds now is very impressive. The user interface is a welcome change and easy and intuitive to use. Frame rates for me are great, and I am very pleased with the overall look and performance of the sim. I'm sure there are bugs and issues yet to be found, but I am confident LR will deal with them. This by far the best flight sim available, and very much worth the upgrade.			"

												All I can say that X-Plane 11 is awesome. I have own every Flight Simulator since 1977 from Sublogic, Microsoft and Prepar3d. I have never purchased X-Plane in the past since I found it was too much work to set-up. Now with X-Plane 11 it's just simple. The standard sceneries are so detailed that there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars for scenery add ons. The aircrafts that also come with the package are very well detailed. If you’re not convinced, just watch YouTube; there you will find multitude of information on many topics from flying to scenery modifications. I run X-Plane 11 in 4k resolution without experiencing any bad frame rate, lag or out of memory problems. For those who are having flying issues, check your hardware and remember this is a simulation not a game. I am very pleased with X-Plane 11 and now I am looking forward for 3rd party software developers to create aircrafts etc. Happy flying.			"

												Only 50 minutes in. This might seem premature for a reivew, but after a short flight in Seattle I'm sold.I've flown most flight sims since the mid eighties and boy have they come a long way.This is the first sim I have flown where you feel like you are flying through air, rather than a vacuum. In addition, the hazing effects are superb. Very realistic and once again add to the feeling of flying in air.I have a pretty beefy system, which sims like Prepar3d normally brings to its knees. But here, at 4k resoution with everything except AA maxed out, it runs liquid smooth - something that's simply impossible in Prepar. The liquid smoothness and density of the terrain really add to the illusion of being there.Even with default scenery and the default aircraft this sim looks superb. I can't wait to tinker with Ortho4XP scenery, nor can I wait to see what the third party publishers give us.Prepar and FSX have had a good run, but finally, they have been surppased in every way. After I finish this review, I will be uninstalling Prepar3d as it is not even in the same ball park with regard to flight fidelity, looks and performance. Farewell Prepar and hello X-Plane! :D			"

												Finally! A flight simulator that is actually good enough to replace the ever so old FSX!Pros: - Finally some graphics, the game looks greate out of the box. On FSX and P3D I had to download over a dozen mods / addons to make it look any good. - MD-82, what can I say, I am glad to see my fav. commercial airliner made it into the game - In-Flight functionality is better than ever! everything seems clean, and well done.

												Just in case anyone has tried the Demo of X-Plane 11 (direct from the X-Plane site) and found it to perform really poorly.  I took a punt on the Full steam version and for me it runs so much better than the demo.I have an i7 - 3550, GTX 980 with 16GB Ram.  With pretty much full detail at 2550x1440 I am getting in the 30-40fps.  On the demo it all felt very laggy and approx ~20fps.			"

												A stunningly good sim to put it mildly,I have been using fsx since it came out in 2006, and ive been sticking to it until now. Fsx is simply too old to compete with xp11, xp11 is a close to flawless simulator which takesflight sims into the next generationPros:-Grapichs .-Scenery.-Quick, easy and brilliant addon support.-Camera can be programmed like ezdok in fsx.-Ground service and details are included.-Lots of freeware avalible for x-plane.-Optimization is the best in any flight sim ive ever tried, im currently running over 20 addons and ive only dropped 1-2 average fps compared to the out of the box game.-Stunning scenery night effects -Interface is clean and easy-Built in recording and replay system-When selecting your airport of choice, you get a map where you can click on your preferred spawnpoint.Cons:-Engine sounds (can easily be changed with freeware addons)-Unrealistic ai traffic (can also be changed with addons)-When using too many addons the game can crash (rarely)			"

												Now i have been a flight sim fan for quite some time, and for the most of that time i played fsx. anyhow, this game is definitivelly better than that. even with a mix of medium/high settings it looks much better than fsx with REX and ASN ever did,  and it also runs better than fsx on my hardware (getting about 45 fps in a big town with a gtx 970/i5 2250/8gb ram And the flight model definitivelly feels better too. the only downsides i have found in comparison to fsx is that many airports are not furnished (they only have the runways) and cities dont have their landmarks (dont expect to see any eiffel tower or anything of that sort). besides that, its a definitive upgrade to fsx, and i really reccomend it.

												Brilliant!  I've played FSX for many years and I had it well-tuned and loaded up with every available graphical add-on. Out-of-the-box X-Plane blows FSX away. It also performs pretty solidly on my ""mid-range"" PC (i7, 16GB, GTX960 2GB).  On FSX whereas I'd often drop <15 fps in heavily rendered areas, X-Plane stays consistently at/above 30fps.  When I replaced my GTX960 with a 1070, I'm now hitting 50-55fps with almost max settings. Butter smooth!The flight model itself does seem more realistic (Who am I to judge having never flown a real plan :) ). The built-in planes are decent... a step-above the stock FSX planes, but probably not quite as good as early Alabeo/Carenado.  I will miss the study-level Q400 and A2A Cessna, but hopefully we'll see more study-level planes in X-Plane soon.  The community offerings aren't as robust as FSX (they do have a 10 year head-start) but there is some really good stuff as freeware are pretty reasonably-priced payware.If I have a criticism, its the completely inadequate ATC.  It doesn't seem to follow airport operating procedures for light aircraft, and gives me some really weird routings. Stock FSX ATC and flight-planning was better, and there were some brilliant add-ons like VoxATC.  Hope to see an XP port soon!With robust sales of this product, I imagine we'll see a strong upswing in conversion of existing products/add-ons for X-Plane,			"

												I've barely put any hours into XP11, and I already know it's my new favourite flight sim.The good stuffComing from FSX, it's a direct upgrade in almost every aspect (including price, but I already feel like it was money well spent).The graphics are stunning, for example I was blown away while flying over a mountain range in Italy on a flight from Ancona to London. The sim also runs exceptionally well, running very comfortably at medium settings and no antialiasing on my kinda outdated PC. The cockpit detailing is far superior to any I've ever seen before, especially in the 737 (but the inability to test the GPWS annoys me slightly haha), but from what I've seen in the 737, 747 and Cessna Skyhawk it looks perfect.The bad stuffThe built in ATC is pretty bad. The default ATC in FSX just seems to work better, and also has a lot more functionality (I can't seem to be able to even request a change of flight level, and if I do change without the permission of ATC, it will repeatedly tell me to descend/ascend to my previous flight level and refuse to stop until I comply). Apart from this minor issue, I can't find anything else I dislike about XP11. It's just fantastic compared to FSX.			"

												Comparing to FSX to Xplane:Ive been with FSX forever. Always thought xplane was a cheap knock off. Download the demo and find out how you feel about it yourself, but as for me ive noticed the following immedietely. (This is with my computer, Some people are having technical difficulties, mine runs perfectly.)Pros of XPLANE:-first off its new! FSX isnt, fsx is 32 bit, Xplane is 64.  We can update the scenery and textures of fsx and spend a lot of money, but off the shelf xplane has better graphics by far even with some payware addons.-Much smoother flight control. MUCH smoother. At first it felt a little bit more ""arcade"" like. And i still feel this way, but its much easier to fly. I dont know which is more ""realistic"". Ive only got 3 hours of real flight time in a real plane, and xplane is much quicker to respond compared to fsx, id oscilate sometimes trying to land a plane in fsx, i dont have that problem in Xplane, and i didnt in real life..... so theres that, if thats worth anything. and actually that was the key selling point after playing the demo repeatedly for several hours.-Default planes are more complex than any default FSX plane. ESPECIALLY airliners omg.... the 737 is about 60% of the pmdg 737 in FSX, which says A LOT as its a default plane.-Runways arent always flat... and xplane accurately represents that, a small, but neat feature.-Did i mention graphics? on my i7 2015 model gaming laptop, i was impressed-There are actual cars on the roads! the night lighting is spectacular! Cars on the highways at night!? holy cow what a concept. This may not be new, but it is to me coming from fsx. it seriously makes the scenery come to life.-very easy to get started. It just feels newer and modern.CONS of Xplane:- Do tires always smoke when you're taking off or taxiing? or is that an xplane thing?- and airliners leave a black contrail behind them appearantly, it looks like an asteroid coming in from outer space more than a plane lol....-Not many default planes. but a good solid basic lineup-im seriously having to think hard here about this cons list.... navigating the menus is different and takes some getting used to...- Not much payware out yet?... Nothing im really willing to commit to yet at least....Ultimately the only thing i like better about FSX vs Xplane.- Fsx is what im familiar with, and im a pmdg pilot. The fact that pmdg hasnt put anything out besides an old dc for xplane makes me wonder a bit. The pmdg models were the best thing that ever happend to fsx. The complexity and realism of the their latest 747 and 737 models are nothing that anyone anywhere yet has come close to yet... I guess what im realizing just now is that, my favorite part about FSX isnt even fsx itself hahaha.... oh man if that doesnt spell it out for you i dont know what will... Ill be playing my 737 and 747 flight simulators still (and by that i mean my pmdg planes, because they are simulators themselves, legitimately they are a running simulator within a simulator), but everything else will be xplane for sure.

												Absolutely awesome piece of software, but a few notes of caution. This is not really a game, but a world-wide highly detailed flight model. If you are brand-new to flight sims, this product is extreamly daunting, and quite (no, VERY) complex to get your head around. Yes, if you just want to apply full power and get airbourne you can, but then you are missing out on 90% of the sim's potential. Learning how to fly properly, start planes, programme your flights plans from cold and dark and navigate your way to far away places and actually find the runway to land is most of the fun... but do not under estimate how much learning that will take! There is a highly active 3rd party developer community who have developed some truely remarkable scenary, mods, planes and sounds much of which is free, or moderatly priced. Master this simulator and you will not just loose hours, days or weeks of your life in the virtual world - you will loose decades!  Highly recommend investing in a decent flight Yoke/Rudder peddels and get yourself airborneNote: The software is regulary patched and updated and does require a substantial beefy PC to get the most out of it. We're talking here top spec gaming rigs to have all the bells and whistles on but boy oh boy, is it worth it.Update: 16-Apr. I've now been flying for quite a few hours and been tinkering with the settings to get the most out of it. My PC Maxiumus IX moterboard, I7-7700k 4.2 Ghtz, overclocked to 5.0 Ghtz with a Asus Strix 1080Ti Gfx. I pretty much have everything clicked up to the Max (except reflections I don't like the effect) and I get between 25-45 frames per second (most 35+) depending on the complexity of the Scene. (New York in foggy conditions at 25fps is still very playable). Now I appriciate that is a fairly beefly PC, but with tinkering you'll still be able to get very good results on a lower spec machine. I'm blown away by how good the gfx are out of the box, especially at dusk/dawn, but some of the textures do look a little week especially at low level flying, however I'm now just beginning to look into the community work, purchasing some extra custom scenery and it's fanstastic. Some free, some is payware... Ortho4XP looks an interesting tool that allows you to use realy google map pictures of the landscape and import them in to the game. (Free!)I also flew from Bristol International, along the M4 and north on the A419 to locate my house yesterday - Highly amusing!			"

												I loved FSX and now I finally have Xplane 11 been waiting for the release on steam for a while now. This definitely adds to the realm of flight simulators with a much more sophisticated physics flight engine adding even more realism to help one prepare for potential ""real world"" flying or a refresh because we can't all constantly pay for flight training to get a PPL this is worth the money to help you learn and progress your way to become a private pilot.

												So after having been an X-plane fan since 2007 when I bought 8.0, I can safely offer my 10 year view of this series. First off, the flight realism is the most accurate it has ever been in X-plane. These are not Xbox-ready military simulators with overdone graphics but more of a traditional flight simulation. If you were expecting Ace Combat, go buy Ace Combat. Though combat can be done on here, it is not too terribly fun. I will now offer my pros and cons:PRO>More realistic flight physics>Easier startup interface>Much improved ATC interface>Maps are now accurate to flight maps>Local graphics so accurate I can tell where I actually am in relation to real airports I've flown to, from, or out of when I was flying. If not, the custom scenery from their site is still backwards compatable.CON>No backwards compatability with aircraft (Pain in the rear to update too due to new GPS system)>No emergency options with ATC (My right engine fell off, can I have vectors? No? ♥♥♥♥♥...)>Stock sounds don't change volume with throttle and suck in their current state.>Must wait for updates to get the most out of this (remeber when games came out ""complete""?)>Stock aircraft are bland and as of right now there isn't many aircraft on the site yet for V.11.Overall, I'm glad I bought it. I've been a fan of the series for 10 years now so my view is pretty biased.			"

												Enthusiast FSX simmer with the whole multi thousand of € setup... but after a long RL-induced pause I just couldn't put myself to go through the maintenance and tweaking of the beast again.Then I heard of this new XP-11 release and decided to give it a try. The least I can say is that I'm happy I did: out of the box this is IMHO an amazing ""all-in-one"" package, coming with stock aircrafts, scenery and features that are on par with many FSX payware add-ons. Also it runs like a charm on my 4 years old rig after 2 minutes adjusting 3 sliders!So would I say this matches my very expensive, heavily modded FSX? No, but in-effect for a tiny fraction of the cost and with a regular modern steam app I'm greatly enjoying sim-flying again ^^Cheers			"

												This simulation is amazing. It feels like the real Cessna 172.   My frame rates have been good, around 30 to 45 fps, depending on how I set my 4K monitor up .   The scenery is breath taking and my local airport is rendered nicely and accurate too. FSX will be put back in its case as this sim is so much more.  When inspecting details of the buildings I nearly fell out of my chair when a loud boom occurred and my right wing tore off . I did look at a few you tube videos to find the best settings for my setup. There is plenty of freeware and mods available for this too.  I guess if I had to say just one word to Laminar Research it would be Wow!			"

												I do not recommend this YET. At least not to long-time flight simmers. Currently the only thing it has going for it is a nice lighting engine but thats not enough to get past the bland audio, the broken ATC, the ugly UGLY clouds, or the fact that they didnt include buildings for most major airports expecting you to go download a user created one requiring a dozen scenery libraries because reasons. If you have a heavily modified FSX or P3D then stick with that for now as they feel much more alive and detailed. XP11 is a solid foundation but not much more, and it feels exactly like that when you fly in it.That said, in a few months there will probably be enough 3rd party content to fix all of those shortcomings and make it an amazing next gen flight sim.Plus, if you're new to flight sims just go for it, as its the best you can get without P3D+OrbX+high end 3rd party plane and all that costs significantly more than XP11 does			"

												Very much improved compared with xplane 10. I was able to trim down the graphics so I can VFR pretty good in my home area while still having acceptable frame rates on my mid-end laptop (geforce 840m). Most airports have now buildings and look realistic, at least for the europe scenery included with the steam version (have not flown outside europe for now). AI traffic control seems to improved and is now able to hit the glide scope for runways correctly, though there are still some AI glitches (e.g., AI tower granted takeof clearance to a plane while I was doing the final approach on the same runway.) I still like the idea that navaids etc. are stored as simple ascii files that easily can be edited with notepad.There are also some nice usability features, e.g. loading the nav settings from the map directly to navigation system.Would buy again.

												X plane 11 is a huge leap foward in every respect, the graphics engine software is a lot more efficent than in the previous version. even though the scenery has been hugely imporved from its predecessor, It ran much faster without the anoying shuttering I experienced on x plane 10. ( No computer upgrade required to run this}  Hardware support has also been vastly improved, it now recognizes my video card and CH flight peddles and flight stick, which makes it a brezz to allocate all the buttons.  Aircrat flight dynamics have been reworked making landing much eaiser owing to more realistic flight characteristics. All in all x plane 11 is vastly superior to its predecessor. Running on a 2 year old Gaming laptop, i7 quad core 3400,  GTX 960 4GB graphics. 16GB ram.			"

												It's a pretty nice step up from the last sim I used, FSX. The flight and failure models are really well done for the default hardware, and it's surprisingly well-optimized (consistently 30fps at low altitudes, basically anywhere in the world, on a GTX960, with settings nearly maxed out).Hadn't used X-Plane before this release, so a few things to take into account if you're used to MSFS:- There's really, really limited custom scenery. Most cities are autogen, and CBDs are ""plausible"" based on OpenStreetMap data, and the road layouts are pretty amazing, but I couldn't actually find a built-in landmark besides the Space Needle in Seattle. Mods are king, and the good mods are pretty pricey -- and some of them are _very_ punishing for the GPU.- Seasons are also out the window. Everything's in a state of perpetual late Spring/early Fall unless you get mods. There are a few good free ones for this, though, and they don't kill your GPU.- The built-in ATC system's pretty lacking. Again, though, there are mods for this, free and paid.Having said that, the detailed terrain, amazing lighting, and realistic weather and flight models are IMO plenty to offset those problem areas. Fully recommend this, just don't be afraid to hop on the forums and pull down some of those sweet, sweet mods.			"

												This is the first time I wait for a game to be released.  Unfortunately X-Plane was delayed for  one month. I have no complaint for it since the new version really  amazed me. When I posted these screen shots to my friends, One of them ask me ""are u on plane now?"" Should I say the fact? =,=The price for X-Plane11 on steam is so friendly: ) Is this the compensation for the delay? By the way, I have deleted FSX already.			"

												This is a huge step forward for Laminar Research.  Having tried X-Plane since version 8, I can tell you that this 64bit architecture kicks everthing else in the teeth.  I've invested plenty of time and money into FSX, long before it was FSX or the Steam version, trying to get the most realistic flight simulation possible.  X-Plane 11 out of the box makes FSX obsolete. The XP11 community is huge and free is a common word within it.  I was shocked to see such detail for my small hometown airport and the larger feeder airport nearby.  Ai traffic is now present, works very well and is adjustable.  If you can't find the details you want for your local airport, then x-plane.org will get you going in the right direction with a huge database of free airports, scenery, aircraft and addons created by the community.   The flight physics are incredibly realistic and no lookup tables are used.  Blade element theory is used, which results in a much more realistic flight model.  The user interface is simple and intuitive.  It recognized both my xbox360 controller and logitech 3d pro stick.  I recommend X-Life Deluxe for an Ai traffic addon and XEnviro for a weather addon, although, you don't really need these.  Like Air Hauler 2 or FSPassengers for a professional pilot/mission type of experience? Then you're in luck because the MyPassengerX plugin is coming soon:http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/108724-mypassengerx-plugin/&page=2#comment-1152939 There are too many youtube videos out there that will convince you that this is the most affordable, expandable, realistic, friendlly flight community, TONS of FREE stuff out there flight simulator on the market.  It's a bit intimidating at first for a newcomer, but aviation isn't simple.  Once you learn a few things about how XP11 works, you'll never look back.Beware! This kind of realism comes at a heavy price in regards to your PC performance.  I play this on an 8-year-old i7 860 CPU (2.8-3.46 GHz), an equally old motherboard, GTX 760 W/2GB VRAM, slow 1TB HDD and 20GB DDR3 RAM at 1920x1080 resolution, Process Lasso & ParkControl (Free versions) and pagefile/virtual memory turned off.  I get 30-35 FPS and this appears to be common even on high-end PC's.  The demo does not represent the actual performance of the game.  It is much better in  terms of FPS and overall experience.  The demo almost changed my purchasing decision because it SUCKED!If you are like many lovers of the flight simulation genre, then you may find yourself tweaking many settings to find the FPS ""G-Spot"".  Once you're done screwing around and decided you're about to hit the refund button or throw a kitten out of a window, then go to the x-plane 11>output>preferences folder and delete everything in it and start over.  You'll thank me for that later and probably get a big FPS boost out of it as well.  Just make sure you have any payware activation keys/codes in hand when you do this.  Don't worry, it works.  Happy flying! This is the future of flight simulation.			"

												It requires the beast PC but developers mentioned their top priority is performance (FPS) improvements.Other than that, the simulation has tons of features out of the box, so you can experience most of the things about aviation without spending extra money. But with payware add-ons it gets better and better. Some parts of simulation requires improvements, for example ATC and AI aircrafts and of course performance improvements.But i still recommend it, since i believe developers will get this simulation better with upcoming updates.P.S. Its already 64-bit and Vulkan support mentioned for future...			"

												X-Plane 11 is a solid upgrade from X-Plane 10, but some key improvements are missing.Laminar Research, X-Plane's creator, did a very good visual upgrade to X-Plane 11 and brought all the things that worked fine in X-Plane 10 along. The simulation and flight model is still one of the most accurate in hard desktop simulation. They reworked the user interface into a more gamey appearance. Although I don't really like the look, but it still remains a solid upgrade in usability over the old interface. A key new feature is the integration of ATC and AI aircraft. Something that MS-Flight Simulator has built in stock. Unfortunately in the current state this feature is lacking. You can only work with IRF flight plans. You don't know take off and landing runways to expect and the ATC get's regularly confused, if you don't hit way points exactly.The AI aircraft are a nice addition, but you can only select a small number. There is no plausible traffic generated and the aircraft ignore your presence. (I had multiple aircraft taxi  though my aircraft.)One further addition is the map. The map is zoomable down to the airport and contains navigation aids, such as ILS and VOR with frequencies. This removes the need to go look for additional charts before heading off for a quick flight.The stock aircraft are well build, with he exception of the Cirrus Vision SF50, which has a half functional glass cockpit. All in all a nice simulator, with some room for improvement.			"

												I am somewhat astonished to give this game a very positive review.     I have purchased earlier verions of X-plane over the years, and not experienced much luck with them.   I'm still not sure why.   Somehow, my gaming hardware just didn't work well with the earlier versions.But now I find that X-plane 11 is running quite satisfactorially on my gaming laptop -- which would seem to be inadequate to the task at first blush.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not getting great frame rates using my toaster-like computer.  But I am getting frame rates that I am perfectly willing to tolerate -- and I am very pleasantly surprised with the simulator as a whole.I have used microsoft flight simulator for many, many years, and still think it's delightful.   But, truth be told, I like X-plane better now.  Every once in awhile one gets a nice surprise.   Well, surprise!   I consider X-plane 11 to be one of those.			"

												I have never been a fan of flying games. I remember as a kid when my dad first got a PC that he got Microsoft Flight Sim, I loved the idea of it, but never learnt how to play it, thus I never got into flight games, but always wanted to. However, about a year ago I picked up a Mad Cat X-55 set for Elite Dangerous, I loved the use of them so I got a few flight games as well to test them out with real aircraft. They where great, however most of the flight sims where not, and VATSIM is far to professional for me to just jump in. Cut to today where I installed X-Plane 11, worried because I got X-Plane 10 and I was not impressed. And I must say, after playing it for about 1 hour, flying over my home city, I am in love with this game! It is so relaxing while at the same time giving you this RPG like feeling of ""You can do anything a real pilot can do"", granted there are not many aircraft yet, but I can really see this game getting a tone of DLC and TLC because of the community, the fact its MOD enabled and the Developers wanting to invest more into it. Also the attention to detail not just in the planes, but in the believable world that for the most part, with other flying games was a disaster of flying blobs and a bunch of 4 houses floating on a PNG of a satalite map. Thumbs up to the Dev for making a game that is spot on what I have always wanted in a flight game, but never got given.			"

												Installed it, runs smooth on 970 gtx, intel 4770 , 16 GB RAM.  I am coming from DCS (not steam version) but comparing this to DCS 2.0 with mult purchsed modules, track ir 5,and Nevada map it just doesn't compare.  DCS is high fidelity, refined and puts you in the cockpit with that head on a swivel feel.  Xplane 11 is slow and clunky.  Track ir 5 support is lame, my head clips through the seat or out of the plane entirely, blocking my view if I am not extremely careful.  IMO DCS 2.0 looks better, feels real with track ir and when you are engaged in a dogfight online the Game engine doesn't get in the way of thrill of it.  I guess it'll work for plugging along in a slow Cessna or a airliner and if that's all you want or expect it'll do.  I'm just disappointed because I had high expectations and hopes coming from DCS which has been out for years.  Also the graphics are kind of poor.  The screen shots that drew me in really just turned out to be cherry picked spots and angles that do not represent what 99% of the game looks like. I only recommend it because it's a good tool for someone going for their private pilot license that needs to get some basics down, or for someone that loves civilian aircraft and want a game that is focused on that type of aircraft.

												This is the flying simulator that we all have been waiting for! The topography is fantastic but the detail could be a little better. Where are the landmark buildings in Chicago? There is Meigs Field but no Sears Tower or Navy Peir. The easeness to set your controls up is great as well. I have been using FSX for a while now and I was able to change all the controls to match FSX with the click of one option. The in coqpit details are amazing and everything is functional. At least the planes I tried were. The ony major gripe I have with the game is that the seaplanes do not act proper when sitting on the water. It basically reminds me of a spastick kid on a trampoline. I would give it a solid 9/10. Fix those few problems and it will be a 10/10.			"

												10 hours in and I have enjoyed this game! I started flying MSFS back when it came on floppy disks.  So it explains perhaps that I have more patience and take off/land with realitive ease.  Yes I did turn on the joystick immediately.  I also have done all flying on Mac OSX.The graphics are superb - especially given my Mac is not the most up to date, but things looked very good.Give yourselve time to learn the shortcuts.  I typically find myself with one hand flying with the joystick and the other using the keyboard until I map more of the common keys over to the joystick.I was disappointed in the Cirrus SF-50's lack of a way to set the transponder.  But that was quickly resolved by updating my local files from the community X-plane.org website.I flew twice into an airport with ATC and experienced a hard crash of the game.  Someone noted this is a known issue an to be resolved in the next update.I then flew via ATC into a different airport, noticing that both departure and destination airports had full ATC and ground; and after landing; received a message that ATC terminated service.  Which was odd because the website it took me to explained I confused the system by having landing when ATC expected me to be flying, etc.Overall happy with my purchase.  I would like to see updates to finish out the planes and stablize things further.			"

			Gameplay for Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0, Dos PC game produced by Microsoft in 1988 - http://www.squakenet.com/download/microsoft-flight-simulator-30/5036/ Flying around in this detailed and...		

I played the game for years and years, about a good week ago i bought xplane 11 (my first xplane).I have to say i was stunned by the graphics & effects. The learning curve is a bit steeper then FSX but you have to see it as a challenge. if you are good with fsx you definitely will be with xplane to, the big difference is the flight planning with the fmc.But it was all worth it. Now i love programming my fmc. The only cons so far:* no visual wet runways (rain)* no droplets from rain on cockpit windows* airports are less Elaborated* less activity on airports (moving jetways, traffic, ect...)* ATC is speaks like someone with radiation poisoning ( they are working on that)Still i prefer Xplane above FSX.... even after so many years.

												I bought fsx during a steam sale while it stoked my love of aviation the programs age (32 bit ) failed to stick with me. Flying close to the ground resulted in an often times blurry un interesting mess and using add on's often resulted in VAS.X-plane 11 right out of the box is a graphical upgrade over fsx in every way. plane models, scenery, weather scenery are breath taking at times. And all this eye candy is well optimized. I run everything maxed out AA off on a fx 8350 gtx 970 and 16 gigs of ram at 40fps.The game is a great simulator everything is there atc, aerodynamics, actual damage to the plane if you crash it ( yep found that out the hard way)  UI dosn't get much friendlier than this. Coming off fsx I had no trouble configuring settings configuring my aircraft, weather, air ports .  There are some glaring issues however.First and my absolute biggest pet peeve with x-plane 11. ATC and traffic around the airport. Request clearances .atc "" a gate hold is in effect for a runway change please hold"" 10,20,30 minutes later you are still waiting as this lone sr-71 meanders around the air port and then idles at a runway... or you do get clearances only to be stuck inline waiting for a plane to taxi onto the runway and take off.... only it never takes off just sits there waiting. Luckly this is easily fixed by downloading a bit of freeware. X-life. But it is still a bug that needs to be worked out of the game( I am pretty sure it is a bug) Also the atc with out x-life will often get stuck in an annoying loop with issuing orders to said sr-71.. constantly telling it to decend in alt. with it constantly confirming the order.... a default flight from kphl to kpit I eventually had to mute atc as it was driving me nuts.My other gripe is the variety in aircraft. The pickings are bare bones as airliners go. The md-82 the 737 and 747. A 777 or dc-10 would have been nice. Technically there is the military version of the dc-10 and a few extra planes but over all it just feels very bare for 60bucks . I am sure the roster will be fleshed out via paid add ons...My 3rd complaint is the air ports and locations. while air ports runways and taxi ways are all laid out correctly they are all very generic looking and major cities have no landmarks. They all still look nice but newyork looks like chicago looks like LA . It's not a deal breaker but a little more detail there would have been apperciated. Over all I reccomend the ""game "" to any one who loves flight sims. Some annoyance and nit picking, aside it is a great sim and a absolute improvment over fsx in every single way. Though, if you have hunders of dollars in payware aircraft for fsx or x-plan 10 you will be dissapointed at the pickins as air craft go.			"

												Very good game!! Im very new to flight simulators and this one is very complicated yet very easy. At first I started with the flight school which tought me how to fly. From there i kept watching youtube videos on how to use fmc system and to file a flight plan. Soon I made my first landing in cuba international airport. I do recomond this game if you have patience and a steering wheel or joystick. (I use my g27 as of right now, hope to get a joystick soon).Thank you,Killer			"

												I bought this game for my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014). I was worried that the frame rate would be very bad, and that the game would be unplayable for my computer. I could not have been farther from the truth. This game so far has gave me no problems whatsoever, and I am extremely pleased with its performance. I fly with high graphic settings and high amounts of scenery. I did download this product on an external drive, to save space on my computer, which may correlate to its suprising success. I would highly recommend this product, it is very well done in my opinion.			"

												This review is intended for FSX users who are thinking about making the jump to Xplane, XPLANE FANBOYS PLS STAY AWAYAs a player who deeply enjoyed FSX this has been my experience so far:CONS-Many airports are empty (Try flying out of the US and it will be ALMOST ALL), they just have runways, dev says that there is a gateway where players upload scenery (using default buildings, no custom scenery) which end ups being loaded to the game with updates, however I've just discovered that this feature is on beta for Xplane 11, so no gateway, no updates, more empty airports for now at least, they didn't even bothered with making capital cities airpots or scenery, there is freeware which is outdated and payware which I wont pay for.-No buildings or bridges are modeled in this game, its almost all randomly generated, so if you want to do VFR, only roads and topography will help you out.-GPS doesn't have airspaces loaded outside of the US-Can't request ATC for lower/higher flight level midflight, you'll have to fulfill a new flight plan with the new flight level and go through all the clearances again.-All AI traffic has a call sign N0xXP (x being a number) quite annoying to hear the same callsing over and over again-ATC in general is bad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, buged, stupid, I hate it, and has NO VFR, remmember doing VFR on FSX and requested a full stop landing with airport's tower ATC which in response would give us a runway to land? in Xplane we don't have that, if you are flying VFR and want a runway assigned you'll have to fill an IFR flightplan before landing, go through all the clearances and then ATC will give you stupid instructions for the approach, detouring you for dozens of NM as if your were in a ♥♥♥♥ing 747 when you are actually flying in a C172, what catches my eye is that xplane users have been complaining about this for years, dev didn't listen, DEVS DON'T LISTEN. So there is really no VFR in this game at least not if you do NOT want to get hit by a departing plane when you are landing yours.-AI traffic is bugged, sometimes it works, many times it doesn't, meaning that for no reason AI AC will be there parked in the middle of the taxiway without moving.-Jets leave an ugly thick black smoke trail, as if the plane was on fire, instead of the white thin pretty one from FSX (closer to what IRL looks)-This was extremely important to me: NO WINTER, there is no snow in this game, let me rephrase that: there are no seasons at all.-Can't change the tailnumber/callsign of any AC within the game.-If you use any career mode, I use FSEconomy, on my High end pc I can only accelerate time by 2x, 3x if I'm lucky, on my laptop I can't accelerate time at all, so long haul flights will be LONG LONG boring flights.-Don't be fool by their deceiving ""full game demo"", the demo is restricted to a zone they have crafted with buildings and detailed airports, but once out of that zone when you buy the game, most airports are empty and randomly generatedPROS:-Slightly better graphics.-Good flight models.-No OOMs.-Liked the idea of the World editor, I've made my local airport and its nice (This is by far the only thing keeping me from going back to FSX)For me, if I had known from the start that there were no seasons and that time acceleration was almost non-existent I would't have bought the game at all, the other problems just make me regret this purchase even more, maybe I was expecting too much, the fact that this simulator is being released 11 years after FSX and realize that it actually has less features for slightly better graphics is a complete disappointment. Don't get me wrong I really wanted to like this game, I even uninstalled FSX and all addons from my 2 computers, I will keep trying to like it (TBH my refund time is over, so I don't have a choice) however I will be probably be going back to FSX.

												I cannot say that I recommend this at all, at least not at $59.99. The product feels unfinished and leaves a lot to be desired. Specifically, I fly out of KAPA in Denver, and VFR is a joke. Landmarks are unrecognizable, as is the city. DTG's Flight School did a better render of the airport and the city. This flight sim is in desperate need of Orbx to fix the roads and many other things. Why are the power lines so prominent? Why are the trains running in an infinite loop consisting of one square block? If you fly at 35,000 ft. and you don't mind incompetent ATC, then this is the flight sim for you.			"

												Improved over XP10 with a slightly more organized GUI at the expense of less customizability. Outstanding lighting, reflections, and shadows. Horrible AI, no VFR ATC at all - IFR plans only. Still has the ""plausible"" autogen with generic buildings in major cities. No state capitols or anything.I feel as if the improved flight modeling of X-Plane is comparable to a high quality payware FSX addon, like something with Accusim. Lack of actual city skyline recreations without an abundance of scenery addons leaves a lot to be desired still in this less popular flight sim.			"

												I have played quite a bit of X-plane 11. I have't played X-Plane 10 mostly because this is my upgrade from FSX (now very outdated) and the graphics in this game are AMAZING! Yes they are a bit frame rate heavy but there are so many more features I love. The AI are not the best and they need some work on (like how they try to land and takeoff through buildings) and how the shading blocks up a bit occasionally. So yes, this game needs a bit of work, but if they fix these bugs, it could be the best flight sim on the market currently. It is a great game and that's all that matters.			"

												After spending a fair amount of hours in this simulator all I am left with is frustration. My biggest gripe is the FMC which is completly broken.

												Recommended because it's beautiful and has the potential to be a highly immersive flying experience.HOWEVER. It is buggy in it's current state. Using default ATC and calling ""Field in sight"" can cause a CTD (this is a known issue). This is a bit of a downer as you have to kiss off ATC (cancel IFR) when you think this maybe about to occur. I've had other CTDs when using default ATC (holding point at runway, on climb out etc. You can get round some of this by using plugin ATC (example 124th ATC) but these (IMO) have their own issues.Track IR (essential for my simming experience) is badly implemented in the vanilla game (you can move your head outside the cockpit). Fortunately, this is easily fixed using the excellent X-camera plugin.When they fix the CTD issue and ATC functions without binning you out of the game, this will be  a fantastic sim. Descending through a cloud base on approach  at night over a city is a breathtaking experience and will leave you needing more. Until they fix it, you can work around the problems with the caveat that some of the immersion will go.			"

												We need a waving hand on the reviews. This game is neither good or bad. - The graphics are a mixed bag, with good lighting but awful clouds - much worse than any flight sim since 2003 that I can think of (except, maybe FlightGear).- Flight model is very suspicious. Some stuff feels quite authetinc. But the helicopter, specifically, is just a tiny bit more detailed than the bland FSX helicopter dynamics. If, like me, helicopters are a big thing for you, go for DCS World or use FSX with HTR mod if money is tight.- The world is detailed, but the game engine still is old-school = hammers like crazy the core-0 without any real multi-threading. FPS is not the worst for a sim, though. 30-40 fps in a modern Intel CPU. Lame, I know, but we are talking about Flight Sims. Hardly there's one fully modern engine optimized to multi-cores. My recommendation? A weaving hand. Wait for a sell if you own X-Plane 10. Helicopters dynamics are better on the older version anyway. If you are crazy for this game, get the demo on the developer site and see for yourself. Be aware though: Seattle area is the best scenery in the whole game. Everything else, by default, is subpar compared to the default stuff on FSX. You can do your own orthographic sceneries relatively easy but time consuming. I think a game should sell itself by what's included, not what can be modded into it. But hey, that's me.			"

												Basic review of X Plane 11 from a FSX user. I have been using FSX since it came out and never used XP before.I decided to give XP a go and its awesome and a bit frustrating.First the good stuff.-Graphics. For a standard sim its unbelievable!!-Flight model. Very realistic and much better than FSX.-The general scenery is very nice.-Airport scenery is awesome.The bad.-Graphics. Don't for one moment think you are going to get anywhere near playable FPS with the recommended requirements. You need a beast of a PC to run this at max settings.-Scenery. Don't get me wrong its amazing but at more than 60 GB there is still so much missing. For example I live in South Africa so I do most of the flying in that region. My hometown airport FARG is amazing but FAOR(OR Tamb Int airport) which is the main hub and the most busiest airport in Africa has no buildings, proper markings or ground services. Bit strange if you ask me.-Bugs, There is a lot of bugs like a Beechcraft Baron 58 suddenly starts flying like a Cessna because one engine is just missing. Lots of random game crashes.-Setting up of controls. The sim will id your joystick automatic but to fine tune it is very hard. 3rd party apps is what you need here but once everything is tuned its awesome.-ATC. Just horrible. Freaks out and gives very bad directions. No taxi control with small aircraft.-Flight planning, FSX was very easy. XP not so much.Most of the bad stuff is just bugs that will be fixed with the first patch, hopefully.Then a word of advice for all the FSX users. Changing to XP is not at all easy. Everything is different so you will need to take the time to read and watch a lot of videos but in the end its worth it. I recommend this sim but rather wait till the first patch to avoid frustration. "

												$60 sim with a very small selection of planes. While I do like the engine, the lack of planes alone make me feel that this is just not worth $60. Also, for some reason the sim does not have a proper GPS like what is in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. Meaning that if you do not know how to communicate with the radio or program the navigation system, you will never find your destination. Even the DCS series has a proper map. I saw some threads in the community hub where people were asking about this, and the devs responded by saying that there is no ""magic"" map. A $60 skeleton sim was bad enough, but the attitude just kills it for me. I'll check this out again in a year when they lower the price by 50%, double the selection of planes AND add a proper GPS system for those who just like to fly.			"

												I cannot understand all the glowing reviews. Perhaps these users have never tried Prepare3D (or even FSX) because, even with all rendering options maxed out, X Plane 11 has no identifiable buildings or landmarks in any of the cities I have flown over thus far. Las Vegas is a barren strip! Nothing. Nada. Los Angeles is completely non-descript. I have no idea what's taking up 55 GB of scenery on my hard drive, but it's certainly not anything close to the default scenery in the competition. So much for VFR flying. Very disappointed.			"

												The amazing graphics is the only way X-Plane 11 beats FSX. The planes look great and so does the scenery, but that's about all I liked about this sim. The first thing I noticed I hated was the default sounds of jets was extremely bland and unrealistic. I have the X-Plane 9 app for iOS and the sounds are 100% similar, totally outdated and unrealistic. Also, I couldn't get my yoke to work properly, it was always way, way too sensitive. All software is up-to-date, and X-Plane has no problem recognizing my yoke, but, no matter what I do, the controls react way too much to my input. Flying by hand has been made impossible because the slightest input causes me to fly off course in a heartbeat.			"

												Despite some fanboys saying its great, don't purchase this yet, xplane 10 still better. Aircraft seem to lack reflection, helicopter model is weird, doesnt correctly identify the controllers they all have controller ID 0. Some lazy textures at airports eg passengers just drawn on windows not moving. No ground services moving. Don't waste your money yet stick with xplane 10. This still seems to be in Beta. Hopefully they will improve it, at this stage though I dont think its worth wasting your hard earned cash. I flew a 747 did impossible turns and it never stalled . Helicopter vrs doesn't seem to exist, was so easy to land compared to xplane 10. Physics seem too easy and not right.The game is not ready in my opinion as a full release, some die hard xplane fans may say otherwise but the truth is it's at the bottom of all other Sims at moment, it's just not finished , perhaps it will become,one of the best but at the moment it's certainly nowhere near the top 3 flight Sims			"

												I've believed possitive reviews and i bought it. But i can easly say all of them Gta players :) and who blamed p3d or fsx they only played default game. If there is real pilot or simulation lovers stop wasting your time by reading my review and do not buy it and back your fsx or p3d...Dear arcade lovers,Please do not compare games with your poor experience and absolutely SIMULATORS! Graphics, yes it's looking cute but not realistic at all. Mario has cute graphics too. This game created by 3d engine so this game never ever'll have photorealistic graphics. Boeing 737-800 looks like cartoon. Absouletely looks like Cities Skylines!Sounds, yes they tried effects but needs a lot of fixes and engine sounds not realistic like PMDG!Realism, there is no realism and i did not find realism settings except G-Factor damage which doesn't work. If you start diving to ground with 450kt you can easly save aircraft from 500feet. You can really fly like f-16 maybe with better characteristics. There is no drag factor and you can climb 90 degree with 737 after takeoff. If you still think it's realistic just try barrel roll in X-Plane11 and check this videos from youtube /watch?v=A7SqcEHRa-U      /watch?v=gnOI_s4x8f0If you think they'll release add-ons please do not wait for it for 10 years. Weather engines, sceneries, Photoreals, great physics, aircrafts, Vatsim connection and if you use your own company apps. We've waited pmdg's 737 maybe for 3 years!!! So do not wait for add-ons.This game better than GTA-V about planes! But %100 worst than p3d or fsx!Last note: If you wanna play arcade you can buy. But if you are simulator lover, really sweet! do not buy it.I'm so sorry that i cheat you dear love i'll be back :( (Prepar3d)			"

												EDIT: FlyInside seems to have ironed out a lot of VR problems. I was a little harsh on them. But the game I still don't like.No native VR support, full of bugs, and a sucks-so-bad-it's-not-even-funny ATC. I bought this thinking maybe the flight sim community had matured a bit from its past days as a bunch of morons, but sadly...no.Yea, it's pretty when it works! And that's good enough for the community still, apparently.			"

												If you are a P3D or FSX user wanting to buy this, do not! Addons are garbage, loading times are forever, the game always hangs, and all the airplanes are garbage (even payware aircrafts)! DO NOT BUY!!!!! I wasted $60 for a game that is worth 1 cent. And also, scenery is junk, everywhere you go, even in New York, instead of having tall buildings and what not, IT IS FULL OF FARM LAND, the entire game scenery except the airports looks like an agricultural zone rather than a busy city.

												This simulator is to much of an arcade game then a real simulator, the detail in the cockpit is decent if the game were released 5 years ago, however for a game from 2017 it is not.The game is also not very well optimized and even at the lowest possible settings in a helicopter you have around 30fps.It does support multimonitors in a better way then most other simulators, however not as good as for example DCS does.It does say it supports online multiplayer, however i have not seen a single way in the menu to join a server.A game like this in its current state would be better if its priced around 29,99 and not the price it has right now.---The FPS i was talking about was at a multimonitor setup on 3x1080p.Also my PC has the recommonded hardware and the FPS test was done while checking cpu and gpu load.A game like DCS ( the A-10c ) which i played alot has alot more detail in the cockpit and into flying, this game lacks that.If you want a game with hardly any learning curve then this the game for you, if however you want a game that is a real simulator with a proper modelled cockpit then this is not the game you are looking.

												Eventough I have very time put in to the simulator i wanted to write this review early to help answer questions which I had myself.X-Plane 11Pros- you can just transfer everything over to the correct x-plane 11 folders and it should work. I have to get rid of 3 freeware plane because of errors but out of my 30ish plus planes they all work.- Scenery was the same as planes. The original scenery is ugh ugly and if you have the huge scenery files just copy and past them over- same thing with plugins. I have noticed a lot of plugin are already x-plane 11 ready, so one should update anyway.- setup is much better but it is tyaking a bit of time to get used to the changes but they are positive- flying planes seems easier and controllers have wizards to setup the up proper- load times are faster!Cons- X-Plane 10 planes that get transfered over have green boxes around the controls on most planes. it is annoying but not a biug deal.

												Loving this flightsim.... I started this series experience with X-Plane 9, didn't think much of 10 but did my best at enjoying a slightly polished version of 9. Now... 11 is looks really good and the interface/GUI for settings, weather, & aircraft are the best ever for X-Plane. Game runs fast and seems to balance rendering well with my system. After playing this sim for 2hrs I have uninstalled FSXSE and ready for the next 1-2 years of community mods and payware planes. My biggest concern with purchasing this was my system being able to handle it; haven't touched my system/hardware (no choice really) and the game looks great (mid-high settings). They have done a great job; highly recommend this one. Cons: ATC sucks still...they did make a better GUI with ATC but still - was hopping for voice-syn. I did see (X-Plane forum) they're working on this issue with Microsoft. Last issue, they dropped some of their 'legacy' aircraft from 9 and 10. *MSI GT72 6QD Dominator (i7-6820HK, 16gb RAM, GTX970M) - Laptop "

												I'd have to say this version of simulator is much better then the previous x-plane games and it runs really smooth. I would however, like to see more planes as freeware in the game added. Also I would like to see more ATC functionality added. oh also some of the locations that I fly over are not very detailed, meaning that no visable landmakrs are shown. would love to see this fixed but who am I to say what the developers whant in there games.

												Just picked up this flight simulator and I am loving it.  I'm currently running this with a HTC Vive using FlyInside on the default graphics settings for the GTX 970.  So far I'm pleased with the upgraded graphics from FSX and XP10.  I've only had a chance to mess around with the Cessna 172 and the Beechcraft Baron.  I'll list some pros and cons from my experience so far and will update this review later when I have a chance to get more indepth with the various components of XP11.  Pros: Fully interactive cockpit!  Even the vents are interactive!  There is no handy pop-up window that will let you know what the switch is from a distance though, but if you already know what you're doing it's not that much of a problem. LOL FlyInside + HTC Vive = Mind blowing experience for the flight sim fan!  FSX with FlyInside was AWESOME!  Even for a game from 2006, the VR gave it all new legs and I sunk another 40 hours in on it since getting VR in November.  There are still some graphical settings I need to tweak in XP11 however. Very indepth simulator that you can fine tune for your experience.  I can't wait to play with Plane Maker on this one.  I got some more free time and will probably sink a bunch of hours in it trying to create some ultralights and gyrocopters I've had my eye on tinkering with in real life... Looking at modeling the Sport Copter II and the Carter Copter.Cons: Currently experiencing some graphic glitches and tearing.  I haven't played with the settings much since I've just picked it up and started playing yesterday at the time of this review.  I'm also upgrading to the 1080 Ti within the month too so my opinion may hopefully change. Landscaping isn't as accurate as FSX in terms of the coloring.  For example, when I was working on my license last year in San Diego I would fly touch and goes between Gillespie Field and Browns Field and the terrain was fairly accurate in FSX.  However in XP11, it looked much different and I even missed the turn for a long final because I couldn't find the runway!  I almost flew into Tijuana to line up with TIA.   No Velocity XL model yet!  I have one for both FSX and XP10.  Now I'm going to have to figure out how to import it :(If you have VR and are a flight sim fan, this is a must have.  I'm sure the goodies from the community will be similar to XP10 and there will be a lot to enjoy in the future.			"

												I'm running into a fair amount of bugs on my Ubuntu system. ATC is buggy. When I select 'report field in sight' I crash to desktop. I would like to get vectors for instrument approaches, however, I have to worry about the ATC crashing the sim. Also the inability to receive AWOS/ATIS weather while a flight plan is open is frustrating. Those are my main beefs. I like it on the whole but need some bugs taken care of. Even if the ATC were bug-free, it is atrocious.			"

												I am changing my review dramatically.  I have now had this sim for a week, and used it a lot.  While it has a way to go, the sim isn't as bad as I first thought.  I have seen things already improved in it.  Yes, the ATC is worse than horrible (sorry, but it is), but I have seen some improvements.  Flying is a pure joy.  The airports are pretty good in their default condition, but again not perfect.  The planes that come with the sim are adequate (at worst) and good (at best).  I think it fair to say they are bette than those that come with FSX.  I used that sim literally for 27 years.  I have owned nine different versions.  But it is old, 32-bit and is what it is.  X-Plane 11 is new and shiny.  The scenery (as I am sure you must be aware of by now) is fantastic.  All in all, I give X-Plane 11 a thumbs up and encourage you to consider it if you like flying a sim.  I can HONESTLY say that I am glad I bought it.  It needs work, but the developers appear to be active in the forums and seem to want to know what needs fixed.  Let's just hope they fix it in a timely fashion.			"

												I wasn't interested in XP10 but I'm glad I bought this game. It's rough edges, Cirrus Vision SF50 doesn't have a transponder for example, and Sedona airport approach is bugged, but the 3D airports at night are great. This is the first sim I've played to where I actually enjoy flying at night. I'm not looking forward to spending money on DLC to get it to exactly what I want but that's the way it goes I suppose.

Reason is im a trucker and its not practical with a joystick.			"
