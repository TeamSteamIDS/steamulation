												Princess Battles is a charming, quirky, totally enjoyable little card battle/visual novel hybrid that despite a silly story and simple game play stands as a shining example of how creativity and humor can make a smaller title more fun than flashier games in the genre.  Life as a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Between unwanted marriage proposals and commoners aiming to dethrone you through popular opinion, it's a tough life.  What's a princess to do when even her royal parents find her rival more praiseworthy than herself?  Card battling, that's what!  The premise is preposterous, but that's why I love it so much.  Princess Battles knows exactly what it is and plays to its silliness with perfection.   In this world, a lady's parlor game is no laughing matter. Tournaments, black market card trading, demonic overlords, card battle schools, all ridiculous ideas that click together and work mostly because the story never takes itself too seriously.   I love Lillian.  She's a spoiled, lazy and entitled brat, but that is precisely what makes her so endearing.  We're given a caricature who acts more realistic than most other ""perfect"" protagonists.  Even though she's far from the ideal princess, through the challenges she faces in her rise to Prima champion, she grows and matures, but never entirely loses that impudent attitude.  Oddly enough, her love interests make more sense for it.  Perfection is boring, guys want a girl with character and spunk, and Lillian has it in spades.

Speaking of love interests, the boys are appealing, too, in their own ways, though we're not given nearly as much time with them as I would have liked.  Perhaps another scene or two of dialogue and a little more development of their characters would have fleshed out their stories a bit more.  But I admit, outside of satisfying my own desire for experiencing the ""feels"" of romance, it probably wouldn't have benefited the game much as it works so well simply because it's not as deep or complicated as it could be.  That goes for the game play as well.The game consists of visiting various areas and selecting dialogue choices between characters to further the plot with card battles sprinkled in.  The battle system itself is simple enough to enjoy casually, but allows for a bit of strategy to keep the player engaged.  A race to max stats against your opponent, you play princess themed cards to either increase your stats or decrease your opponent's, all while juggling your gold and energy.  As with other card games, success often comes down to the luck of the draw which at times can be frustrating, but the battles are usually short enough to not feel like a total waste of time if you lose.  My sole complaint with the system is a bug that does not allow your opponent's attack cards to affect your stats.  While this makes the game easier (although success is by no means guaranteed), it removes some of the strategy from play and makes Free Play mode less attractive.  I certainly hope the bug is fixed as I'd love to build and play around with my own free play deck, but it's only worth it if the card battles are working the way they should.

Which brings me to game length.  Free Play mode would add several hours of game play if only the battle bug were fixed.  The main game itself is rather short taking only about 3 hours to complete.  There is plenty of replayability, however, with over two dozen achievements leading through most of the branching dialogue paths and in-game events.  It took me a good 12 hours to make 27/28 with that last one eluding me, but I'll get it yet! Despite a few shortcomings, I enjoyed Princess Battles immensely.  It's not often I am this impressed by a title that looked much less adventurous and entertaining than it proved to be.  The price may be daunting for some due to the short play time, but I feel I've gotten my money's worth given how much I enjoyed what's here.  If you're looking for silly fun with a dash of romance tossed in, pick up Princess Battles.  On sale, off sale - it's worth it either way.  I know I'll be supporting Nekomura Games in the future, especially if they continue to bring the same creativeness and humor to their other titles.Bottom Line - Worth it for the humor alone, Princess Battles deserves a spot in any visual novel lover's library.  Recommended.			"

												TL;DR: If you want an otome game that is all about the romance and exploring the idea of falling in love with the different characters... you're not really going to get that. It's a card battling game with a bit of princessy fluff surrounding it. The card game itself is fun and not super challenging, so if you want something you can come back to and play from time to time even after you 100% the game, you should pick this one up!---Overall impression: Generally positive. It's a bit rough around the edges in places, but certainly is a game I'd recommend for younger players or those who are quite sensitive to more mature content. It might also be a good way to get a friend into otome games if they wouldn't normally play them but might play a card game.Content: I can't think of any content warnings that might be necessary. It's rather G-rated. About the only ""questionable"" content I can think of is if you fail a particular battle you'll be [SPOILER - locked in a cage and kept as 'pet']. Neither the art nor the text implies anything sexual or violent about it. Rather, the princess is just bored out of her mind. Translation: N/A (?) As far as I'm aware, the creators speak English as a first language. Editing: A few typos here and there, but nothing glaring. Art: Pretty decent. It's a cute anime style. A few odd CGs here and there, but effort was clearly made. If you like what you see in the screenshots; etc, you should be fine.Character Design: It was a little amusing to see how they'd incorporate strawberries into each of the outfits the princess collected throughout the game. Some of them are positively outlandish. (Not necessarily negatively - just out there.) Some of the outfits are pretty nice.Story: A spoiled and disinterested princess feels her position as heir to the throne threatened by an upstanding citizen named Olivia. (Olivia is herself an hommage to raising sim games, particularly Princess Maker.) She enlists the help of friends to become accomplished in about the only thing Olivia hasn't mastered yet - Prima, a card-battling game for (generally upperclass) ladies.Along the way, she can fall in love with one of three gentlemen - her tutor (honestly, he's useless at his job), a thief/shady card trader (you can only trade cards with him in Freeplay Mode), and the prince her family wants her to marry. There is also a fourth ""unlockable"" love interest, a demon. [SPOILER: You win him over in the game proper, don't end up with one of the other three love interests when you end the game, and then in FreePlay, spam ""Trade Cards"" until he shows up instead of the thief.] The gentlemen suffer a bit because they're not given enough time to show off their personalities. The two characters I liked most got the least amount of ""on screen"" time. The other two felt bland, just because they were of a similar character type and, again, didn't have much of a chance to develop, even though they had the most screen time out of the guys. Even side characters like Lina, Olivia, and the demon princess were more fleshed out and distinct in spite of having less time on screen.Don't expect much more story than, ""I'm not letting Olivia take my place! I'll learn Prima and get good! (Maybe I'll fall in love too?) Oh hey, here I am at the huge Prima tournament and once that's over, that's The End.""Honestly, as a ""story"", the game suffers a little for being just that. There's nothing in-depth about the romances. No real ""falling in love"" stage for any of them and even the bonus stories don't do that great a job of bridging the gap. It all seems quite abrupt. I'm also a little bummed that there was no ending where you and Olivia decided to get along.The Heroine: On the positive side, she has a personality of her own. She's quite distinct as a character. Unfortunately, I find her terribly rude (sometimes even in her ""good"" answers) and self-centered. She improves only very slightly throughout the story. Fortunately, she does have her moments, but I honestly thought for all her faults, Olivia really was a better heir for the kingdom. I'm not entirely sure whether I was supposed to admire the princess or not.In closing...: I sound quite negative about the game overall, but I'm really not. It's a cute game that's very light and fluffy. The Prima card game is the shining feature and clearly a ton of work went into making it run well and polishing the game flow. The fact that it's a game that I could let my nieces play when they're a little older is even better. I know I'll be returning to Princess Battles from time to time just to futz around in Free Play mode. Prima's good fun!			"

												I'm a fan of visual novels and otome games, so when I saw the game on Steam I was intrigued by it. Unfortunately this game managed to disappoint me. On the surface Princess Battles is an okay game. The biggest problem with it, is how short it is. The characters you meet seem interesting, but you don't get to know them properly. By the time the game gets going it's already over. The battles are pretty easy and there's only one difficulty level. On the plus side it has replay value, since it has several men who you can pursue. I struggled with whether to recommend it or not. I'd give it a neutral score if I could. All in all, you end up wanting more of it than it provides, which means that there is potential, but it is unfortunately wasted. Grab it if you can get it at a discount. I'd say it's not worth the full price, at least not for me.			"

												Getting proposed to by a complete stranger is just another day in the life of being a princess. This game is cute and fun but very short. I got through the whole thing in about an hour and replayed several times for various romantic endings. The artwork is creative and the card game contains cards that remind me of the Princess Maker series. The card game is simple but very much dependant on luck. I just wish there was more to the game, even with going back and unlocking different endings, the card tournament just felt really short. Needs more story.It's a lot of $$ to pay for a game that feels really short and lacking in story and card game play. There's some replay value (if you want to unlock all the endings). Many cute outfits so she can be dressed up as a gothic lolita or a maid, with many more outfits to choose from. But actual gameplay is so short I can't help but feel like I've wasted my money. Wait for a sale before picking up this one. "

												Fun game, would be great if it were a little longer but definitely worth buying and playing.  Yes, you have to deal with a bratty princess to start out, but there's actual choice about which way she develops.  She isn't a pushover, which is rather nice.  There are a number of interesting endings, which add to playing time and value.Artwork is very nice, main story and story arcs are well done, card battles are slightly repetitive but the difficulty progression is good (especially the first time through).  And despite the repetition, I did find the card games fun.I managed to get through my first ""let's see how it works"" run through without achieving a single ""good"" romantic ending, but I got a lot further the second time through.  Not a spoiler, but good to know:  always visit every available location at every opportunity (first time through I made the assumption it was like Long Live the Queen and similar - could only make once choice at any given time of day).Overall, for me this was an 8/10 as a more casual, less intense VN/sim.  I'm glad I bought it (although being on sale was a plus!).  Also - the Steam Trading Cards are cute.			"

												Princess Battles is a fresh and funny otome game with an original system : you have to do card battles which will affect your destiny if you win or not. Simples and funny romances with 4 boys ! ^_^What I like the most- the card battle system (after the main story done, you can play in free play mode and make your own deck, so you can play your otome game again and again without being bored)- the heroines' costumes are so cute and colorful (I like them)- the achievements aren't only unlocked in the main story, but also in the free play mode (so it's not too easy to unlock all of them)- the extra stories are good- the visual art is really good (I love the CGs : some of them are really romantic and there are all so colorful)- the music is good too- you can make choices not only for your romance (to be married or to elope), but also for your future (become a pro card battler or a queen)- you can change the heroine's attitude (for example, if you don't like her selfish side like me, you can make her into a perfect princess who will become a perfect queen)- the game isn't fully voiced, but all the characters (the heroine included) make a different voice's sound depending of the situation (they can laugh, shows their amusement, embarrassment, anger...), so it's funnySo, I recommend it if you want to play an otome game, not only for its story but also for its original game's system (here's card battles) ! ^^			"

												This review is coming from someone that really liked ""Long Live The Queen"", and after finishing that game I searched for something similar and Princess Battles fills that void. Though the game isn't identical to LLTQ both are addictive once you understand the rules. With multiple endings that relie on choices you've made and people you've offened :p This game's pace and length are admirable since its long enough to keep my interest while allowing me to then replay it to find the other endings. I like it and it's fun! I wish there were more games like Princess Battles on Steam.			"

												This game is amazing but in its own way. Fans of the visual novel genre must be aware of how important are the card batles in this game. They're like the main point of the game and the biggest fun you have on it. The writting is pretty good though. This game is just... hilarious. It's really, really funny and silly and I love it. It's not a extremely deep and complex game but it's very charming and nice. I would like to see a little bit more of diversity in the characters but oh well. At least we have plenty of awesome female characters. Also kudos for the different endings you can get though this game is mostly about the card battles(that are awesome btw). 08/10!			"

												This game I felt a bit disappointed by.  It felt more like a beta or a short version to hint at something larger.  As other reviews have stated - it's much too short.  The price tag is very overinflated for what you get.  I wouldn't pay more than 8-10$ on sale for it if you are interested in this style of game.  In general I feel a little cheated by how much they charge for how little play time you get.  I've seen free games of the dating genre with longer play times than this one.Lots of clever ideas, but much too short for what they want to charge...great premise that fell short in my opinion.  Too bad really, I felt like there was a lot of potential and that the designers must have just gotten lazy on length.  Such a pity.			"

												decent art, minimum cgs, mediocre uninteresting plot, cheesy romanceI love visual novels, if they come with silly mini games that's a bonus. I don't have very high standards for them, because I like the genre enough and there aren't many. not in english anyway. as i was saying, this one was bad, I didnt even finish it. do not recommend. don't buy it.
