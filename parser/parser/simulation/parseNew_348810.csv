								If you love tanks definately try this one. its easy to get into, and once you know the controls its great fun. i suggest playing in hard mode if your playing single player mode. Its at its best when you are playing the Soviet and German missions.I would love to see the Tiger, King Tiger, and IS-2 tanks in this game. I dont play games for the multiplayer mode so i wont comment on that aspect.The graphics are nothing special, but they certainly do the job here. you can easily tell who your guys are, and who the enemy even from great distances.The first person fighting is really quite fun, its simplified but fast paced and a feeling of ugency is really there if your in hard mode.the strategy map that you have is easy to use, and extremely helpful to see exactly whats out there and what to use against a particular enemy. theres even air strikes and artillery available and its great to use.I would like to see the graphics improve, and more tanks to use. The combination of the stategy map and everything running in real time, with the fun 1st person action is awesome andit allows you to play the game in different ways. If you want to stick to the strategy aspect and avoid the first person stuff you can if you like. you can also play largely from the first person mode as well.I find its best to use both at appropriate moments, you will soon know when to be using which for best effect.Good luck to the Devs on this title, I love tank games in general and this is a true gem to me personally.

								I nearly didnt buy this game because of a negative review by somebody who only played it for 1 hour and when I did get it I wasnt too impressed and wished I'd saved my money. however after looking past the very basic graphics and getting into the gameplay I now think it is a very playable highly tactical game. One of the issues I was struggling with was the controls, everything in the control setup was reffering to aeroplanes and playing this game with keyboard and joystick wasnt right, once I managed to get the gunners station controlled by mouse things took a very different turn and the game became very good, theres nothing as satisfying as destroying an enemy tank while its moving flat out accross your front using old fashioned gunnery techniques ie, no lazer, autolay or computers to help, just get on with it. basically this game is about the gameplay. its very messy setting it up and the basic graphics and sounds can lead you to think its all crap, give it a go, take time to understand it and you will have hours of fun. If you liked M1 Tank Platoon you'll like this			"

								A sort of modern version of the classic ""M1 Tank Platoon"" yet I wouldn't put it on the same high level as that brilliant sim.In fact, ""M4 Tank Brigade"" feels more like a tank *game* than a tank simulation.At the easiest level there appears to be no limit on ammunition available to  the player and the gunnery capability of the enemy leaves a lot to be desired.I also find the setting up of mouse/keyboard/joystick to be very confusing and not intuitive at all.However, for $15, and the fact that it is under ongoing development, you probably can't expect much more - and that's a qualified recommendation.

								I think this game works.The tanks are great, the tactics and formations are great, of course I only played this on rookie so far so it seems pretty easy for my Shermans to smash Panthers and Panzer IV's, I imagine once I up the difficulty I'll feel cold sweat fighting against superior tanks.Artillery, air strikes/recon, maneuverable tanks and somewhat realistic physics shooting the weapons.  Explosions rain all over the place, over my forces and the enemies my platoon fires at.  It feels like a toned down war, but once I inject myself into the world it's pretty awesome.  Again, I am sure once the difficulty is up I'll be eating those words as this is all on rookie.  I am sure I won't have as much artillery and airstrikes available.  I am sure the enemy tanks will return ACCURATE fire.  I am sure I will have to dig deep and use that terrain and set traps for the oncoming IV's and Panthers.I feel this is a good game considering the existence of WoT.Multiplayer too?  I haven't tried that yet, but if I can play my favorite Panzer IV's and Panthers I'd gladly play more often.From what I can tell though, not so big a player base online.			"

								If you're a old school wargamer who likes great tank games like Steel Fury or Steel Beasts where you could prowl the battlefield and command a virtual batallion with infantry, artillery and the like, you may want to wait to see where this game is headed. This game reminds me of Panzer Elite Action where theres no tank interior or feeling of a lumbering killing machine. Just line up your shot and click the mouse. Not much by way of simulation.The UI is a bit confusing at first, the tanks are a bit fast and hopefully the Devs will address the Line of Sight issue where tanks constantly fire at objects beyond a hill that's not even in view (sometimes the object doesn't even exist). Its not a bad game, it just feels like another Point and Click tank game where your A.I tanks just follow you around behaving like mindless guns. Profiles also seem to vanish. I have to create a new Profile everytime I start the game. The game also crashes after I complete the first mission so I have no idea what other missions look like because they have to be unlocked. Guess its a risk you take with Early Access. Lets just hope the Devs refine and mature the gameplay.			"

								The graphics are terrible and the sound is even worse. I don't care if this an indie game or whatever, it looks and sounds terrible. Why have 20 different tank models if they're all ugly?The gameplay is solid but the campaigns are INCREADIBLY monotonous. The tutorial is hidden under ""Class User Interface"" and then going to the single player campaign, no mention of this.I WOULD recommend this game to people who love WW2 tank sims but I cannot do that in good faith because the developers have completely abonded the game. COMPLETELY ABAONDED. Go look at the iEntertainment Network social media pages, they're just shilling their warplane and hunting games. This developer is contributing to the cancer that is Steam Early Access and I hope it comes back to bit them some day.			"
