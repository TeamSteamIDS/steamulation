Early Access Review
								Edit, March 2017:Any potential buyers please be aware that the campaign - which was the main selling point for me - is still not functional at all as of now. I don't know how much more time it will take for it to be, but I have to say I'm quite disappointed that there is practically no advancement on that front (sic) from what I see. I think before jumping on the VR hype train and implementing such a superficial feature, the dev would have done better with first getting the game going. Oh well. Don't want to down-talk this game yet, but any potential buyer just be aware that as of now, other than just flying around and dropping ordnance on random objects, there is no real game here yet. Original Review follows:I'm flying Flightsims since 1995, and do also retro-simming on Flightsims from 1991 on.From my early impression - this is a true spiritual successor to EF2000. It features a Dynamic Campaign, that aloneis awesome when you look at all the naysayers on flightsim forums who use to say ""It can't be done, it is teh hard"".Systems and Flight model wise it is a step above EF2000 and significantly above Strike Fighters actually, but not on the level of military-grade simulators likethe DCS series or Falcon BMS. But it was never intended to and the developer was clear on it.The avionics are modelled to the degree they are really mission relevant. You have your main MFD pages, with the MFDs being clickable: Navigation / HSD, Radar, FLIR, TPod, Stores, etc.The thrust-vectoring is awesome and works perfect. Including weight effects - e.g. with a light load, you can take off vertically from the ship, but load 4x MK83s for example and you will have to do a rolling take off with a 45° nozzle setting or so. People who say the flight model is bad don't know what they're talking about.Since this is Early Access, there are indeed some bugs, but nothing game breaking from what I saw. I agree with the criticism that it is too dark. There needs to be more play on the brightness / gamma setting so as to increase it further.There also needs to be a way to set curves for the stick input. But I'm sure this is gonna get implemented in the future.Ok, off to some more missions in the Straits!EDIT: It seems like the campaign is currently not being saved, so be aware of that. Keep in mind though that this is just a few hours after Early Access release and the developer already stated that there is going to be a bunch of patches within the week, so I'm sure they're going to fix that soon.EDIT 2: Brightness issues have been fixed and stick input options have been improved.

Early Access Review
								Build .808:I love the idea behind this game. We haven't have a new casual sim since, I think, the 90's and this one sits perfectly in the middle between the arcade shooters like HAWK and hyper realistic sims like DCS. Add to that a really interesting jet and a dynamic campaign and you've got an excellent game.However...This is not what you will get when buying this one at the moment. Instead you'll get a skeleton of a game, with not a single completed feature.The graphics looks nice, I especially like how the water looks from different altitudes. And the clouds are one of the best, but the particles leave a lot of room for improvements.The flight model is another thing that seems almost done. It is believable without feeling too arcadey and I don't think it needs to be much more realistic. I'd maybe only improve stalls as they are a bit weird now.The sounds are ok. Certainly not the best but they're not annoying.The main problem here is content and the quality of it. I fully understand it's in early access and I'd be totally ok with the fact that there's not much of it right now. What I'm not ok with is the fact that the stuff that's in the game already is mostly broken. Here's few examples: - There is a vertical landing training mission in which by default you start with full fuel tank (which you can change before the mission) and a few bombs under your wing (which you can't change - the options for it doesn't seem to work) which makes your plane too heavy to hover. - There is a A-A missile training mission which crashes as soon as you fire your missiles. - There is a Maverick training mission but the Mav's targeting camera doesn't seem to work (couldn't find a way to lock on any target with it) - There is a HARM training mission but there's no way to setup missiles (to target radar sources)... and they crash the game on launch...and so on.And while we're at the subject of weapons there's no HUD symbology for any of those. Currently you practically have to guess when the missile is in range. All you have right now are squares over the targets, gun reticule (without working range indicator) and CCIP marker.Add to that many other bugs and problems and we have a game that's in my opinion in too early stage for even early access. I'll still be keeping an eye on this one as it's very promising and can be a cool game when finished (or even before that considering that all the current problems are solved) but right now I don't think it's worth buying.

Early Access Review
								This is an early access game first and foremost. So expect bugs and quirks! This simulator is between  advanced and light. To make a comparison, here's a visual aid.DCS/Prepar3d/Falcon 4.0 BMS -- Combat Air Patrol 2/Novalogic F-16/MIG-29/F-22/Total Air War/Enemy Engaged -- Strike Fighters series -- ARMA Series -- Ace CombatAs a hardcore sim lover like myself(From DCS, to Prepar3D, to Falcon 4 BMS, among others) I completely recommend Combat Air Patrol 2.-- What to expect on Combat Air Patrol 2 --+ With that in mind, it has mostly clickable cockpit, left and right panel, MFDs and the upper keypad(alludes to due to mouse icon change). + The flight dynamics seem quite real and gives that flight sensation. Especially with the incloud effect and the 3D waves. Flying low gives a lot of depth and speed sensation with the waves. + The weather is really quite good, flying through the map you can get some nice cloud cover in the mountains, and completely clear sky on the water. The shadowing is also quite well done, giving a sensation of flying, especially, as stated above, with the incloud flight effects. + Terrain looks really good in some places, I really appreciate the shallow water/green water near the shores. + It runs smooth, really smooth! As smooth as my beautiful♥♥♥♥♥ No FPS issues at all, and it loads really fast. + The textures, it seems, are placeholder, as some are a bit blurry, but the cockpit looks really good! + The keymappings are bare bones right now, as in, you will need to remap it at your liking as there is very little default keys. DON'T FORGET TO CLICK SAVE! + You can't, right now map more complex key commands, like CTRL + F or use special characters for the mapping, like ""/"" or ""#"". + Remember to map the keypad for padlocking to enjoy the outside view! In the current build, the ""left"" and ""right"" on the padlocking view is swapped. + TrackIr works, but it seems there's no limit to how much you can turn your head, so, you will end up looking through the floor or cockpit in some weird fashion if you turn your head too much.+ Currently, when changing resolutions, or some other options you have to click on it multiple times to change it. Annoying, if you have to change resolutions, but not that bad. + I'm using Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS and F16 MFD Cougar. When they allow MFD key mapping, this will really be a game changer! + Remember to leave an axis for the nozzle direction for the Harrier, I'm using the left throttle on my Warthog for that, even though in the Harrier it is situated on the right, this is due to the buttons on the joystick. + When setting up the throttle, remember to INVERT it. + Fun fact, if you move your head at the intro menu, the pilots will move it too, and it will look like the pilots are headbanging :D+ DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN! With all that being said, remember to set your nozzle to 30-40 degrees, or you will end up taking off backwards, and wondering why for a few seconds. Then crashing and drinking some salty water, which based on my various other ""accidents"", it is not tasty at all! But so far, the time I've played, I was impressed. This shows a lot of promise and if you are willing to go through some bugs and quirks, then please support the developers. It has been a long time since we had a simulator quite like this one, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next! For upcoming features, check this post: http://devblog.sim155.com/2016/06/like-phoenix.htmlFor the engine capabilities: http://devblog.sim155.com/2015/08/custom-engine.htmlSo, in my opinion, if you enjoy Strike Fighters, light-sim and want to go through a few bugs, buy it now!

Early Access Review
								This is one of the ""I do really want to like it, BUT...."" products.Currently way too many features broken / very poorly implemented. This would have been ok for me in case the product description would have been much more accurate and honest. According to the description the features listed on the shop page are all implemented and should be working (although not polished yet).E.g. campaign: Almost nothing seems to work yet: auto tasking does not generate any missions; manual tasking does not work; adding or editing waypoints does not work for ships or aircrafts. Most of the buttons on the campaign map screen do not seem to work properly or even at all. Starting a mission (using the go to flight deck button) puts you into a Harrier with a 2nd ""ghost Harrier"" right in front of you. It is not a wingman but a copy of your Harrier. It is possible to let it crash after start so you can get rid of it at least. More issues: Pilots could not be deleted (game repeatadly crashed or pilot was simply kept). Control customization is broken (joystick POV mapping: works for 3 out of 4, but the 4th one (mapped to ""select next target"")  does not work although the mapping is accepted on the mapping screen). Adding VR is nice (I guess at least, I do not have VR devices), but it is hard to understand why one of the most basic feature, the camera keys (function keys), do not work (only F1 for cockpit and F7 for look back behave as expected).Trainings missions also have issues (r.g. weapon selection).Flight model is fun and a bit challening. No idea if it is realistic and accurate (e.g. if impact of different loadouts is considered?), but at least it is not too arcade. Damage model (e.g. flap / gear overspeed) is missing. Graphics are OK and sometimes even great. Especially clouds and waves look very good. On the other hand collision detection is missing (you can fly through buildings / antennas). The Harrier model looks great, the cockpit view is also convinving.I think the sim has a lot of potential. It reminds me of the Super VGA Harrier (actually, that was the reasons I bought this one). However, unless the developper is not sharing the (high level) roadmap / plans for future updates I would recommend to not follow the ""buy and hope it will be finished"" approach. This is primarily based on the concern that many of the most basic feature (managing pilot profiles; keyboard and joystick mapping; camera + view controls) are very poorly implemented without any progress since several months. If these easy and basic parts of a game are not fixed  foprsuch a long time how could one expect that the developper is able to implement or fix the difficult parts (AI, campaign, flight model refinement)?I am an old Falcon BMS and DCS pilot and even fire up DID Tornado and Super VGA Harrier every now and then. Currently I will stick to those one but I hope CAP 2 will be finished / make significant progress at least and it will not remain in its current state.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this product to give the developer a chance - making a Harrier sim (albeit a 'light' sim) is an excellent idea. However, even though this is an 'early access' product, I have hardly seen any development progress since I purchased it. I am starting to wonder if this flight-sim will ever truly get off the ground. The list of things that need doing is way too long to mention, therefore I cannot recommend buying this. Wait and see if any serious progress has been made (check the update log) before spending your money on a very basic and largely unfinished product. Or at least wait until it is a Beta version. I hope the dev eventually gets to work on the problems that need fixing - and there are many - because the general idea is a good one.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a 65-year-old diehard combat flight sim junkie. I’ve been flying with combat flight sims since DOS and Lucas Art’s Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe and MS Combat Flight Simulator. I have also flow many real small aircraft including the Air Force T34 Trainer.   I have always considered the flight models in MS Combat Flight Simulator 2 and 3 to be the most realistic models out there.  While games like IL2, DCS, and War Thunder have fantastic graphics, there flight models always seem to have a less than realistic (especially with a yaw instability that is always too much.)  I find this to be a common problem with all of the current sims.  With that said I found the Combat Air Patrol 2 to be a refreshing change from the other newer sims.  I set the game up with Oculus Rift and was very pleased with the overall response of the plane and the graphics.  The frame rates were good never dropping below 60.   I think that this game has a lot of potential and hope that it gets enough players to make its continued development possible.  I would recommend this game to anyone who loves combat flight sims.

								I'm glad I backed this project.I really like the feel of the Harrier, its the perfect level of complexity for me, somewhere in between DCS and my old favourite 'Total air war'.CAP2 has tons of potential, once the dynamic campaign is fleshed out some more I can see see myself spending a decent amount of time in it.At the moment, I would only recommend it if you want to support the Devs, help test and be part of the evolution of the game.I would not recommend if you expect to jump in and start playing a fully featured game, you will just be disappointed.

Early Access Review
								I have to admit the game look really interesting and promising.  ( it is early access ) so expect it to have faults and missing features. )The harrier and contol of the harrier do feel like you are flying the airplane, but controls are more simplified than example dcs since you can only click a few buttons.. But never the less this also make the game more fun for many people that they do not have to use 10 houres to figure out how to fly the airplane but can go and shoot the enemy.I would call the game a sim and not arcade, since it look and feel like a sim, but control of the airplane ect are just more simple. Targeting of ships and airplanes are rather simple.. find them with your radar and press next target and then you cycle trough avaliable target you can shoot and it is okay i think.  ( a bit like arma flying and targeting )You also have a targeting pod for gound attacks but I did not yet use it but it work like you expect.. point zoom and lock.I would say using the airplane once you have become airborn is easy and the feeling of flying it is good.The most difficult so far was acual to take off and land, since it took a little while to figure out what angle of the jet engine needed to be in, and that I had to adjust this the moment i left the aircraft carrier.. But once learned things became more easy. Landing is somewhat difficult, and i find it hard to hover near the ship since the airplane do not have enough power to maintain level flight or gain height once it hover.. im not sure if this is my joysticks fault but I just make a slow landing instead of going into hover that work.Graphics are actual nice, and game run very well. But you need to adjust settings since game do not automatic configure them correctly based on your hardware.. But i would say graphics are good some will say mediocre, but it is clear it is not fantastic like big AAA titles.This is about flying an airplane and the game simulate that very good i would say.So far i experienced several bugs and crashes.. example my radar do not work so i cant see enemy airplanes and lockon and shoot them down.. maybe i have some kind of bug, i am sure the dev will fix this.Game crash once in a while but nothing that bad typical it crash in the main menu and not ingame, im sure they fix it fast. waypoing indicator is missing on hud, so I kind og guess in what direction i have to fly, but I can see waypoint counter count up or down.The campaign well I find it confusing at first.. I managed to move my ships via. waypoint, but I did not yet figure out how to plan a mission and such things or what really is going. would be nice with a little video tutorial or something.The training missions seem kind of simple and have very little information about what to do.. but they are okay.So should you buy this.. Yes I think you will like this game if you seak a ""simple"" flight simulator that focus more on fun than clicking buttons. ;-)			"

Early Access Review
								For the most part I am in agreement with the initial positive feedback received. Bearing in mind that this is ""EA"", I would give the platform a ""great start"" rating (Including the reasonable pricing). My background includes SIMS ranging from the IL-2 series, Strike Fighters, War Thunder, Yankee Air Pirates, DCS and of course Falcon 4.0 BMS. Based on this, my expectations have increased over the years for what might constitute a satisfying, full immersion experience in a flight SIM. The potential displayed in this AE release fully meets the foundation required for massive and exciting expansion over time along with a very satisfying sense of real flight characteristics without attending an actual flight school environment for take-off and weapons deployment such as ""Blackshark"". Most of us want some reality mixed with the immediacy of being able to blow some stuff up pretty quickly after download! I am looking forward to more effects, sounds, location variety and single mission development in the near future. The site does mention a ""Full Manual"" available which has full details about the SIM. Where can that be accessed? Keep up the good work guys, thanks! BTW: Rhino X-55 works great as well as Track IR!!			"

								I've read the negative reviews and people must realise this IS EARLY ACCESS!!!!!!! We have the chance to support a dev willing to make a niche flight sim with dynamic campaign etc etc. Don't buy it yet unless you are willing to contribute to the development of the product. the dev's made it perfectly clear what needs doing. So all you negative reviewers why don't you just ♥♥♥♥ off and play with your xbox and leave the people willing to support this product to support it. These negative reviews will not help in any way at the moment. It will eventually prevent any combat flight sims ever being developed because of all these ♥♥♥♥ing kids throwing their toys out of their pram as soon as a problem arises.They should put an 18 cert on these games.Anyway, having played flight sims for over 25 years on pc's I can tell you that it flys nice, you can key map the joystick and the dynamic campaign looks really interesting.

								The people who have given this game a poor review have misplaced expectations. This is not DCS World nor does it set out to be. So, why do I support this game and think it is worth the investment?1.) It's a Harrier with great modelling and realistic flight dynamics. I like the way it transitions from flight to hover and I am an experienced sim pilot for both fixed and rotatry aircraft.2.) There is VR support3.) You'd pay at least £24 for most P3D or X-Plane aircraft (at the lower end) and this is so much more than that.4.) I was in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy as a trainee pilot and feel that this project is deserving of support.5.) Didi I mention, this is a Harrier! We should support the devs in the menory of this unique aircraft with an amazing operational history.I voted my with my wallet and despite the fact that it is early access, I am not disappointed and hope for greater things to come.  Come on simmers, give this product some love.			"

								EA first impressions:Overall: Pretty good so far, with a lot of potential down the line.At this time I found the following pros...- Decent flight model and physics. It feels like you are flying an aircraft.- Decent graphics and texturing, good enough for EA- Good models.- All my controllers recognized and no trouble mapping them.- Working track ir support.- Full control over VTOL and trim.- No crashes in the time I played.- Fun to fly, fun to fight.And now the current cons...- Some minor bugs.- The UI needs a bit of work but it is functional.- Needs the ability to tweak controller sensitivity and deadzones.- Track IR was slightly too responsive. - Some textures and models need work, but that is to be expected at this stage. Nothing really bad.I'd say it is in a better state than most EA titles at launch. It is what it pretends to be, a middle of the road sim. Not arcade, but not crazy button pushing like DCS. It is to Air combat what ARMA 3 is to infantry combat. It is accessible and fun.			"

								Within 20 minutes of gameplay I found out that:- This is not a simulator. The flight model is like someone just fudged some numbers to make it look authentic, it doesn't actually seem to relate to any level of real world data. Avionics seemed to work a bit like jets in Arma, meaning it's more closer to an action game than an abstraction of real avionics/instrument use you have in flight sims like IL-2 or LOMAC/FC3. It's a flight game, but it's not a flight sim to me.- The entire game is covered with unrealistic (dark) post-processing and HDR.- CTD.- GFX options and keybinds did not persist after restart. Good luck mapping HOTAS controls all over again.- The cockpit did not load and I could see through my aircraft.- I didn't notice any axis tune settings, and trying to bind anything related to the joystick is a nightmare since the game detects the slightest axis movement and then binds that axis to the control.- Quick start missions suddenly fail immediately after start. (I think the plane hits the sea surface during the intro cutscene).- CBA to redo any HOTAS controls, I plugged in an xbox controller since it's the default input device. The game's however completely unresponsive to the gamepad apart from the ""press any key"" screen.- Alt-tabbing resets game resolution.			"

								Hi , I've just purchased CAP2 and its good to know that someone took the initiative to try and design a modern air combat simulator...i'd like to offer the following suggestions so please bear with me:1) The controller support needs to be improved drastically with minimal customizing required by the player I had quite a tough time configuring my Mad Catz F.L.Y.5 joystick2) A voice over interactive guide for training missions would be more than welcome esp for take offs and landings as well as VTOL operations and while operating AAM's and guided A/G ordnance and how to use water injection, issuing orders to wingmen (most definitely needed please)3) The menu interations are a bit awkward and there is avery disturbing rasping sound when the harrier in the background animation fires its cannon4) As for the graphics considering that it's a DX11 interface can be better (iuse a core i7 with an 8GB GTX880m with 16GB RAM)6) Of course other flyabe aircraft would be welcome in the future7) Assists such as waypoint indicator, target ID, need to be included8) FX like fire, smoke, gunfire, damage model, terrain texture can be improved over time...I'm not trying to find fault but please consider these as suggestions to improve CAP2 and other future products you may release. thankSTo the Devs: Please incorporate the above and you'll have a great game....

								Pretty good so far but I don't see many updates being pushed out so that has me concerened. Currently there is not even a working HUD and there are no options to adjust joystick sensitivity, which it needs asap because I can barely fly due to it being way oversensitive in the x axis on my Logitech 3D Pro stick. If you are looking for something with more depth than Strike Fighters but not as deep as DCS then this is probably your game. But it is no where near finished so don't expect much right now. "

								I've only played a few minutes on this account, but that is because my actual account is region locked, due to the credit card used plus it a PC not just a laptop. But over at my PC I've logged 10 hours. So lets get to it:Pros: -beatuifull cockpit interior at ultra      -Good map variety (the island has plains, mountins and sea's... offcourse!)      -almost everything to do with simulation is spot on (by this I mean the physics, cockpit bottons and interface etc...)      -good target variety (ships, planes and ground targets)      -decent price especially since the dev's plan on adding multiplayer and other features Cons: -you have to map a lot of the crucial butons for your self (for example i had to map all of the harrier controls, and I mean all of them including moving surfaces like the rudder and ailerones)      -Lack of mission variety      - The ability to use only the harrier makes the game dull after a while (I suggest they add in planes like the F-4 or Mig which are already modeled as targets)BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY: This game is very POORLY OPTIMIZED, on my PC (gtx 1070, 16gb of ddr4 ram, Intel core i7) it still struggles to keep a steady 30 fps. This means the minimum requirements are way, wayyy of. But that is for the most part my biggest grugde with this game, and it's not like it won't be fixed in the futreSo over all, I recommend you pick this game up if your interested in combat sims like DCS. And if the cons I listed out-weigh the pros I still recomend you purchase this game and wait for all the features to fully implemented and bugs to be ironed out, as the devs say they will increase the price the further develop the game.-excuse the English for it is not my native language			"

								In this review I mention quite a few areas where CAP2 needs a lot of TLC, a _LOT_. I do recommend buying it however, but you have to realise that this game is far from being ready.Simmer since ZX-81 Spektrum. Have flown nearly everything since I started simming. Loved Harrier Assualt VGA version back in the dos days. It features a campaign (with editor) I was/am hoping CAP2 will be it's 2016 counterpart. 


YouTube™ Video: Super-VGA Harrier on DosBox 

			Views: 9,005		

			This is an old classic fligh sim / strategy game from early 90's by Domark/Simis. Running on DosBox 0.72, cycles locked at 20000 for correct playing speed.		

Currently active in DCS, X-Plane and P3D apart from my day job where I fly planes too.. I have flown a lot of different types with 0 up to 4 engines.With a just a little in game time I must get a few little things of my chest. Views:Switching views, especially getting back in the cockpit.. please get rid of the animation. If I need to be back in the pit, I want it to be instantaneous.Also using outside (F2) view, make it so I can zoom in, circle etc.TrackIr limits... There are none.. Please implement limts. Turn wise, and lateral wise. I can turn my head at least 3 times! (New profile have to tweak it down.. I know), And I can also move sideways outside the pit.Graphics:Too bland and dark.Scenery is cartoon like with very large buildings and such.Inside cockpit looks again very bland and some parts like the canopy are outright ugly and very low res.Other points concerning settings have been mentioned by other people. I agree with them. I have not experienced any ctd's of the kind, settings remain saved. Game starts very quick.Flight Model.. . Considering this is meant to be a very accessible *light* sim, It's not bad at all. I would suggest increasing the fidelity a notch up to a ""realistic"" setting. Flying a Harrier is not easy at all. So flying at a hard setting shouldn't be easy either, right now it definately is. Pitch authority and response seems a but low at times. I do like the way inertia is done, but here it needs a bit of dumbing down.I will give it a thumbs up, jus because I love flying and think this sim has potential. I would however recommend that in the description some sort of percentage would be mentioned.. ""This game is XX% complete"". After a good nights sleep and some more flights I will update my review.			"

								Yes! Yes! Yes!, Okay, lets get this out of the way as I feel there are too many idiots who dont understand this is early access. This is the time you buy into this Sim and run it through the ringer, then let the devs know what you like, hate, needs improvement, needs new options, less options etc. etc. etc.Straight away this reminded me Strike Fighters 2, only way more systems are modeled, not as much as DCS but just as fun and still very beautiful. The aircraft are a joy to fly and learn to hover, transition from flight to hover/ hover to flight, learn weapons systems, navigation, radio. Beautiful weapons effects, popping flares, ejecting from the aircraft, aircraft detail, water detail, vehicles detail, terrain detail needs a little work. Looking forward to helping the developers by providing constructive criticism here and there. Also this sim is not as intensive as DCS, consider this more average flight simmer user friendly(like myself) to learn and operate. Lots of settings to adjust to your liking. With the upcoming updates to include air-to-air refueling and VR support this is and will continue to be at the top of my Favorite Combat Sims List, and if you give it a chance and understand this will continue to be developed to an even better state until it comes out of ""Early Access"" and you have the opportunity to positively influence what comes in the future, it will be at the top of your list too.edit-1, the devs are very active in the community threads, listening to user feedback and putting out updates, providing user help to individuals who have problems with PC set-ups and general questions. I love this sim, I want others to enjoy this sim, this sim needs your support especially in the early stages, I imagine the developers would like your support as when you pruchase the early access you become the tester, you are the test pilot, push this sim to the edge of that ""ol"" envelope then take what you learned good, bad, unexpected, this broke, that broke, this was beautiful, that was fun, that was challenging, this was too challenging, I broke it doing this or that, etc.... We need you, we would like you to join the elite ranks of Combat Air Patrol 2 Harrier Test Pilots! The more people like myself support it and fund it the better the final product will be. Do I recommend this game?, ABSOLUTELY! Is this game anywhere near perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Will this be the best flight sim experience on STEAM and in the flight-sim community in general?, with more user support and feedback you bet your♥♥♥♥♥it will be!Will update with Dynamic Campaign info in the future, but from what I have tested so far it's incredible and truely your own dynamic campaign, you pick the locations, movements, loadouts, WPs, IPs, TAs, egress options, the list goes on. The flight sim community has not seen the likes of this since maybe the early 90s(the golden years of true flight simulation).			"

								Briefly-This one shows promise. Still buggy / many features missing ATM but it performs very smoothly and feels like everything is in the right place. Despite the EA rough edges, the core issomehow more user-friendly in many ways than Rise of Flight / Il-2 in my opinion, and it's fun. Just note that it may be a bit before it's more welcome to new players. Buy now if you believe in the project and want to support it.			"

								Ok, these are my first impressions:-Control setup needs some work. Figured out you have to save controls after setting up each page, rudder pedals aren't working. Need to add axis tuning settings.-GFX wise, looking nice, beautiful harrier model, cockpit certainly not DCS Level but who really expected that? Good smooth FPS (1440p i7 4770K GTX980) but too dark.-TrackIr working, no setup necessary.-Flight model feels on rails, you can just throw the stick around at high speed, seems impossible to make it depart controlled flight.-Extremely simple avionics, not even a proper radar, just radar on/off and select next target.-No enemy aircraft damage effects, not even smoke trails or fire.-Enemy F-4 phantom took 2 slammers and kept flying, no f*cks given.Very very early build, I'll follow up and update with further releases. Sure hope the developer is on the level, this looks nice but it'll take some major improvements to keep me interested.Score: 10/10 would VIFF straight into the water again. "

DARKKi's Dark Star Reviews - Combat Air Patrol 2In Combat Air Patrol 2 you get to fly AV8B Harrier II subsonic attack aircraft in areas around Straits of Hormuz (250,000km2 geographically accurate area) in and later in fully dynamic open ended campaigns with flight / naval mission planner. CAP2 is simulator and it's not recommended for arcade pilots but great choice for people who want realistic simulator (and HOTAS setup is recommended but not necessary) with lots to offer! I would say this is not as realistic as DCS (it sits between DCS and Strike Fighter / Novalogic F-16 / Total Air War games) series but how it has modeled many things is just amazing like flight model is really good with and you can really feel the speed when flying low with 3D waves. Also this game is pretty easy to get into if you have not played much simulators. In your Harrier's cockpit most of the of them are clickable (left and right panel, upper keyboards)  and MFD's like navigation / HSD, FLIR, radar, etc. And it also supports TrackIR (I hear it also supports OpenTrack). Dynamic will be campaign really awesome and remarkable feature and with mission planner you can create your own objectives to do. This game also let's you enjoy Harrier's nice features like VTOL and Thrust Vectoring.Graphically this looks very good and also does not require high-end machine to run it. Especially terrain looks gorgeous and weather effects are great which adds to immersion among other things. Sounds also serve their purpose pretty well.Rating and Should you buy this game9/10As this is still in Early Access many features are not in yet and there are great features to come. Game itself is pretty much bugfree and well optimized though there are some elements missing and you wont just yet get to play the full experience this game will offer in future but i think this game has huge potential to become really good game! So if you are into this kind of simulators i recommend it with my full heart!Gameplay has been balanced prPros:I WANT DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN!!!11Good performance with great graphics!Updates come really fast and dev is reponsive in discussionsReally good flight modelPretty easy to learnTrackIR support (TrackWorks also but not tried)Pretty polished in bugs / optimizationYou really feel like flying!Great features upcomingCons:Some EA issues contentwise (this is an EA title so why does this belong here?)We have to wait for this game to get finishedHardware InformationHardwareTypeCPUAMD FX-8350 @ 4,7GHzGPUNvidia GeForce GTX 970 MSI Gaming 4GB Edition - OverclockedRAM16GB DDR3 1333MHz @ 1830HzControllerXbox One and Playstation 3 ContollersOSWindows 10 Pro 64bitVRNoneDisclaimer:Source of consideration: I got this game for review purposes but it does not influence my opinion "

								As a long time Psygnosis fan, all the way back to Armour Geddon and Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga, I cannot but thumbs up for this resurgence under another name.Agreed with other positive reviews; great potential. Hopefully development will continue.Flight model is nice, great ""feeling"" of control input inertia. Stalling needs some work, though, can only detect it by keeping an eye on AoA and VSI indications (ie; no nose drop, simulated buffet, etcetera). V/STOL Ops are fun to do on this one, too!Maybe some work on the systems and weapons control interface (more options for key binding?). Views, especially the function of the joystick hat in looking around. Maybe some ""mode"" in which you can stay looking in the direction where you put the view, and not snap back to default ""look ahead"" automatically. Maybe this is already being worked on and perfected, and there will be some cool way to manage the views around the cockpit that I haven't imagined yet, for those of us that don't use VR sets. However, if the focus is mainly for VR sets only, then some attention also needs to be paid to users who don't have them, regarding working from the cockpit.In short, this sim is looking good so far!

Early Access Review
								I bought this last year. Before the games release there was a ton of hype about a dynamic campaign and what appeared to be a large team complete with hype advertising .What we have at beta release is a basic flight model. The campaign after serveral patches is still not implemented, much of the avoinics don't work as they should or aren't implemented yet. The navigation system still doesn't work right and all the creator seems to be working on is VR which is ridiculous given the fact that this was marketed as a flight sim and VR support was never menetioned as the priority. I had a lot of hope for this sim as it appears like a Super Vga Harrier or flying nightmares successor but with the developement focused on worthless VR , I don't see it progressing as it should in a timely fashion.Show me a fully working sim and the promised campaign, steer away from premature VR developement and focus on whats important and I may change my mind. I feel like the product wasn't sold as advertised and at this point I can't recommend it.			"

								My early access copy has some bugs that need fixing and a little more content here and there. Once this is done it will be a great game. It reminds me of Euro Fighter Typhoon, the first and best one (if anyone is old enough to remember it). It's not a simple throttle up, leap into the sky and start shooting game but it's not a DCS type game either, it's somewhere between the two. Using the Harrier as the aircraft of choice adds to the game the flight charecteristics are different from any other fixed wing aircraft. The controls are easy to map to a HOTAS from the in game menu (I'm using the X-55 Rhino) which enhances the feel of the game.There is a good array of weapons at your disposal from Sidewinders to Harpoons and many in between.CAP2 is enjoyably playable as it is and I can't wait for it to be finished.

								Yes this is an Early Access title and some people are having teething issues, however it is better than most all of the negative comments would suggest. Most study sim pilots will find it a challenge but not impossible for the new pilot. If you have a full suite of Aviation Sim Hardware or just an X-box controller you can play this though I would recommend at least having a flight stick. I won this during a promotion but I would have bought it and I'm still having fun with it despite any early bugs which are being worked on and the Devs are closely working with the community feedbackSee some of my own first plays herehttp://plays.tv/u/Krt_Bong "

Graphically it's very nice, and the frame rate is fluid.Campaign, Comms, career progress, and a lot of other features haven't been implemented yet.There are a LOT of bugs and crashes though, so be warned.

								This game has great potential, I am a fan of arcade type airplane games and simulators alike. I understand this game is early access, but there are some bugs that make this game unplayble for me. The first is the fps; in the main menu, I get about 20-25 fps. Once I load a mission the fps drops to about 9, but that is solved by flying away from the carrier fleet. Ths brings me to my second issue; my controller worked the first time I've booted the game, and no other time. According to the controls menu in the pause screen (which takes about 5 minutes to get to because of the abismal framerate) my controller is recognized and recieving inputs. If you want a fun combat simlator, you may as wel go with fsx and mod it.			"

Beautiful model, excellent flight handling -- looks like really promising app.  Looking forward to the updates -- and definitely agree with definition of ""successor"" -- I would acttually say ""resurrection"" of simulation qualities of Falcon 4, Janes F18, EF2000 and F22 by DID.  I thought DCS would be working on this...  I guess not.  So, thank you for undertaking this task!Even though I would like to see some more functionality in the cockpit (perhaps simple/advanced game mode?) -- I can't agree with any of complainers' reviews...

								A few issues due to it being an early access game. But all in all its not that bad as long as you read the menu screen when you set up. You need to save each page after you set up controls.  I crashed a lot due to both my control config and also user error haha. I am having an issue with the VTOL setting as the vents only go from either 0% to 110% no incrementation which makers things tricky but still flyable. All in all this would of been no easy task to accomplish so great job to all that put in their time and hard work and continue to do so. This is NOT a DCS module, and doesnt pretend to be. I do love DCS as well. This is a simplified combat flight sim with a Harrier so it does have its unique quirks of flying a harrier and VTOL flying. Im quite sure that the issues will only get better in time. Enjoy it for what it is. A game you get to fly at home blowing shizz up haha.			"

								First of all, the only reason I put this as positive is because I think this game has potential. It could be the definitive AV-8B Harrier flight game in a interesting setting with interesting enemies. It is not there yet and it has a long way to go. - The Price. This game is nowhere near worth what they are asking for it, especially not as Early Access. - Tutorials are nonexistant. If you are going to release a sim, this is the first thing you need to have actually working. - Control Binding is a mess. It should not take me fifteen minutes to properly setup controls only to note that it is not working as advertised. Thankfully the forum was a great help. - Weapons at the moment feels like Point and Shoot. They have no character to them. - Enemy and friendly aircraft AI? Is there even such a thing? + The Camera Angles are fun, especially the Selfie Camera. The Zoom In can be a bit annoying when you want cockpit view RIGHT NOW. + With a little work, the terrain and settings could be pretty damn fun. + It feels immersive with the bobbly headcamera. I know some are bothered by it but I like it. A nice simulation of G-Forces+ Has Potential.  "

								CAP 2 is showing a LOT of promise for early access day one!i was able to bind my x52 HOTAS the way i wanted it with minimal fuss, my puny GTX460, despite being under reccommended spec gave me failry stable frame rate of about 40-50 (fine by me), and the training stuff gave me enough to think about.Is this DCS or BMS? not yet. Admittedly, i have yet to try the dynamic campaign, but if it does, i hope this will put pressure on DCS to get one sorted. How is the flight model? could be better, but it 'feels' like a good start.the FM is not advanced to DCS EFM levels, but as its EA there is plenty of time to fix that. Avionics? needs more realism. systems management isnt working the way i expect it do but im willing to wait and see.Cockpit? partly clickable, the MFDs mostly. i want the option for a fully ramp-startable harrier in game. that's where we start talking fidelity.These things above need to be changed for me to consider it a true combat flight sim. granted, its early days, so im able to cut the game slack here - for now. For me to be 100% sold on this game, these would need to be changed.as its EA there were some noticable glitches and graphics arent perfect, but as above, I can allow this provided its fixed later.overall, in terms of realism, id put it between strike fighters 2 (my minimum standard for flight simming (provided its on 100% realism), and DCS/BMS (the current gold standard for modern combat flight sim in my opinion).IF CAP2 can get to the level that DCS and BMS simulate their aircarft and dynamic campaign, then they will have this sim nut hooked.Bonus points if the devs can allow other aircraft in game to be flyable to the same level as their harrier. Hey, I can dream, can't I?For those looking to give it a chance, pick it up now before the game runs to full cost at launch. the earlier you get in and leave your feedback, the more we as CAP2 fans/buyers can let the devs know what we want!

								This could be a great game if I could get the Logitech Force 3D Pro to  work.  Tried the key bindings -(hard to do) and one binded they do not work.  Pc Controller not ant better.  Went on line and got the manual no help.  If this gets fixed it will be a good flight arcade  with some simulation. After all the trouble getting controllers to work (some what)  I can not recommend buying this game due to lack of playability.  Maybe the developers will fix.  We will see.  Wait until the  controller issues are fixed.  I really hope the game will be fixed and become playable.  The Av8B fiying would be awsome.			"

								Have fun binding controls if you're using mouse + keyboard and/or and Xbox controller. If you are not already well versed in flight sims controls its hard enough but when keys and buttons just will not bind well you might find a game of that in and of itselfMy refunding is now processing, not gonna support early access like this. You want to appeal to the mid-sim range then get it right with at least the keybinds working or good luck to you too.			"

								I will keep it short and to the point.This is a really refreshing, the most promising and already amazingly good flight simulator I have come across over the last few years.I take is as a work in progress, a progress that is obvious. Listening, friendly developers that make you feel like an honoured guest.It's up to us to support them and hopefully add a truly amazing game/simulator to our collection.The price makes me feel bad; I have payed much much more money for utilities for (let's say) my force feedback joystick, or the weather, or a set of bitmaps for the clouds...Support the developers. In my honest opinion it will be well worth it.PSIf you own a VR set, get this NOW. If I was to give it a title, it would be ""The way VR experience should be"". With Pixel Density setting that according to the developers is around the corner it' a true ""experience"".			"

								I've purchased this about a month after the initial release, since then there has been little to no development that would make this playable. Right now, as far as I can tell, you can fly around for a bit, and that's it.  The campaign doesn't work, there are no combat missions, and there are still a lot of basic bugs (i.e. you can surf the waves of the ocean, since the sim will forgive you hitting the water at a very small angle). And, while it would seem a priority to fix that, the developers focus on adding features like Air Tankers, satellite images (quite poor, I might add), and VR support. I've owned some Early Access titles, and I managed to squeeze some fun out of each one of them, but this game has none to offer, and - what's even worse - the development is almost non-existent.			"

								This game is amazin. So much potential for early access. Vr work great and controller setup is one the easiest of the sims i've played. Not quite as technical as Falcon Bms but the vr support and potenial for Leap Motion support, as it is running UR4, more than makes up for it. If you like flight sime, keep your eye on this one!
