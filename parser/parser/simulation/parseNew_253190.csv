												(Original Review)Still a bit sparse and kind of dull to play. Not sure what I'm missing here, but it doesn't seem like a very intriguing game as it stands. Will check back regularly to see improvements, patches, and addons, but I don't find it keeping my interest in it's current state.(/Original Review)HOWEVERI WILL recommend either buying this game, or keeping your eye on this game, purely based on the fact these developers go way above and beyond to try and get everyone to enjoy it. Publicly, my old review was not agreed upon and I don't mind that. But that didn't even stop these devs from contacting me to let me know they're making changes and improvements, and even personally informing me of a new expansion coming. I'm definitely going to put this on my regular checklist of perpetually updated games.I may not enjoy the game like I do for others, but the developers are top notch - something you don't see more often enough with vidya these days. I hope you guys keep the professional attitude and personal touch in the future. It puts you way above a lot of other devs, and it's something we game enthusiasts really need.Thanks, guys! Can't wait to see what's to come.			"

												This game is the best when you play with friends, but the elves are a little op. So to sum it up, there are 3 factions orcs, wood elves and humans. Every faction have a diffrent ''language'' and completly different building mechanics. I my selfe play mostly as humans, but that is because I already have all their cards. One thing that is pretty uniqe and nice with this game is that it has cards that you can buy in the main meny. These cards cost various things like, swords, magic items and beer. These items are rewarded when you kill a boss (dragon mostly) in a custom game, or if you just complete the game. So from the start you are very limited on what units and upgrades you can buy in game, and this is a very fun thing for me atleast.Now to why the wood elves are pretty op. Wood elves can build gold, stone and bushes in their base, and these resources can be rebuild right after they are mined up, this ofc makes the elves have unlimited income. Also the zombies are a super fun mechanic, when you loose alot of troops in a siege or a big battle, then those troops rise as zombies and kills everything if your not carefull.There is also a small AH function where you can trade your resources for other resources, pretty neat. Higly recommend if you have some friends to play with, but also a ton of fun by your selfe.			"

								When I first saw this game really my only thought was ""Hey this looks like it could be interesting.""  After purchasing the game I found out that there was apparently some sort of path error that had occured not allowing me to play the game.  I was pretty put off that a brand new game already won't start for me, but after posting a help ticket my mind was blown.tl:drThis dev team is probably THE most helpful team I have ever had the pleasure to speak with.  Over the course of a couple days they walked me through several different steps that they had not previously listed in any of their help threads until we got it working.  This dev team is 10/10, would buy any game from them.			"

								what i once thought XD:the game crashes on start up often and once in a single player game against 1 AI Orc, the game will %100 crash everytime...but then.. something happened..the developer of KW2B actually spoke out to me saying that ""we are sorry and it has been fixed"" I LOVE THAT !!!!! a developer actually talked to a unhappy customer (BTW great customer service 1+)  (Dev Konstantin  [developer] 22 hours ago  Panzer,I invite you to try the game again, as last night we have fixed all of the issues you`ve experienced, and sorry to hear about this terrible experience.And to explain what happened - we`ve released a massive patch on Thursday, and due to a lot of new features, a few crushing bugs appeared. But by Sunday evening we had all of these crashes fixed. I know it`s not a good excuse, but for a small team we couldn`t catch all the crashes ourselves before releasing this massive update.I hope to see you come back to give the game another chance, and sorry that your first experience with the game was during the two days that we had all these crashing problems.)ive seen so many games that i have backed only to be left to rot in page 2358 on the steam store and this one AINT one.so the dev team left a few bugs, but their small and that is to be expected! and the repair patch came out moments later so im left happy! :D			"

								The Game is a pleasant mix of the Total War games and Age of Empires games. The game has come a long way, and even though it still has a long way to go, the journey has been a decent one. The Dev team has only four members working on the game and they work hard as they listen to the player's suggestions. The Fantastic Four have been working really hard to make this game better from the many suggestions that players have given them, and This can only get better from this point, fingers crossed.The game ofcourse has some pros and cons so without further ado, lets get into them: Pros:-Combat Feels similar to Total War; Units have formations and most have special abilities. -Heroes/Champions are characters that can be unlocked via cards or technology advancements-In game Crafting System that allows the player to choose which technology to research as they unlock features for their                     favourite faction.-Three Diverse and interesting factions to choose from. From the Mighty Orcs to the Humble Elves. And if you want to              specialise in both offense and defense, Humans are the faction for you.-Base Building has a nice bit of Nostalgia embedded into it, as they are pleasantly similar to the awesome Age of      Empires    resource collection/management system the games are so well known for; Has the feel of playing the classic AoE     games -Graphics are decent, but they're decent enough. -Dragons-Dwarves -Zombies rise as corpses are left to rotCons:-The game has some bugs but they're not really game-breaking, fixes are on the way!-At the moment, pvp is a possibility, but sometimes its difficult to find players because of the low player count. It'll only      get better from here on, (fingers crossed) And that's about it! I don't think I missed anything as of yet, feel free to correct me if I have.			"

												So, my first review. I've played a few games over the years and I've never really felt inclined to write a review for any of them. Not for any particular reason, there just didn't seem a need.As for this game...- Pretty soon after loading my first skirmish I was repeatedly offered potatoes by a shifty looking peasent. Built a barn, and decided to persue a chicken farming career. Orcs must have sniffed out the little cluckers or just decided to shaft me, either way they were at the front door. - Fought them off with some archers.- Decided to build on my chicken empire so I sent the potato man to discover the new world. The wolves got him before help could arrive.- Fought off a second attack from the orcs and paused for a moment to reflect on my avian industry. That when it happened: the bodies of my felled opposition, as well as some of my own men, rose from the ground and WENT STRAIGHT FOR MY BLOODY CHICKENS!!! I thought NONE OF THAT m8, you @&^%s!!! - Skewered the zombies, killed off the wolves, then returned with my army just in time to remember I'd left the front gate open and the orcs had finished off every single peasent in the place.Lost the game...Had the most fun I've had in a video game in a very long time.ChickenFarmingSimulator/10In all seriousness, what's driving me to write this review is the dev team. I wanted to help out in my small way to support their work. I have never, in all honesty, seen one so intergrated with, or responsive to their community. Go read some of the other reviews if you don't believe me. There's a helpful reply to just about every negative review; that is rare, A+ customer service. Good work dev team. Don't ♥♥♥♥ it up.LABOURER CAN BUILD!!!!			"

Kingdom Wars 2 Battles is a real time strategy game set in fictional world with medieval accents. The game plays as you would expect a game of this genre to but a few added mechanics and an online multiplayer mode keep things fresh for players. While this isn’t a genre I am very familiar with I did find the game enjoyable, it can easily be played for hours as you spend time focusing on micromanaging your units. The game offers single player and campaign modes if you just want to enjoy it on your own.The story in the campaign mode focuses on the race of humans mainly fighting against orcs. Humanity is on the run from their aggressors, periodically making valiant stands to secure their survival. Each step of the story is told via cutscenes with voice over explaining the battle and what takes place before and after it. An interesting plot point in the game is the presence of zombies -the result of cannibalism, no doubt committed by desperate war-refugees. The story itself is currently one episode with five chapters.The game’s mechanics work very well, while I mainly played the campaign mode I also found that the multiplayer mode was a fun option for those wanting to increase the game’s replay value. The game also has a great single player mode where you can play your own adventure or a survival mode. All units in the game are under your control, even down to farm animals. The worker class mines, farms and builds while fighters help protect and progress. Both classes are important to the game as is resource and time management. The game works best with a keyboard and mouse requiring both to control the camera and click on areas of interest. Each unit and building have a large variety of actions and options available to players that help to customize gameplay experiences.The graphics in the game are simple, and even a bit dated. Character models are basic and not overly-detailed and I found some of the buildings hard to tell apart visually. Maps are also standard, nothing is bad but nothing really stands out much either. I found it a little hard to tell the tiny units on the map apart as their uniform colors were often the same. The audio in the game is fine, the characters talk when you click on them and there is some voice over as well. The music is fitting, but not memorable. I found the game to be a good way for novices such as myself to learn about real time strategy, or fans who haven’t played a game in the genre for a while. Kingdom Wars 2 Battles offers a lot of options and customizing choices to tailor gameplay to each person as well as three different races to choose from; humans, orcs and elves. No matter what option you pick the game will be fun and challenging, plus there are trading card and achievements to keep a person coming back for more. With a hands-on development team regularly updating the game, this title is a great addition to any library.This review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!

								To cut straight to the chase, this is my favorite strategy game to date, and that is not due to lack of variety. I have played a large amount of RTS such as Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Total War, and Star Wars: Empire at War, and various others. Yet none of the above gave quite the satisfaction that Kingdom Wars 2: Battles does, and that is not due to cheap gimmicks or repetitive game play.Just to give a brief bullet point list of some of the features that I find quite enjoyable:- Faction Diversity- Unit Specialization- Fire, lots of fire- Size of maps allow many forms of combat- Zombies- Unit DiversityNow, to go over each piece individually.Faction Diversity   Each faction quite simply plays very different from each other, and while there is a slight bit of overlap, as there is in every RTS, each have their own tricks and techniques to master. For example, the Orc Faction has the highest number of soldiers per unit as well as the ability to mass produce weak units such as goblins, which can win wars of attrition if you play your cards right. On the other hand, the Human Faction has some of the tankiest units in the game but is more of a balance between Elves and Orcs than anything else. Other than their durability, their units do not stick out too much, but it is quite pivotal if you are able to compound on such. Finally, the Elves, have the lowest soldiers per unit, but also have the highest quality of units, which allow them to defeat superior numbers more often than not. Despite all of this though, each faction has balanced counters and maneuvers to use against each other, with no one strategy being undefeatable. For each move, there is a counter move, for every counter move there is another counter. In essence, balance is maintained for the most part, with no one Faction getting too far ahead of the others. Each can be phenomenal in the right player’s hands.Unit Specialization   Quite simple really, but each unit has 'levels' that they achieve when they have gained enough experience from combat. This in turn, allows you to distribute stats for that unit as you see fit, meaning that a full blown army can be as unique as you deem fit. It could be as simple as maxing out the defensive stats, or going for full out mobility... Yet each is viable in different situations, with no one configuration being the end all be all. Diversity is the word of the game.Fire  This one is much simpler than the previous item, in that it is quite self-explanatory. Archers and siege equipment can make use of fire to damage buildings, do extra damage to units, or even light the battle field itself on fire. In short, just as in real life, fire is one hell of a weapon.Map Size   There are four castle plots, one taken by each player unless there are less than four of course. Each one is in a corner of the map, with defensible positions dotted all over the place, including bridges, ruins, quarries, and npc forts. The time it takes to travel across the map isn't too long, but just long enough to make you think before emptying your garrison. Caught without an army at home, you will suffer the consequences.Zombies   A relatively new addition, these buggers form up large hordes outside your castle and in essence prolong the game unless you can circumvent them. You used to be able to direct them against your opponents with clever sacrifice of units, but they are more a field threat these days. Every unit that dies and is not looted... Well... Expect to see them again. Not only does this add some threat to the general map to consider when moving about, but it also being key to use scouts to avoid them or funnel enemies towards them. While they are destructible, they can still wreak quite a bit of havoc before being put down.Unit Diversity   Each Faction has some basic units similar to another, but even then, each have their own defining characteristics. Take spearmen for example, orcs have Impalers, elves Sentries, and humans Halberdiers. The Halberdiers lack special abilities, but have higher base stats and are able to cut down monsters and Calvary quite efficiently. Impalers on the other hand are slow and lower damage, as well as health, but have an AoE ability that can one shot a large charging Calvary force, as well as stun them, not to mention it works decently against other infantry as well. Sentries on the other hand have a stun ability, which allows them to combat Calvary and monsters while taking little damage. What we have here, are three different units designed for the same task, yet go about doing it in completely different ways. Nor are they only type to have such differences.In short, KW2 is a great RTS that gets you in the action, gives you the tools to create the army you always dreamed of commanding, and to proceed however you want. Want stealth based combat? Elves have plenty of that, and the Orc's Goblins can do such as well. Want to take a tanky approach? All three have their own methods, such as Slayers, Knights, and Grandmasters. Archers? Most definitely. Another interesting thing, is the siege equipment... But I might as well not spoil it for those who have not played yet, but suffice to say, they can be used in a variety of situations.Don't believe me on half of what I said? Try it for yourself, and you are sure to find something you enjoy here.Sincerely, The Goblin King			"

												A very fun, addicting, unique, challenging RTS game, the campaign is good but for me i played mostly the skirimish because that is where the real challenge is. Facing 4 AI in a free for all along with zombies is truly brutal. I would train thousands along with all the ai training thousands marching them to attack me and the other AI causing tens of thousands to die throughout the game. What did the zombies do? all those tens of thousands of troops got up and became a zombie. Talk about hardcore, not only fighting AI in extremely massive battles but also having to worry about all the massive armies that die become zombies?  Let me tell you it didnt end well for me or the ai since thousands were dead infront of everyones castle. Having to worry about the enemy along with zombies is no simple task which makes it more challenging. When you fight there are 3 parties fighting which is you, the ai, and zombies ah and some random ogres and dragons every so often. This game is a very unique RTS game that has tons of replay value and content along with the weird crafting system which i personally am not into but it does add something most RTS games dont have. To answer if the game is worth it i would say yes and would very much suggest gettng it, sure you can find other good rts games but definitely not as unique as this. I mean, you not only fight AI you also fight zombies all at the same time. Pretty dang unique if you ask me and definitely not something you will find in another game.			"

								For a game that is still on Alpha, it successfully manages to hook players in for a long period of time despite its early content and diversity.A game that despite its current early stage is already fully capable of projecting an enchanting medieval atmosphere throughout the entire game play either on its singleplayer or in real time multiplayer battles.Kingdom Wars 2: Battles can be seen as a huge improvement from similar game series such as The Settlers, that is also capable of defining with accuracy the true way of RTS games genre.The pros of this game:Charming and wonderful graphics that makes players feel an unique medieval atmosphere in it;A game that shows a lot of diversity so far despite its short variety available (which is understandable considering that this game is still on Alpha);Both game mechanics as well the user interface are simple and good looking;A crafting system that makes this game different from the usual RTS games genre;Good music selection that contributes to the medieval atmosphere this game has to offer visually;And last but not least, the first impression that I obtained after playing this game is that it has a bright and promising future ahead of it!The cons of this game: Lack of players; (This isn't exactly a con because with the excellency of a game like Kingdom Wars 2: Battles gives to players, it does deserve a LOT more players playing it).The game currently has bugs and lack of content that can give your opponent serious advantage over you, but such things will eventually be fixed through patches;Unstable multiplayer mode with usual de-syncs and some lag spikes from time to time.ConclusionMy conclusion on this game is a bit hard to determinate because it is far from finished, but one thing I can guarantee, that this game has potential and a promising future ahead of it!

												This game has all of the feastures it needs to make a great game and I have had fun in the short amount of time I have played it already. I really like that the more you play the more units you can unlock through the mission rewards, and the trade centre is a great idea.  However, I do believe there are a significant number of bugs to fix as I have experienced a great deal. Pros:* Fun - Probably the most fun rts I have played in some time * Interesting buidling mechanics - I love that you can extend the outer walls and how you can go quite defensive to start* All races play very differently - I really like how different  the Orcs are, it really feels like you can make a horde* The maps are large and well balanced - They feel large at first, but it means you have to move and attack* Its hard - Im probably just rubbish at it (although I play alot of RTS), but I died on the first mission which is basically a tutorial. Thats never happened to me in a game before and I like the challenge (that was on normal mode)* Very active devs - You can see this within minutes of looking on steam and the ingame chat, its very good to seeCons:* Bugs - there are alot, but looking on steam they update frequently)* Visuals - I dont mean the gfx (which arent great), buit its quite hard to tell units apart. I think this is made slightly worse on the first campaign level as there are so many bodies, but it does get easier on the single player maps*  Units AI - The units seem to work great in smaller groups, but when you select the enmasse several dont move at all without helpTLDR; Buy it now, but it needs future support from the developers (who look super active)			"

												This game has worked its way into accomplishment for beta to opening,Just like kingdom wars 1 its VERY smiliar but VERY different the part where it looks and feels is similar and the gameplay is different.Ive been beta testing this game since the day in came out. For beginners the first thing you should do is do the campign to get to know and feel how the game plays and works. I have encounterd this bug multiple times where in a Multiplayer mode you see diferent things then your teammate. But most of the bugs has been fixed from beta. When you first play hands on you should play all the races that you think best fit you or is your style.Humans-Good for beginners,1st Best race at defense. Hard in early game.Orcs-Third defense of the 3 races,Good for people who understand the game. They are best at early game.Elves-Once you play them it seems tricky but youll get use to it,With there stealth you can sneak capture towns. For feedback to the DEVS for a small team they deserve many cookies. I suggest making a new race (Dwarfs) like we all wanted in kingdom wars 1 the dwarfs would be master at defense then the humans at the best health but the slowest units and lesser damage. They would be the slowest race to build up their Econmy due to there advantages in defense. There main resource is stone. This is just a fan suggestion of mine but i could see adding the dwarf as a race could cause a promblem due to the the dwarfs being used by other races currently. But as i seen most people dont really use them.As I said keep on doing what your doing DEVS the game is great but can be even greater (New race c;). I highly suggest this to people who love Total war games,Kingdom wars 1,etc these types of games.  "

Also the different units: human, elves, orcs and zombies are awesome. The game still has to much bugs to play carefree but the devs are working hard on it. I just saw they released a massive update so hopefully some game changing bugs have been removed now.If strategy games are your thing keep this game on your wishlist for now!			"

								Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is an incredibly interesting concept in todays view of rts strategy games. It takes mechanics from all over, with resource nodes from games like age of empires or empire earth; huge scale combat from the total war games including the batallions of x amount of units per squad. It's so nostalgic and at the same time thrilling to play a game like this. As much as I'd like to praise it up to the stars and call it the new messiah, I can't do that fairly. So let's look at some of the negatives I've noticed during gameplay.- Archers: These guys are useful, but good god can they not aim at times. If you stick them on a wall, sure they'll aim as well as they can, but when you have about 3 orcish marauders (orc archers) left in a squad firing at your 5 squads on a wall, and killing them like flies while hundreds of arrows rain down upon the orcish invaders, and not a single one is hitting them, it's a little bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not even a case of them having godly luck by dodging, the archers just don't aim at them. They aim a bit to the left, or a bit to the right, and every single arrow aims in that spot instead of where the enemy is actually standing! It's infuriating! The siege is the same too, missing countless shots and wasting ammunition to try and flatten the ground next to the invader. AGH!- Terrain: This is a little bugbear of mine, but it still counts in this. On some maps you play singleplayer, I've found that if I try to play humans, and have stone walls defending the core of my city, I can't place anyone on the outer layer. By outer layer I mean the humans have a kind of bastion style design. If intruders break through the outer walls, they have to break through the inner gates. But the inner gates are broken into two parts. I won't fully explain it since I'd sound like an utter moron trying to explain something I don't know about, but look it up. I'm sure there are a few images flying around of the human castles by now.- Balance: As of the current release of the game, I've found that the elves are insanely overpowered. Now, in a lot of games I've played over the years, elves can be quite dangerous, but if you try enough, they'll fall over flat on their pretty little faces. In this game? Good god. They're the same as all others, don't get me wrong. Push enough and they'll still die. But in terms of resources, they will outlast you. How? They get a building called a symbiosis tree, which allows them to CREATE resources. Yup, I really mean that. They can create gold mines, stone mines, even more berries if they so fancy. This means they can keep pumping out entire armies of powerful troops, while you're scrounging around the map desperately trying to find some gold for another squad of knights.- Walls: Useful, correct? well, not when the wall is blocking all your arrows trying to murder a single zombie battering down your damn gate, and you can't open that gate because the zombie is hitting it. Infuriating, especially as an orc, since you only get one exit out of your plateau. Truly infuriating. It's made even worse when you watch your archers arrows hit thin air way above the barricades and the enemy on the other side is perfectly safe. Worst bugbear ever.Now, I know that a lot of these problems should be solved during the next couple updates, and admittedly they'll take a while. I'm an impatient person so I want them as soon as possible, so I can enjoy this game even more. But on the whole, for the feel this game gives you when you play this, it's totally worth it in my opinion. Especially for the price right now. £10.99? I'd pay £20 for this game, just because it's brilliant, and brings back the main thing I love in games like this; strategic options. Rush them, or defend. It's your choice.			"

								I am a huge medieval RTS fan. It's been a very long time since we have another good medieval RTS, I can't remember the last good one released in recent years. All we have these days are those futuristic ones with guns and mechs yawn...Then I stumbled upon this game.+ Beautiful graphics. Nothing outstanding for 2015 but for a RTS game it still looks very good.+ The three factions in this game are very different from each other. Can we have more factions though? Why every RTS game these days has exactly 3 factions? I know it's quality over quantity but still!+ Great wall defense mechanics. Pouring oil down to the invaders!+ Fire arrows. Archers in this game have much more impact than just being some low-HP fire support.+ After a battle, you can send peasants to loot corpses for gold and wood. Nice.+ Interesting crafting system, with different cards for different factions.+ Good price for a game like this. Look up other recently released RTS games on Steam, they are very overpriced despite just being clones of Starcraft, C&C etc.- Variety of buildings and units, hope more will get added.- Not really a fan of the zombies. More polishing would make this a + instead of a - though.- Bugs & optimization, but not really a con here since the game is still in early access.I'm excited to see new patches and content added to this game. As of right now I cannot not consider this one of the great medieval RTS games yet, but lots of potential here, don't screw it up guys.8/10			"

												For me this game is the perfect pace at how I want an RTS to be played. You usually don't get rushed right away and even if you do you start with wooden walls. Your base can be upgraded and it is fun sitting in your castle defending it against a horde.			"

Early Access Review
								as of: May 11, 2015A creative and inventive world with an RTS twist, it has a ton of potential but there is still a lot of work to be done on it. For now I can barely play hardly an hour. Trust me, if you are an RTS lover, this game is not. worth. 20 dollars. I promise you. I can barely play more than an hour and I will try to give you a short review on why it's not worth your time:Cons:-Very clunky main menu screen-Text is hard to read and you can't increase or decrease the size because then it will disappear-There is like, NO AA on the menu screen so everything is hard to look at. (texts are very jagged and it's headache-inducing to try and craft cards) -If you're used to most RTS games, building in this game is weirdly confusing, but I think it can be overlooked if they patched the game up some more. Obviously they're trying new techniques that's completely different from building in Age of Empires, as an example.-Voice acting -No immersion, and definitely not addictive or satisfying when it comes to RTS games.-Not quite optimized, I sadly can't even do the storymode because of extreme lag (yet when I play singleplayer, it's just fine)-A voice that constantly tells you that you have idle workers (not sure if you can turn this off yet)Pros:-Good music!-Obviously they care about their own lore and storytelling, you easily get this with how they simply give their inhuman races their snippets of their own languages-Each race is completely different -Cards: something I've never done in an RTS. Basically they're like buffs that you craft before you play a game that gives you an advantage on a map. It's pretty clever-Good maps, they look pretty and there's a good selection of them so far-Nice visuals for an RTS-If you're into the high fantasy scene, it's a good way to feel a little nostalgia from the old Warcraft daysI actually do not recommend this game to play, but to help fund the studio to make this game better because it has obvious potential. This is one reason I hope Early Access Games will stop being a thing and gaming studios will focus on the content of their game rather than pushing it out as fast as they can as an unfinished piece.

								You like strategy ? massive battles ? So this game is for you. It's only early access - there're some mistakes and flaws but it remains a great one. A lot of opportunities to get your enemy down or defense your own city. You can earn some * extra * out-of-battles resources to make your race stronger in the next battles. It also allows you to call a dragon ( but would be very expensive and hard to take ). Basically I wanted to buy the new game or additional to it * stronghold - crusaders 2 * but when I * suddenly * stumbled upon this I found it much better. IT HAS strategy possibilities. You can play alone, everyone against everyone (4v4) or 1v1 or 2v2 united. Shortly say: a good game with strong prospects			"

												It feels like an older fashioned rts, almost like the age of empires series but with orcs and elves. The battles can be pretty epic with a fair amount of unique units for each class. Campain's decent and does a proper job at teaching you how to play, though still giving enough challange to keep you on your toes when fighting the ai.My biggest complaint is the massive lag I get when selecting and moving large armies, maybe it's the graphics card I use (I have a AMD Radeon) it's almost game beaking with the screen freezing up and trying to maneuver your troops. I've heard the devs say they're working on this and hopfully it'll get fixed soon, but if you're someone who likes his fps at its highest then i would recomend waiting until this is patched, otherwise it's genuinly fun.Also big points for the undead that can be used to your advantage, never played an rts where you can kill your amries off next to the enemy base just to have them raised as undead to finish them off.

Early Access Review
								A good fantasy real time strategy game that has a lot of potential.It feels like a combination of the two good old Age of Empireand Blitzkrieg, where you control a group of soldiers as per unitlike in Blitzkrieg and has the building, economy andupgrade system similar to that of AoE.You can play as 3 distinct factions: Human, Elves and Orcs.Since you can control group of soldiers as a unit, every battle will be huge and epic like in the movieLord of The Ring :) though they may not last very long like in Total War series because the soldierswill die fairly quickly (same as in any other RTS).Graphics is really nice, and of today gaming standard.There is a little limit with the AI as theydon't know how to attack human player so it's hard to even finish a game because they would just build a really huge armyand station them in their heavily fortified castle and wait there untill the end of earth.But since the developer's goal is to make this a multiplayer RTS game, the AI limitation can well be omitted, and probably will be improved in the future as it is still in early access stage.For now you can enjoy it in multiplayer, as there are manyfeatures like crafting and leveling up your general that I have yet to try my hand on (since I am more into single player mode).8/10 "

Early Access Review
								This is a very fun little game. The single player is lacking, Needs a proper skirmish mode. Hopefully we get one. Other then that its similar to stronghold crusader, but with fantasy elements similiar to lord of the rings. Are the graphics amazing? no, not really, but its fun and its not taking itself too seriously. I play total war games when i want complete realism on the battlefield. The game is large scale, and i cant stress enough, just fun. You start with a town or whatever from which you build peasents. 1 squad of peasents is like 15 guys. So you build some squads and then you task them out to do things like..work mines for stone, kill pigs for food, loot corpses for gold and stuff, etc etc you get the idea. Each race is different, for example the elves do not chop down trees like humans  do. they are nature lovers or whatever so, they work with the earth.  You build houses to increase population cap. Each house adds 10 squads, each squad can have 15ish men in them. I dont know the max population...i havent hit one yet. But you can see from the video up top on the store page that the battles can be big. Theres upgrades and tech trees, things mostly make sense, like if you have catapults on your wall, they fire stones but in doing so they deplete them from your stock pile. Makes sense to me, Stones arent infinite and free to just toss around.  Theres alot of detail in the maps, The huge cities and towns are really pretty and well thought out. In closing....I dont know how popular this game is, there are clearly more of them, and this is the most recent, but i had never heard of these games before this one. so i cant compare the rest or anything, but man i feel like i stumbled across a little gem. This is true old school rts. Build a barracks get infantry. I compare this most with the lord of the rings rts battle for middle earth. Basically if Battle for middle earth and stronghold had a baby, this would be its offspring. Also reminds me ALOT of warcraft 3 so maybe battle for middle earth cheated with warcraft 3, and stronghold never found out, so stronghold helped raise the kid as his own. LOL			"

								As a casual gamer with a larger game collection I don't tend to write reviews for products but this title is very different, What you get is a RTS Strategy game that puts Triple A games like Total Wars to shame that on the face of it doesn't look particulary spectacular but the game play is amazing (note I'm not a kid looking for some pew pew - as a older game mid 30's I like to relax after work for a few hours).Let me get this out of the way straight away:Cons -Can't Move the castle - its been my only gripe so far when you start a battle your castle walls are in a pre defined location (one at each side of the map)Graphics - the textures look like AoE games or games dated around that genre (not a bad thing but the younger gamers wont like it for a 2016 game)From what I've seen (others I read have graphics issues) I've had 100+ units in battle and yes the framerate has dropped but the game has never dipped more then a gig of memory use - (It did make me wonder if this is a 32 bit application)Pro's- Gameplay (the battles keep you returning time and again)- First Battling the AI to get crafting materials (RnG based materials which unlock units to use in battle) - thats right you start with only the most basic of units and castle and work up- Que system - I can't wait to see this with more players you hit your gametype the game seems to auto match the players- No Console - For me not being able to spawn all items in or cheat my way through it is spectacular (the secret room on fallout 4 that gives you everything in the game once you know its there the game is done!)All in all a fantastic game... while I look forward to seeing some progression in its current state its well worth a look (just make sure you stick it out for a few hours) - I've sunk 20 hours in so far in just over a week... i petty my gametime in a month			"

												I'm not a fan of RTS games, but what the game has to offer is really great! Short Version Well made Progression system, cliche but perfectly fitting races, exciting battles, Freaking Zombies!  usually don't like those, but here they fit great into the game!  rather small dev team, that does a damn amazing job IMHORating 9/10 long Version  Races in KW2:B you can choose between 3 distinct races to fight with: Humans, Orcs and Elves. They might be what you would expect from each race, but that's not really an issue as they made them really well!Humans are pretty basic and medieviel-ish, except they can breed FREAKING DRAGONS! and can train mages, otherwise what you would expect (each race has their heroes, Dwarven ""Mercenaries"", Mages and Dragons.Orcs - Quantity over Quality - they are really dumb but that makes them fun to play! it's a bit hard getting used to them, as they infinitely spawn at your base (can be toggled) but once you got into it it's relatively easy.Elves - Quality over Quantity - these guys are a bit tricky, as you need to ""build"" trees in order to build Buildings on it, but they have some neat advantages like a wood gathering spirit. Progression Each race can unlock new buildings, Units, Abilities etc..... (permanently with materials - will cover later) and for each upgrade you make you can see your tribe grow in the main menu, which is a neat feature, although i haven't recognized much difference on single upgrades - but are clearly noticeable when doing more.Once your done upgrading, you can buy Battle cards to aid you in your fights. Cards range from Resources, to units and even timed bonuses.Materials for crafting these Upgrades or Cards can be gathered by completing matches (win or lose) beating every 3 waves in survival, trading or simply by logging in each day - which is IMO a great idea to keep people interested in the game. Game Modes KW2:B has a few game modes BUT keeps growing! currently has 5 game modes:- Capture town flag: Get your Army through the Enemy gates and capture the Town center to beat them.- Total Annihilation: Destroy and murder everything from that player to beat them.- Capture the flag: there is a flag in the middle of the map, you know the drill!-Casualties of War: just murder as many Enemies as possible to win - has a set limit to win- Zombie Survival: like capture town flag, except you have to defend it agains masses of incoming Zombies! pretty hard especially with humans as you can't really get to stone and gold with them. Battles Battles start relatively fast in KW2:B and can be really exciting and pretty frustrating if you just wanna take things easy. But once you got everything set and rush into **** with your team it's a whole lot of fun! But Beware! Killed people can TURN!! so, if you just leave the corpses around they could suddenly stand up and start clawing at you! ways to deal with that fu***rs is by burning them (dead or living.....again) or by tasking your workers to scavenge the corpses.It can especially be fun to let a few peasants die near the enemy camp just to see them turn! >:) Multiplayer Haven't gone into this (cause i think i'm to bad for this :P) but it has PvP and PvE. You can also do a Zombie Survival run with a Friend! Dev Team I usually be veeeery careful on who to call a good dev, but those very few guys working on making the Game great are really amazing! the Game tend to have some issues and when this arises the devs jump on this and try their damn hardest fixing them. They are also really well present in the Forums and are up for new things and suggestions.Overall a great RTS Game that WILL grow much better, I'm sure of it!My Rating 9/10			"

								*Starts first game on normal difficulty*-Starts gathering resources-builds two layers of wooden palisade-makes some Archers to defend the outer walls*10-15 minutes in*-Enemy AI sends an onslaught of orcs and battering rams at my walls-Finally finishes them off after a 10 minute battle *Moaning starts* -Zombies completely destroy the gates of my outer walls-Rush to build stone walls while some of my lucky soldiers are able to retreat behind other layer of walls while the rest are trapped, being destroyed by the undead horde-My archers begin to fire at the zombies from my newly created stone walls while the orcs decide to send some wargs which kill the last of the zombies after a few minutes, my archers kill the last 2 wargs-I begin repairing and raising an army-I eventually get to the Orcish base to see that they have glitched and have a massive army doing nothing-After about 2 hours of sending wave after wave of macemen (because I haven't unlocked any good troops) the enemy base is almost destroyed but they continue building more and more units*Game crashes*Pros:-Fun gameplay-The battles don't feel too grindy about resources -Zombies rising adds new strategies no other RTS has-3 Completely distinct race(not complaining about crashing and glitches, because this is early access)Cons:-Enemy computer doesn't have resources.... seriously-AI needs to be worked on, even without the glitch, that they don't attack, all they really did was immediately send troops to attack, I recommend adding different kinds of AI in the battle creating menu [eg. Aggressive, Defensive, Random, Normal (semi-aggressive, semi-defensive)]Conclusion: A great game for early access, I love RTS' like this. Crashing and glitches that need to be worked on a bit, some optimization. PLEASE MAKE COMPUTER AI HAVE TO USE/GATHER RESOURCES, I understand that the AI may need to be better before this is done but just please do not leave it like this for the future. Overall a great game so far, don't expect a shining piece of art but if you like RTS and/or Fantasy games I HIGHLY recommend this early access title.Edit 1: One more recommendation, as far as the enemy defending worked, they just seemed to hangout where ever they were recruited, it would be nice if the enemy built stone walls, towers, etc and stationed troops on walls.

Early Access Review
								I am a big RTS fan, and this game is pretty revolutionary when it comes to the zombie mechanic. (You can turn off the zombies if you don't like them.) The game is basically any other Medieval RTS title, but has zombies! You fortify your castle and upgrade units and structures, there's a whole crafting system in this game, which is weird, but kinda cool. For most new players, like myself it took a few games to realize that I had to craft upgrades from the main menu to actually use them in game. But once I figured it out, the game really came to life.Basically how it works: You play campaign/multiplayer/singleplayer vs AI. Once you have played a few games, you will get these special resources, now I don't know how to actually acquire them, but it seems like the more games you play, the more you get. Anyway so once you have these resources you can craft certain upgrades that can be used in game. (For the Humans, Halberdier for example.) And after you craft the upgrade you can use it in game. Pretty cool stuff.All in all this game is pretty awesome. I mean it needs some more refining, and at random times may crash. (Save Often!!!!) It'll get framy and just gucky, so be prepared to have it crash, also sometimes your units won't respond to orders, I've noticed if you stop moving the screen and click it usually works. lol other than that this game is a diamond in the rough, totally worth the money if you wanna support the devs. It's really fun in the state that it's in. Can't wait to see what they do with it in the future! 10/10 Would get sieged by Zombies again.			"

												Game: Kingdom Wars 2 :BattlesPublisher: Reverie World StudiosStill in Early accessGameplayKingdom Wars 2: Battles is a RTS game set in the medieval era with emphasis on battles of epic proportions and managing your kingdom. At first glance, it is a typical run of the mill RTS game which provides players with 3 races : Humans, Orcs and Elves. All the races here are pretty well balanced and none of them feel overpowered in any way. Then there are the undead which spawn when blood has been shed on the battlefield and they have the potential to destroy the army which was remaining on the battlefield. The other part of the gameplay consists of villagers/orcs who build buildings to keep you in control of the battlefield.  There is variation present in the type of soldiers you can build to keep things fresh. You can also upgrade various abilities to make your army better. The gameplay here is fairly basic for RTS otherwise with little to no surprises. Though it does execute the basic things pretty well and is very much enjoyable inspite of the clichéd RTS tropes.Visuals Kingdom wars 2 isn’t the best looking RTS out there. It falls somewhere in the lower end spectrum in the graphics category. It reminds me of Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth II which was a pretty good looking game of it’s time. The water in Kingdom wars 2 is spot on. You can see the waves rushing towards the shore as you make your way through the game. The unit models have some variation but are not as well made as they should have been. Some buildings have some very good design but most of them feel very much rushed out. You can see the buildings, especially the gates being upgraded not only through stats but also visually which brings a really good feeling. Overall, the graphics here are fairly average and nothing exceptional or bad is found here.SoundThe music in Kingdom wars 2 is really good. It really escalates the feeling of a battle and amps up the sound as the mood changes from peaceful to a more violent nature. The sounds from your units and villagers though interesting at first gets repetitive in not more than 4-5 hours, which is common in most RTS games so it is nothing big of a deal. The battle cries of your soldiers and the grunts of the zombies are good enough to keep you invested in the battle raging in front of you. The music and sound in Kingdom wars 2 is pretty neat to say the least.Current performanceKingdom Wars 2 features an episodic single player campaign which is fairly long as of now. The tutorial is actually one of the best tutorials you will find in a RTS games. It is fairly complicated but explains most of the situations to you. I did not find bugs in single player except a couple of freezes and some minor annoyances. The multiplayer though is somewhat of an issue. It did not take me long to connect to a multiplayer game but the lag in the middle of the games were annoying to unbearable. The multiplayer needs to be worked on as it is not in the best condition. Bugs are plentiful too when playing multiplayer ranging from some sound cuts to major lag and crashing of the game. It runs pretty well though when playing an offline game. Since it is still in early access, we should expect to see much more bugs being ironed out.Overall reviewKingdom Wars 2:Battles is a game which is really enjoyable by the fans of the genre. It’s massive battles and the inclusion of undead really gives a pleasurable experience. The single player campaign is fairly long and there are a lot of options to mess around in a random game. The multiplayer needs some work and there are quite a lot of bugs. It won’t change the mind of the people who don’t enjoy the genre but there are a lot of redeeming qualities which make this a great game. Rating 7/10This review is brought to you by Steamified.

Early Access Review
								--Early Access Review--This game reminds me of Total War series, Battle for Middle Earth series, Stronghold series and last but not least Age of Empire series.Pros.- Three Factions/Races  to choose from. Elves, Orcs and Humans.- Tech trees. Each faction/race has its own Tech tree that you can upgrade. - At the end of each game you can get Cards to improve/upgrade your tech tree to improve the gameplay and tactics. - Large selection of troops.- You can place troops at your or any other castle wall! - Dragons man! Zombies man! Both together man!- As said below: Zombies. You kill some guys, wait for some time and Boom! You have zombies out walking out in the map. - Campaign mode. It's always nice to have a story. - Each map has agressive AI bases you can fight with. - Steam cards! Badges!  Achievements! Cons.- Still has many bugs. (A lot of  bugs have been fixed.)- Hard to get into Multiplayer games.- Voice acting can be better. Right now it just isn't perfect.- Graphics aren't great (but it is all about the gameplay that matters. )All in all. Game will get better as Early Access goes on due the active Devs asking the community for suggestions to improve the game.Better get it now that never.8 / 10			"

												If you’re looking for a game that genuinely feels increasingly rewarding the longer than you play it then I urge you to try Reverie World Studios Kingdom Wars 2: Battles that has been recently released out of Steam Early Access.Although the game was bundled twice during its Early Access period, meaning many of you may already own the game and therefore have an even greater reason to play it now, the game is definitely worth its asking price especially for those of you who have the time and the energy to make the effort to playing this through to completion. Although I’ve spent four hours playing the game I can already foreshadow that this is the type of game that you could easily sink hundreds of hours in. There are five full campaigns and that’s without even considering the multiplayer. As of writing there are well over one hundred players playing and the in game chat system was vibrant and active so finding a match shouldn’t be a problem for some time.One of the best things about the game is that there are three playable races. However, unlike a number of other games where each race feels very much alike even though units and buildings may be given different names the play styles of each race feel very different from one another. If not for the graphics then at times you would have a hard time believing that you were playing the same game which is a real boon for a genre where variety can be an important selling point. Another strength of the three race system in this game is that – at least in my experience – none of the races play over or underpowered when compared to the other. Certainly there may be a race that plays to your own individual strengths or against your weaknesses but it is a game where putting in the time to learn to master one or more will give you an advantage in the multiplayer.There are some weaknesses to the game. My biggest one would be the graphics. The UI, because of the graphics, needs a fair amount of work but I’m not entirely certain as to how I would go to polish it but I do know that it needs work from its present state. At times the screen can be too busy and I found it difficult in these times to know which units – peasants – weren’t being busy. This is especially apparent on the tutorial level where there are just so many different units that bombard you that you can lose track of what is happening all too quickly. I know that I wasn’t the first player to lose at the tutorial level and have this complaint. There are also some bugs that continue to remain in the game. However, to be very fair to the developers, they’ve been great and are removing them from the game at a rapid pace and this has been the case throughout the entirety of the development process.However, the tutorial level – even if you include the fact that there is a little bit too much going on – is one of the better ones that I’ve played. It’s a welcome introduction to the challenge that you will be experiencing throughout the game. This isn’t a walk in the park regardless of the level of difficulty that you play on and that is as it should be. Some players may well be frustrated at just how tough the challenge can be but if you’re wanting an engaging and challenging game in this genre then you’ve found it.My favorite aspect of the game is the fantastic skirmish gameplay. This is genuinely the type of game that I would recommend to those who loved the original Warcraft games as well as those of you who play Rise of Nations and other similar games. You’ll be surprised at just how much depth there is to your city/base building while also at the same time how strategically you must be in designing the type of armies that will enable you to be successful. Players of both types of games will be at a distinct advantage as you utilize a combination of the skills throughout the campaign and multiplayer modes.There is a ton to like about Kingdom Wars 2: Battles. There is potential for the title to become even better. The devs have been great and if they continue working on the title then it could become a classic. If you already own the game thanks to the Damnation Bundle from Bundle Stars or the Be Mine 21 bundle from Groupees then get on board and play it. If not and you’re a fan of the game then you really owe it to yourself to check it out if not right away then when it goes on sale.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group "

												I was really excited for a nice rts style game, almost reminding me of BFME2 from years ago. Read the reviews, everyone seemed pleased with their purchase, and it's not a bad a game per say. But... if you are interested in multiplayer games, there is a wretched desyncing issue. But it doesn't inform you of an issue. So while I was in discord with a few friends, playing a match against one another. One person was laughing that they were burning peoples cities down, while... On the defenders screen, literally no battle was occuring. Eventually we were not even playing the same game. Pretty disappointed.			"

								The peasants finally finish the last section of stone wall surrounding our village when the Elven scum strike. Huge tree men advance at the front of their lines, finally reaching my gates and kicking with their oak-tree like legs. ""FIRE"", screams the captain of the archer squads, as they let loose an unholy barrage of arrows at the pointy-eared hellspawn. Elven warriors try to advance onto the walls when macemen stationed on high tip cauldrons full of boiling oil down on their evil little heads. A loud crash is heard from the rear of the keep. ""My Lord, they have destroyed the rear gate!"". "" TO ARMS"", I scream, as I lead my men on a thunderous charge into the enemy ranks. What feels like decades later, the battle ends. Scores of bodies, both human and elf, lay mangled on the ground.     Suddenly, moaning sounds start blasting from my pc speakers. What the? The mangles corpses start rising from the dead, and now I'm fighting...zombies?      A pretty cool game that reeks of potential. Have only played single player skirmish so far but I like what I see. Maps, units, upgades are all interesting. Had a few CTD's so I'm hoping for a little polish over the next few months. A solid offering so far.			"

												Oh , cmon people !!Why am i seeing negative reviews.I buyed yesterday (2016-12-07) and i completed the first part of episode 1. Its a nice, classic RTS like Stronghold, LOTR, etc. Tha classic recipe: You research tech, u build buildings with pesants, you make walls. It have extra features like cards, or techs that u can buy. I do not like multiplayer games, so i only can say about single player. It is an nice game for me. If u can get it with discount i can recoment it. I buyed it at 6.4 euros. for 6 euros it have much things to do. Also workshop supported, new expansions are coming, steam cards and achivements...I am waiting for the new expansion now. Nice work devs.The only downside is the graphics. this game can play in a pentium 4 Machine. Those graphics are really early 2000s style.			"

								Ok, this game is interesting. The Graphics are meh, but the game is really easy to learn. The game has you start off gathering resources and training an army. After that the game turns into wolf killing simulator 2015 for a little while. Once you have your army ready for battle and your peasants working... then you are ready for battle! Battle consists of:-Killing enemies-Killing houses-Killing enemy soldiers-Killing your own men who turn into zombies-Watching your own men get killed by wolves that they passed bySo in all the game is definitely in alpha, but for $15 it has a great deal of potential.

												I have spoken in the in-game chat with the DEVS and other guys around this game - they are extremly friendly and help at every occasion, making me feel my money good invested.The game itself is very good and similar to KW 1, but with a singleplayer campaign now, which is hard but rewarding. You feel so good if you beat every hard mission after several trys (like the feeling of other hard strategy games out there if you finally beat a difficult mission)Good castle-building, upgrades, wall-addons, tactics... and I just like the game, thumps up ez.

Early Access Review
Kingdom Wars 2: Battles ReviewKingdom Wars 2: Battles (which I will refer to as KW2B in this review) is a bold approach to RTS strategic simulation games that focuses on the building and destroying of massive medieval citadels. The battles are intense and the strategy is unlike most other simulations out there so most players can expect a challenging experience unlike any they have faced before. That is, unless you happened to play the original Kingdom Wars. What gives this series its unique flavor is Reverie World Studios, INC's strong focus on siege warfare, making it unlike anything else being developed.Players will naturally need to gather resources, build structures, research technologies, and train armies just like in most other RTS sims of this nature. However, the economy and techs have all been streamlined so the player doesn't have to micro-manage their progression and can devote most of their attention to the battles themselves. Currently there are three races to choose from: Humans, Elves, and Orcs. Each race has its own unique units, structures and styles. Since the game is still Early Access, its possible that more will be added later but I cannot say for certain.Players can choose between single-player story mode played out in episodes, skirmish mode, and Multiplayer mode. There is only one episode available now but current plans include five in total and these additional episodes will be released as Free DLC's. Other features in the works include a crafting system based on rewards earned during battles for a variety of advancements, an intricate card system used for powerful bonuses during games, a trading market where players can trade crafting items with other players, and a guild system that will allow players to create or join a battle clan for shared strength. At this time, some of these things are still in development so its not easy to elaborate on them, but they sound pretty cool.The graphics are very rich but older systems struggle to keep up on moderately high settings so this may change in order to accommodate more players, especially for Multiplayer PvP. There is an in-game chat system so players can communicate during gameplay without the hassles of using the Steam overlay. A level editor is included for the mod community can get a jumpstart on their own creations. The sound effects are a bit troublesome currently and being sorted out. Nothing new for an Alpha version though. Also, there are still a number of bugs scattered about so don't be alarmed. This is typical of an Early Access game and the devs welcome any information on them so they can work to correct the problems. Still, the game is very stable and entertaining. Being part of the Early Access phase gives players the opportunity to help shape the future of KW2B and help the developers build the best game possible. However, if you're one of those gamers who has little patience or prefers only finished/polished projects, then i suggest holding off a while longer. Unhappy gamers do nothing to help the community, the developers, or the game.The Good:=======+  Solid graphics and detailed artwork+  Three fully unique races+  Various player modes for added replay value+  Crafting and Card systems for player bonuses+  Fully rotating camera with smooth controls+  In-game chat system+  Steam Achievements & Trading Cards+  Level Editor included for the Workshop+  Active & friendly game devs+  Free DLC's +  More cool features being addedThe Bad:======-  Still has a lot of bugs to be worked out (typical for Early Access)-  Audio is a mess right now-  User Interface and layout still needs some work-  Many features and elements are missing (still under development)-  Graphics are a strain on older systemsFinal Thoughts:===========KW2B has all the promise of a great game and I have no doubt the developers will see this game all the way through to a polished gem. Siege warfare is often a neglected aspect of RTS strategy sims and its rarely done properly so this game offers a fresh experience for most players. Strategy players will definitely want to grab a copy and strap in for battle. This game isn't the best choice for impatient people or those who expect to have a smooth and complete experience since its still Early Access Alpha though.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								Hello All, (Final Beta Release)Id like to start out by saying that I love this game but, my girlfriend hates it. In the weekend following its purchase iv logged just under 30h. I played abit of the campaign, Multiplayer, Survival and skirmish. Out of all the modes Survival is my favorite.PROS- The amount of Units one can sustain on the battlefield rivals TA (Total Annihliation) and TW (All Total Wars)- The combat mechanics, Siege mechanics are fantastic- 3 Unique races all with their own spin- THE SCALE!- The Maps (though id like more)- The graphics are slightly above average but leave lots to be desired- Army customization via personnel armors, weapon upgrades and health/Regen ect ect.- Seperate tech tree for each faction- Unique card system for enhanced starts- Guilds/friends list/trading system- Low PC demands given the sheer scale- Trial by fireCONS (most being adressed ASAP)- Poor unit pathing Warriors and Peasents alike (especially for wood)- Alot of missing content for a Final Beta release- AI even on easy starts with near infinite resources forcing a turtle everytime (very hard)- Exploitable Race mechanic (The orcs are the only ones i know of)- HUD lacking important info- Unit huds lacking important info- Bugs and crashes (not unplayable at all)- Only one way to build a fortress for each faction (could use different keep and fortress layouts, dont confuse this with building stuff, this only affects where walls can be built)- Lacking a real tutorial besides the campaign, especially for combat/ damage types- Zombie glitches/bugsCONCLUSIONBuilt an army to lend AID to my survival partner. My army and his die defending his lands, soldiers killed by zombies rise. Rapes my lands and decimates my people to extinction. Cows and sheep last to die off. 11/10 WPA&A&A&A			"

								(Apologies if this review is a tad long but being detailed can be helpful everyone once in a while lol)An impressive start to this game, The Developers stated that this game would run smoothly and that they hope to bring this achievement from running smoothly (in which i can personally vouch for, great work for that guys/lasses) into their first development (Dawn of Fantasy) I personally believe in the developers and they work their god damn arses off trying to get the games to work, to the best they can.You gamers that play with a wooden Toaster, it'll definately work on your wooden toaster, thats not an insult to you nor the developers, in fact its quite the opposite, its a great thing indeed and you will feel relieved that you an actually play a game without so much of a lag.)Great game, obviously needs tweaks here and there for present things within the game and obviously got more stuff coming, its a great game, too great a game to pass up in fact. A sexy idea, the tech tree, and i think it will serve well for the game, and the cards, i haven't looked at it much since i've been engrossed into the ins and outs of the actual gameplay, but from what i've seen, it looks good. The gameplay feels much smoother than the first, but again, improvements are always welcome and a pretty site on games. Overall, Get this god damn game and play it will ya? (its an awesome game for old skool RTS players such as myself.)			"

								Kingdom Wars 2: Battles:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   A kingdom without a king is a recipe for war! Three races are engaged in this devastating conflict and trying to survive. Who is going to have the upper hand? Would it be the Orcs, possibly the Elves or it just might be the Humans?!Kingdom War 2: Battles is an RTS game which offers several modes of play. In the campaign mode, you will be playing four episodes at this stage (the fifth episode is coming soon), you will be treated with very good cinematics as well as an in-depth story line. This episode with be all about the last stronghold for the human race, the city of “Dagbor.” You will be playing the Humans and then the Orcs. During the gameplay, you will have to achieve all tasks before entering a battle. Essentially, it is like a very good tutorial. You will learn how to gather resources, create buildings and units. The single player mode is realistically a skirmish; choose your race and up to three others players (AI) to fight against. In the survival mode, you will be fighting against waves of zombies. There is quite a lot of content here. There is a technology tree for the 3 races and you can unlock upgrade with different resources. If you are missing some, head up to the trade centre and buy what you need from another user. By clicking on the social icon, you will be able to see who is online, become a friend with whoever you want, challenge or engage in a co-op game.Strategic cards can be crafted and used in a multiplayer game. Select a combination of cards to have the edge against your opponent but be aware, they might have a better combination than you.The gameplay is good, as are the graphics, although I did experience a couple of flicking screen effects here and there. The controls are easy to master and follow the trend of this type of game. The only negative here is that I had to click several times to the same points for my units to acknowledge my command, and this can be frustrating.Positives:~~~~~~~~    -	Good graphics-	Good story and cinematics -	3 races to play with each their specific tech tree-	Achievements and Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls could be more responsiveI really like RTS and Kingdom War 2: Battles show great potential. 7.5/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Alot of time has gone by since I first made a serious review of this game, so I think, as it has made significant steps in the right direction, I should update my review of it.Kingdom Wars 2 has all the makings of a classic, aswell as a few things that make it definately stand out, some things seem like poor choices... i don't know why there's a progression system in an RTS, or why its next to impossible to get any of the high level crafting objects, but those are just nitpicks, so lets tear into the game as a whole shall we? I'll be judging it as if it was a finished project so anything that ends up being ironed out when you read this may no longer be applicable.The game features the standard 3 factions, a faction with expensive troops, a faction with tankish troops, and a faction with cheap troops, however each faction works in very unique ways such as how they gather their resources and how they build their armies, which is a neat thing to see in an RTS.Kingdom wars 2 is also the first RTS I've seen to feature zombification as a mechanic, and its more or less clunky, it really just makes sieges more of a hassle and slows the game down, but it has its high moments, there's a lot tension when a massive army of your troops or an enemy's army has been defeated near something important, and you need to clear the area of corpses before either: your enemy arrives again or the sun sets.The strategy side of this game seems fairly weak, sad to say, this hasn't changed at all in the past year, no doubt this is because the community for this game is fairly small, and the armies themselves aren't balanced ESPECIALLY orcs. The people who play this game regularly seem to play it exclusively for the survival mode, which is kinda a shame for me.I'm happy to see the majority of glitchs have been ironed out, and the remaining lag is probably just the fault of my own computer or internet, i'm not sure.This game is still not finished, though it is finally ready for release, I suppose. The units are grossly unbalanced, but and the devs do seem very invested in the community around this game, so I'm actually going to go ahead and recommend you support them still.			"

								This game is very good for a currently Early Access game. Is everything perfect? No, of course not. However, it's well on its way. The only thing that may discourage you as of right now is the lacking AI and the fact that you don't start off with all the techs and troops that you do in campaign. You after get supplies through winning games, or through a daily login bonus, as well as trading with others. Other than that, it's a good game overall.			"

Posted: January 9
The conceptKW2B is a (partially asymmetric) RTS. It is NOT your typical Starcraft/ competitive melee RTS clone but rather the ""enjoy your units and have some fun"" kind.You build your base, gather 4 types of resources, research upgrades and recruit your army. On top, you get to fortify your base with several layers of upgradeable walls so attacking an enemy always ends in a siege battle. There are 3 different races with ample differences in gameplay and base building and each of them gets their own castle.And at this point you're probably asking yourself: ""Wait, I can't build my own castle or what?"". The answer is YES. The castle layout is fixed and so is the general landscape beneath your base. You can place your RTS typical structures wherever you want but wall segments, gates and towers are all built on a fixed ""addon"" location. However, this doesn't detract from the fun and I'll explain why down below.As for game modes, it offers a singleplayer campaign which also acts as tutorial, PVP up to 4 players, COOP vs AI (the AI is good enough) and a zombie survival wave mode where you defend your castle (and that of your friends) against ever increasing waves of zombies.What you're getting yourself intoThis is a low-budged indie game with all the pros and cons:Be prepared for a truck load of bugs.  The game has anything from crashes and disfunctional addons over a laggy interface which also is not always properly updated to minor bugs which can be summed up as 'lack of polishing'.The devs are actively involved with the community and do their best. This has to be pointed out as well. You can find developers in the ingame chat every day and they do their best to respond and act on every bug report you commit. They also mediate in balance discussions and admit if something has been overnerfed or whatever. In general it's a very pleasent experience with these devs and they put out patches on a regular basis.Moderators are online almost around the clock and the entire community is small but very helpful.What makes this game special?Well maybe special is the wrong word. KW2B employs a large variety of iconic game mechanics from other RTS (many of which are lost today) and mixes them. The result is compelling to me because a) I get to enjoy all those mechanics again and b) it is simply fun to play.I'll try to give you an idea (RTS veterans will understand):Resources work exactly like in age of empiresThere is food, gold, wood and stone. You start with high gathering rate but limited resource patches to kickstart your base and then transition into slower but renewable resource generation for late game. How and what exactly depends on your race. Generally speaking, elves have the most stable renewable resource generators, humans the most efficient and orcs spawn free units instead.Meta tech trees for every race (like AoE online)For every player you kill, for every game you win and for every day you log in you get a loot reward. There is a good dozen of items with varying rarity to be gathered and you use those to permanently unlock new structures, units and upgrades for your race to be used in any future match.Once you've unlocked them all, you can spend those resources on ""cards"" which are one time boosters you can bring into the next match. For example, you can spawn a blob of additional, free workers or add a ton of food to your bank.Soft rock-paper-scissors balance Like in many strategy games you have units which are specialized in killing a specific unit type. However, it's not dead set in this balance. You can still damage cavalry with archers and swordmen for example, but you trade units with less efficiency. Your fortress, good micro or a better economy can easily offset this, though.Unit verterancy and stat pointsAs you upgrade your barracks it will train units of higher level. Killing enemy units will grant them additional exp. Unlike the usual veterance system though, it's up to the player to decide which stats are improved on a level up. A leveled unit basically gains stat points like in an RPG that you can apply to one of it's 3 defenses, damage, movement speed, health, stamina (which is also used as mana), etc.Hero units and WizardsEvery race has a bunch of heroes and wizards like in Battle for Middle earth 2. You can train and level them like regular units but they have a higher max level and a whole lot of active abilities. There are also war beasts and mercenary units!Captureables and neutral fortifications across the mapConsidering you have everything at home you need (more or less) there is little reason to leave the save embrace of your fort right? Wrong! The maps are littered with capturable pieces like bandit forts, lumber mills, quarries (which provide you additional renewable income) and ruins of old castles which walls and towers you can man like they're your own. These ruins offer choke points, ambush routes and everything the heart of a tactician requires. And then there is a dragon on every map, guarding a treasure (additional meta loot) which the players compete for.Fortifications So let me get back to what I said in the beginning. You can man your walls with archers and other units and mount ballistas, trebuchets, oil and a bunch of other machines onto towers and gates like in Stronghold. Unlike stronghold the final layout of your walls, towers and gates is fixed rather than pieced together by the player. Tbh, the layout of the landscape and your base greatly differs depending on which race you play. The concept here is comparable to Empire at War or Battle for Middle Earth 1.Also unlike Stronghold the devs had the opportunity to carfully craft and balance your foritifcations so the result is more complex and fun than anything you can build with the limited tools in that so called castle simulator (SH). You get access to walls of different heights, you have up to 3 layers of fully seperated, fully mannable (if upgraded) walls. Your keep is always located on a hill which gives you further height and line of sight advantage (both matter for archers) and there is always a backdoor.Additionally, you're not forced to fully upgrade your defenses every game. Sometimes you want to leave the out wall a mere fence to slow down the enemy an keep your forces together at the base's core. Sometimes you want the out wall asap to better control the area around your base. Thus your castle doesn't necessarily look the same every game.Zombies!As an additional source of income you can task your workers to loot the corpses on the battlefield. Yes, the insane gore in this game is part of the gameplay! Even better, not looting them before nightfall means they will rise as zombies which pose a serious threat. The zombies don't fight for any player per se but a good player will know how to use them to their advantage...ConclusionThis game may fall flat on you if you have too high expectations. It's not super polished and the graphics aren't really up to date. That said, the music, art design and concept are just beatiful and super enjoyable. KW2B can stand on it's own and fill a niche that other RTS have left wide open for the past years.If that is what you are looking for the stop reading and buy the game already!			"

												I have never spent more than 20$ on a game in my life; This is the only exception. Kingdoms Wars 1 and 2 are probably my favourite games and I've played hundreds. I saw one gameplay trailer and was hooked from there. I definitely reccomend looking up a gameplay video on youtube or such and if the game even remotely looks interesting to you, buy it. It is 100% worth. Even the devs are amazing, the company continues to give us the equivalent of free dlc every couple months just to say thanks for buying their game. Kingdom Wars 1 is now free to play btw, so check that out too. This is the same game with more focus on fast paced skirmishes over spending literal weeks of real life time building up your city.			"

												Looks like the new version of AOE3/BFME2 that my wife and I have been waiting for, excited about co-op skirmishes against the AI as that is what we prefer. Keep up the good work, loving the progress so far...Update right at release. Devs have come through with the Co-op, perfect for our needs.  In fact I have never seen Devs so dedicated or responsive before - kudos to those guys and well done on a great game. If you enjoy RTS (starcraft, warcraft, Age of empires, etc.) you will love this game.			"

												Gameplay is actually really solid, love the different unlocks and various upgrades you can earn for your respective factions. The game is not without faults, unit selection and movement can be quirky at times, somewhat poor image quality and graphics. That said, none of the issues detract from an overall excellent game. Devs continue to update and fine tune it, and are very open to suggestions, concerns and ideas from the fanbase.			"

												Tons of bugs:1. If your peasents are harvesting a tree near a cliff edge, they will often times forsake the tree next to it and climb all the way down the mountain to harvest the tree down the cliff that is closer horizontally.2. Dragon animation is choppy and poor. When it flies over a wall it sort of warp lands on the other side. It also shoots fireballs out the back of its head when you target a location behind where it is looking. 3. The graphics are fairly poor compared to other rts games of this time and genre.4. The peasant animations are also choppy and the cycling for the chopping animation on trees does not transiition smoothly resulting in them rapidly raising the axe two times in a row.5. I got the dragon slayer achievement just by letting the enemy ai take out the dragon and I looted the dragon treasure afterwards.6. The boulders from the trebs tend to explode in mid air above their targets at times.7. The level of castle customization only accounts for placing buildings, you can't choose where to build your walls and you can't place indipendant towers so establishing a defensive position is only possible with units and possibly occupying ai creep camps.8. Sometimes only a few units in a group attack the enemy, letting potential increase battle effectiveness slip by since the rest of the group just sits back for 5 seconds waiting to join the battle.9. The map variety is zip for single player. They are the same sections of land repasted in different patterns. Not much variety from the original F2P version of Kingdom Wars. (not a bug)10. The enemy ai likes to sit outside your gate while you slaughter them with arrows because they forgot to bring siege equipment with them.11. Also not really a bug, but I don't find it really feasible for zombies that are already loose conglamerations of flesh and guts to be able to tear down solid stone walls.12. Peasant ai sux.13. Peasants don't finish off a tree before they go ADD and decide to go look for another tree to chop down. (unless the decay animation is really slow and hangs around for a while after the tree has been exhausted, but I wouldn't know since there is no indicator as to how much wood is left in a tree)14. Not a bug, but you cant have multiple save games of single player battles/skirmishes. Makes me frustrated that I cant save at any point in the campaign missions.15. If you save during the zombie horde survival single player mode, and let yourself die then you can quit the game after you get the reward and continue again and repeat and get a lot of crafting mats. At least that happened to me after I got to wave 7. (I only exploited this glitch three of four times).14. ECT.Overall, I love the concept and idea, just poorly implemented. To be honest, I would reccomend The Lord of The Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 over this any time. Therefore, I do not reccomend this game until they fix and polish the mechanics of this game. Sorry for the grammer mistakes, but I don't feel like fixing them.			"

Notification: I got a free copy of the game for review purposes.This review only mirrors my expressions from an early development version - It is not up to date! Summary Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is a medieval styled strategy game with a affection to card games and massive battles. You get the chance to control your own empire of orcs, elves or humans in a war shattered world with with their very own play style and build-up system.Playing each single race feels totally different to the other ones and the player needs to choose wisely between them and their belonging cards to match their own type of tactics.Pro'sUnique play style with different races and card decksLess micromanagement due to squads of unitsPossibility to fight relatively huge battlesBased on old school games like Starcraft, Warcraft and AoEFast update and development progressStable gameplay despite being early accessLevel-up system based on cardsCon'sGraphics are still partly early stageRather bad pathfinding (soon to change)Battles seem pretty buggy at this point - Most arrows can't hit their target properly and units behave pretty dumb at some pointsMy own ConclusionWhen playing this game for the first time I felt like being reminded of my first gaming adventures with those good old strategy classics like Age of Empires or Warcraft 2 - this game got a big potential of becoming the next attempt to revive the dying art of building strategy games. Also the first few campaign missions gave a nice introduction to the future of this game.There is indeed only one thing I can really complain about at this very moment: The game is still unfinished - that needs to be changed ASAP.Imaginary Rating: 8.2/10 "

												This is a game that at face value looks rough around the edges. Being an RTS/Stategy/Simulation-ish game, it fills a very niche market, one which I always struggle to find the right game for me, that satisfies my every need - decent castle building, solid warfare, economy / resource gathering and units gaining veternacy with progression, and I can gladly say that this game fulfills my every need. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of age of empires and especially stronghold. The graphics aren't the best - but after an hour you get used to it, what matters more is core gameplay (look at games like terraria and minecraft as an example). Suddenly you have this nostalgia of old games with modern mechanics and it really is fantastic.One of my favourite features - zombie survival in an RTS! You have a castle like a normal game but you're tasked with surviving wave after wave and this can be done cooperatively! After every 3rd wave you unlike crafting materials that you can use after the battle to craft the various cards and race upgrades.This is just a taste of what the game offers and I have barely scratched the surface my self, but with such helpful and ACTIVE dev team members in game chat (which is visible throughout all games and menus) I felt compelled to write my first review of a game in a long time. Buy it, support the produces and watch this fantastic game grow - there's a lot to offer and the team have an amazing philosophy, something we cannot say for most modern games these days.			"

								If you are a Kingdom Wars fan or hell, even an Old School RTS fan i strongly recommend to try this out. First, I Alpha tested this game and i am proud to say the developers are very responsive to bugs and happily accept suggestons from all usersSecondly, this game (so far as its in beta now) Irons out most of the bugs on Kingdom Wars 1 and other RPG's such as the ""Out of Sync"" issue with multiplayer games such as this. The old school economy system also brings back nostalgia from older RTS's namly Age of Empires. Thirdly,  The Community. The community is made up of a lot of old school players who could relate to old times and also are friendly with new players. Anyway if your a fan of RTS's or maybe even just like RTS's than this is definitley a good choice to try out with responsive devs, nostalgic economy system and general gameplay, and great community willing to help out!

								Still early access game but man its looking good deff cant wait to see how it ends up, its like the total war games, and a hint of stronghold but better way better. You build up your city and prepare your army however you want to you get to choose between Orcs, Elves, and of Humans. Every faction has a group that gathers materials gold,stone,wood,and food from there you build houses in your city to gain more slots for military of civilans. You can put archers on the walls and amp up your defenses with trebuchets, rocks, and oil and you can upgrade from wooden palisade walls to rock walls. Like I said still in early access but I deff recommend this game can't wait for more updates and the finished game			"

												Where do I start.. Ah yes. KW2B has honestly astounded me, for being a new release it is very well done and the Dev's are on point with support and patches. The gameplay merges with the large openness of the game quite beautifully. The massive armies of siegeness to the simple raids of infantry, it also comes together nicely and keeps you on your toes. The complexity of managing an attack force, a defense and your economy puts players at their best. Combine that with the possibility of ""Oh No!"" of a zombie attack for not cleaning the army you have just successfully wiped out makes it a challenge. The races are well done, all balanced to eachother and the tech trees giving you an edge over your opponent make it wonderful to build your own strategies. The campaign is so well in depth and fun to play, the problem is waiting for the next Act/Chapter, whatever you feel the need to call it. I'm very pleased with this game and it was well worth the buy, I highly reccomend it to anybody wanting a well-paced RTS.			"

Their ideology of continuing to add to the single player campaign over time with patches (along with other content/fixes) and the amount of diversity already present in the game are the only two reasons you need to purchase this game right now!  Multiplayer is a blast, the MMO system is well thought out, and it can only get better from here.  Props to the devs!			"

												Feels very sloppy, which could be as a result of it being based off the back of a FTP MMO. When you tell units to move often the flag doesn't appear at their chosen location, and if you select a group to move it's pure guesswork where they'll end up. Upgrading troops is a pain because there is no noticable indicator they're ready for upgrade unless you click on them individually, additionally once you've upgraded one unit type (i.e. archers) the UI bugs out for all subsequent upgrades.The graphics are poor, and there are several anomolies including blue and white screen flashes.Presumably as it used to be a FTP MMO there is no save option in the single player campaign, you have to wait for checkpoints which can be hours apart. I tested the checkpoint save system by waiting till a checkpoint and exiting, and on reloading it had lost 40 minutes progress, it was at this point I decided it was time for a refund.			"

I cant even tell if they are working still or died from a zombie attack.-OP ORCS= Maybe More camera control (my preferncees) similar to Attilla total war maybe able to zoom in closer?= MAYBE a Dwarf Faction?

												What can I say....THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL GAME!!!   So fun, very challenging. Lots of moving parts and some very deep systems at play here. If you like castle building, real strategy, age of empires, stronghold kind of RTS you will go absolutely nuts for this title.  1000's of units on screen duking it out with blood everywhere. (Makes sure you clean up the bodies by the way or now you have an army of the dead attacking you). 3 different playable races currently that each have their own completely unique attributes, units and economic system. Resouce gatherin is fun and also challenging.I have been waiting for a game like this for a long time. For the price it's a steal. Can't say enough good things. Start off wtih the Campaign. Fun to play through and great way to sample all the playable races, that you get some stuff for unlocks in the global skill tree's and bonus cards you use for the single player and multiplayer part of the game. Yes skill trees!			"

								Great game.I consider it to be the future successor to Stronghold and Castle Strike.The zombie mechanics are also execllent and add another layer of challenge to the game,reminding me of the tv series The Walking Dead,except this time,it is in medieval ages with medieval weapons.Any corpse (friendly/enemy) not looted/burned in five mins will have a  chance to turn into a zombie,higher if of a more expensive type of unit.A lot of corpses outside your stronghold=potential zombie apocalypse.The zombies are slow,but strong and difficult to kill.Best chance is fire arrows.The only problem is the lack of polish and bugfixing,especially unit to unit combat and ai,hopefully will be updated and fixed in future patches.Or you could wait for its full release.For now as it stands, 8/10.

												I personally perfer the Original Kingdom Wars, the second KW2,(the topic of review) is both an amazing step in the right dircection as a single player expierance(SP). RTS games have been a dying breed after Warcraft 3 was released and the way of the fps arose like the zombies do as in it's totally awesome yet you still wish it would just die. There is only one other game that the conscept of zombies rising from the dead of the resent conflict, Army Men franchise again another rts master peice. It has always been an interesting extra threat to an RTS one that is alway fun. This begining said I was hoping for a similar to the originals mmo like ""World"" to have zombies as well they should look into  such a thing but in general with Total War fighting for survival as the only quality RTS game around anymore let us pray that Kingdom Wars can aid in the return of the RTS genere overall across lifespan of game(s) in series (8/10 Inivative Ideas Across Existing Titles in Series 7.5/10Gameplay of KW2 7/10So the ideas that are coming from this game are not 100% new but they are either often poorly exicuted or just plum unexplored such as RTS zombie hazard or the MMORTS Kingdom Wars has largely adress the major problem mmorts games face how not to be P2W and how to keep contrution and training times to be more normal for RTS games in general, This is a huge strength as an mmortsKW2 has an interesting Card mechanic as well as a zombie hazard, though it has in some ways dailed back though it is nice to be able to play a story campain and other things to do without being online The there is the game world itself all I can say ""What will befall the realm of Mythador next what apycolyptic event is in store next of the world that seems to taken a plunge into the unfathomable depths of what seems to be the inevitable dying throws of all of Mythador?

												One of the BEST up and coming RTS games out there. The game is worth full price in my eyes! Great buy for mid-week madness.I have been following this game since release and i can say they progress was a bit slower going but was well worth the wait. Its nice to see how fast things are going as of now!You won't find a new RTS game that can hold up to this!!Goes into best ever along with LOTR: BFME 1,2, AoE 1, AoE 2, Warhammer 40k, Command & Conqour, Warcraft, and Starcraft!I have very high hopes for this game! I would recommend this game to anyone who ever enjoyed a good RTS!!What do you have to lose?? Steam has a refund program!! If you don't like it can always refund it :D			"

												I have only been playing this game for a few hours and I'm completely in love with it. I haven't played an RTS game in years, which was Halo Wars (if that even counts as an RTS game, I'm not sure), but I'm loving the gameplay and artwork. Not to mention, the developers are also totally in contact with the community. I oppened up the game after downloading it and the first thing I see is the global chat and the Devs talking to the players. In my opinion, that is one of the BEST features. There are also many other game modes such as Zombie Survival, PVP, and PVE. However, new players will want to start with the campaign since it teaches the basics of the game. If you have any questions (as I did), just ask the amazing community of the game in the chat. I strongly recomend this game, even though I've only played a few hours, because of the great community, caring developers, and amazing gameplay.			"

												I have to say I am quiet impressed by quality of this game. After 1.17 patch, lot of things changed, got improved and overall it's really big step for KW forward. Gameplay is very enjoyable with 3 factions, with unique tactics and way how to play them. You can also upgrade each of them and get some more buildings, units, upgrades etc., permanently, which is at least from me, interesting system that rewards players for playing.Siege can get quiet hectic with all these units running around, arrows, rocks etc. flying around, and multiple ways how to approach them, so they are definitely fun.So far I am enjoying this game, since it has really a lot of potential, and hopefully it will stay that way. If you are not sure if you would like this kind of game, go ahead and try KW 1, since it is free to play right now.Anyway, good job Reverie and keep it up!			"

												A great indie RTS. If I was going to compare it to anything, I'd say the base building is like Stronghold/Battle for Middle Earth, while the combat is like a mix of Total War/BFME. Graphically it looks pretty nice, and one big plus is that walls and defenses are really easy to build, so no more wrangling with the mouse and drag and drop to try and make a decent looking wall.The zombies are a fun addition and really add an extra dimension to the gameplay, since big fights can result in an even bigger horde of the undead coming to attack everyone.

												This is a great little game! Hard campainge, tricky AI and a steep learning curve to play Online. The game does only seem lag alot when you have lots of zombies on your screen but other then at it seems to run really well. Plus you can turn zombies off if you think its silly or just dont like them.Havnt really tried out all the game modes yet but i could see there a quite a few to get you going. Obviously i've only got 3 hours in game so i havnt played it too much but from what i have its an alright game.			"

												had a 14 hour long game of defending my base because of elf tping onto the battle field and dying and becoming zombies and killing everyone, sent out groups to clear zombies and zombies were too strong. zombies then broke down my walls and  it was a last defence behind my final walls against zombies. led zombies away to elf base and watched zombies tear their kingdom apart while i had 30 peasents offering me potatoes while looting the bodies of their dead relatives. 10/10 would make peasents loot dead family again P.S On a serious note, this a fun game to play every now and then, however id buy it when on sale becasue 30 bones is a bit pricy.

												As of right now, the game is very nice, the mechanics are unique and they do an interesting combinations between games like Age of Empires and Total War games. there are 3 races and their playstyles differ and it allows for unique strategies. Now, what made me give this a thumbs down? well first of all, the game is unplayable, I get such low fps that i can barely enjoy the game itself, the game stutters nearly every few seconds and the fps gets really low at times, running at low/med/high has no difference. once this has been solved, I am willing to give the game another try and update this review accordingly.My Specs:Intel Core i7-2600 @3.40GHz12 GB RAMGeForce GTX 960 2GBAnd I'm also running Windows 7 64 bitI assume these should be more than enough to run the game and if anything I'd at least expect no stuttering/fps loss at the lowest settings.Just an FYI graphics are really not important to me, gameplay is, and the game is unplayable to me currently.EDIT: Devs said they fixed the problems with a patch but I didn't notice any increase in performance when I tested it.

								I love this game. It is an incredibly RTS game, kind of reminds me of Battle for Middle-earth 2 and Age of Empires... With Zombies. But it still has issues. The controls aren't very responsive (I play a lot of Starcraft 2, and that one is very very responsive). Sometimes I have to click 2 or 3 times in order to move a unit and there is no attack-move function (or if there is, I don't know how it works). And then there is the biggest problem I have ever faced with an RTS game: SYNCRONISATION! I've played with a friend a couple of times, and the game was never in sync. He was doing something I didn't see, so that wasn't happening on my screen. He told me he was at my base but I couldn't see it, and the other way around. I seriously hope that gets fixed, because it is a big turn-off.But all in all this is a great RTS game :D			"

												Reading through the reviews, and with the hindsight of now playing the game... i think people are giving this game more credit than it deserves due to the small but responsive dev team.  The actual gameplay is a VERY dumbed down age of empires meets a VERY dumbed down Stronghold.    Tactics consists of smashing piles of units together or hiding behind premade fortifications you can click on to ""build"".  No designing here.  I won't pretend this is a comprehensive review, but I was so bored so quickly with the gameplay, I couldn't be bothered to see if there was more deeper somewhere.			"

Great game with even greater potential.I'm generally keeping distance from early access games, especially after I read the negative comments of players who were mislead by promise of a great game and when that game is finally published it is just one big disappointment and waste of money.This is not one of those games. The game is perfectly playable even in the early access, you have pvp, coop and skirmish vs. AI, devs are working on campaign, and constantly polishing it/fixing bugs.And have I mentioned that there are zombies rising from the dead soldiers (and believe me there will be a lot of dead soldiers) :)TL;DR If you like RTS do yourself a favor and get this game, it's fun and it's cheap (I know some worthless DLC that cost as much as this whole game).

												Very pleasant and deep but unpolished Rts.3 different factions (Orcs,Elves,Humans) with different playstyles with a gameplay that i would describe as a mix of stronghold (but no free castle building) and battle for Middle Earth with a zombie Kicker. Slain units rise as zombies attacking everything if you dont Bury/loot/burn them with workers.This can give sieges and engagements new angles, like mass sacrificing your units in the enemies castle, only to watch him getting swamped in a zombie outbreak ultimatly suffocating in the risen corpses. Or watching an enemie assault come to stop in the risen corpses you left in your retreat.Bad Pathing, Mediocre Voice acting and lags in huge engagement pull this a bit down.If you need a fix for HUGE siege battles and massive Engagements and can tolerate a bit of shabbyness i recommand this wholeheartitly "

												This game is an amazing RTS!Cons:The graphics are a few years outdated, but for me this isnt a big problem becuase I love games like Warcraft and Warcraft 3aswell as the orginal starcraft series, this game reminds me of Battle for Middle Earth (the first one).Multiplayer kinda sucks, my freind and I have been playing this game for about a week now and we have been dicconected ingame and it doesnt stop the game but instead the AI takes over and we then technicly start playing a single player battle.Sadly there is no custmizable banners and colors so you are stuck with default.AI, the AI in this game SUCKS! the workers are really, and I mean really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. the soldiers AI when I tell them to hold their ground charge out to meet the enemy dooming my entire defence! and dont even get me started on zombie AI (the AI for players in zombie/survival mode)BUGS! there are a ton of glitches and bugs so watch out for those when you are playing this.Framrates are horrendous and will drop anytime I get into a multiplayer game, AND I have a beefy computer, I am able to run (smoothly at high graphics) Rome Total War. (and Rome Total war has a very bad engine and I can run it fine in large scale batles) But in this game whenever I build more than 5 units the game starts dropping frames.AND NOW! unto the Pros:This game is so much fun! I want to play this more then I do right now (but for certain problems with the game I cant) one thing I love the most about this game is that there is a Zombie mode (survival mode). But with the Zombie/Survival mode comes a WHOLE BUNCH! Of problem that I am not going to include in this. for the most part the game runs fine and the battle are amazing, I love the way that the seiges take place, team Green sets up his massive force to assualt team Yellow and then all of a sudden team Purple swoops in from behind and starts attacking team Green, Green team then calls for the aid of their temporary allies the Brown team to aid them in this massive battle taking place over at the Purple Teams city. this happened to me and it was amazing to see this battle play out (even though I was Yellow, I was seiged and defending for the most part) in the end Yellow team pushed Purple, Green AND Brown out of his city and then procededs to seige and defeat Brown and Purple teams, just before Yellow team gets seiged again by team Green! (in the end I lost, I ddint have enough recourses becuase they were all gone and my market would not give me any gold for all the meat I was trying to give it, so in the end I lost becuase I could not defend my walls)Overall this game in its current state is a 7/10maybe in the future it can go beyond that but for not it doesnt seem like it, and also if they do not fix the bugs and quirks happening throught this, my rating for this game would drop to a 4/10. (love the game but the problems are huge and need to be fixed)			"

								After playing the game for a couple hours i found that the game so far is well developed and that the developers are fast on their toes when it comes to getting back to you about suggestions for the game. If you are a fan of RTS styled games i couldnt recommend this game more Kingdom Wars 2 may have a small community of players right now but just think about how you could have an impact on the game! Not only will your idea possibly be looked at but the developers might agree with it and add it in! This is worth the price and im glad I bought it and not only that, there is no pay to win aspect behind it and any player new or veteran can win at this game even if you dont have tech or cards you stand as much of a chance at winning as the other player does. Also the three races (Orcs,Elves and humans are equally balanced in there own ways! 10/10 would lead my elves into a wolf pack while watching the enemy castle burn to the ground again! *NOTE* this is early access and there are bugs in the game but chances are if you are as big of an RTS fan as i am you will look past the bugs and look at the amazing game created before you.

								Now thats an impressive job from Reverie team. They really improved the engine which totally deserves the 2.0 title :DThe most noticeable is the combat. Units are fluid and responsive and pathfinding seems to be totally fixed. Most small glitches and bugs from KW1 never shows up during my gameplay, and believe me, i had some fights there which could easily match those EPIC moments from KW1The new mechanics is fantastic. The fast paced combat will surely grow a very competitive community. Theres a great sense of evolution, which is costly but very functional.Im not a RTS gamer, but somehow KW universe really appeal me. Ive spent over 200 hours into KW1, and i can see myself playing both games for a long time yet. Im sure both games will work out great togheter, so far the knowledge acquired from one, can be used on the other. I can see people training uncommon army formation and strategies to use into KW1 :DLong live to Reverie and KW universe!			"

								This game shows a lot of promise but unfortunately suffers from the same bugs that were present in the first one.  The music, for example, constantly resets itself to the default setting after it loops forcing you to go into the options menu every few minutes to turn it down/off.  While there is a single player campaign, there is no save feature at present.  This is unfortunate, considering that the game crashed after 20 minutes of playing the first level with no way to recover it.  I like the ideas it brings to the table: craft-able cards, researching permanent tech upgrades...sort of reminds me of ""Age of Empires Online"" that way.  The developers have also proven through their first game that they have no problem with releasing free DLC/add-ons and responding to the community.  To that end, I'd say pick this up if you don't mind the bugs (buildings disappearing, etc.) and lack of a save feature...otherwise, wait a while until the game becomes a bit more polished.

												(I bought this game on sale, so keep that in mind when reading) The graphical style of this game is its lowest feature, but if you can get past it or it doesnt matter to you then youll find a fun, albeit imperfect game. Kingdom wars 2 is an RTS in the classic style with some intresting intricacies and improvements on the overall formula. There are a few main recources: food, gold, wood, stone, and population. Where the game shines in my opinion is the differeing abilities to gather these recources. For instance, after a battle you can task peasants to loot corpses for gold and valuable loot, and as they do so they will also make sure the soldiers that died dont come back from the dead. Which brings me to arguably the most fun part of this game, the zombies. The zombies are a dynamic RTS threat that I have not seen done anywhere else and they are enough to pick this game up if you see it on sale.When fighting the zombies you have to take a completely different approach to combat. If you send waves after waves of enemies to get chopped up by them youll only make the situation worse, because those freshly dead corpses will rise up from the grave to haunt you. If they get out of hand they can easily overwhelm you and with a combined effort topple your walls and destroy your recources crippling you completely as they overwhelm your stronghold. Being defeated by the zombies is almost fighting them.Keep in mind this review is only for the single player, as I have not tried the multiplayer, but even as a solitary experience I found this game worth a buy at sale cost.

												I enjoy kingdoms wars for a number of reasons one is the diversity of the races normally race is just for cosmetic reasons but in kingdoms the play styles of all the races is different. Economy is the easiest one to see with orcs hunting, humans farming and elves creating them. All in all the game is good still some bugs but the developers are active so ones you find will be most likely fixed. Though me myself hope to see the dwarfs or dragons added as full races but best to wait till games fully finished.			"

												This is a fairly fresh approach to the RTS genre, it throws in a few things which just make the game so much more enjoyable.It seems to take a few ideas from games such as AOE III, and by that I mean you can use cards during the game for extra resources, a few troops etc, only difference being you will have to craft these cards. You also have to play the game through a bit before fully unlocking all units and benefits within, as you receive materials for finishing matches which can then be used to craft new techs.Gameplay is pretty standard RTS, with a few suprises which keep you on your feet. Your base will fortify itself by upgrades, and (this is one of my favourite things in an RTS) you can position your archers on your walls to defend from invaders. There are scattered benefits around the map, such as extra resource deposits for your workers to mine, gold carts (defended by packs of wolves usually), and small forts (defended by bandits) which are good for strategic positions.The main thing I love about this game, which had me and a friend thoroughly entertained, was that your (and your allies/enemies) troops don't stay dead.. They will rise again as zombies, and at night are even worse to deal with. Essentially, even if you win a fight against your opposition, you'd best get your troops far away from there, or at least hope to god that that fight didn't take place near your base. The zombies swarm, you fight them off with troops and lose more, they gain more zombies, it becomes a losing battle fast.There is also a survival gamemode, in which you (and allies) defend your bases against zombie hordes. It seems like a normal gamemode, except instead of fortresses they have cemeteries spawning zombies at increasing rates every round. It becomes hilarious and terrifying the longer the game goes on.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great multiplayer-Fun Gamemodes-Interesting advancement with crafting techs for new units-Collecting materials makes tryharding those slow AI matches worthwhileCons:-Not completelty optimised if your PC isn't fantastic, can get very framey at times (the worst during the survival gamemode)-Limited to 3 different teams (races)-A slight lack of unit variety on each time-Limited amount of maps to play on as opposed to randomly generated maps on other RTS'Overall, the only cons of the game are things which can be improved over time and in further development/expansions, and I hear a new expansion (free, might I add) is coming in May. If you're questioning whether the game is worth its price, I highly recommend it. You'll get many hours out of the base game alone, plus with the free upcoming expansion I'm sure there's many more hours to pour into it.Tl;dr - RTS game with many unique ideas/gamemodes, great fun and guaranteed to have a good time.

												Gonna give this an upvote despite the numerous bugs as of 11 march 2016I used to love the sieges of total war med 2 , lotr rts and this game is what i was looking for Singleplayer :You colllect resources (sometimes within the castle walls) ,get to build up yer castle , put yer upgraded archers /trebuchets on the walls in prep for incoming enemy... kill them em off then counterattack and pew pew. Then most of the bloody bodies on the ground come back as zombies .The devs do throw a wrench into the game just as you think you are winning a mission to make it interesting.There was a mission where the enemy just kept coming and coming ...i was down to my last wall and they broke in , i charged at the orcs with whatever i had left but it was looking bleak. Just as i was bout to cry and fap over losing a 2 hour battle , a cutscene happened ...this was the way the mission was built ...has a lotr twin towers type ending then get saved at the last minuteBugs:there are tonnes of bugs , some can prevent you from completing the mission and you might have to start it all over again . I had a mission where i couldnt cross a bridge  and i was 4 hours into it. I actually did restart it next day , and same bug was gone .Your own troops seem unresponsive sometimes.Ive heard some people cant finish multiplayer coz the end screen doesnt come up. If you load a save , there might be  cracks in the walls you cant repair and enemy will just pour through themI addressed the bridge bug with a mod on the game -chat (there always seems to be a mod on to help people out) , and tried to help me out .Im sure they will iron these bugs out Graphics arent the best in the world , but i dont care too much .The singleplayer is only 5 missions (""New Episodes will be released as a free expansion pack, every few months."" ) , but i spent hours n hours doing these.I also tried out a co-op mission and a survival mission (where u fight incoming waves of zombies). Every online mission you do gives you crafting rewards that you spend on cards (i.e. extra 2000 gold in game ) or the tech tree (giving you advanced troops for online play) and theres a sort of auction/trade button on the main menu "

												Are you a fan of the original stronghold games but feel as though you can never quite find a game that comes anywhere near its majesty? Well ... Look no further ladies and Jents as this game right here pack quite the punch. From my experience so far this game not only brings back old memories but it also has a lot of new innovative concepts that I genuinely find quite interesting. Additionally unlike a lot of games still in development the team behind this game is constantly working on the game not to mention about to release a free DLC expansion here in the next few weeks. Like any game however this game does have its issues but that's to be expected from a game that is still undergoing development. if this game keeps progressing the way it is then it will more than likely grow into an iron giant in the RTS Community. I suggest purchasing this game when you get the change its worth the price but if you're unsure just wait for it to go on sale. Either way I believe you will enjoy this game! :D			"

Early Access Review
								The pros- truly unique factions that are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from each other, each requiring a distinct approch to building your base and fight battles. The gameplay of the elves is so different from that of the orcs you would think you're playing a different game!- very interesting siege defense and battles. There are very few AOE style RTS games out there that♥♥♥♥♥♥such an emphasis on siege elements, and this game does it quite well. Both defending your forts and laying siege on the enemy ones feel exhilarating.ConsNote that this game is still in early access stage. I assume and hope that some of the issues below will be fixed/improved. But it is always possible that they won't be. So I think people wanting to try the game should know about them.- this likely will stay, but it's not too much of an issue for me. The graphics is quite outdated for a 2015 game, even with everything on the highest quality. But for an indie game it's really not bad at all.- the most serious problem is the constant crashing. 9/10 skirmishes i played ended up CTD. The official solutions did not work. And that's when i have a good rig i7 + gtx 980 ti- some of the useful features that are omnipresent in RTS games are missing. E.g the game wont automatically redirect to  a unit after you press the number they are tied to, nor are they shown in a specific color on the minimap to tell you where they are.- your units can be pretty unresponsive to your commands. All in all it is a very fun game. Just hope the above issues will be fixed. "

Product received for free
												First and Foremost this is just an Early Review.  More of a First Impression than an in-depth tear-it-apart and tell you all it's flaws and greatness.I've followed this company and played their games since Kingdom Wars 1 was in Beta (Known as Dawn of Fantasy at the time), and aside from their recent hiatus they stand by their product which is more than you can say for most Devs in todays world.  Now let's actually get onto the game.They have taken the good things from Kingdom Wars 1 and squeezed them into a more concise game that should be more freeflowing and allow users to get right into the game.  WHich is really good and seems to work really well, however to me it takes a lot of the meat out of the game and I personally prefer KW1 playstyle over KW2:B.The Graphics aren't top notch but they're reminicent of RTS of times past that make you feel like your in a time machine.The Story is actually fairly decent, it's not the best writing ever but it's enough to keep you engaged to the point where you realize why you're fighting which is nice.The Music is nice but the sounds are more than a bit repetative, annoying the crap out of you when you click on NPCs/Peasants/Archers/Etc it is frustrating to hear the same thing over and over again.Lol, I meant to give a basic review and I went on a little much for what I intended.  Either way after I get some more time into the game I intend to extend this review to get some more depth.  I recommend this game, however I personally recommend Kingdom Wars 1 more, but why not both?!?!			"

												Same as the first game except now with zombies. The same horrible pathfinding, the same buggy sieges and the same less than great graphics. Oh and now the battles are bigger so theres more lag and no way in hell to effectively do anything since units nead to be micromanaged. Also the campaign saving system is really awful. It only autosaves and theyr completely unreliable. Everytime you leave and come back theres a good chance your gonna have to replay the whole dam mission over again.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a conditional recommendation.The multiplayer is busted on all adversarial modes, the campaign is unfinished and the singleplayer lacks a great deal of enjoyment due to buggy controls and resultant lacklustre gameplay. I recommend either getting this game now and waiting for fixes, or buying it later, so the devs still have an incentive to finish their product.With all that in mind, here are the reasons you should buy this game:Units: The units in this game are large scale and yet have plenty of time for tactical diversity. Varying formations and abilities hark back to the good days of Total War, whilst the Stronghold-like maps are utilised well to create interesting battle scenarios. However, the aforementioned lag makes utilising a large-scale army near impossible and the clicks needed to fight most effectively simply cannot be dished out. Furthermore, the movement is basic at best, with units sometimes not moving to where you want to go at the right times. This can be especially annoying when it means losing half your army to someone pouring pitch over them or them walking into spike traps. What remains though is potential - with optimisation and bug fixes the unit system will be enjoyable. Conditional recommendation. Get it once this is better.Buildings/Economy: The economy system works well. Things are well priced and utilised well, with clear diversity between the races (more on this later). There is a mechanic called ""trickle"" where you get small-scale income from various buildings/units, whilst gatherers bring in large-scale resources. This provides a multi-tiered system whereby you can manage the short and long term economic needs of your settlement. Furthermore, the design of the buildings is clearly different for all three and provides more clear strategic diversity, with the settlement sieges being truly compelling and enjoyable at the later stages of the game. What's wrong then? Well, the game pre-sets where your walls are going to go, so you don't construct your own elaborate fortifications and they will be the same each time, with the same set-up, regardless of map. This means that in terms of defense, it can get quite samey. Furthermore, for all races but the elves, the ability to snipe resource points from outside the walls can make defending in the long-term impossible.  More needs to be done to ensure fortresses fall and aren't merely starved out in a 2 hour long staring extravangaza. Again though, there is plenty of potential for this to develop as the game goes on.Other: The races provide good strategic diversity in terms of their late game potential and ability but the cards and tech development is a bit of a sham. For a lot of the cards and techs, they do exactly the same thing but are just reskinned. I can't see this improving. TL/DR: Poor multiplayer. Broken campaign. Fun as hell mechanics though and plenty of potential. Put this on your wishlist and keep a lookout for improvements. "

Early Access Review
								If you are an avid RTS gamer and hunger for a game that has something unique and different to the countless RTS games that have been released in the past, then I would recommend you jump on this developing one. Yes the graphics are not state of the art you see in recent RTS games, but the gameplay is above most that I have played in the past few years. And I'm confident that it will get much better due to the fact that the developers are extremely interactive with the community, asking players what they would like to see included in the game and how they would like it to develop. Most of the critical, ""not recommended"" reviews fail to understand or take into account that this game is still in development. Yes there are bugs and problems encounted but the devs are actively interacting with players and constantly fixing and updating the game.Yet, even in the present development stage, this game is fun to play with some very unique gameplay.I'm happy to stay on the ""development ride"" and looking forward to see this game achieve the success it deserves.

Early Access Review
								Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is a nice RTS game with big interracial battles ( Humans, Orcs and Elves at the current stage) Castles  (upgradeable but given and not custom placable [yet?] ).Basically they took the MMO ""Kingdom Wars"" (free to play in steam) and transformed it into a RTS game. Also i recommend to play the free to play version for the undecided to get an impression of how the game looks like.If you like Stronghold and Lotr: Battle for Middleearth  - you should give it a try.Some points:+++ Close Dev contact via ingame Worldchat ( never seen such exemplary attitude in any game before )++ regular updates+ Castle siege+ Big battles+ Campaign+/- Orcs.Elves as playable races+/- Zombies as npcs+/- Technology has to be unlocked to be used in Skirmish mod- Graphics bit outdated and clumpsy at current stage ( actual version is 0.1.7) but for genre lovers this is acceptable and i bet they work on it- current AI is not the smartestAll in all it seems like one of those rare Early Access games which will actually reach something. Even at the current stage you have much fun in multiplayer and some hours in singleplayer. thumbs up			"

								This game is really great for still being an early access. The large scaled battles and huge maps are very well done. The graphics on the game for the scale that it's at are pretty good. I'm still confused on how to gather the items required to acquire new technologies and cards, they could have a better explanation of it. I don't know if I'm the only one having this issue but if the battles become a bit too large the game itself crashes even though my computer is running just fine with no lag. All in all I really do enjoy this game, it defintely has a large amount of potential still left for the devs to bring out but even at this point the game is very well done.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, i'm not a native english speaker so you have to forgive me for any possible confusions. I decided to write a review for this game because the game is marvellous in all aspects with exceptions of a few annoying stuffs which will be summarized below.Pros:-Traditional RTS gameplay which consist of base building, economic management and fighting.-Variation of units and the very distinctive factions not a clone of each others or just a change in skins.-Each races have different advantages/disadvantages in resources gathering i.e. Humans can do husbandry and collect foods from fatten animals, Eleves instead gather food from picking fruits and let their deer generating supply and lastly Orcs can only hunt wild beasts or breeded animals for food. There are also other resources, gold, wood and stone to manage and each factions have pros/cons. Don't worry though the resource gathering/its technologies upgrade is simplified and cleverly done to not interfere with your fun in mobilizing your troops. These resorces aspect also affect your play style for each races for instance, Elves can generate every resources infinitely from tree symbiosis, alchemy and exchange market. In contrast, Orcs have to find a substitute gold and sone mining in neutral areas.-Supporting various play styles i.e. turtle, rushing or rogue.-Zombies, when you leave  corpses both yours and enemy's unattended, they will become the walking dead. Each factions has different corpse sweepers which more or less affect the battle strategies.  -NPCs and creeps, it is very fun to hunt down a dragon for treasury(additional resources which currently incollectible) or kill orges or goblins for dominating forward base/small fort. -Orcs produce units differently from other factions. If you guys remember the game named Battle Realm a decade back, these orc's units production reminds me of that game. To elaborate, you have to train different types of units by moving them through different types of buildings. -Sieging stronghold, you have to break through both outer and inner walls before destroying the enemy HQ. You can command various siege units which are vary for each factions.-Quite steep learning curve which for me is a plus as i'm having fun trying diffrent things.-Dev is quite active in fixing bugs and adding contents.Cons:( i will list it down from the most annoying/serious problems)-Units controls are quite lifeless and a bit clunky, you won't get a feel that you have already ordered your units. -No hotkeys at the moment particularly ""attack move"" command which really destroy the fun. -A few bugs here and there which are mostly under Dev's attention.-Incomplete contentsImo, this game deserves much better attention than most AAA RTS game released this year. The game itself have everything you can imagine a very good RTS should have and i definitely won;t regret buying it at full price.			"

								I remember a few months ago, I had to get a refund for this game. I was unable to play it due to the INSANELY low framerate that was caused by no apparent reason. But after deciding to give this game another shot, the FPS issue is fixed. I don't know if it was because of some new PC specs or what, but I know it works amazingly now. It reminds me quite a bit of some of my favorite RTS's of all time, such as: Warcraft 3 (and frozen throne), the supreme commander series, and a few others. It may not be as good as those games, but with time I'm sure it can be. 7/10			"

												I've had this game for a while now watching it blossom into what it is. The game is cool I'll give it that with a great concept. My only issue with this game is I still cannot finish a game or control things that happen in mid to late game, it just lags way to much to be able to properly finish a match. I've never finished a single game against the AI, which by the way is not very good and I have not played against other people yet. The Dev's said that they fixed the lag issues with the latest patch, it helped but it is still a lag fest. I would not recommend this game title until they really do fix the lag issues. Imagine trying to play a match of starcraft of Age of Empires or Supreme commander forged alliance and you cannot get to your units abilities/battles and economy upgrades and tasking workers, by the time you get around to everything its way to late and you miss the action because everything is just slow and laggy. Come on Devs I've been wanting to finish a match in this game for a while now! I hope you guys do get it better! :)			"

												Game has some bugs. TrueGraphics are old/ ugly. TrueBut that does not mean that you cant have fun with the game.Also, I asked corection for 2 annoying bugs. Less that a week later, they were fixed. I dont know if this will aways be the case, but it was a really cool update from the Devs, that aways seems to want to listen to what the community has to say.Don't expect a ""Battle For Middle Earth 2"" kind of game here, but expect to have good fun planing sieges, and defending from them.

												First impression review- under 10 hours.Its basially the RTS ive been looking for and I started PC gaming with warcraft 2.the graphics are a little wierd. (hurts my eyes at first, squinting and whatnot. im using a 55"" TV and my glasses are scratched) but you get used to it and notice the GFX are decent.-edit-20 hours in... I think I left my game on... anyways. I get this feeling of Warcraft when playing. LIke warcraft 2 and 3 but a mix of age of empires and some TW... pretty cool.. This game currently has little lag for MP, from canada to au theres  ~ 0.1 second lag. not really a big deal. The huge battles make up for it. Orc for example has a pop of 80, and each 1 is 10 units I think..lol and you control 10 as a group.  Theres lots of upgrades and stuff like stances and formations that look really cool when you have 100+ units. They all level up and have personal upgrades too.This is made by a small dev team so if everyone could support them I think they will continue to improve this game and will make huge improvments each future game.plus free dlc/expansions. who does that? If you want TW but dont have the money or w/e and you can deal with less then AAA quality games then you should ppprobably get this.2nd edit-40 hours in. .. wow already? nice.. still enjoying it. need more players for sure. its a bit buggy.. random stuff.. UI disapearing.. building not spawning...Bunch of multiplayer games either end in desync, disconnects or crash.. but hey..TW games on sale... I really want to play them but I think..JUST PUNY HUMAN! ORC SMASH PESKY PEASANT!WH games on sale... but no sweet RTS building.Maybe I like it because my strat is unfair.. Rushing my orc archers at the start and using fire arrows to set my enemy on fire. Whist (while?lol) crippling his economy. Then spamming archers Ill soon have 500+ archers surrounding my enemies base setting everything ablaze. Your walls are futile. If you chase me ill run, if you get my archers ill change up my strat super quick, with one building I can change all my archers to polearm and bye bye calvary. If i need calvary my building is already built. since orcs eat their mounts., MMM lol. Not sure if it needs balancing or everyone is just new and cant handle the rush/spam. I wouldnt wanna be on the recieving end thats for sure. But really... archers autospawn for free.. literally cheap. Once they are going I have so much money to spare, while enemy cant even handle my cannon fodder ill be upgrading and spawning dragons and♥♥♥♥♥♥needs more players tho dangit, if you buy this feel free to add me, Ill go easy and teach you brosephs.*goods*+orcs,elves, humans  (talk about undead for expansion)+basebuilding+lots of units able to spawn+lots of unit types/upgrades/unlocks+can unlock the unlockable unlocks with singleplayer+zombies/ survival mode+seems to run decent performance wise.+map editor+custom games+++ active devs and mods*bads*-bugs crashes etc -missing little things... that I remember from old RTS games.. like lobbies, more game options... more user friendly friend system.-UI feels sluggish. at times I have to click again... its like the code for checking mouse input is on a fixedupdate or something.. I saw in the debug log about a input delay or something... not sure why they would add a delay so I will assume its not or its to help the game.-MP desync and some lag,-small user base means more SP.*Edit* 49 hours in... Honestly I have lost interest, I will try again if new content is added like they said. I still recommend it as that is more a review/rating for the game. For actually recommending it, I cant because I dont play it anymore because of player base and I am a very multiplayer oriented player, also some things bug me, like crashes, sluggish UI, and delayed unit responsegfx- 6.5fun factor- 8AI- 6.5campaign - Didnt play! id rather pwn newbs			"

								Hello, I would like to start off by saying that the developers and community managers are super friendly. They listen to the community on what they say and are working very hard in order to make a well balanced game and functional, yet fun RTS. This game has to be one of the most interesting and unique RTS's that I have played, and as a gamer that has played numerous RTS's can say with ease that this game has big potential. What I like about this game so far is that there is a crafting system that is enforced by simplying the game to further tech or enhancements.  The three races are currently, Orcs, Humans, and Elves. The game has a little bit of a learning curve and may hopefully be aidded by some simple tutorials or tip bubbles, however once the learning curve has been passed, the game opens up tremendously and is very fun. I rate this game currently 9/10 for the amount of content that is currently in game, however there are some small things that could be worked out. I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in RTS's or simply wants to have a fun game to play together with friends.			"

												I do like the MMO features in this game this is at least something new. Building up your faction and getting stronger with every game you win is cool.What I dont like are the tons of bugs and hard to play design. You can not have gates closing itself when enemies are in front of it and so on. It feels like you are micromanaging this whole castel yourself without any help. These developers should have played an RTS before building one. They took no learing from classics like Stronghold Crusader. The assets in this game look shady and the AI is so broken (e.g. there is a dragon on the map with a treasure, just shoot it with a bow - takes time but the dragon wont attack you). Every tiny thing in the game is half done and thats why the gameplay feels just annoying.			"

								This is a really great concept. The other reviews pretty much voer everything I could say about the pros and cons of this game, so this review is more of me asking players and maybe the developers a few things. A. What is the point of the ruined forts outside of my city? I have taken them over and I'm not sure what the glowing volcano looking thing does inside the fort, I can garrison the fort, but is that the only use for it?B. Is there any way to attack a city without your men turning into zombies and making it nearly impossible to siege the place? I always end up having to fight the enemy archers plus my own zombies, which seem to be way better at combat than even my best soldiers, wish they were that good alive.C. (To the developers.) Can you please add a feature that lets you remove zombies? I love the game but always end up having to stay hiding inside my walls because whenever I go on the offensive I end up creating a zombie horde that surrounds my city and then random zombies pop out of the ground, making it even more impossible for me to leave my city.All in all, really creative approach to an RTS, lots of upgrades and unit variety, great siege battling. Buggy as crap, not optimized, and really weird unit pathing/combat, but that will be fixed I'm sure.			"

								Hello,This game is really fun even if at this moment it is in Beta.It is a very good medieval warfare simulator. If you ever wanted to occupy a castle with Siege Towers, Catapults and Ladders at the same time your units create an open path through the enemy's defences.It receives a lot of updates and this shows me how much the developers really care about their game. I do not have a high end pc. I actually have a very old desktop and I can say that at start the game was not running for me, but now with the same settings I can play without problems.It still needs a few tweaks, but the game is 100% playable.10/10 Would recommend and teach my dog to play it with the Orcs!

Sure it´s in a fairly early stage of development. And probably it won´t be perfect at any time.But i would give it a try.

								when i played i was amazed even while the graphics look a bit old, like 2007 old but it has great potentialpros:- castle development is easy and fun even while you can't build walls yourself- good amount of unit types for human faction- nice tech tree system- units can also be upgraded which to me is pretty cool- gore is awesome- zombies resurrect after a while when most of the big battles are over which will try to invade you- has good developers that read your feadback and discuss the issue with youcons- crashes sometimes- graphics look a bit old for a game which get's released in 2015, but since it's still early access i can unserstand the low quallity for now- zombie models look awefull, some don't have arms in a way that it looks like a glitch- not enough maps and the ones that we got are the same maps with a different layout/texture- resources could be a bit more- some interaction with your friendly AI would be nice for teamwork- AI often already has everything unlocked so new players most likely can't propperly play singleplayer skirmish since they have just the starter stuff and so get annihilated- when owning 2 screens the cursor can leave the game to your second monitor and so create frustration as it makes your game crashi came back when the update got released mainly becouse i was playing multiplayer with friend, i was suprised to see all the efford the developer has done to fix the issues (which is why the cons list is shorter now)the game is now playeble and i noticed huge preformance improvements aswell, becouse i'm gratefull for the work the developer does i'm giving it a 7/10 now, the game looks really promising			"

								I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far. My only complaint is that the story mode is not complete yet but what is done was a real blast for anyone that likes fantasy RTS.Graphics are nice and upgraded from the original Kingdom Quest but could still use some work. From the max zoom out units can easily be lost in the back ground and behind objects while zoomed in figures appear a bit blocky and environmental objects are not scaled accurately to character size. However please remember I said this still looks better than Kingdom Wars 1 if you have seen it. If you have not please go try it, it’s another great game by the same people and amazingly fun for lovers of both RTS and RPG.Game ran smoothly for the most part with occasional jerkiness when I simple had the screen filled with more than 100 individual troops but I did have one unknown random crash while the game was loading. This only happened once and I have not been able to duplicate.All in all I can’t wait for the final product.Game played on a 3.3 Intel Xeon Processor, 8GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 960 4GB, Samsung 512GB SSD.

								Pretty neat game now! With latest Beta patch this game runs pretty well.Game itself does need abit more work as i seem very limited to what i can do for a game like this.Its not bad though atm but hope the Early Beta does not mean a halt for more content in game! Feels like I am missing alot compared to other games in this genre, But I played Warcraft 1, 2, 3, also Starcrafts and C&C alot so maybe I ask too much but It feels quite raw still and is not a finished game.But I have to give this a positive review because the devs done great work improving the performance issues they did have and the devs (Konstantine) actually followed up on my initial negative review to help me out which is considered good customer support in my opinion. So there is def. potential in this game lets hope it gets there :)			"

								This is an early access review so take it with a grain of salt.I really enjoy this game for a multitude of reasons.One of those reasons is the addition of zombies as a game mechanic in the game. It is something that isnt done in the RTS genre, and it really opens up different avenues of strategy in taking down the enemy base. Another consequence of this game mechanic is that it forces you to make sure that you have enough troops when exploring or else you will be overrun by your -former- soldiers as they die off.There are many other reasons why this game is great but they are commonplace in the RTS genre.Now, for the reasons why this game sometimes annoys me.- You need to unlock the tech tree for each race individually using items and other things found during your campaigns. This makes it feel grindey just trying to get the tech.- There are a multitude of bugs such as units getting stuck and units not following orders- Siege rams are way too op right now. I shouldnt be able to take down three gates with a single ram against a fully defended castleHowever, despite these cons (most of which can be fixed by either game balancing or bug fixing) this game is a definite buy.

But the fun to be hade is endless, the crafting, the battles it self, this is great for those people looking for a change in the normal RTS genre. You have to clean up the dead bodies after a battle, or they have a chance to turn into zombies, that are powerful, and a pain (yet super fun) to deal with. I bought this game for me and my friend and we have nothing bad to say at all. Free expansions, a dedicated dev, and already a lot of fun to be had in this game. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????

												Okay, so I tried the game today. Graphics wise: I would score it at 5 out of 10 at max settings (could be better if sprites and textures enhanced), Overall Units Voice Acting: (I don't normally score this but, I think it could get better. Not that bad, just needs a little more) So, I give it a 4 out of 10. Story and lore: 7.5 out of 10finally gameplay (Campaign) 6 out of 10. Overall it's a nice game with some great potential. What I didn't like so far is the random game crash, like in the campaign mode. The SlowMo Feature for the game to slow down when multi-tasking is a bit too slow or too fast depending on who is playing. I would suggest having a game speed toggle to have it at 4 different speed levels which can be toggled at anytime just like slowMo Mode.The Flash fade in or fade out effect in story mode does hurt the eye. It was not just me who complained about it but friends who I invited to try the game out. Overall, I was beginning to enjoy the game when another crash happened during the 3rd human mission after the orc attack. I just hope this game has autosaves on some sections. But well, that's my review for now and I will post more as soon as I get some more hours-in-game.My scores are my opinion about that game so far, may change in the future but I'll be glad to hear your score and let me know. P.s. I'm just evaluating this from a Campaign story mode view for now. Overall I would still say it's a good game to try if you love RTS, Tower Defense and some good storyline. Think of Strongholds with a twist.Note: Gameplay would be scored so much higher if it doesn't have random crashes and If there was A WAY TO SAVE THE GAME in a middle of the campaign. Don't even make checkpoints as excuses. Not everyone has the luxury of time to play a two hour campaign then sudden something got messed up or your game crashes leading you to start all over. :(			"

Great RTS. only issues are some minor bigs like lag and occassional unresponsiveness to commands, but this game is early access. if you were a fan of the Lord of the rings: Battle for middle earth games, jump on this. there are little to no games out now that fill the niche that this one does!

								Its better than KW1. Improved graphics, better AI, zombies, better UI, Better everything infact... But theres lag. Lots and lots of lag. You can be playing at 40 frames one minute, then have a random lag spike that lasts for 30 seconds. Still, a good game though.			"

												Kingdom Wars 2 is an exciting and innovative RTS game that introduces tower defense and enemy siege aspects along with army building, resource collection, and upgrades.  However the game's user interface is clunky, control groups, hotkeys, unit ai, and being unable to save in 2-4 hour missions, where failure means a level restart bring the game down.			"

												Kingdom Wars 2 is an excellent game and has provided me with many hours of enjoyment just from playing the campaign alone. It runs without problem in 4K with everything but shadows maxxed out, in spite of many units and animations taking place at any one time. It is very competitively priced as well. For me, a key strength of the game is the interesting storyline, which takes several unexpected turns along the way. The injection of zombies is an unforeseen ""X factor"" in the game and is a delightful twist. Graphics and animations are well done, detailed and suitable for for the races and monsters. The makers have chosen a slightly more painterly color palette over the usual choice of ""herioc primary colors"", which is much more appropriate for dysmal muddy, filthy and downtrodden depressed mood of these imagined medieval times. To me, the game feels mostly like a great book that is very hard to put down again and I am recommending it to everyone who is a fan of the genre.  "

Early Access Review
								I had fun playing through Kingdom Wars 2: Battles, and am far from finished with it. But here’s what I’ve come up with from what I’ve done so far.I really enjoyed the theme of this game, letting the player slowly build up their own kingdom as protection from a siege. There are added challenges, such as food and materials, that you need to gather in order to be able to upgrade your buildings. There are very good tutorials to get you started on all the basics, and the game is laid out nicely enough that you don’t get confused with what you’re doing. Once you pass the initial teaching stage of the game, it’s onwards to limitless other parts of the game. If you finish with majority of the game, there’s even a steady stream of updates being released all the time.Pros:Great themeHigh quality graphicsAttention to detailConstant updatesFun multiplayerAwesome background musicHigh level of customizationLow priceSteam achievements and trading cardsLevel editorCons:Could get laggy at times (maybe just my computer)There was in-game rain quite often and grew annoyingCan get tiring after more than two hours at onceBut overall, it was a fun game to play, and a must have for fans of this kind of game. I will definitely be doing more playing in the future. "

												Hands down, best strategy game I´ve ever played or seen. It is quite similar to Battle For Middle-Earth II, except this game has more realistic battle mechanics, especially archers - in this game, they are not OP, and you have no chance of succeeding in any battle with archers only. They do make a very useful support though - so, just like they did in actual historical warfare. One of the things that make this game stand out so much, is how amazingly detailed, scrupulous, and complex its siege mechanics are - there are ladders, belfrys, trebuchets, battering rams, mantlets, and many more contraptions and techniques in which you can break down your enemy´s walls, breach them, or bypass them. On the other hand, you can pour hot oil down from your battlements, or throw rocks, you can install catapults on them to help you defend, build high towers where you can place your archers for a tactical advantage, and more!I´m not going to lie - my first impression was a mix of confusion, disorientation, and frustration. This game is complex, hard to understand at first, and certainly can pose an intellectual and strategic challenge. And I love that. Once you understand how economy works in this game, and get used to controlling your troops, this game will show itself in its entire greatness.There are zombies, dragons, mages, mighty heroes, as well as countless other, less fantasy-esque units and foes. You can build a vast army, that will storm your enemy´s city and lay waste to it, or you can level up a few heroes, supported by a mage, who wreaks havoc with his powerful spells, and try taking the entire city on with just a few mighty individuals, much like in Battle For Middle-Earth.This game is absolutely worth its cost, not just the money, the time spent playing, the initial confusion, the effort you put in learning to play this game, all of it.

								Battles shows much promise in the coming months, the developers are releasing patches every few days and look to the commuity for what to do next. Bugfixes are plenty, and major bugs (which sometimes come with new content) are fixed quickly. Battles sees much more development and interaction from the development team with the community than most other titles I've played. Despite the small team, they accomplish so much in a week. I look forward to seeing the community grow through early access and seeing the game develop into the masterpiece it should be.			"

								There upon the edges of some ancient kingdom long lost to time, the settlers had staked their claim. A simple wooden palisade and a few buildings near rich deposits of stone and gold form the seed of what will grow to become a mighty city. Life is hard but the workers are harder, their lives, their future, and their hopes rest in them being able to survive. days go by and the people are exhausted but content for they are constructing their future, they are building not only a settlement but a legacy. As time passes scouts are sent to map the local area...most do not return. The wild is littered with ravenous packs of wolves and fortresses dot the landscape striking at any who venture too close. It has been decided, as the old mines run out and the stirring sense of adventure grows in the hearts of the settlers, it is time to claim their destiny. Armed and armored brave companies of soldiers ride out to meet those fell beasts. The hordes of teeth and claws fall before a volley of arrows and crash upon stalwart shields. The forts are besieged and the defenders rush out to defeat the brave warriors, but they to fall to the mace. As the soldiers break open the gate they swarm over fortress slaying the brigands and cutthroats. At the end of the day, when the banner of the new kingdom flew from the tower the settlers knew they had the grace of the gods. Word spread to the now mighty kingdom of an ancient elvish city in the far north, recluses who killed any who approached their gates. The people of the kingdom knew that this new foe would be a hindrance to any further growth, they too must be eradicated, such was the divine will. For months men trained to become the soldiers, the swords and shields that would claim the Kingdom's right to rule. Upon the field they assembled a legion of shields and steel... to the north they marched... to their destiny.10.1/10 would write inspired fan fiction again			"

								Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is probably the most unique and entertaining medieval RTS I have played in a really long time. The developers have continued to do a fantastic job of making changes big and  small  through communication with the players in the forums, as well as there own creative expertise, and its going to be a really really fun game when its all said and done. The graphics as of now are not the best, BUT its running on DX9 and it will be running on DX11 in the future, and it will look really good! Any complaints about no AI for the AI :p sound they like they are gonna dealt with in this next lineup of pathces and updates. All in all the zombies are a really fun addition to the battlefield, and seeing them wander around and do there thing is pretty cool, and alot of people bash them, but they add a whole different strategy to the game! you can lead a horde to the enemies gates and watch it attack the front gates and mob in through the mangles doors! Or my personal favorite: building a huge army and just charging over the walls and getting wiped out, but doing enough damage to let the corpses rot, and then wake up and start burning there town down from the inside! Honestly my only qualm so far is the peasents! They are SO stupid lol, and when you're playing against AI players that sit in there fortress its one thing, But I can imagine it would be very frustrating being in the middle of multiplyer game and all of the sudden have to divert all of your attention to stopping your peasents from being slaughtered in droves by a dragon, or the zombie hordes, or a HUGE pack of wolves for some reason, because they got bored doing what you wanted them to do. I really recommend this game to anyone that likes fantasy RTS games or wants to try something very unique and they like zombies, and/or knights hacking zombies to bits! There are alot of unique features and its definitely worth picking up.			"

								A review huh?Out of respect for the developers I will write one,Now KW2 is a great game, some may not agree because it is an ""Unfinished game"". But as a player who has joined many of these said same games, I cannot stress how different this one is. The developers are EXTREMELY ACTIVE! Don't believe me? Look on the forums and click a random topic and you will see how.Now I remember when this game was first launced and how buggy it was, haha those who are vets know what I am talking about and all the glitches we all used to take advantage of. But the thing is, all the people in the player base post on the forums explaining in detail about these same bugs. Depending on how bad it affects gameplay depends on how much priority the developers give to fix it. When I say priority I mean those with a huge effect, developers try to fix it with the next patch, Those with low priority get fixed within a few weeks. Now those of us who were here since beginning had fun PVP and with campaign, but the game changers that EVERYONE mostly LOVES was the zombie feature. Haha I cannot tell you all how much fun I personally had in matches online with the zombies. The times in a FFA where 4 players are going head to head trying their all to take one another out, but alas due to all the deaths and carnage in the midst of the ruined battlefields undead would arise. Now in the beginning this was a major issue, personally I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED IT!!!!!!!! Nothing more thrilling than that first player finally getting his base destroyed by your forces and wondering how the other 2 players are doing in their battle. Just as you are finishing up mopping uphis building in his base and of course handling the undead that appeared during your battle. As you are taking it all in you see either your base or the rear of your units taking damage. seeing it is a few steady stream of undead coming from the other 2 players side of the map. You cannot help but notice that the stream is getting larger and larger slowly forming into a horde, thus you must reorganize your troops before they die and add to the already large undead horde. Only once that you FINALLY (Ya those of you that had been in that situation know what I mean when you finally get them under control like an infestation) get the undead under control you decide to send a scout to see how the others are doing because these undead came from their end. Only to discover a massive horde beseiging both of their bases and them fighting for their lives against the AI. Ahhhhh haha I will never forget those beautiful games where all players put aside their differences of humans, orks, or elves and team up to exterminate the undead on the map before they completely take us all out.Those were proud memories I have of this game, memories that years from now as I get older I can talki video games to others my age or younger and tell them of a game that I really and honestly had alot of fun playing. Kind of like I do with Age of empires from when I was kid.Zombies now are a joke from what they used to be, they do not give that rush of a feeling but i guess in some instances it is possible to get that horde feeling even if it is just for a few minutes.-Wanderer			"

												Kingdom Wars 2 review.In all honesty, this game has been extremely fun to play with my Friend, and even the solo campaign is quite fun. It's got a unique twist on RTS, it's largely defence/siege orientated, meaning that you get to build a massive citadel and fill the walls with archers! rain death upon your foes as they attack, but be careful! too much blood and death can spawn Zombies, and boy. The zombies? They keep coming, so you better be on top of them. Plus Dwarves! (although not playable, you can still get them.) Anyhow, enough of that stuff, let's hit the pro's and con's.The Pro's:+Good sound track+Enjoyable community and Dev's+Combat is fun+Build an unbreakable fortress+In depth Tech Trees and a nice Card System to assist you in the game.+Both of the above require crafting, and crafting is pretty easy in this.+You get ingredients from playing a game, win OR lose.+Nice art for loading screensThe Con's:-The graphics are somewhat outdated, but that is fine! it's a nice classical feel I say.-Not a huge selection of maps, but again this is fine as it is still fun!Overall I rate this game a 9.5/10 and highly recommend this to anyone interested. Definitely worth the buy, and most certainly something to keep you coming back! I strongly urge you to support the devs.			"

												Okay. Maybe I was drunk on eggnog last christmas or something, I was way too kind to this game.Don't buy, not even on sale, not for now. I'll set your expectations:Pros: Good music and responsesConcept is interesting, at least, as you are encouraged to loot corpses lest they become zombiesOrcs, elves, humans play differentlyThe fun stops there.Cons:Lag and crashes. Read the Community Hub, where great gaming PCs stutter at 3fps for a game that doesn't seem to need bloom, anti-aliasing, or whatnot. Having thousands of units isn't an excuse, as older games handle squads and that many units without lag. That oldergame is BfME2, which is my next point:Game system feels like a clone of BfME2 that lost its polish. Levelling up structures, the cavalry infantry archer triangle, unit experience, heroes, all feel familiar but poorly executed.Tech and cards. By face value, cards are basically ""choose your God Power"" a la AoM. Because of the rarity of certain resources, you can get hit by someone with a free Hydra in multiplayer because he has that card, you don't have a counter. Tech runs into the same problem that AoE3 had: AoE3 was a great game, but having to play a hundred games while not yet unlocking all the good/necesary cards to WIN just to level up a Home city isn't fun, doing it for all other civs is a chore. For this game, it's a bit simpler, but it's still a chore to have to run at least 10 Skirmish games to unlock MOST of what a race can have. Now, some hope. Devs do respond, mostly. They update the game frequently, about once a month. They have a nice concept, and players appreciate it. It's not worth your dollars right now, and not even when it is on sale. When it does, I'll be among the first to sing its praises.			"

								This game awesome by far the best strategy game i ever played because it is 3 of the best strategies mixed into one game.Lord of The Rings,Warcraft 3 and Age of Empires.It is still early access and love the trading cards.Above all this you can make a guild with your friends and also the zombies are a bit OP when you had a huge battle and they spawn in front of your base.Buy this game if you like strategy games!!

												This game is easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of rts.  Is difficult as ♥♥♥♥ and the first time you open the game the loading screen is soo slow! But if you are patient you can play this game... have good music, the voice actors are good too and the controls isn't complicated... but if you wanna play the campaign you have to put effort on it, maybe the graphics isn't the best, but for an indie game is well made!Congrats to the designers of this game <3			"

Gameplay is traditional strategy with ai npc zombies that roam and ♥♥♥♥ everyone up, however the game has a nice skill/techtree that is persistent and you level it up as you play games. More than worth the $15, especially now that they fixed all my gripes!			"

												Price excluded I think this game is great, price included it's a steal. Many people complaining haven't given the game a chance, the slomo button is almost the same as pausing the game, and there is a campaign that shows you how to play, so its not absurdly difficult... unless you play on hard lol. I don't have too many hours in the game yet but it'll only be increasing from here on out. There's a lot of variety to the game and its very similar to the stronghold games, just more fluid.			"

												I never got into the first one, so can't really compare the two, but I'm loving this game. As far as i'm concerned it's taken the crown off stronghold as best siege RTS. I was initialy dissapointed that you can't build walls wherever you want, but after some time playing I quite like that mechanic. It means you spend less time trying to line up walls and more time planning your defences and assaults. They've actually done a good job with the archers, where as in many RTS games they seel underpowered, in this game they can make a brilliant defence, and are something you have to seriously consider when looking to assault an enemy stronghold. I also like the unlock system. It adds a sense of progression to the game outside the campaign, and gives you something fun to try out after every few games. And the zombies are also a brilliant addition. I know zombies have been done to death, but never on this scale in a siege RTS. It's a cool little modifier in regular matches, giving you a reason to clear up corpses and making large battle sites a threat, and the zombie survival mode is great fun, and a different sort of challenge. Nothing beats loading up your walls full of archers with fire arrows :D			"

												Created a Battle; Humans Vs OrcsHour 1:All seems well. My peasants are happily gathering materials such as stone, gold and food. I have captured a orc outpost, and have found some gold caches guarded by wolves. I made a stone wall around my castle, some turrets have mounted trebuchets on them.Hour 2: The Orcs have attacked me. I destroyed their siege equipment, and now my archers are slaughtering them by the droves. The Orcs have retaken their outpost, which is located close to my base. In both skirmishes i have lost a good amount of men.Hour 3:*hear moans* huh, thats some pretty bad orc audio. From the battlegrounds dead orcs and humans alike are rising from the dead. Undead ogres start to appear out of the fog of war.Hour 3.5:I have rung the bell of war. All peasants are now inside my base. All battalions are recalled, and everyone man, women and child armed to the teeth. My palisade wall is gone, and with it some of my hope. Zombies have come from everywhere, my walls are being attacked as we speak. My barracks are pumping out pikemen and swordsman.Hour 4:My first gate has fallen. I have sustained heavy casualties, but i think I have managed to stem the flow of zombies. I feel hopeful.Hour 4.25:My last gate has fallen. All the hope we had felt quickly turned to horror as men we had fought along turned into zombies.Their corpses re-animated. By making more men to defend against the zombies, we have simply given them more soldiers. I have lost contact with the orcs, I feel that they too are in a dire situation.Hour 4.5:This is the last entry, I have a small ring of pikemen keeping the zombies at bay. One by one they are falling, my wizard is exhausted, his spells have long been used up. He quickly stumbles, and is killed by the zombies. The castle is lost, overrun by the undead.			"

Having spent a fair bit of time with it, I’m happy to say that, despite a few flaws, this is a pretty enjoyable game, with a decent story, some OK voice acting and graphics that, while not spectacular, look pretty good, even on lower settings.I've received an email today, that says a new free expansion is being released on may 16th, and really looking forward to it.I have a few total war games in my library, but in my opinion find this one much better and more rewarding to play.

												When I first saw Kingdom wars 2, I couldn't believe it. It had everything I like in a game. Theoretically. It has so much potential. So many good ideas. The resource/card system is cool and adds a ton of different strategies, and other than a few balance issues its fun to play all the races.This game is so good, it has the potential to be my favorite game of all time. But it falls short with tons of issues.I had terrible sync drops in which I would be playing with a friend in the same room and our units would not be in the same place on the map, or his base would be totally destroyed but on my screen it looked perfectly tranquil. Game breaking glitches in which buildings that auto produce units, still continue to produce units after the buildings are destroyed making it impossible to get a strategic upperhand. It was so frustrating playing against my friend that plays orcs, and I harass and outplay him, but once his buildings are destroyed, they continue to make units and I could never make any ground.The zombie survival mode was fun, but after a few waves, my partner would always disconnect and drop from the game and so I end up just playing the rest out on my own anyway.The Campaign was the best part of the game, and thats not a good thing to say about this kind of game. The campaign should just be a tag-along to a fantastic online gaming experience.Overall, I would say this game is worth your time if you enjoy playing Real Time Strategy games. Or if you like building castles and armies and making your friends look dumb when you storm their weak and feeble peasants with knights or warg riders. I've had a great time with this game. I would have put more time into it if there was ever anyone but the one player that constantly beats me online.			"

												What a great game, the developers ideas for the game have been outstanding and they have done a wonderful job of achieving their goal. There are still a few minor problems but the dedicated team of developers are fast at responding and patching problems when they arise. The game has a variety of game play to satisfy everyone from single player campaigns and conflicts to full blown siege warfare to zombie survival modes. I would recommend this game to any person who loves to play RTS games. Congrats to the Devs they have outdone themselves once again.			"

								Pretty fun! KW2 is very similar to its predecessor which I have not played much, but i can say that this is much betteer than the first. It is fast paced and the community is always striving to make this better alongside with the devs.			"

								My review for Kingdom wars 2 will be short and sweat. I love the game! the only problem i found ai that some times units gets stuck on mountains and buildings, and the only way you can solfe the problem is by deleting the unit. secondly i would like to know if there will be an open world add on in the future like it was in Kingdom wars 1?  The freedome of an open world game is always welcome for strategy gamers. But in the end you might have someting better perhaps... its just a suggestion (pardon the english, not my first language)..			"

								I'll write a long review as soon as it's out of early access but even so I must totally recommend this game. It's still missing many features (like saving, but will be added very soon) and yet it makes you addicted. You notice that the Devs are putting a lot of efforts into this game and get the community involved.			"

												THIS IS NOT KINGDOM WARS 2, This is crap, was a fan of the firsta game, but it was buggy, and i guessed that ongoing support was unlikely, so i thought before i get too far into it, ill get the new one, and get into that, i read that players from 1 would be given crowns in 2, so i figured it would be the same but updated, IT ISNT, graphics are the same, hideous huge buttons on screen all the time, why do i need permamnent access to those things? unit selection, multi select is a joke,  select 10 units, and attack, only one moves, despite having 10 massive icons, saying that they are selected.  campaign has save points, WTF, i have to p[lay half way through per chapter to save? so i can play 10 sessions, that may or may not be conveniently timed with my actual life, then thats it.   i build a castle with bugger all resources around it in the shadow of, a castle! really? not imprerssed at all. i appreciate its a small team, but if youd have fixed the bugs in the 1st gam, you wouldnt have lost so many players, and this is just rehashing the old games graphics, for an irritating fixed format mess.  most people who play this type of game, want more control and more freedom, not less.  you took a giant leap backwards . I WANT A REFUND.			"

								Game is clearly in early phase of an Early Access, with many missing features and few issues and bugs, but it has big potential, and it reminds me a lot of golden ages of RTS games like AOE 2 etc.For now, there's only one episode on SP campaing, but story behind it is pretty good and I like it a lot. Community seems to be nice and mature, and you will find always find someone to fight in skirmish battles.			"

												My 2 friends and I bought the game to play cooperatively, here's what we found out.Co-op mode is 2 players only. Survival mode is also 2 players only.That leaves multiplayer mode, which unfortunately is 4 max players, so that leaves room for 1 A.I. opponent. Which would be fine if the Hard A.I. was any good, but it's not competent at all.Connectivity is very junky, my friends could see my game, I couldn't see their's. Also Join Game via Steam is not possible.Our first game was a Total Annihilation victory conditon, which we coudln't complete despite destroying the enemy's main base, because some buildings couldn't fall below 1 HP. We couldn't deploy trebuchets because none of us had the required tech (which you unlock at the main menu) to build them, maybe thats why those buildings wouldn't fall, still very silly mechanic.We experienced heavy lag issues during gameplay at random times, the framerate would get choppy for a dozen of seconds and then it would go away. I suppose it's better than desyncing, but still..The biggest flaw in this game IMO is the terrible unintuitive UI. From a serious lack of shortcuts, to missing common features that you expect to find in any modern RTS (like when you want to add a unit to a group by selecting the unit and then shift+1 to add it to group 1, that doesn't work here), to frustrating moments when you can't find where your units are because: a) Center on unit doesn't prorperly work in some cases, especially on grouped units the camera goes all over the place.b) No messages at all of what is happening to your units, if they are under attack, out of stamina, low on health, where are they, what militay units are idle, you are oblivious to what is happening around the map if you are not looking around all the time. c) The minimap is just BAD. Some colors are hard to see, flare is always off from where you clicked, it's just useless.Also If a unit is engaged in battle, good luck retreating it. Some of them run properly, but the ones that are closer to enemy units, you literally have to fight against their suicide will by spamming the right click mouse button until they (hopefully) get to your base.Finally, from the 2 multiplayer games we played, we encountered some bugs, one of them was a very obvious one: 3 units from a larger group suddenly were stuck on a hill where there was no path to it (was pretty funny when it happened though).From my experience this game lacks some serious standard RTS features, needs a UI rework, better A.I. and tactical unit behaviour. It would also benefit from bigger maps with more opponents (4 players is too low c'mon) and a rework of the Survival mode to allow more players to enjoy some zombie horde slaying. Honestly most of the positive reviews here were misleading to say the least, whereas the few negatives were spot on.			"

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers. Kingdom Wars 2: Battles review Graphics KW2 has some very impressive graphics that sadly require one meaty boss of a computer to even go on medium settings. However the game's still beautiful even on the very low settings. So all that it would take is some improved optimisation to make the game more playable. I can play 99% of games on maxed out setting, but this game only runs on 25fps, so that will make KW2 to lose a few points. Apart from poor optimisation, the game is a masterpiece, no questions needed. Although you don't always get to just stare at this work ofart for too long as there is always action to be seen. Gameplay This game is like the Total War series (the good games of the series), Clash of Clans (for a giant amount of things you can build) and Company of Hereos had a marvelous baby. You can build tons of different thigns (each race has different buildings), there's a campaign mode, a gigantic variety of classes (every race has different classes), different ways to gather up resources (races have different ways to get them), different advantages and disadvantages throughout the races, multiplayer, singleplayer, and so, so much more content. So to tum this topic up, if you like a lot of content in a game, this is will fullfil your expectation even more than you could wish for it to. Races There's currently 3 classes. Humans, Orcs and Elves. Humans are the most basic class (and the most boring)... why would you want to choose them? Well, maybe if you're new to the game you will choose them. The second class is Orcs, just as you might think, some really cool guys who are violent, much like the Vikings but in a beast form. Last but not least, there's Elves! These guys might look boring, but if you play as them, you'll know how powerful they are. They can technically have never ending resources with only a bit of work. Also, they have unicorns... fantastic game 10/10 - Wolff. So hopefully in the future we'll either see some workshop content or more races such as... uh... something. Building Think of Sid Meiers' game series and Rome: Total War 2s' mechanics inside of one masterpiece. As already mentioned from my description, this game has an excellent style of building. There's tons of buildings, upgrades, walls, and a bunch more items that you, the player, can use to either an advantage or disadvantage. As you can build, the opposition can do the same. And if you can attack, you can destory. Does that give you a hint? Yes, you can invade others settlement and completely destroy it. After that, you can do an even more horrible thing and loot the townsfolk that you have just slaughtered for different loot. Pros vs Cons Pros:In depth buildingGraphics are jaw-droppingVery funUnlike other gamesTech tree'sSingleplayerMultiplayerCampaign modeRacesClassesUpgrades Cons:Very poor optimizationBuggy (this should be an excpetion since it's Early Acces, but there's too much bugs) Overall score 8/10 - Even with lots of bugs and bad optimization, it's still an excellent game.

								The game has a lot of potential. Still needs a lot of work, I had to post via review because the chat box wouldn't allow me to converse back with developers, during gameplay.  I got the game because it stated, it would have a coop option, but unfortunately, that option isn't there yet. I wish I had more freedom with the maps, unit color freedom, and it seems that regardless of what map you pick, you're still pretty much in the same spot (single-player mode) ....you can branch out to other parts but don't have the ability to restructure as you would in AOE. When clicking on ""idle workers icon"" it will highlight them, but doesn't seem to take you to them, so unless you are on top of area, you won't see the highlights....causing me to have to hover over wherever i see my color, in order to hopefully see highlighed workers. I did like how the workers came out in batches.  Aside from the lack of player freedom on the map....I have to give it two thumbs up for design. There is a lot of creativity and I love that there are a lot of building elements not found in other strategy games. For example, the ability to have troops utilize the watch towers.  Conclusion, this game has tremendous potential, and I was very pleased with the creativity that went into it. I will just practice patience and see what comes of it.			"

												Good concept, Quite buggy and some responsiveness issues with unit commands but active feedback from the devs. - Gates reopen upon upgrading allowing the enemy horde to storm your castle. (Can be Quite Gamebreaking depending on he size of the horde attacking.) (Not sure if this has been fixed yet or not, just played recently to check on the responsivness of the unit commands is all.)- Have to re-issue same commands multiple times for the desired effects. Right clicking moves camera and does not issue command responsively. (Can be Gamebreaking to some.)- Takes up to 5 seconds for commands to even register sometimes. This title still needs work and polish so I advise reading other comments and reviews and also watching videos on gameplay and technical issues that are still noticeable to see if they are tolerable enough to warrant a purchase or not.

												I'm not going to complain about the graphics; they are more or less what is advertised in the screenshots. Dated, yes, but marginally improved over KW 1.I initially gave this game a thumbs-down, citing it was unpolished, buggy, and generally a mess. Matches were unwinnable, in a number of ways. Content was limited, maps were few in number, and the primary game mode was a half-finished survival style of game.I'm happy to say the game has been significantly improved since then. Yes, it's still a bit ugly (perhaps more specifically dated looking), has a clunky UI, and seems to ignore mouseclicks every so often. What it does do is provide an enjoyable gaming experience, within the very specific realm of a survival style siege defense game. The competitive multiplayer I haven't played much, but judging by comments, continues to go in the sort of balance circles we've become familiar with in recent years. (Rock OP, Paper is fine. -Scissors.) I don't consider the patches and fixes they've released for free to be a glorious gift, full of exciting new content, but they are still patches and fixes, a sign that the developers are committed to continuously improving and expanding the game. Kingdom Wars: Battles has always been a game for a specific nice sort of player, looking for a particular experience. However, it's gone from being a lousy way to fill that niche to being a satisfying and enjoyable one.			"

												Kingdom Wars 2 provides a brutal but satisfying RTS with a campaign that will carefully beat into your head the importance of slow, careful preparation. Fittingly for a game set in a medieval world, the elaborate fortifications that sprawl across key points of the map are crucial when it comes to holding and expanding your territory, and building up proper defenses first and foremost, both in campaign and multiplayer. Watching a ramshackle palisade grow, bit by bit, into a proper stone castle manned by hundreds of archers and swordsmen never gets old, along with seeing the enemy break on it.Additionally, the three races within the game all manage to be unique in both mechanics, playstyle, and design. The Humans are the most ""standard"" faction, training troops from buildings and taking resources from the map. Their workers are fragile, their units work wonderfully together, and their defenses are incredibly strong.The Orcs automatically spawn workers from their buildings, which are then sent through ""training"" to become stronger units. Their defenses are lacking, but their troops are strong, with their workers able to fight at range and in melee both, serving as their basic infantry.Elves are an interesting case, having one of the strongest economies, but otherwise unremarkable defenses and soldiers. The ability of the elves to spend money to make more money, without having to send their workers outside their defenses, is quite powerful, and allows them to build up massively if given the chance. Their greatest strength is their ""monstrous"" units-massive ents, for example.The Undead, fittingly, completely change the game once they show up. In Skirmish and Campaign both, they seemingly come across as a minor creep faction that can be dealt with easily, until they swarm you in the aftermath of a major battle and you realize every single corpse can and will become another enemy. Relying on the day and night cycle to combat their spread is crucial, before they turn into an existential threat.Lastly, while the graphics are seemingly lackluster, they serve well enough and allow the game to throw together truly massive battles with troops in the tens of thousands, with the only limitation being how big you are willing to make your army.

												As some mention, very rough along the edges,first few minutes I felt it like was a ripoff, then after a few more minutes of enjoyable fun,I didn't care so much.After have almost completed wave 7 in zombie mode, I'm exited as ever, and am sure it will stay that way, once we get rid of having to give units doubble commands and the units does as they are told.Also, whats up with the UI pre-XP look? That said, you get a finger up.Been looking for something like this for ages, and even though its a tried tested and true genre,adding just a little zombie and fantacy into the mix, kind of spices it up just enough to balance out the rather basic graphics. (sorry, they are basic, anno 2015-6 here) "

												So far i have really enjoyed this game. Kingdom Wars 2 is a little rough around the edges but the gameplay is still immensly enjoyable. I recommend it, however as i stated earier the game lacks polish but the devs seem extremely active. Also, the zombies are a nice touch.			"

												The developers have added a lot of content since when I first bought it, which was awhile ago. As a player of RTS style games for many years now, I can safely say this is one of the greatest indie RTS games I have played. In fact it is a solid RTS, for the price, and I haven't really seen anything that was comparable.It features:Progressive Gameplay; I.e. upgrade talent tree that is outside of the actual battles. You gain loot and such, then spend it to gain benefits, such as a knight, or spearman, buildings, etc.Common RTS elements and uncommon RTS elements, all that are good. Base building, troops, management of resources. Uncommon includes choosing to grow chickens vs pigs, to send a cart or not, where to build a farm, how to use the resources. Do I use the wood for this or that, what do I use the stone for, the gold for, do I use food for peasants or soldiers? Each match (this was awhile ago, sorry if review is outdated), plays out with a strong tactical gameplay set AND elements normally limited to turn based games. The maps are fair sized, and there are plenty of objects to go for. Want more gold, get a cart, some peasants, and send them out to mine. You may need to station soldiers nearby to protect them from enemies, including the undead.Speaking of the fallen, things that die have a tendency to, well, come back to kill you. If things are left unlooted, which must be done by peasants, they will come back and be an annoyance. At first this seems trivial, but can be abused to cause injury to your foes. Raid the neutral camp near your enemy's base early into the game with a medium sized force. This way if your troops succeed, a large dead force will strike at their peasants and fort, and if not hopefully many die, and the same result may happen to your foe.Neutral camps, the enemies vary, usually protect resources that you need in order to survive and expand, and are worth looking into.The game is somewhat complex, and has bugs, but is definitely worth the investment.

Game's InformationGenre: Indie, Simulation, StrategyDeveloper: Reverie World Studios, INC Publisher: Reverie World Studios, INC Release Date: 5 Mar, 2016IntroductionKWB2 has greatly outdone itself in portraying this game into giving users the feeling of being directly part of the game. It brings us back into time during the viking ages that makes me just want to attend cosplays for these. KWB2 offers Single & Multiplayer modes, making the game ever lasting. The Dev team has only four members working on the game and they work hard as they listen to the player's suggestions, despite this not being a game genre I would play, it certainly did made me addicted and wanting to spend hours continuously managing my units. GraphicsIt has outstanding graphics and the animations done has greatly displayed it's quality development by the developers of the game. I was greeted by the loading screen which grabbed most of my attention, giving me the anticipation of how action packed the game would be.GameplayUpon the start, I explored the campaign mode. It mainly focuses on humans battling against the orcs. Each level is told with a backstory which gives more meaning to the battle, making us more encouraged into winning the battles. I tried multiplayer mode for a short while and found it rather the star attraction of this game. It gives the opportunity to replay the game once they've completed campaigns modes, which never lets the game die down. I tend to get entertained by the not so professional players causing mistakes in the game as well. It comes with a Single player mode where you can run in your own adventures or do survival modes. I've yet to tried out Single player hence I wouldn't be able to run a brief overview of the game.ProsGives a acient feelingRuns on multiplayer, increasing the replay valueFantastic graphicsGreat audio and musicInteresting backstoriesConsWhen opening my overlay, the game crashed (several times)Some lag issues, possibly my PC being a potato on startupAudio being broken during startup (Due to the lag)I would strongly recommend KWB2. Some plus benefits is it having trading card and achievements to keep a person coming back for more. With a hands-on development team regularly updating the game, this title is a great addition to any library. Get it today to stop missing out the fun.			"

								I'm not usually into these types of games but this one was quite interesting for me. It reminded me alot of an old game I used to play called Lords of the Realm 2. Of course, this has much better graphics and way more options. I only played the episodes a little although it was tough for me to get into. I didn't think it was fair to play a multiplayer match with someone when I didn't fully understand what I was doing. Playing the episodes kind of acts as a tutorial of sorts. I would fully recommend playing through these before diving into the game. I did receive a few invites to play multiplayer games when I logged in which shows there is a decent player base. I will try to update this review when I have played with the multiplayer a little more.			"

Gameplay is very in depth and I think it will take me quite some time to get to grips with the finer details of the game.So far I've played one of the single player mission a couple of times. Liking the story quite a bit as you play from multiple perspectivesFor the price I would recommend getting it if you are into these kinda games.I have ran into a couple of minor bugs to do with sound, but thats to be expected in an early access game and besides these minor bugs which dont effect gameplay at all the game runs quite well!

It already delivers on much of what they promise, again, unlike other alphas. If there was one thing I wanted, it was more single player story, loooooove a good story. But it looks like they're already planning on more single player missions. Can't wait to see the final version!			"

Posted: August 22, 2016
												So I am going to go on a whim and write this review purely on opinion and not on gameplay. Firstly, there are two main grouped sub-categories of people who will like this:1) Medieval/RTS fans will find this game unique, and kind of follows a old-school style of play where you primarily build up your base in one main location. If you like the Medieval/Fantasy theme that is also a bonus2) Players who can get over polish and odd textures. Yes, this game feels a little ""clunky"" but since this a review I have to be real, the game is still a little clunckly. But the interface and fantasy animation effects are only a means to an end, and that the game does require more polish. The animation for some units especially when they are attacking or mining a resources looks terrible, it just doesn't look right nor professional. However, since I've played a large variety of games, I've learned to ignore those visual effects and focus on the gameplay itself. Gameplay: So the reason I am giving this a thumbs up review is because I feel like this game does bring something unique to the table, it's a real-time base-building/ siege simulating strategy game that involves zombies. Now, that is quite creative as I don't play many medieval/fantasy games that involve zombies (well I guess if you play a lot of fantasy there is usually a necromancer, but nevermind that). Anyhow, the siege aspect of the game is very unique and I do feel like I am playing in the realm of some medieval world in how much preparation is needed to breach a wall. So here is where the cons come in, and this is very important because this list of 'bad aspects' of this game is what throws most people off when they first buy it (I bought it at the original price of 29.99$ on Steam despite numerous other sites that sell the key cheaply because I wanted to support the continued development of this game).1) At some point in time when playing this game, your going to get lag spikes, on some rigs it may never go away. The game engine seems to lack the integrity either to handle newer machines or it is just in general bad coding. I'm not an expert so I'll just leave it at that2)Again visuals and animations do not look fantastic, there is an endless amount of games I could list that have amazing visual effects for units in RTS games when it comes to mining, dying, spells, fighting, etc. etc. Kingdom Wars 2: Battles will need to desperately mend this problem if they wish to appeal to hard-core RTS fans since this is a major draw to the game is the pretty graphics, especially animation. It just looks sloppy and some of them look like they repeat a different action.3) Tech and boasts locked behind ""play wall"". So quite similar to a paywall where you pay real money to unlock certain tech and stuff in a free to play game, King Wars 2: Battles thought it would engage its playerbase by locking new tech and upgrades behind what I call a ""play wall"" during the main menu of the game. Meaning, you'll have to grind in this game via singleplayer, multiplayer, or whatever to gain gems, chests, or whatever resource in this game that could be only obtained from finishing a full match in this game. You can spend said resources on the main menu where there is myriad of unlocks for the three races presented in this game. Some people don't have time for this grind and it just puts you off because it feel force feed of ""yes we want you to play this game a very long time to get everything"" versus most RTS games put the tech and upgrades inside the game via a special building like a blacksmith, engineering bay, etc. But nope, not Kingdom Wars 2: Battles, they want to put a play wall instead of putting it inside the game where you unlock all these things inside the match like most RTS games do. 4) The zombies aspect is not fully fleshed out, and quite frankly it needs a lot of work. Sometimes it doesn't feel it's working right and at other times the AI for the zombies is just stupid. Like it feels they attack anything and anyone, they don't have really anything special about them. They just feel ""there"" and you can't direct them in any sort of way in the game. You would think since this is a kind of a reference to a fantasy/medieval type theme, the three races in this game would at least attempted some way to use the zombies as a weapon against their foes. Nope, instead they are just FFA type enemies that spawn after troops are killed in battle via your or the enemy side.5) UNITS: This is a big problem for me, I do not like the way each unit is grouped and bunched with each other. A lot of RTS has a unit spawn, say, a barracks one by one, and not in a group for a reason. In a RTS games, you will want to mix somme elements with another via drag and click and group them to hotkey in the form of 1 2 3 4 5. . . . . However, in Kingdom Wars 2: Battles all the units spawn in groups, so really when they are walking around your castle etc. they may get stuck, and in other times it is confusing when you are running a siege because  you just have all these globs everywhere. 6) Sieges and AI feel really bad. I mean sometimes the AI can attack you REALLY early, and sieges are really hard to manage. It just feels feels like a grind breaking down the enemies walls and fighting their army, and vice-versa once your base is invaded you pretty much lost.VERDICT: Yes I gave this game a thumbs up, but I did harshly criticize some of the design decisions of this game. King Wars 2: Battles does bring something new to the table and they took everything from a RTS game and completely took a different direction. It will heavily depend on whether or not the player can adapt to these changes. On a more positive note, the developers are constantly updating and supporting this game no matter how much flak it gets or how much people bicker and cry how about this game, they love this game like it is their baby, and I respect that. I also felt I had a valid reason for making these criticism since I did pay a premimum price for this title only to support them, and they did lower the base price to 18.99. However, I will praise this studio, they aren't giving up, and despite all the commotion and ""rioting"" they still struck on to mold this baby into the soon to come master-piece they envisioned. This game has come a long way, from early access, now to a full-released product, and they still say, were gonna work on this game and show everyone that were not going to stop until everyone is satisfied. I kid you not when I say a lot of other studios would have quit and thrown in the towel, probably put a premium price tag  on their game and disappear and years down the road suddenly release another game. I've seen studios who have done this, simply abandon one game and create aother one when the first few months look bleak, and often times their catalog of games always have the same mixed review rating because of vicious cycle. But not Reverie World Studios, INC. they stand by their product and look to truck away onwards and upwards until this game meets everyone expectation, and for that, I thank you, and say good luck.

								This game... I wish I could say good things about it I really do, but it's just bad. This is an impulse buy at its finest. The single player maps are just you with the NPC already having a base made and ready for attack (mind you it's not a campain map) My first playthrough went a little like this...Start out inside wooden walls, build a few villagers and tell them to gather the resources, basic stuff... But then it gets better; I build an archery range and buy some bowmen. There are a group of neutral ogres just chilling outside my base, so I use my bowmen (just made, lvl 1 no upgrades) to kill all 8 of them, just kited them around and thought ""well that was easy"" but then I scroll to the left a bit more and there are a **** ton of wolves atleast 300 of the damn things. Thought ""Maybe this will be harder"". (When have you ever know wolves to stay in a pack that big?) regardless... my bowmen wipe them out easy no problem (Still the same bowmen, lvl 1 no upgrades) so after my 20 bowmen wipe out 300 wolves, I decide to actually build my base. First attempt I build a mill, villagers get stuck inside and I have to delete them... After that I build a house, villagers get stuck again, delete them also....  Then I quit the game, just couldn't take it anymore, and proceeded to play Age of Empires.Pros:The devs seem nice I guess ++Exit button is easy to find... +++Cons:UI: Non existent UI (Only when the building is selected and its just an eye sore) --Units: all the same and walk like a bunch of dumb stiff♥♥♥♥♥♥♥---Tutorial: I said ""What?"" and ""Why am I doing this?"" too much... (They tie it into the story instead of trying to teach it was just way TOO MUCH) --Story: Orcs ♥♥♥♥ed everybody in the world and are suddenly stopped at the ""last"" human city? REALLY? (If you have free reign over the world you would NOT be stopped at a single city) --Graphics: I'm not a stickler for graphics, but seriously? IT LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS KINGDOM WARS 1 --These positive reviews are too misleading, I was hesitant to buy this game but they sold me into it. I should never have purchased this game and I would love a refund. I really, REALLY would...			"

												Good game with an interesting mixture of popular RPG mechanics. 3 diverse and fun to play factions, Humans which are your typical jack of all trades faction with good defense and offense but not the best at either. Elves which are your best defensive faction because of their self-sustaining economy and strong wall fortifications, also invisible archers which are a pain. Orcs which are supposedly good at rushing but it doesn't normally work out for me, thankfully the orcs are also a strong faction in mid game with powerful offensive units, I believe they are the only faction with non-siege units that are effective at breaking gates down (ogres and minotaurs). There are also 3 mercenary unit factions that are fun to play around with (Dwarves, Dragons and now Undead). The gameplay is fun as feels like a mixture of Age of Empires, Stronghold and other classic RTS games. Graphics are outdated but you get accustom to them in time, especially if you are an old-school RTS player. Be warned this isn't a game you should jump directly into multiplayer in, its highly advised you play at least some of the campaign missions and some skirmish games first. As their is a tech-tree system that requires different crafting components you use to invest in. I believe you start with a fair amount of crafting components now to research some of the tech tree but this is an important point because without the tech tree research, you will be at a large disadvantage in multiplayer and unable to build the majority of your units / upgrades.

												Due to the system of techs and cards which require resources you gain from playing and most likely losing, the best way to eventually win at this game is to intentionally lose repeatedly. Your AI opponents have access to all the good stuff right off the bat, but you're as helpless as a babe in the woods. You won't make it through the tortuous tutorial campaign unless you are the kind of person who loves being wide awake while the dentist laughs evilly while he drills on your morals, so you enter the game clueless. You haplessly build up a city thinking that you are doing all the right stuff and all of a sudden your opponent(s) have dragons ripping you a new anal orifice. Dragons? Where the f did they get dragons? I'm still trying to figure out how to mine more gold, you say to yourself.  This game is an incredible lesson in humility, because you cannot win without losing, a lot, first.My inner masochist gives this 10 thumbs up.			"

												This game has the nice concept of adding zombies into a RTS as an added treath to manage as you fight against your enemy. The greatest problems is that it fails on everything else. Here my Pro/Cons list.~Pros:∎ Zombies will rise from dead bodies, trying to kill everything comes near, they will siege castles and swarm and block some paths, requiring to add new strategies constantly as the battle on the field evolves;∎ Three factions with detailed and big unlock trees that makes possible to customize your army with different kind of units;∎ Survival mode: zombies will rise and attack you in waves, each wave bigger and stronger.~Cons:∎ Poor and low aestethically interface with a poor ""trade"" function (you can trade crafting materials with other players) where it's not that clear who is buying what and for how much. Luckily I didn't fall in that but have seen lots of people trying to exchange 'a golden palace for a few copper coins';∎ FPS drops even on high end computers (probably no problems on the last two models of nvidia) when you select units, leaving the game frustrating, most of the times unplayable;∎ Unit commands don't respond as they should, sometimes they don''t get the command giving you the sensation of them lagging because of the input, most of the times you have to double or even triple click;∎ Some units are cheap and letal, they allow you to stack different platoons of them together and bugabuse by clicking one command to decimate an entire army (noticed it with a spell that shuld only stun enemy units, not damage them), some heroes are ridicolously OP;∎ Dragon has a problem to attack enemy units, he doesn't react and when he does he ends up breathing a cone of flames where your unites are not, making very easy killing him with just a couple of archers;∎ Poor selection of maps, a couple of them are just a copy/paste with and without snow, with a unbalanced resource/camps distribution;∎ Most of the bugs are there still from the release date, some gets fixed but it's not enough.In the end the game could be good, it has potential to be something different than the usual RTS, the dev team is following and requesting actively the community to signal bugs wich is nice as it shows their will to try to fix them all creating a better game... But that's not enough, at least for a game that values 27.99€ on Steam, in my opinion they should take them eyes off the old game and focus on this because one good game is better than two mediocre games.

Product received for free
												Before I start, I must put it out there that I'm not a fan of RTS type of strategy games. I've tried many titles in the past, but I don't seem to get attached to any for some reason. This particular one, however, was more fun than I've anticipated it to be.After clicking the play button, Kingdom Wars 2: Battles (KW2) offered 3 different choices (Play Game, Game Options and Scenario Editor), each of them serves different purposes as you may have noticed. One thing to add here is that the Game Options screen allows players to select the game’s resolution scale, which the in game menu lacks the ability to. The game apparently only support full screen window mode, as mentioned in the forum by one of the developers:Originally posted by Dev Konstantin:That option is actually Full-Screen Windowed mode, so unfortunately this is not the windowed mode you want to see. We can`t add a real windowed mode without weeks of work reworking the engine. Sorry. Regardless, the Options Utility does not work at all for me. But that isn’t much of a big deal; I’m fine playing the game as it is. For those of you who prefer playing in a small window, just so you could alt+tab and do your own thing while playing the game at the same time would find it very much unlikely to do so.Kingdom Wars 2: Battles enables players to train their own troops and assign tasks to attack or defend from their opponents. The campaign mode felt more like an interactive building management rather than a lore-extensive story mode, but it shouldn’t matter much, given that the game didn’t choose to be a roleplaying game. The game has a decent tutorial to prepare those who aren’t familiar with the RTS genre and made sure that players get to experience different sides of the battlefield, playing as the humans, orcs and elves. On another note, the MMO part of the game adds more to the single-player experience with various features, suitable for those who enjoy working together with or challenging other players. As mentioned by other reviews, the developers are very active in the forums. They could’ve stopped giving support for a released game, like so many other developers at Steam. By listening to the customers’ concerns and answering inquiries of those in trouble, it shows that the developers truly care about their game and the community itself.I believe that the developers’ dedication towards improving the game with only a handful of staff is remarkable in and of itself, and for that, I truly think that this game deserves a chance for those that are interested into trying this out.

								Game is still in alpha-closed beta, so has some bugs in it, but the graphics are getting better and better, and performance is at open beta form! Game developers are also very active with the community to improve the game, which already includes full scale seige warfare and building a city from the dust up. 10/10 would play again, must buy.

												A Decent game. Although The graphics are not spectacular, there are some bugs and glitches, units are hard to read, and rough, but still responsive controls, The gameplay of this game is really fun! Why is this game fun; because you can play with your friends in survival mode, You can play against people in 1v1 games, you can do team battles or awesome free for all mode, you can literally siege your opponent base with siege towers, trebuchets, catapults, many more siege weapons and the battles are messy, but Epic, the combat is pretty fun too, which make the game more engaging. Even the zombies make this game fun because if your or enemy units die then they have a chance of becoming a zombie which could hurt you more or your opponent if you don't deal with the corpses.Yes, the game have generic fantasy tropes and have ton of generic rts mechanics, but there are few original mechanics like the card system, tech system and the MMOlike elements of guilds, trade, and social. Even though this game is average, I think average games are sometimes worth the purchase. And this game is worth it. Really interested in what the future for this game. Hopefully they add in more PVE modes, more campaign missions, and add steam workshop to Kingdom Wars 2 someday.			"

												This game is awesome!Most bugs have been taken care off and I feel like I can recommend this title now.I haven't seen this game concept before and I needed some time to figure out the best strategies against the zombie hordes. Many castles got crushed, but with every try I managed to survive more waves (survival mode)Multiplayer skirmishes are great. Long sieges, leading to many dead, leading to many zombies bringing more death...sometimes I don't even know what to fight first in front of my walls.Some people still complain about lags, although I can't confirm that. for me it is running without problems and the Devs are really into fixing stuff and bringing more content (for free!! no stupid DLCs)All in all I can say, if you like strategy, zombies and multiplayer give this game a try :D			"

												Pros: *Seems like a decent RTS (Not really an RTS fan tho, and only played part of the campaign) *Solid frame rate.  Was getting a solid 60 fps the whole time. not really Pro/Not really Con: *Crashed once in my 4 hrs of play time.  So seems fairly stable...Cons: *Character selection dialog is quite repetitive with about 3 dialogs per unit.   Them Human Peasants always asking if you want a potato!  I almost wanted to take an arrow to the knee.  *During the campaign there were timed and scripted events I didnt know were gonna happen.  Got really frusterating for me as I like to take my time with stuff.  I felt rushed to finish objectives quickly before getting wiped out in some sections.  Suppose it may have been designed to make you feel a sense of urgency.			"

								After comfirmation that this will never go F2P like the first did, I buy it - only for it to be almost immediately put into a cheap Groupees Be Mine bundle before I even had a chance to really install and play it. Sadly, I bought it directly from the devs or I would be going for a refund right now.Stay away from any Reverie World Studios games. I bought this one with the premise that I wasn't throwing my money to the wind. I was wrong. I bought the first one believing it wouldn't go F2P or have P2W transactions. P2W transactions for dragons was added immediately afterward. Then later, it went F2P with them giving me a free temporary 'premium' which went to waste.			"

												I want to like this game; it has some really novel ideas for a streamlined RTS experience with some MMO features woven in, which could make for very rewarding competitive play. Unfortunately, despite the responsive developers, it remains mired in technical issues. Graphical glitches, clunky and unreliable control, and uneven and sluggish performance make it tiresome to play.It's a real shame, as there is little competition out there for a game like this, and I would be into it if it were just better executed.

												I love the game mechanics in this... however there is a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to wade through to enjoy them. crashing very often.Multiplayers matches you wind up always winning because the connection is lost between players (so you're fighting no one)Even single player without connection issues. Select a unit it takes a good second to actually become selected so anybhotkeys u hit before that time win up putting you someplace else and potentially dropping your units off soemplace you don't want to be.Selection in general is slow like this. The Ai is very frustrating as well, only being able to control 12 battalionals at once.. when u need to rush in with many more than that at critical moments.not saying its hard... i have level hundred on everything and even found a way i coudlve done it afk. i chose super speed instead with rushing 1v1s.. much quicker.Random crashes as well aside from conenction issues.was hoping the bad graphics and in many cases very little unit look differences would mean the game coudl operate quickly at least... or large.. at only 80 battalions you are likely to crash the game once u start doing too much at once.and this isnt a computer issue... i processed frames in the latest benchmark i did at twice the speed of 99th percentile.If you're determined to enjoy a seige type rts that is roud based only it is ok enough for that but idk if i wouldve spent the money knowing by the time i beat it i coudlnt wait to stop playing its so broken.

Early Access Review
								I played and liked the predecessor ""Kingdom Wars"" and so i was sure that now KW2 will be even better... but well, it is not.I am not going to write about bugs and bad AI, because I know what an early access game is, and that this will be fixed in the future.But I can allready write about the gameplay and the direction which the game is heading. And personally, I dont like it.The grafics, the animations, the soundeffects, the music, the units, everything is just copypasted from the predecessor. KW1 was played like an browser game, where you builded one big city and could attack the cities and armies of other players or AI on a big world map. So you had a big city building part, and a big fighting part.The developers said in KW2, they will focus on the battles. And now you are building a base, gather ressources and fight at the same time against up to 4 players on a small map, just like on every other RTS game.By abandoning their ""city building"" part and mixing it to a smaller scaled skirmish together with the battle part, they not only decreased the actual game content, but also their unique feature, that made them standout from the rest of the RTS games. Another thing is the grinding system. In KW1 you had a gold currency, which you could buy for real money, or earn on the battlefield. From the gold you could buy new technologies and hero-units. It was actually a pretty fair system, since you got a fair amount of gold for defeating enemy units.Now you dont grind for gold, but for up to 10 ! (or so) different resources-cards, which you get randomly for every fight, and which you need for unlocking new skills, technologies and units. Of course you will always need the right combination of them to progress and some of this cards are very rare. Also mind, that you will have to unlock everything for the orcs/elves/humans separatly. In the old grinding system, you knew what you get - gold - and you could buy with it whatever you wanted.Now you get something completly random, that you maybe dont need at all and allready have in large quantities. There is a market where you can trade your resources-cards with others, but of course everyone is trying to sell you his stuff as high as possible, so this doesnt really help.Except for the new grinding system, the only new feature right now, are the zombies. after some time, the corpses of the fallen soilders will rise as zombies and attack everyone close by. This can be fun, but also quite annoying, depending on the players. You can deactivate the zombies in the options if you want.Conclusion: The exact same game, but - right now - with less content and a much more tedious grinding system than before.			"

												A hidden gem!Very good stratergy game! What the world was waiting for =)!I'm a massive fan of stratergy, I have AOE, C and C, Ashes of the singularity, COH and many more.... This game will never match my hours spent on C and C back in 2014, but this game really holds it's own, since buying it I really have become hooked. Pro: It has an element of middle eart to it - Orcs, dwarfs, people and elves. It has freaking zombies in it!It has a very good tower defence element to it - people can go on walls, you really feel sieged in this game The level up system keeps you wanting more, and keeps you exploring.A free ad-on! (Not like every other game out there trying to rip you offIt has heros, unique abilities and unlockables (Really keeps you interested and very well balanced)Very fun storyline (Even if the speaker and the narative is a bit cheesy at times)Very cheap! 13 pounds for this game is a bargain. Cons: Not a big community.. yet! (Need you to buy it!)Some lag issues (But this could be my computer) seems to struggle when you select a large amount of unitsbut remember that this is like 200/300 in size, so it's a tad understandableDiversity of multiplayer maps (They need more maps! and ways to mix up formation)- But the developers seem dedicated to working on this game so I guess this is coming). Just need more of you to notice this gem and to build a strong community of gamers. They really are working on this game. They have another update coming next week... definetly worth the 13 pounds.

Game says to move soldiers to flag.  Done.  Nothing else happens.  No new instructions.  Nothing.  Might as well have locked up because it will not progress.  Also, spelling and grammar errors in the help info and pop ups.I like the overall look and feel.  Voiceover is great.  Music very good.  This game needs polish.  Not ready for a discerning player.  I look forward to revisiting the game after some updates.			"

								Just installed this today and it has quite a bit of promise. I found one serious bug that may be an unintended result of the recent patch to add checkpoint save in the campaign, I can't progress any further than chapter 1. After completing chapter 1 it simply returns to the title screen, and chapter 2 isn't even able to be highlighted. Haven't tried any other modes as of yet, but it's definitely a fun game. I'm going to hold off playing until they work out a few more of the bugs, but I have faith that the devs will keep working to squash all the bugs found, we just have to keep telling them about them. They were very active with the first Kingdom Wars, which was nice to see.			"

												I must admit, at first, I was lost. Goes without saying that if you get creamed in the 1st act of the campaign which doubles a tutorial..we'll. it's a bit complicated. LOL. So I went and played a scenario, got the hang, got the feel, and the more I did the more I loved it. Very uunique gameplay and a stunner for a strategy/RTS fan. It's like stronghold and HOMM had a baby...a pretty one. From the castle work, to the leveling up of individual troops with stats/traits, resource point capture/defense and base building...it all ended up being quite fun and immersive in the end. Yes it takes a bit of learning curve but what good game doesn't.  As for problem reviews, I did crash the very time I opened the game...then never again. I had no in-game problems, no studders no anything so far with quite a few ""Learning hours"" under my belt. I'm just on win 10, which hasn't been updated sine the anniversary patch, an R7 230 card, and a amd A8 7600 Apu, with 8 gigs of ram. So ceertainly not a powerhouse computer and everything has ran fine so far. I also play MW3, COD BO2, Stellaris, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Battlefield 4 and quite a few other graphic intense games with no problem, crashes or lag. So, take the crash reviews for the hit/miss they are. The game itself, is awesome and enjoyable, challenging and engaging. Well worth the mooney I paid and certainly worth a shot.			"

												started off shaky due to the game not recogising the nividia graphics and using the intel graphics instead lol but dev dudes noticed that bug and said its gonna be fixed so flipped from impulse negative review to thumbs up senpai noticed me review! haha, but anyways if your games shaky and laggy just check your graphics options and add it to your gaming graphics.as for the game, the chars graphics seem pretty basic, probably due to making up with the amoun that need to run and process, the blood and corpse effects are cool, and makes it even cooler when you set zombies to high. the zombies in the game make it unique to other RTS games as the fallen enemies or your own troops can rise as zombies and cause problems for everyone, meaning its usually more beneficial to die and do the killing in the enemies area to avoid the whole pooping on your doorstep and causing zobies to rise on your land, so it adds consequence to death and battles. which adds a furthur strategical layer, i even saw some big moster troll thing rise as a zombie in a enemy castle which pretty much stomped anything he had left.game still gets a bit laggy late game, probably due to me turtling with lots of units and letting the ai build too much and spamming houses.walls are pre built and set in position and you can upgrade to make more get built or upgraded, which is neat as it means you dot have to dilly dally making shoddy walls yourself like in other rts games.it has cool weather effects and thick looking stormy rain, but i turned those settings off to prevent lag and it still looks good without the extra effects.all in all a cool rts so far. will update if i find anything else and change review as necessary XD			"

												Well, i don't like to write bad reviews, but new people should be advised about this game.Regarding the Pros and Cons:Pros: + Zombie addiction: i think it's the most beautiful thing in a rts game: with big battle you can turn the field in a bloody horde of zombie that will go to attack your base and everything they will meet, you need to burn them or send your civilians for cleaning the bodies or the zombies will spawn every time. + I like the 3 factions: they are different with their pros and cons, they made them very good.+ The economy system is good: you have to collect wood, gold, food and stone.  But you need to choose carefully your strategies, because gold and stone are limited if you don't build the other things for collect the resources ( each factions have their way to do it). + Battles are great and funny, you can build from soldiers to orcs, monsters and everything else (it depends from your faction). + They are working hard for improving the game.+ Mod kit is coming for early julyCons: - Lag: there is lag when you play with more than 1 AI or versus other players. This is a bad thing in the game, it ruins a lot your game's exprience. - The map variety is not so good. All the map are similar, and they need a re-balance for the resources nodes.- Ai: Despite the last improvements, it still needs a lot of work.Conclusion: Devs are trying hard for improving the game, but they are a small company, so it needs long time before having a 'full and complete game'. They lowered the price, now it's only 18 euro in my side. I still don't suggest to buy the game in it's currently state, but if you love the idea behind and want support them, then buy it!.I will update my review, but for now it's negative. Hope my English is good, i'm sorry for that.Edited: 22/06/2016			"

												From what I understand the game is still being improved and patched. Currently it is playable and enjoyable and truly is innovative for a medieval fantasy RTS. Music is good too. Scale is more realistic than other RTS. But several things still need to be fixed. Movement and controls are not as crisp and smooth as other RTS. There is too much need for double clicking, especially when commanding military units. Doesn't feel as responsive as a crisp AAA RTS. I have top of the line hardware and software but still the game has the abovementioned issues. Graphics are very good and cinematic mode is VERY fun and cool. Combat animations should be improved. Make it like battle for middle earth where cavalry can trample enemy units. Make the graphics more customizable and deeper graphics options than simply low medium high etc... Make it more sopshisticated and customizableTreant's graphics are sub par, they could look ALOT better. Some other units need improvement in appearance. Make combat unit animations more fluid and diverse and less robotic and clunky. Make it like Battle for Middle Earth, where cavalry and large Units can trample other units and push through them.			"

												THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WRITEING A REVIEWI bought this game two times... The first time I tried it I played for like 10 to 20 minutes and I though It wasnt very good. But when I got it the second time I went a little deeper into the game and was surprised with what I got.  PROS -The building system for all three factions is the same as it was for the orcs faction in KW1, bringing a new, fun way of how you can play KW.-The campagin is made to be a fun way to learn how to play the game, while being able to actualy play the game at the same time(unlike other RTS games)...-Unlike KW1, I personally injoy how this game is more like RTS games where you constently play different battles.-Just like KW1, I injoy how all the workers and soldiers talk to you.(single player can get really lonely) CONS Help me think of some...

												I don't normally leave reviews so this says something, especially since strategy games are my favorite genre.Game feels kinda buggy all the time, it almost feels akward and tedious to play not actually that fun I would say. I also feel lied to, as the video trailers above are nothing like the actual game feels. I didn't really see a purpose to the zombies, they just kinda ruined the fun for me as well and made me want to just quit the game every time as soon as they showed up.Lastly, a huge negative for me is the lack of multiplayer, almost impossible to get a game going every time I try. Game has potential if it gets fixed and expands it's marketing for more players and increased multiplayer community. Playing AI in skirmishes is usually very boring in RTS games as either they are too easy or they cheat to win.Will check on it in a few months see how it feels and will update review on that.			"

												I feel like I'm taking crazy pills right now. This game is bordering on unplayable. It stutters and chops for me even though I have a GTX 980 and an i7. The framerate actually drops into the single digits if I select more than 2 or 3 units at one time. The gameplay is boring as hell and the voice acting is grating. ""Want some potatoes?"" A better game is what I want.			"

Early Access Review
								Crashed after 30 minutes and lost all progress. Crashed again after 15 minutes. There's no option to save the game.  Right clicking not always works, mostly doesn't. I begun the game 2 times but will not the 3 rd time as it crashed the 3 rd time. All this crashes in just under 1 hour. Had forgot the last time a game crashed even if it was in early access. The terrible thing are not the crashes. I can live with those. Its the no saving option or auto save.			"

												The game is early access, and the developer team is but a small bunch of geeks that want some attention. The graphics are terrible and the gameplay is even worse. But the game is, nonetheless, original, it has a nice storyline and plenty of potential for the future. I think the zombie thing was a mistake, but that's my opinion and I'll no longer bother you about it. The game needs plenty of problems to be fixed, but as long as people enjoy playing it, there's no problem in buying it. The price is a bit too high for a game of this quality, but it's your money, so if you want to buy a game like this for 20 bucks, then do as you wish.			"

												i guess its ok... 3 problems that make me downvote it:1.: cant use your unlocked units in offline2.: no saves in sp games or story (3h story map has 2 checkpoints - dont know if you can load them of if they are only there if you lose)3.: if you get disconnected for more than 10 sec (even in sp) the game will tell you that you have to play in offline mode or quit the game! - no option to reconnect (game gets paused while reconnecting anyway so there is no reason why you shouldnt be able to reconnect) so playing survival for 2,5h and getting a dc (eg. router problems, reception problems with a hotspot or having to leave the area with your tethering cellphone for 1 min.) results in continued play without rewards or quitting...this is so frustrating...Edit 1: and yes i could complain about the moronic ai or how it is nearly impossible to give your units orders in battle (block stairs to protect your archers and keep enemies (ai) from rushing past you - or make your units rush past someone (only works for the ai), shoot a moving target (even a zombie))but others have done that better so... read that...

												First advice, take a look in the bugs section of steam discussion. It's huge!Bought it for about 6$ and the game was fun in campaign for a while. But it has a lot of bugs and some are gamebreaking. It uses only 25% of a quad cpu and stutters like crazy seemingly out of nowhere and there is no fix for it other than a seemingly bad engine. Pathfinding is also very buggy, units get stuck in walls, rivers, under bridges etc and make your archers shoot at them forever. I played it for about 30 hours but half that time was trying stuff to solve the gamebreaking stuttering.The devs are pretty active but they seem to spend more time selling the game with borderline false advertising and moving all bugreports away from the general discussion that they use for a ""sales channel"". So take a long good read in the Bug Reports section before you buy.I didnt even get around to try the multiplayer which i read is pretty bad (you dont play the same game because of desync issues).This game and the way the devs answer the ""unknowing"" potential customers gives me a lot of ""Red Flags"" aka the WarZ case. Even the voiceover guy sounds like he is about to burst into laughter at any moment and he gives you the feeling that you are playing a parody.Stronghold 3 and Stronghold Crusader 2 are much better games and all the Age of Empires. Heck, even ""Craft the World"" are better spending time on. Dont even try comparing this mess to Warhammer.			"

												Sorry, can't recommend this game. Her's why:1.) No Pause-ButtonI like to build my Keep an defend ist. Thinking carefully where to spent your rare Resources and what Unit to build and where to place the Unit. There's only the ""Slow-Motion-Feature""  which ending me playing the whole game in slowmo, what is rather redicilous. Me personally can't even read the discrption of what differnt Buttons dp and what Upgrades they prduce before pounded to dust... and that's on Easy-Mode and Slow-Mo...2.) Same goes for the Second Point. I hate, I really hate games with ""Timers""... e.g. You have X-Minutes before Y happens... Mainly that means attacking something... and as mentioned before I like to play from a strong Base. E.G. Securing a Strong Base which can defend itself, perhaps produces some Resources and than turn over to the Attack Mission. That's not, at least for me, possiple.3.) The Suvival ModeThis could be funny: Facing endless Hordes of Undead until you finaly go down... but all Cards are the SAME. You can select e.G. Desert or Coastal Cards... but... they all the same only with different textures... and by the way, because of 1.) and 2.) I didn't survive the firts Night (with the Humans). The Elves are somewaht easier because the Resources are in their Keep and not outside like with te Humans. The Orcs I disn't try.4.) Online Connection RequiredI hate it if Games are requiring you to be online to play. Sure, there is a button to turn ths ""feature"" off, but first yoz have to be online to start the game, get to the Main Menur and hit this f*cking Button. Personally I think this Online♥♥♥♥♥♥is  a very-very-very bad modern thing. I don't give a damn about Multiplayer, why san't that be respected?Okay... if you like fast Action and do have a very high Frustration Treshold than maybe you could get some Fun out of it. But for me it's certainly not the right game and therfore I can't recomed it.Technically it seems okayGreeting from SwitzerlandRobert			"

Early Access Review
								I like this game, I really do. I just can't recommend this game as of right now. It looks good, it's fun, and can even be a pretty good game at times. My issue is with the crafting system and the matchmaking, as neither seems to be well enough designed to actually be in this game as of yet. They heavily hold this game back by making it a little too convoluted. Buy it if you want, I had fun for about the first 20 minutes, but after that i felt like the game was just...bad. No idea why I feel this way, but eh. You may like it, but i sure didn't and can't recommend it to anyone. Overall, I rate this game at about a 6.5/10			"

												As of right now, the game is very nice, the mechanics are unique and they do an interesting combinations between games. There are 3 races and their play styles differ and it allows for unique strategies and what not. Now, what made me give this a thumbs down? Well first of all, the game is fun but is unplayable, I get such low fps that i can barely enjoy the game itself, the game stutters nearly every few seconds and the fps gets really low at times, running at low/med/high has no difference. once this has been solved, I am willing to give the game another try and update this review to a positive one.My Specs:Intel Core i7-3630 @2.40GHz6 GB RAMGeForce GT 630MAnd I'm also running Windows 8 64 bitI assume these should be enough to run the game and if anything I'd at least expect no stuttering/fps loss at the lowest settings.

												So, I have been looking for a proper RTS game with alot of managing and keeping an eye on your troops while thinking of proper strategies.This game is one of those games that will provide you with indepth tactics and strategies while maintaining a steady income of supplies and training troops. There are dozens of upgrades, not to mention boost-cards  that you can craft with materials you get when you play the game. Yes, by simply playing the game. No micro-transactions, just by playing the game. And you get those quite regularly. After every lose, win or every 3 waves in survival.There are 3 factions with each their pro's and cons and these weigh up and off eachother. I have fallen in love with this game, simply by it's simple graphics, deep gameplay, friendly community and really, really good developers who are still working on this game and are planning another (FREE) expansion!I suggest you buy this game because this is the RTS that can provide you with hundreds of hours with gameplay.

												This game, is broken, if ya gotta get and play any game similar to this, just get Black & White or Age of Empires/mythologythey are better.My problems with this game is that, the AI for your soldiers, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, during the first act the very first act, i understode all of it cuz im not new to these types of games (altho being forced to create a whole platune of soldiers And workers is a bit odd but understandable) but a broken AI is fkn broken, i had set up my soldiers, towers, oil, trebuchet strategic and perfect, i figured out right away that the enemies would most likely scale the walls with ladders or what not, so i made sure i had soldiers placed to block off their access to the stairs and the towers where my archers were located, the battle started and as i figured, they scaled the walls, pretty obvius....But, then i noticed that the AI didnt do a damn thing, the orcs just walked right past my soliders, neither giving a damn about eachother (no i didnt tell them to hold attacks, that'd be dumb) and went right for my oil and archers, even when i told my soldiers specificly to attack the orcs and their ladder....they didnt do anything, they ran Past the orcs, to the ladders, started climbing the edge of the walls basicly standing in the air outside the walls, and my archers were firing at the damn ground for some reason, not that the enemies had just happend to walk past there oh no, they were firing on corpses or something, it was basicly unplayable trying to command your men, if you've never played any other Strategy game, this could be acceptable for you, if  you've played basicly any other, this will be torture to try to play, a great idea and could be one of the best...but it needs A LOT more work put into it, atleast the AI needs to be fixed thats #1 priority to be taken care of.

												The game has too many kinks that MUST be ironed out. It is not playable right now. Firstly, my Roccat Lua didn't work with the game. Although it's kind of ridiculous that a developer couldn't get a mouse input to work properly, I stuck through and figured out how to fix the problem after about 30 minutes. The stated 'fix' from Reverie did not work. Once I got my own solution done, I was excited to see the 20€ game that I bought in action, only to find out that it is plagued by crippling frame rate issues as soon as I had a few military units on screen. This was after I had reduced my resolution (by the way, you can't do that in game) to 1280x720 and set the graphics to all of the minimum settings.Long story short, don't buy this game, even if you find the concept interesting. I know the game is still in development, but it has too many issues to have any sort of release right now.			"

												I cannot recommend this game with the terrible optimization (game lags hard when you select a handful of units, im on a i76700k/32gb ram/gtx980). While the premise here is ok (maps/board set ups are boring, small and get old very fast). The visuals are lacking if you weigh heavily on that sort of thing. The UI is VERY basic and unintuitive. The little things like poor minimap, poor castle set ups and very little in the way of personalisation. Just a bogus try at a castle siege platform. It's 2016, demand more from your developers. Refuse to settle for sub par garbage.It is a small group of devs, 3 I believe, and it shows in the quality and depth of this game. Game crashes when the engine can't handle the units you've spawned. The game crashes because the programmer can't optimize it correctly, the engine just doesn't handle the garbage game. Do yourself a favor skip this title.			"

												Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is a RTS with an interesting crafting system entwined with classic RTS gameplay and a great story.The Story:The story in Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is a great one pitting Humans against Orcs from the get go. The cutscenes are narrated with quality dialog making it feel like you are there commanding the forces and overcoming the challenges. The setting is somewhat different from other RTS games due to Human forces being on the defensive from the invading Orcs. To avoid any large spoilers I won’t go further into detail  but it is a story that will keep you playing.Gameplay:Now gameplay is where any RTS shines the most. There are several ways to overcome a challenge like instead of scaling walls with ladders why not smash it in with a battering ram! There are plenty of units to complement anyone's play style. The crafting aspects enhance the gameplay further giving you an edge over your enemy.In today’s internet age no game is complete without multiplayer. Kingdom Wars 2: Battles has your multiplayer RTS needs covered with intense PVP or co-operative play. There are also free content updates no season pass to get the latest chapter or added content! So many great things but every game has some bad mixed in with the good. The tutorial could have been longer and more in depth on certain mechanics. Resource management takes some getting used to. Overall it was still one of the best gameplay experiences in months for meBugs and Glitches:No game is perfect bugs and glitches happen they are fixed Kingdom Wars 2: Battles has only a few annoying bugs. One cutscene bugged forcing me to close the game.There are some visual bugs also like textures stretching in weird ways. The bugs and glitches are mostly minor and don’t lessen the gameplay or story quality at all.Pros and Cons:Pros: Great storyCrafting systemCard battlesIntense battlesMultiplayerMultiple unit typesVoiced dialogHelp menuMultiple ways to overcome a challengeFree expansion packCons:Small visual bugsTutorial could be better Resource management can be tough for those new to the gameThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

								Okay, I usually dont write reviews, but i simply had to make one here, since most people seems so thrilled about this game.I do realize that it's an early access game, but even with that in mind I wouldnt recommend the game. (Basicly I'm against paying for an unfinished product because it removes the motivation to finish the game). I bought the game because it was supposed to be a mix of Total War and Stronghold. IT IS NOT.Well, first of it is VERY buggy, and when i say VERY, I mean VERY buggy. It took me almost 3 hours just to make the game launch, and when it finally did it lagged alot during the intro scene and narrating.  It annoyed me so much that i had to quit after only 20 mins of gameplay.Since this is early access you would have to live with a few bugs, thats true, and the bugs arent the reason why Im not recommending the game. But besides this being an early access game, it simply looks and feels like it was released 10-15 years ago. Animations are ugly and the game feels clumsy. There is no real introduction to the game, so you just have to learn by playing.Game graphics looks like a mix of The Settlers 3 and Age of Mythology, with the feel of Age of Empires II. Might not sound like a bad mix, but for a game made in 2015 thats just not good enough.I asked for a refund, think and research before you buy this game.			"

												So, I was looking for a new RTS with castles, swords and bows. This game instantly caught my eye! The developer videos looked amazing and the graphics were nice. Now to my experience of the game. It is quite different to the RTS games that I am use to. I like AOE, C&C and such. This is more of a castle siege game which gives you limited map control with defensive buildings.The UI for me is very slow to resopond, and I am running a high end gaming machine. The AI is unrelentless, I have been playing some single player on easy and I get rushed and harrased so bad. Perhaps I am not as good a player as I thought but normally on easy, the AI doesnt attack so much and plays more defensively.I am going to bear with it but at the moment I am not so sure.			"

												I enjoyed Kingdom Wars 1 for its uniquiness with the overworld map and mmo features so i gave this game a try, what i got was utter dissapointment.First of all the game performes HORRIBLE. I usually go down to sub 10fps with almost min graphics on a 750ti and similiar strong CPU, making the game unplayable after the first few minutes.Secondly they took out the campaign map as far as i could tell and turned it into a boring campaign (But i did not play far into it because of of problem #1)Third problem i have was the unfunctioning options that sometimes worked other times did not.What i mean with this is the fact that the premenu launcher to change aspect ratio etc. sometimes doesnt save your changes, and windowed mode never worked at all. And the ingame option of leader portraits to apparantly fix the lag is not functioning either.All in all its a total dissapointment and i regret purchasing it, atleast until the performance problems got fixed.

								the last several times i attempted to play this there were less then 10 people in game....everytime.  None of those people talked either.  So basically this isnt much of a multiplayer success.  Also the cpu is boring and doesnt do anything but defend, so it feels like a bland rts where you just siege cities that dont even respond to what you are doing.Maybe updates have fixed some of it, but as it stood...the game was very empty and bland.

								If you liked the first install of this game and were hoping like me that they fixed all the bugs and made this the next installment the you will be disapointed like i was. This is only an instance battle mode of the original game. Its not even a finished game. Most beta games have less locked out features. First game was fun but very glitchy. I wouldnt even call this a game. its just a small segment of the original game with all the fun sucked out of it.			"

								Very badly coded. IA is dum. Game crashes. Whats the point of a game when you order a unit to move to location A to B and they try to go to C and walk into a wall.OK the updates work quite well. Still Major Problems. Mainly you can not save. It does not remember the last point you achived. Which means you end up playing the same parts over and over. Still Not recommended unless you want to play none stop from start to finish.			"

Early Access Review
								My first thoughts: I rate this knowing it is only in... From the looks of things hopefully still on the drawing board and not in Alpha stages. My first play through was the screen coming up 'connection lost to server' and closing down the game to the desktop, half-way through a game. No warning or option to re-connect.After my third attempt I actually managed to play the first campaign map. After completing it and going on to the next chapter... well that was blacked out and only allowed me to repetitively play the first.If I could think of any Pros I’ll list them…. Hmmm, nope.Cons-Graphics. The graphics strongly compete with up and coming games of the late 90’s to early 2000’s like Stronghold. At first I thought my resolution was 600x400, but on checking and zooming in…. mobile games have better graphics…. And that’s no joke. Whilst graphics aren’t everything, having trouble distinguishing an orc from a human on a 27” monitor at full zoom is concerning.I never played the original Kingdom Wars but thought it was something akin to Dawn of Fantasy, that’s entirely my fault and a mistake I’ll never make again.I see no point continuing to bag this game as it’s still in early (hopefully WAY early) development. But for the current price, I wouldn’t recommend to anyone to purchase this refuse even if it was on sale for under a dollar.			"

												I'd like to like it.  But when I click on the map to order a unit somewhere it doesn't always register.  I have to click again and there is a slight delay and then it registers and the unit confirms and starts moving.  Sometimes the unit won't give me a audio confirmation that he got the order either.The units fight awful as well; half of them stand up in a super relaxed stance while half of them are doing sword slash animations,  Since everything is kind of poorly defined/differentiated details when you get a big mosh pit of fighting guys you don't really know whats going on and who are your guys and who are orcs.Everything feels really clunky and unresponsive to commands.  I wish I was having the kind of fun all the other reviewers are having.			"

												Kingdom Wars 2: Battles is basically the same game as Kingdom Wars (the original game). I feel like the developers could have a really fun game here if they added new and better features. Why not have more units and buildings for your kingdom? Why not make the maps bigger? The crafting in the game is a good idea but was implemented terribly. You only have 5 spells for you wizard? Not cool. Only having 4 resources makes the game boring. Not to mention that they run out quickly then you have to rely on the market for your resources which by the way is supposed to work on supply and demand (it doesn't). Having a population limit of 80 is really boring as well. Last and the MOST IMPORTANT...  You need to add mod support. For the love of God... Mod support.This game should still be in alpha. I can't recommend this game until there are some serious changes, unless its on sale for $5.			"

								I can't really recommend a game that tries to be like Stronghold Crusader, but doesn't allow you to move any of your castle buildings. Want a wall in a specific spot, too bad. Want a tower over there, so sad. To be fair, I did see some reviews that listed this as a problem, but they were a month or two old, so I thought this might be something they added. Failing that, I thought that maybe it was designed well enough to compensate for that. The battles just felt kinda samey after a while. Also, I hate the card system. I like being able to unlock upgrades, but you literally start with jack squat at the begining. I'd like to have seen it be at least a little well-rounded. Also, if you spend some cards on a race you realize you don't like, then sad day for you too. The cards should be split among the races. In other words, the humans should have their own card deck, the elves should have theirs, and so forth. That way, if you don't like one of them, you can always switch races and still get some upgrades.			"

												Played single player skirmish ( i have not tried the campaign or multiplayer as it wasn't me to sign up my email) I put in however many hours into the game as listed with the ability to build 6units total.Macemen, archer, ladder thingy, ram,♥♥♥♥♥♥cav, and peasants. Many units have upgrades you cannot get unless you spend cards which I will admit I did not learn about as I wanted to learn how to play.I was playing skirmish mode and the AI was broke as f***. Units were walking over walls after upgraded to stone(also you can't build walls it is all pre determined) Mountains were easily scaled by the enemy where I had to go around. The skirmish games never end as the main building for ORCs cannot be destroyed and they produce infinite peasants. AI do not protect their towns/units/resources/territory.There are stronghold points or points of interest as they are not labled other than 100% +125/min above a flag.AI do not defend these but would only ever send units to a single location to duke it out and then just sit in the base that looked like nothing more than a crap fort placed on the map.My units when selected and designated to kill a unit would not shoot that unit but random units. You can only select up to 8-10 units at a time so moving a full army of 70 takes ages. Framerate froze up a lot randomly. Archers seem to be extremely powerful if you can get them to attack a target and not change targets after they kill 1/10 ppl in the unit.TL:DR The game is awful, its buggy, singleplayer games never seem to end. Save money and do not buy (i got it on sale so I didn't lose as much)			"

My eyes burned after 15 mins play. Hard to clear see pur solder or tructures in land. Color too strong make game like.. See dust in sand.. This is my comment. Maybe i will buy again when game fixed better.Ps: i like survival mode. With cheat it will kill my time, like i play mem of war assault2 ;)			"

												I did not enjoy my brief experience in the game. I had thought this would be a nice construction based RTS, which I like quite a bit. And it's true, the construction is a highlight of the game. Watching the walls go up, expanding the walls, and reinforcing the walls with defences is very fun. That was the only fun part of the game I could find.The many bugs made the game frustriating. the graphics are painful and the saturation is driven up to hide it. The UI is a mess. Units aquire skill points, which means you have to go to each group of units and distribute their skillpoints one at a time. The AI is bad, and the neutral outposts seem to be pointless.The Combat AI really made it unplayable though. Telling melee units to attack a unit, they will attack exactly that unit, and only that unit, even if they need to walk behind 3 lines of enemies to get to him. You can't even form a wall to prevent the enemy from walking past you, not that the AI would anyway. Just stick with archers who at least autoattack. Worse, there are no formations or advanced orders. The best you can do is tell your units to form a line facing one direction or another, making combat tactics paper thin.I expected fewer poor design choices and bugs from an indy studio.Pros:-Cool wall construction and upgrade machanics ++-Old school style resource collection +-Old school style unit design+Cons:-Bad map AI, Worse combat AI --Blinding graphics and saturation ---Frustrating glitches --Lack of formations or complex strategy ----Old school unit design -Verdict:Don't believe the fanboyst. Unless you really want to built walls stay away, even at 50% off.			"

												A creative and inventive world with an RTS twist, it has a ton of potential but there is still a lot of work to be done on it. For now I can barely play hardly an hour. Trust me, if you are an RTS lover, this game is not. worth. 20 dollars. I promise you. I can barely play more than an hour and I will try to give you a short review on why it's not worth your time:			"

								This could have been a BFME III. It is not!The videos you see show epic battles and smooth gameplay. I say: NAY!- Troops act stupid (Attack without order; Attack the Troops at Distance and ignore the ones beside them)- Pathfinding horrible (Troops get stuck everywhere. One man is stuck and the other 50 can't move any longer. Great!)- Trebuchets don't hit anything. (It's not about a radius stop making them pointlasers. Its 20 Trebuchets can't hit a Tower so you got to work with ""attack ground"" to hit that thing. Makes sieges more annoying then fun)I'm going to get a refund. Since these are pre-alpha bugs and not ""yay we're out of alpha""- bugs.			"

												I can't really tell if it is a good game, or a bad one, but it has one of the most annoying bugs I have ever found in a game. Once I started the game, I was happy that there is a Campaign mode. I like to start new games with these. It started well. but it seems like my peassants don't like the pig meet. One of the first step is to slaghter pigs. And they do it well if I tell them to. They kill a pig, and every one of them is happy. The become so full of themselves that after that they do nothing. I need meat to train units, but the peasants don't like to carry meat. They only like to kill the pigs.After the 3rd start of the campaign, I gave up, it seems like I am terrible ruler, who can't even tell the peasant what to do...EDIT: After the Gods have intervened for the sake of this humble ruler, our subjects did their jobs deligently. Alas we have alredy given up hope on the human race, but will try our best as an Orc Warlord.			"

The Devs seem committed to the player experience and to updating the game in a timely fashion. compared to my first impression the game has improved by leaps and bounds, not perfect by any means but no game is. i look forward to watching this game evolve and become the great game it has the potential to be.

However, the game is very laggy especially when selecting more than one unit as also it oftenly crashes. In my cases I cannot finish the quest because it crashes and therefore I will ask for a rembeursment from the company. Until this game works properly dont release it!After the bugs have been solved I changed my recommendation for this game. Good job devs!			"

												Kingdom Wars 2: Battles has three different races to it.Although I can not say I have fully played the Elves or humans, I have played the orcs for a while and enjoyed the gameplay.The gameplay itself is very fun and with a few updates I'm sure this game would something I would reccomend without a second of doubt.Except there are a few issues.1: Not all workers have hotkeys, meaning you have to use your mouse for it. For people who really want to be quick, this can take extra time as well as all other RTS games having hotkeys for these sorts of things.2: Elves in annihilation mode right now appear to be unkillable.3: The mouse being small can sometimes get lost in the middle of big battles, making it hard to direct troops.4: You have to unlock your techs for multiplayer mode, and there is currently no way to quickly check if you're going against a person with 300+ hours or a person just starting out when doing 1v1 or coop (Aside from checking their username in the social tab).Besides that, I'd reccomend this game for anyone looking to buy a fun RTS, it also has a great and entertaining Campaign.

												Awesome Game, despite the outdated graphics it's one of the most fun games I've played in a while.There's a lot of love being put into this game, the Devs are active, friendly and sometimes you can even play with them.In versus mode there are a lot of tactics that can be deployed against your opponent, the zombie system (too many dead bodies piled up result in zombies spawning) can be used in your favour or sometimes screws you up big time if you manage to defend an enemy attack but don't get rid of the bodies quick enough :)Survival mode is extremely fun if you manage to find someone who works cooperatively with you to defend against the endless zombie horde.The races all have a very different feel to them, there are many units and upgrades to choose from and with the resources you earn after each battle, you can unlock even more stuff like cards that have a limited use and act as spells to give you an advantage.The only downsides are the occasional (but rather rare) crashes and the currently low player count.

												I've been playing RTS games since I was young around 5 or 6 and now that i'm 25 i've had some experience with the genre. This game is a great for strategy, You can really get into the finer details the more you play it and it keeps you entertained. There is only a few things I can think of to make it better and that is more factions, units but not like in the total war games where you have to pay for everything and self placed forts. Other than these This game is a great game and just needs more advertisement and following for it.			"
