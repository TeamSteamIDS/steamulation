												It managed to play 1 time out of 5 attempts. 4 times it just simply crashed..      Would not waste your money on this unless some patch comes out for it.   Cannot find support options for this online?			"

												Overall, the game is not bad. Knowing what to expect is a big part of buying an Indie game.It is rather repetitive, and some of the triggers are either small or need better placing.I would not recommend this game to most people. With that said, if you like the object specific sim, then this is not a bad one.			"

												CrashesSame here, why isn't reviewing this forum of discussion and fix this problem? Lack of support for the game. They not let us be hanging with any responds thinking that it will resolve itself because it won't just going to get a lot of people disappointed and angry			"

			This game actually works with laptop GPU people ! ! ! Laptop GPU IS NOT supported as stated in the system requirements and this game has a very bad rating in Steam reviews mainly because most people...		

All ya had to do was move the movie, thats it! I'm changing it to recommend based on the fact that i had enjoyed and completed the 2014 version. This game has the same engine and user interface minus the achievements that is in 2014 version. The only differences so far i see are the helicopters and maps. I suppose the missions would be different too.A little disappointed that there are no achievements or trading cards but i'm sorta a maverick who likes to prove everybody's wrong haha! Naah actually the bundle is cheap and all the other games works without a hassel so i was willing to take a gamble and unwilling to refund the whole bundle just because of one troublesome title.It's all good now back to the skies. Oh wait! dang so many other titles waiting to be tested. Maybe i'll get back to this a little later.			"
