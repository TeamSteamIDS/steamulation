												A true masterpiece; takes the medium of videogames and pushes it to an entirely new level.  Even the most extensive of gaming productions in the distant future will find themselves compared to Moonbase Alpha time and time again.  It reminds us that videogames have truly become a form of art.			"

												Moonbase Alpha is a marvel of the 21st century. You cannot even compare any other games like Gears of War, Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, or even Assassin's Creed to this landmark in human intelligence. If you were to put a average Joe into this kind of enviroment, his head would implode from the amazing graphics, story, and gameplay. If you were to play this game, your feeble monkey brain would not even be able to understand the deep, complex and twisted story of Moonbase Alpha. NASA's masterpiece of 2010 shows us how far America has come in understanding space and lifestyle in space. Moonbase Alpha shows that even through NASA, we can learn much more about space and the human psyche. Moonbase Alpha follows the story of astronaut John Madden and his daily life on Moonbase Alpha, NASAs experimental base on the moon. If John fails his secret mission objective, his family and status in the NFL will be taken away and soiled by NASA. Moonbase Alpha brings us this harrowing story along with intense gameplay elements such as fixing carbon dioxide leaks, repairing solar panels, and driving robots. If you even attempted to finish such a hard, cruel game, you would be hailed as a god among men. Jesus would bless you with immortality and wealth beyond comprehension. The graphics in Moonbase Alpha top even Crysis 3 and have made many a computer catch fire. Even my IBM Super Computer cannot handle such a masterpiece as Moonbase Alpha. Many will look back to this game in the future, and smile as they remember their glorious past. NASA will forever be hailed as the wunderkind of this millenia. Thank you, NASA, for creating such a wonderful and exciting game.			"

												Set in Iraq, Moonbase Alpha is a hyper-realistic war simulation, rivaling ARMA in terms of AI, graphics, and controls. The game's main feature is its well-tuned multiplayer, which I noticed no lag while playing. Moonbase Alpha's amount of customization is simply astounding -- you can entirely adjust your character's appearance, which ranges from the clothes they wear depending on the weather, their face, the tint of their skin, how shiny their skin is, their skin color, how rough their skin is, how dirty their skin is, so forth. The character generation can take years to finish due to how complex it is. Alongside its extensive multiplayer, Moonbase Alpha also boasts a story that's Shakespearan in breadth, questioning the very morality of war and the existence of humanity. All of this is topped with an extensive soundtrack done from the incredible Jesper Kyd, who gives his best performance here. His soundtrack is diverse -- ranging from opera, electro, heavy metal, and dubstep. Going over everything that makes this game simply the greatest game ever made would render this review too long for Steam to post, so I'll end the review by saying that Moonbase Alpha will change your life.

												There are two ways to play this:Either with 1-5 friends you know, cooperating to fix up a broken moon base. People working together, trying to optimize paths, routes, finding out in what order to fix what and what to replace when and where and how...Or with 1-5 strangers, hopping about on the moon and finding out what insanities the text2speech feature will make out of what you type and how many loops and knots you can twist into the power cables before the physics engine bugs out and launches them into space at escape velocity.They are mutually exclusive. You cannot play a game according to the alleged rules on a public server. I think it's illegal or something, at least it has never been observed.			"

												At an affordable price of $0, NASA's Moonbase Alpha is a true piece of art and separates itself from today's popular games such as Call of Duty and Team Hatress 2 with it's cutting edge graphics, lifelike psychics and overall playability. The text to speech is quite helpful as I was born blind and cannot read text very well. On a closing note, I wish the U.S.A wouldn't cut so much funding towards NASA as I would like to see a sequel of this game in the near future.			"

Cool.Moonbase Alpha!Stand aside, Space Engineers, you've got a new competitor that kicks fun space games in the nuts and says""Well, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you should've been like me.""Let's start with the gameplay. The gameplay is just plain awesome. Parts where you're fixing everything CAN be quite boring, but using a cool remote controlled robot to go fix buttons and valves? NOW THAT IS A+.Graphics! Now let me tell you, i've seen Far Cry 3, i've seen Shadows of Mordor, i've seen Battlefield 4 on the highest. But to be honest, the graphics are really awesome on high. Remember that 20% joke thing? This ain't part of it. The graphics are really good.Perspective! Now, as a FPS game lover, i'd thought this would be something first person, but to tell you, it turns out great in third person. Even the third+first person robot is awesome!All in all, singing + pretty cool gameplay + good perspective and FOV = this. 9.92/10			"

												Moonbase Alpha... Houston, we have a great gameNASA really did good with this one, ESPECIALLY since it’s free. Your job is simple, fix Moonbase Alpha's life support systems using various tools and drones. I have always wanted a great space simulator, and stupidly I left this gem untouched in my games library for over a month believing because it was free, Moonbase would be garbage. I was wrong. Very wrong.So to start off with, you choose how you want your game to be set up from the menu, this includes map size, if there’s a time limit or not, the name and password of the server, and even if you want it to be single player if you desire. From there you’re shown a brief cutscene, followed by a simple 'tutorial' telling how to get things done. The goal of the game is to repair the base as fast as you can. This is done by repairing solar panels, replacing broken couplers, and attaching disconnected tubes. From pulling down solar panels, to using a computer operated drone to repair oxygen filters in hazardous areas, this game is very pleasing, especially the slow, awkward movements. Taking forever to walk thirty feet is defiantly more pleasing than it would seem, and you genuinely feel as if you’re on the moon. Making it better is that almost everything is silent, with the exception of your footsteps and the beautiful soundtrack. You can even team up with some buddies online to try to beat your previous time records, and the Text-to-Speech option can create some hilarious conversations. Now, if there were more levels you could choose from, and some minor bugs worked out, this game would be a true masterpiece.Pros:entirely freeshows off some pretty cool NASA techyou’re on the moonsoundtrack is amazingmovement feels as it should for being on the moononline servers or single playerText-to-SpeechCons:only 1 map (with multiple sizes)occasional bugsif online you're most likely going to hear some naughty thingsRate: 8/10If you love space in anyway at all, get this game. Heck, even if you don’t like space get this game!Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/ "

												John Madden!Moonbase Alpha is a space simulator created by the almighty NASA. You need to do various things in order to stay alive, such as repairing parts of your moonbase and using the built-in text-to-speech.The text-to-speech is my favorite part. You should try it at least for this one specific thing, and since it's free, you don't even need to pay for such technology!NASA, great work you did! Definitely recommending this game.			"

												This game is the magnum opus of all game design, a truely excellent experience for only the most hardcore gamers in the world. The year is 2020 and you are the survivors of a horrible moonbase accident. but the story is not important, what really makes this game excellent is the stellar gameplay, when i first played this game i was reduced to tears by its sheer radiant perfection, mere human words cannot begin to describe the euphoria that i felt as i fixed various electrical cables, and drove around in a moon rover. But, BUT the most excellent, amazing, and earth-shattering part of this game that will forever set it apart from all other games, and what catapulted it to the top of the Triple-A market, is the text to speech portion, hours and hours lost simply experiencing the greatness taht is the text to speech chat, each and evrey word i typed became real, ""John Madden"" i cried ""Football"" i screamed. ""Astronaut gayness"" i shouted from the top of my robotic voice modulator, into the inky black void and to the cardboard cutout of the earth so far away.

												MoonBase Alpha,  a FREE  Edutainment game developed for NASA, to educate the people about a future moonbase project.     You have 25 minutes to get the oxygen system repaired or it is game over. ** Has VOIP and Text to Speech Chat system. **You can play on online multiplayer co-op maps.  Mostly those servers that are usually playing online are playing with console mode cheats and nobody helping each other or really serious playing the game, everybody chating with the Text to Speech enabled and VOIP, saying silly and stupid things, while doing wild and crazy things with the gear.   ""John Madden"" is a popular saying.  With the lack of oxygen, you start to see things.Try it, it will be a out of sight and funny game.  You might die laughing before you die from lack of oxygen.The graphics, gear and game play looks ok. You, the astronaut, is slow moving, and maybe hopping would be faster. You can drive lunar rovers, use 2 tools, use 2 repair drones, carrying things, setting beacons.  Everything you do requires time, so you need more people to split the work up, and need to work with efficiency.  Has a minigame in the repair mode that tests your coloring in the lines skills, earns you time off the repair. You needed to recruit a bunch of serious players, train together then launch a competitive server.  Will require teamwork and training to finish in time.  You can practise the game by creating a private server and pick freeplay mode.    I guess the repairs needed change each game run.  Wish there was more to it than just fixing the Oxygen supply.for more info:

I used the rover to drive around to where i needed to get to but still ran out of time well before oxygen was restored. Best i got was about 2mins till oxygen restores on time up. I would recommend this game ONLY if u have friends u can play with.PROS Fun to play Challenging welding section Graphics are better then i expected Good game to play with friendsCONS Very very slow movement speed (i get its based in outer space and on the moon but still) Impossible to play single player/alonePros out weigh the cons on this so its a thumbs up from me!

												I don't know what I did and why I did it.I started the game, joined the only visible server I could find and started walking around.. i picked up a wrench which was apparently called: 'big purple ♥♥♥♥♥' and started working on some cables which later turned out to be oxygen flow cables. Turned out i dismantled and disconnected them from the main grid. Due to that the other astronauts which were walking around and of which I think still did less useful things than me received a oxygen shortage.. which was.. apparently due to my fault. Later I asked in the chat what I exactly did wrong and to my big surprise i got insulted by a player who called himself Donalt Trump. It's been an adventure. I'm not sure how It ended since I was kind of stuck in another oxygen hose which was going ragdoll.			"

												This game has SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL IT KILLS ME! It's beautiful, the game play rocks, and it's fun over all! IT REALLY IS! But the content was sverely limited... I mean you can always play on a harder mode but it just stops after a while. You've fixed every part of the base, you've beaten it three (or four) times over, and there's nothing more to do. It just stops, BAM!What would be awesome is if the game allowed you to build more of the base or construct it in the first place. You could go and make YOUR moon base and fix it when bad things happen. Maybe even make the ships that make the base! If you want a long lasting space game, get Kerbal Space Program. If you want a quick ""Hey I've got an hour or two"" game and you want it free, get this game. It's not bad, just limited.			"

												When things are working correctly, this game is extremely fun to play, however, making a server to play with others is just as easy as sticking your d**k in a Cheerio. Seems you have to go through a lot of exceptions in order to play with others. I'm still unsure how to do it properly, and there's no clear instructions online to do it. If you're lucky, you'll find an open server, but often they're either closed or full of text-to-speech trolls. Or you get kicked for absolutely no reason. Basically, the community is hit or miss.The gameplay itself is alright, it's just you jumping around to a broken piece of whatever and fixing or replacing it, nothing extremely riveting.As for the spice cake of this game, the text to speech is probably the most favorable aspect. If you're playing semi-seriously, it's a good way to make sure you're not missing any info from your fellow astronauts. But what's the fun in that when you can screw around? There's a lot of commands online that are fun to play with, though I advise you don't do it excessively.Overall, it's simple, it's playable, it has it's own charm, I say definitely get it if you're looking for a time waster.

												Catastrophe spreads out quickly at NASA's long winded moon base in 2025. A falling star strike has harmed key sunlight based showcases that keep the life sincerely solid frameworks running, oxygen levels are dropping quick for space wayfarers inside the base, and that darn repair robot just got stuck. What's a space voyager to do? Welcome to ""Moonbase Alpha,"" NASA's new free beguilement now accessible for download for PC clients on Valve's Steam web based gaming association. Virtual wayfarers must attempt to reestablish oxygen by repairing hurt sun arranged groups, control couplings and life sincerely solid frameworks amidst a 25-minute farthest point. The beguilement likewise permits up to six players to obligingly race the clock on the web, and to handle more noteworthy repair maps for a more fundamental test. Players can sway on board a lunar meanderer to cross the more drawn out segments. ""Moonbase Alpha"" gives a core of NASA's goal masterminded space beguilement, an immensely multiplayer electronic redirection, called ""Space explorer: Moon, Mars and Past,"" where players would go up against space wayfarer parts, for example, a roboticist, and research virtual sorts of the moon and other extraterrestrial extents. ""Moonbase Alpha"" in addition addresses an irrelevant effort meander for NASA, paying little notice to the probability that it's not a swap for an authentic rocket program that can send space adventurers back to the moon ""That is the offer of utilizing beguilements and redirections, since they let you do things that are fiercely unreasonably expensive [in true blue life],"" said Daniel Laughlin, expand administrator for NASA Learning Improvements at the affiliation's Goddard Earth Science and Progression Center in Maryland. In ""Moonbase Alpha"" players skip straight into the activity after a brief innovative that motivations behind interest the present difficulties.They control a space voyager who must visit a gear shed to get contraptions, for example, wrenches and welding light to settle the base. In any case, the space pilgrim can essentially go on one instrument immediately, which recommends players ought to pick purposely and drop off their devices in vital focal reaches. One of the all the also enrapturing parts of ""Moonbase Alpha"" starts from sending and controlling a repair robot that is outfitted with either a welding light or a major arm. Driving the robot permits the player to approach risky parts of the base to make repairs. It's conceivable to go on both sorts of robots rapidly, paying little personality to the probability that the player can just control each one along these lines. ""Moonbase Alpha"" moreover requires a touch of accuracy in its redirection trades, so that a player's space pilgrim may battle to relate a tremendous power interface if it's not adjusted true blue. In like way, the robot has the normal turning extent of a wheeled vehicle and does not turn on a dime. Those little touches came as a boggling stagger, with the exception of when the redirection controls tried player tries. The in-excitement cursor progression felt satisfactorily tired to make a robot repair scaled down redirection that included after circuit lines more troublesome than anticipated. By a wide margin the greater part of the player affiliation happens by centering a focal target reticule and left-clicking to make a move. That works generally, alongside a couple times when uneven camera centers may propel the player to move down or move the space voyager around. The trickiest piece of ""Moonbase Alpha"" starts from seeing accurately what the beguilement needs players to do in a specific repair condition. That can persuade the chance to be troublesome amidst a first play-through without understanding what repair mechanical gatherings are required for every case, and particularly when dependably checks. Voiceovers drop a few shows about the headway controls and what to do next, however different players may experience some experimentation before they really succeed in sparing the base inside the 25-minute time constrain. The distraction grants players to butcher past what numerous would consider conceivable, yet at the cost of not having their score recorded on the amusement's pioneer sheets. The cancelation of NASA's Social occasion of stars program that proposed to return space travelers to the moon activated a reasonable exchange among NASA and the distraction organizers about paying little personality to whether to move the point of convergence of ""Moonbase Alpha"" to Mars. Notwithstanding, that would have required changing every one of the improvements at a late time of progress. Two or three individuals additionally centered around that national directors may see the distraction as confirmation that NASA still needs to go for the moon first. However Laughlin called attention to that it's a PC entertainment, not an approach record. ""What I have been told is that the moon is still NASA's future, just not in the quick future,"" Laughlin told SPACE.com. ""Moonbase Alpha"" has beginning now started pulling in thought from inside NASA. Laughlin depicted enduring calls from NASA researchers and engineers excited for their missions to show up in ""Space explorer: Moon, Mars and Past."" The attach in of true blue mission information could give future gamers an additional estimations of realness. ""Individuals will start from attempts and make legitimate colleague, I require my Martian pioneer or theoretical Europa test in there,"" Laughlin said. ""[The game] will create as we get more missions set apart on.""(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												2014.12.07NASA should have taken more content from the 1974 tv series Moonbase alpha (MA).The game was released on July 6, 2010, as a free download on Steam. (http://store.steampowered.com/app/39000/)It was supposed to be a tech demo/simulation to test ideas to be used in Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond, NASA's massively multiplayer online game (successfully kickstarter funded August-October 11, 2011 where they were looking forward to a matching government tax credit matching all donations up to $700,000 with an additional 500K. But that is a different mia issue.)With a mixed reception, MA is an exercise in text to speech functionality and repetitive gameplay where one to six people try to shorten the time it takes to accomplish the repair O2 mission. One person can do it in 30 - 40 min, the curent record time is like 6 min (likely he had five other people helping get that time.) No obvious way to submit bug reports in this four year old game: hacking of audio files to intentionally irritate fellows on the map, intentionally obstructing completing the mission with no way to kick the person besides a password protected instance, and mouse click that subdues the game to task bar...  Not sure what NASA/Army Game Studio has been doing on this for the last four years (the Unreal 3 engine MA uses came out in 2004. UE4 came out 2012) but they have not really put effort into updating this MA exercise. As a free game and only 1.1GB install, it is a fun passtime, you can even compete against another team for fastest completion time... sabotuers not withstanding!141211There are ALOT of problems they REFUSE to address much less correct:hackers can insert code disrupting the game or irritating fellow players, often the game forces to task bar on mouse click, wasting time especially in timed matches getting the game back to full display, they REFUSE to allow bug reports indicating they have no intrest in problems four years after they released the game.Apparently Moonbase alpha was just a proof of concept to get money (kickstarter + govt matching funds) for the ""astronaut"" mmo (e.g. they have abandoned that game's web page http://www.astronautmmo.com/)  even though they got almost twice the $ pledged they were goaled for... THREE years later still no actual Astronaut mmo released. They took the $ and ran. ""Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond™, the official NASA MMO video game depicts the year 2035, with realistic environments and missions! ""this has been an ongoing scam since befor 2009 when it was titled Starlight: the NASA themed MMO http://www.stumbleupon.com/to/s/1TRruM "

												Moonbase Alpha is a wonderful experience. You can tell the creators of this game were all very experienced at creating games. This piece is beautiful. The game boasts an amazing landscape varying from white moon dust, to rocks, to the black abyss that is space, and even the earth from afar. The shadows are also very notable as they all move very fluently. Along with the environment, the game has a wonderful soundtrack. Three songs on loop that really bring out the emotion of every moment. Weather you be waddling around on the moon, dragging pipes around, driving a robot like it is a NASCAR race, or just spewing crap out of your mouth there is a song for it. The story is also wonderful. Plot twists kept me on my feet and the incentive kept me playing for a whole 3 hours. The voice actors are also all-star. The game has my favorite voice actor of all time in it... A speak and spell. The game has too many features to list there so I will choose some of my favorites. Markers can be placed and can say things such as ""Communist"" or ""John Madden"". You can pick things up... Only to drop them when you realize there is nothing you can do with the item you are holding. You can also communicate with other players through text like ""aeiou"" or ""John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden"". No matter what it is the game has something for you. 10/10 would wank to this again.  "

												Moonbase Alpha is a NASA-funded multiplayer game scenario with 20 minutes of play. The game provides a simulation of life on the moon, based on potential moon base programs.Together with other players, it is your task to repair important components necessary for producing oxygen, which were damaged by a meteor.The graphics of the game are not the worst but also not the best. Also the controls can be a frustrating factor. The length of the game is too short and it could need more diverse missions. Well, if you want to know what it might be like to be on the Moon then try out this game, but you should not expect much.Sounds 5/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 5/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Moonbase Alpha can be pretty fun, if you're in the right mood. I enjoy the game but alot of people will probably not like it the same way. I think this mostly has to do at witch the speed the game is played. The game can be slow, but this doesn't take anything away from the feel of the game or the fun that you can have. Also multiplayer can increase the enjoyment you get from the game dramatically.			"

												Moonbase Alpha provides a fascinating simulation of the regular activities that the first colonizators of the Moon would face. From simple tasks such as exploring the surface of the Moon, to critical duties like repairing the life support systems. You'll feel as if you were there, what's with all the astronauts shouting ""JOHN MADDEN"", just like they would in real life.			"

												In 1995, John Madden is ten years old and living in Los Angeles with foster astronauts. His mother Sarah Madden had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the leader of the human astronaut resistance against AEIOU, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a Moonbase and imprisoned at a mental hospital under the supervision of Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. Skynet sends a new asterisk, designated as ""T-1000"", back in time to kill John Madden. An advanced prototype, the T-1000 is composed of a ""mimetic poly-alloy holla holla get dolla"" aka liquid metal that allows it to take on the shape and appearance of anything it touches (short of complex devices such as guns or bombs or rovers or john madden), and transform parts of its anatomy into knives and stabbing weapons and wrenches as well as wall-e. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills an astronaut and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Madden has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. Huhahahaha.The admin and the T-1000 converge on John in a moonbase, and a chase ensues in which John and the admin escape together by rover while the T-1000 steal the only other ♥♥♥♥ing rover and chases after them, but ends up crashing into a canyon he couldn't get out of. Fearing that the T-1000 will copy and kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the admin to help free her. They encounter Sarah escaping the moonbase after severely injuring Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU's staff and himself. The three escape the T-1000 in a rover. The admin informs John and Sarah about Spooky Scary Skeletons, the artificial intelligence that will initiate a nuclear war on ""John Madden Day"" and go on to create the machines that will come over come over come over come over. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is not gay if its on the moon.Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to EARF, but after having a horrific nightmare ♥♥♥♥♥ beacons she awakens and sets out to kill Miles Dyson to prevent ""John Madden Day"" from occurring. She wounds him at his home but finds herself unable to kill him in front of the server. John and the admin arrive and inform Miles of the consequences of his ♥♥♥♥♥ beacons. They then learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged power couplings and the right arm of the previous wall-e. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the power station building and retrieve the CPU and the arm. The space po-po arrive and Miles is shot, but stays behind to trigger the explosives that destroy his lab and his research. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in that one ♥♥♥♥ing canyon.In a climactic battle in the mill, the T-1000 succeeds in severely damaging and shutting down the admin. However, The admin's emergency backup system engages and brings him back on-line. He surprises and shoots the T-1000 with a JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN!, causing it to fall into a vat of molten lololololololololol, where it is trolled. John throws the arm and CPU of the original admin into the vat as well. Just as Sarah felt relieved that the whole ordeal was over, the admin then explains that it must sacrifice itself so that its dance moves cannot be used to create Sppoky Scary Skeletons, and asks Sarah to help lower it into the lololololololololol. John begs for the admin to stay, but he says goodbye to John and Sarah and promises to dance again before it is lowered into the vat. The admin gives a tearful John an encouraging thumbs up as it disappears into the lolololololol to go alien hunting. Sarah looks to the future with hope, adding, ""Because if a machine, an admin, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.""One small suck for man, one giant tug for mankind.10/10			"

												If you love saving the moons and propogating the compelling legacy of John Madden, then this is the game for you.  Save the moon as we know it by completing action-packed point-and-click mini games!  It's so real, you'll think you're actually a contributing member of NASA!  Also, state of the art text-to-speech technology brings moon communications into the 21st century.  No more having to read like a ♥♥♥♥ing nerd.  Ride around on solar powered rovers and do sick moon jumps - basically like any skating game ever made, but on the moon.   When its dark, you begin to hallucinate in the real game, and when you play more than 15 hours, you begin to hallucinate in real life!  For this reason, I give Moonbase 5 stars and 12 thumbs up (The highest score possible).  Poonbang Alpha is not the game of the year, or even the decade, but the best game of all time.  All time.  All time.			"

												Realistic for a space simulator (hard to come by). The obectives are tough-ish. If you want a real game, you'll have to do it alone or plan one with friends. I'm afraid the text-to-voice chat is taken advantage of, albeit being hilarious. Also- keep your volume low. There are certain text commands implemented via chat that cause the game to produce various decibals of screeching. Coincidentally, you can also make songs.			"

												This game is absoloutely fantastic. This very realistic RPG MMO is the best i've played of its kind in years. You can spend hours and hours (in my case an hour) without even knowing; that's how good it is. You can fly in massive fleets like a scene from star wars and have huge 500 v 500 player battles. I have never seen anything like this before. You play as an astronaut called Timmy Wiseau who crash lands on the NASA space mission aboard the 'I did not hit her' and the lunar lander 'I DID NOT.' The soundtrack of the game is great featuring all your favourites  such as the Bob the Builder theme song and Biggie Smalls Thomas the Tank Engine and don't forget the Youtube sensation Chocka Block. The story, better than the Last of Us, lasts roughly 5 minutes until you realise what you just wasted your time downloading. I definitely recommend that if you have a spare five minutes that you download this game because the time you spend downloading you have more fun than the actual game and the download screen has a better storyline than the game itself. Enjoy this game! It's a masterpiece!			"

												This game is amazingly well constructed. It gives the player a realistic feeling of practicing the skills necessary to join the space program at NASA. This game has many features that allow you to hone your skills before you even graduate High School - imagine how well your application to any college will look like with first hand experience in equipment management in zero gravity conditions. This game allows you to ramp the barren landscape on the moon in rovers that were designed to slowly travel across the ground and you can take advantage of them to fly off rock piles going at least 10 miles an hour. While this game is a serious perspective on the moon, it also features a dark side. Unknown aliens trying to communicate to you, kids somehow landing and trying to communicate, I believe I even bumped into someone who was singing but burst into a fit of coughs before he could finish. If I could go higher, I would, but I'll settle and give this game a solid 10 out of 10. Definitely life changing yet eye opening at the same time. With a game like this, you have to ask yourself. Do YOU have what it takes to be a whaler on the moon?			"

												The story revolves around Kinjirō Sakamachi, a 17 year old high school boy who suffers from gynophobia. The gynophobia makes his nose bleed every time he has physical contact with a female. While using the men's washroom he accidentally discovers that the popular and handsome butler Subaru Konoe is in fact a girl. Now that Kinjirō knows about Subaru's secret, he must work together with Subaru and her sadistic mistress, Kanade Suzutsuki, to protect Subaru’s secret from being discovered.			"

												My rating 9/10You are an astronaut sent by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) to complete a task on the moon. You were more than likely aboard the ISS (International Space Station), but were given a mission to complete on the moon. The mission is to fix a crap load of stuff and get the heck off.  The Text to Speech feature of the game is the absolute best thing that has ever been in Unreal Engine, and it is highly abused by the players. But golly is it fun, like Goat Simulator this will bring several hours of fun and laughter.			"

												This game has the most advanced text-to-speech functionality of any game/movie/machine ever.  The backstory to this game is that NASA wants new little boys to work on a space shelter for santa while he slowly asphyxiates himself with new-brought oxygen tubes.  Throughout your playing of this vintage beauty, you will encounter things such as unparalleled driving physics, extremely advanced hardware interactions, and much more on this crazy ♥♥♥ adventure.

												It's a fun game, even if the multiplayer is a little wonky to get working sometimes.The text-to-speech and sick rover jumps aside, the game is a pretty good sim. Challenging at first, but could use a little more depth. ALSO, fun things to do with the computer inside, which may/may not include a text based adventure. If you have a buddy it can be a fun time and funny too. Or you can be a real man and do it solo for the extra difficult.6.5/10, enjoyed it and would recommend.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes graphics over gameplay, because Far Cry 2 has some of the best graphics out of every game made in 2008. From a ratio to the time the game was made and the technology limitations, this game practically had better graphics that Far Cry 3, due to the ratio. But Far Cry 3 all in all, has better graphics and better gameplay. I like Far Cry 2, but obviously Far Cry 3 is the better game.			"

												This game is by far the game of the century. It has a very capturing story, with highs and lows, exciting gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and dialogue that is pure perfection. This is my favorite game in my Steam library, if you do not have it, get it NOW. It's made by NASA, who wouldn't want a game made by NASA?Moonbase Alpha is like Grand Theft Auto on the moon, done professionally. You can repair and drive space vehicles, carry tubes with your friends and play tug of war, jump around with low gravity, and so much more! The gameplay of this game will immediatly get you addicted.Moonbase Alpha also features an amazing communication system, with ultra-realistic text to speech playback. If you don't feel like talking in game with your microphone, no worries! You can customize your voice so you sound the way you like when you type!No but seriously, I don't think anyone really knows how to play this game.			"

												This game is a lot of fun when you play with friends. If you play alone, it's still quite interesting. It's definitely a nice change with the setting being the Moon. It's thought through and the controls and features are very nice and handy. Watch me play with a friend and see for yourself:

												One again proof that steam needs a ""maybe"" or ""so-so"" option for these reviews.Moonbase Alpha is based around a series of scenarios involving performing general maintanence on a habitat located on...as you might guess...the moon. While the game is pretty straightforward, its mostly a matter of time-management more than anything. Handling repairs involves a number of QTE (Quick Time Events) which can shorten the time it takes to finish repairing this hose or that solar-panel for instance.It also involves use of drones for certain parts, as getting too close to specific (Radioactive) items can seriously muck up one's vision. They also have the only tools that can be used to remove and repair items in these areas.All in all the game's mechanics are, while pretty simplistic, tend to be pretty fun.So why am I saying ""No"" to recommending this game?Because, to loosely borrow from Borderlands 2's Hammerlock, Every time I join a public game I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one.I have never seen a group of gamers that are so mind-shatteringly childish, and i've been gaming online for almost 16 years now.

												I haven't really played around with this game except for once with a friend, but the concept is pretty interesting.tl;dr you need to fix the moon base's oxygen supply which is made up of three-ish parts in 25 minutes or less, else you die.May update with more details as I play this game more (if I even do), seems more fun when playing with others.

												The only building on that part of the moon’s surface is the Moonbase, a weather tracking and managing station staffed by an international crew managed by the bullish Hobson. They are using a gravity machine called the Gravitron to control the Earth’s weather. When the time travellers arrive, the Doctor ingratiates them and does detective work because some of the crew have been collapsing in comas with a strange virus. International Space Control responds to the crisis by quarantining the Moonbase. The station doctor, Evans, was the first one to get the disease, and in a delirium talks of a silver hand but immediately dies of the disease.Another of the Moonbase crew, Ralph, has disappeared in the food stores, and the Moonbase radio transmissions are being monitored from somewhere else on the moon. Jamie has been placed in the sickbay where, feverish and delirious, he begins mumbling about a “Phantom Piper”, a figure which Jamie believes appears to a McCrimmon before he dies. While attending to Jamie, Polly sees a large figure leave through the door. When Hobson, the Doctor, Ben, John and Nils arrive to collect Evans' body, it has disappeared. They then leave to investigate where this 'piper' is. Polly goes to get water, and Jamie wakes up to see the 'piper' advancing on him.The 'piper' ignores Jamie, as he doesn't have the disease, so he steals another patient and leaves. Polly comes back in just as the figure is leaving and recognises it as a Cyberman, and the Doctor realises their old enemies are stalking the Moonbase and taking the patients' bodies. Hobson brushes away the cyber-story, believing they died out years ago. He gives the Doctor 24 hours to discover the cause of the virus, or else he and his companions must leave the moon.While Hobson deals with the Gravitron, which is becoming difficult to control with fewer staff, the Doctor focuses on the cause of the viral disease. In the sickbay, Polly and Jamie are attacked by a Cyberman, which stuns them with electricity from his hand and leaves with another patient's body.The Gravitron isn't working because some antennae on the Moon's surface are broken. Jules and Franz go out to fix them but are ambushed by two Cybermen and beaten to death. The Doctor can't work out the cause of the disease and is ordered to leave by Hobson. Polly makes some coffee and another crew member gets infected. The Doctor works out that the neurotropic virus has been spread through infected sugar from the food stores and is an organised scheme to destabilise the crew. A Cyberman who had been posing as a patient in bed reveals himself and aims his gun at them.Another Cyberman emerges and kills Bob when he tries to attack the other with a metal bar. The Cybermen recognise the Doctor and use their weapons to take control of the central control centre of the Moonbase while confining Polly and Ben to the sickbay. The Cybermen reveal that they want to use the Gravitron to destroy all life on Earth by altering the weather.On board the cyber-ship Evans, Jules and Ralph are conditioned to obey the Cybermen like zombie slaves. They are taken to the base and are sent into the heart of the Gravitron to subvert the machine. The Cybermen have been entering and leaving the base using a tunnel that goes into the food stores, explaining the drops in air pressure.Using fire extinguishers, nail varnish remover and other objects that dissolve plastic, Ben, Polly and a recovered Jamie lead a fightback from their incarceration in the medical wing. The three Cybermen in the initial attack force are destroyed.Benoit goes outside to see what happened to Jules and Franz. He only finds their spacesuits, and is chased by a Cyberman. Ben puts some of the solvent in a bottle and goes out. He then throws the bottle at the Cyberman's chest unit, killing it and saving Benoit. The crew block off the hole in the food stores to prevent more Cybermen entering. The cybership is located, but a large squad of Cybermen start advancing on the Moonbase.They advance on the Moonbase through the vacuum of the Moon’s surface. Two Cybermen on the surface damage the aerial, preventing the Moonbase from contacting Earth; however, a relief ship is on the way. The Cybermen use radio beams to reactivate their zombies inside the base, who infiltrate the Gravitron and use it to deflect a relief ship sent by Earth into the sun. A hole is blasted in the wall, which depressurises the base, but Hobson and Benoit use a coffee tray to plug the leak. The depressurisation deactivates Evans and the other zombies.Two more cyberships arrive. The Cybermen already on the surface erect a large laser cannon and threaten to blow the base open unless the entry port is opened within 10 seconds. They fire, but the beam is deflected by the Gravitron, so the Cybermen pack the cannon away. Another large squad from one of the other cyberships take up positions around the base. With the help of Hobson, Polly and Benoit, the Doctor points the Gravitron at the lunar surface, which blasts the Cybermen and their ships into space.As Hobson and his team reorient the Gravitron to its proper use, the Doctor and his companions slip away. Back in the TARDIS, they dematerialise and then activate the rarely used time scanner to reveal a monstrous claw waving around.Production[edit]The working titles of this story were Cybermen and The Return of the Cybermen. It was commissioned before the last episode of The Tenth Planet was broadcast, to take advantage of the strong positive response to the Cybermen. When Pedler was commissioned to write a second Cyberman story, one of the requirements was that the story should have only one large set and a limited number of smaller sets. The first draft of the script was written before it was decided that Frazer Hines would be a regular cast member. As a result, the character of Jamie had to be worked into a script that didn't have much room for him. So in the first two episodes, Jamie spends much of the time in the sickbay. In the last two episodes, some of Ben's dialogue was given to him.The first 3 Episodes were recorded on successive Saturdays at Doctor Who's then regular home of Riverside 1, but for Episode 4 it moved back to Lime Grove D. A final clip, used to carry the story into the subsequent adventure, The Macra Terror, was filmed separately during the making of that story, as the Macra prop was too large to be brought into the studio.This story is also the last story to use the original title sequence that had been in use since the first serial; the next serial introduced a new sequence with different howlaround patterns that incorporated Troughton's face.Cast notes[edit]This story features the debut of actor John Levene (uncredited) as a Cyberman. Levene would return as a Yeti in The Web of Fear, and would go on to play the regular character Sergeant Benton. John Rolfe had previously appeared in The War Machines and would appear again in The Green Death. Alan Rowe was cast as Doctor Evans, an early victim of the space plague and also provided the voice of Space Control. He later appeared in The Time Warrior, Horror of Fang Rock and Full Circle.[1]			"

												This is a game made by the very heavens themselves. This is what AAA Studios are wanting to achieve but they all fail. Every last one of them despite their hardest attempts. None have managed to do what Moonbase Alpha has achieved. The Division tried and failed. Far Cry: Primal tried and failed. Spore tried and failed. Red Orchestra 2 tried and failed. You know what they failed to achieve that this game hadn't? The ability to type ""JOHN MADDEN"" in the chat in the form of a song.			"

												Moonbase Alpha is a very fun experience for both the solo player and for a group. It's very well designed, offers a nice variety of choice in how to fix and repair the various damages the base has undergone, has some enjoyable replayability, and is something that I can certainly recommend. There is a host of space sim games avaiable currently, but for those who are looking to dabble in the genre without spending anything Moonbase Alpha can provide a small sample.			"

												There may have been updates since I last played this, however the version I installed was an interesting little simulator. There was some educational value to be had, but not much. The game play is also not very intuitive and could benefit from tutorials. The game seemed to be very stable, however it had issues in multiplayer missions due to children constantly attempting to grief players by undermining the work of those attempting to accomplish the mission within the allotted time limit.If there was more content, specifically missions, or perhaps there was a sandbox mode available during Alpha in which players could use to simply build with, this would have real value. As it is, it's simply a toy for wasting time.I am recommending this for younger children or anyone who has an interest in real life space exploration, as these are the individuals most likely to enjoy this. That said, I do not think it will be able to keep anyones attention for very long unless content is added.			"

I've been trying to find a good moon simulator for years now and then I found this, Moonbase Alpha, its probably one of the most realistic games I've ever seen. It's like the next Call of Duty or even better. all I pretty much need to say is, best game ever 10/10.			"

												This is really an amazingly detailed space-simulation prioritizing the maintenance of Moonbase Alpha. Players will find themselves being motivated perfecting their teamplay in order to solve puzzle governed objectives. Such as re-routing power supplies, repairing wires and electronics. That all must happen in a predefined given time limit, which on harder difficulties really keeps you focussed and concentrated. Its rather short and comes along with nothing additionally, but for those who ever wondered what working on the moon might look like, or those who are simply curious, Moonbase Alpha is worthy a try.

												As a kid, I always imagined I'd grow up and become an astronaut. I planned on being  one of the few brave souls to ever set foot upon the moon. Well, my dreams and aspirations were shattered when I was told by NASA that I'd never be an astronaut, due to weighing 620lbs and being completely immobile, without a crane and intricate series of ropes and pulleys.. I was heartbroken. I attempted suicide but when I put the noose around my neck and edged off the bed, all 20 floors of the assisted living facility above me collapsed. So what was I to do? Play a computer game to take my mind off of things. That is when I found Moonbase Alpha or should I say: ""That is when Moonbase Alpha found me"". Now I can journey across the lunar surface from the comfort of my ultra deluxe titanium reinforced computer chair. This game saved me from boredom and inspired me to sit there and play games instead of eating all day. I'm now down to a slim 590lbs and feeling lighter and healthier than ever. A++			"

												This game is horrible. Unoptimized, buggy, has glitches, and almost no one plays it. There is just one gamemode/objective whatever you want to call it, and it's greatly monotone in terms of gameplay. BUT, and there is that BUT.This game due to it's hilariously glitchy nature + text-to-speech system, and multiplayer availability (hopefully you won't get together with trolls) is pretty enjoyable. I haven't played that much, but from a game which would deserve 3/10 likely, it is a LOT. If there are servers up, it's real fun to make ""supasnaik"" the glitchy cable, and ask people to sing me the whaling tune. Even if you think this would be a waste of your time, just hop in for a lil', it costs nothing and it's even better if you have a friend. Nasa provided us something of sentimental value which stands the test of time no matter how far we go.			"

												Interesting game really. The only winning move is not to play.After playing this for some time you'll find that many people will just sit in servers and mess around using the DECTalk-powered Text-To-Speech to make interesting noises or sing songs. This can be both funny and entertaining for quite some time if done correctly...On the other hand it can also be ear-shattering annoying.From a game perspective, the maps are short, fairly straightforward, and when given some practice are fairly easy to complete in a timely fashion. There is only a small handfull of them, but some can be very competetive (given you have enough people who actually want to complete the objective).On the other hard, you get what you pay for...So to be honest there's nothing really to lose (other than about a Gigabyte of storage space).

												If you're looking for a game where you can simply screw around and make funny text-to-speech messages that sound like Stephen Hawking with other people screwing around and making funny text-to-speech messages that sound like Stephen Hawking, then this is the game for you! Literally, NASA built this game to be a serious space simulator, and it probably would've been a serious game had they not included text-to-speech chat where people can make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ noises. But then again, it would be NOWHERE AS FUN if it weren't for this feature, which is pretty much the key feature to the game. There are some people who try to play the game seriously... Screw those people..... literally........... Just turn on text-to-speech and your day will absolutely be made.10 out of F***ing 10 IGN			"

												NASA's magnum opus, Moonbase Alpha, is a true gem. This game, no this is more than a game, this life-changing experience, thrusts you into the life of the greatest astronaut of all time, John Madden, to explore the inner-workings of human language, and the foreign landscape of our very own moon. This is tax dollars at work! NASA has truly revolutionized the standards for modern video games with this masterpiece. This is an experience that should not be passed up, the mind-altering effect that this game is comparable to only that of a psychoactive drug such as LSD. This is honestly the greatest game of our generation, nay, it is the greatest game of the history of mankind, a true 10/10.			"

												There may have been updates since I last played this, however the version I installed was an interesting little simulator. There was some educational value to be had, but not much. The game play is also not very intuitive and could benefit from tutorials. The game seemed to be very stable, however it had issues in multiplayer missions due to children constantly attempting to grief players by undermining the work of those attempting to accomplish the mission within the allotted time limit.If there was more content, specifically missions, or perhaps there was a sandbox mode available during Alpha in which players could use to simply build with, this would have real value. As it is, it's simply a toy for wasting time.I am recommending this for younger children or anyone who has an interest in real life space exploration, as these are the individuals most likely to enjoy this. That said, I do not think it will be able to keep anyones attention for very long unless content is added.			"

												NASA's magnum opus, Moonbase Alpha, is a true gem. This game, no this is more than a game, this life-changing experience, thrusts you into the life of the greatest astronaut of all time, John Madden, to explore the inner-workings of human language, and the foreign landscape of our very own moon. This is tax dollars at work! NASA has truly revolutionized the standards for modern video games with this masterpiece. This is an experience that should not be passed up, the mind-altering effect that this game is comparable to only that of a psychoactive drug such as LSD. This is honestly the greatest game of our generation, nay, it is the greatest game of the history of mankind, a true 10/10.			"

												Where to begin....can I even begin to describe the epic that is, Moonbase Alpha? Yes, actually I can.Ever since the beginning of time, there have been bad games and good games. Sport games such as ""Madden"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" and point and click FPS games such as the lovable ""Call of Duty"" franchise and the much appraised ""Football Superstars"". Now for the first time, we have something that we, collectively, as the human race can use to reach enlightenment. Moonbase Alpha isn't a game, nor is it a video - it's an experience. An experience that when encountered, will change your life forever - increasing your intelligence, trebling your strength and ensuring you will not only get laid, but maintain your virginity simultaneously.On the face of this 'game', the 'player' takes on the role of an astronaut attempting to maintain oxygen to the NASA station situated on the Moon - but this simply belies the true nature of this experience. In reality, this is just an allegory and subtle reference to many circumstances and crucial scenarios which have occurred throughout human history. One event many interpret this experience as referencing is in fact, the Cold War which although is argued, is quiet plausible. The 'player' obviously represents the US with the depleting oxygen being subtly inferred as being a Russian sabotage and when it finally does deplete - the cinematic of the station exploding into millions of pieces is representative of how if the Russians had won the Cold War - they would have dominated the world and forced the entire populace to speak Russian as well as worship Russian heroes of Communism such as Marx, Lenin and Richard Nixon.Another popular interpretation is one of an Apocalypse scenario, which reverses what the 'player' is initially led to believe. The 'players' are in fact establish a colony on the Moon to subvert and oppress the invisible Moon aliens in order to gain moon rocks which will be manufactured into weapons for the U.S.A. in order for them to begin their universal conquest. Though even more subtle, one could see how this is credible. In the game, one of the rooms has seemingly no purpose except to monitor the entire Moon which would mean logically, it is in fact to monitor and subvert the invisible aliens. More importantly, all ""players"" do not have proper voices, but in fact an unknown, voice which is strangely unmechanical in any way and is so heart-warming that it must be the alien language being utilised by the ""players"" in order to bring the aliens out of hiding in order for the player to enslave them.Whatever the scenario it represents, one thing is certain. If you do not play Moonbase Alpha not only are you ridding yourself of your one chance to be rid of the dreary-ness of 21st Century Life and allow you to reach enlightenment but you will probably get some sort of illness of some sort like typhoid or something I dunno.

												Moonbase Alpha is an FPS-strategy-football hybrid which no one has ever done before, where you defend the final bastion of mankind. In this realistic simulation, where you control millions of people, you can feel the tension in the air. The story starts where our soon to be protagonist(s) escape Earth on the last ship before it meets it's fate. When our hero gets to the moon, he/she finds that it is under siege and that's where I'll leave you to find the rest. I tell you now, the sheer amount of gameplay here is astounding. You can create caste systems, watch people in a creepy ""The Sims""-esque fashion, and have sloths fight to the death. On top of that, the moon is your castle to build and destroy whatever you wish. Don't like women? Send them out the airlocks or stop refueling their oxygen tanks. Want to expand your quarters? No worries, we can move all those deathly ill peasants into a tinier hovel so you can enjoy that new hot tub you've always wanted. This game is the pinnacle of gaming, which no game has ever been able to replicate. Total War, Call of Duty, Eve Online, Battlefield, and more can't even compare to this wonderful treasure given to us by NASA. There's also a little girl, who is pure of heart who utters the truth of the universe: johnmadden.			"

												Truely an amazing work of art. Game developers should take note of what truely makes a perfect game such as this. Just read all the stuff in the chat in this game, it really feels like you are on a NASA mission on the moon: ""Poo poo goo goo"", ""I want to suk your kok"" ""It's not ♥♥♥♥ if it's on the moon"" ""UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"" ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" ""BRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB"" ""My little pony, my little pony"" ""Your mom is ♥♥♥♥"" ""John Madden is ♥♥♥♥"" ""Can I have a pizza? No. Why? Because you are John Madden""No game can ever beat the true realism of this magnifisant work of art. I'd recommend changing the neme from ""Moonbase Alpha"" to ""Best Game Of All TIme"" as it gives a brief but accurate description of what this game is.			"

												This game is an appalling attempt to vindicate unjust colonial exploitation and is the latest in a vast body of evidence that proves that America is the most blatantly imperialistic power since the Roman Empire, or if you go back a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away) the Galactic Empire. Moonbase Alpha is a ""game"" (or more accurately ""imperalist propaganda tool"") where you and others play as a group of foreigners (all presumably white, judging by their spacesuits) who show up on a the frontier and immediately begin exploiting it, completely ignoring the rights of the native population, who you will likely infect with space smallpox if the lazy developers ever get around to adding that to the ""game"" (imperalist propaganda tool). As it stands, your only objective is to solidify America's invasive presence in this pristine land by messing it up with a bunch of space tubes. This game (imperilist propaganda tool) should really been called ""Evil Moonbase Manifest Destiny Alpha.""			"

												First I Arrived off an american lander can to help repair broken equipment and life support systems on a Moonbase.I met plenty of other astro and cosmonauts from around the world.We agreed to fix up the base.But then we found moonshine in the barracks.Being the silly men we were, we drank it to the last drop.Then ♥♥♥♥ happened.I remember drag racing in the moon rovers, and screaming over our coms obscure pop songs.Why were our voices midi?♥♥♥♥.Our oxygen support systems were failing.I decided to go try and fix it, but one of my fellow astronauts came to me and said someobscure riddle about bending over and red rovers. Next thing you know,He's got some giant ♥♥♥♥♥ thing and he's charging me with it.I ran.Somewhere in there one of the cosmonauts become a senile old man and started whispering naughty things through our coms. In very poorly pronunciated Russian.I then returned home after a failure of repairing the systems.The return trip was succesful, thank Madden.I got home, and relaxed.And then i played Moonbase Alpha ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This game is actually cool. You can save a NASA moon base after it is hit by big rock. It's a shame how short it is....It's also the only game where typing w over and over agin into the chat box can crash a server.Then again, NASA sent the most average team to save the moon base on my play through.
