												Kinda fun driving around on the snow but:Pro's1) Animation of the vehicle is quite good and accurate (looking at images of the real things)2) Driving is passable (you slide a little on snow/ice) and larger attachments slow you down a little3) Alot of things to buy (see con's ""9"")Con's1) Can't Ski (as first person, which is strange)2) Very little to do after slopes are groomed3) The ecomony is very Simple, No real managment apart from a little ""station"" tweaking4) Very limited ""tools"" even with the 2 DLC's5) No music, limited dynamic sound6) Can't acidently run skier's over (would have been more fun if you had to avoid the skier's, or close the slope)7) People dont get on or off ski lifts they just walk into the buildings black holes8) Graphics are low quality but playable for such a cheap game9) Most of the things you buy are pointless as you very quickly get to a point where you are generating money faster than you can spend it, and if you put the ""missons"" to 2min you baiscailly have unlimited money by spam running missions.I would have like to have been able to build large snow mounds, or make my own ski tracks, Fly the helicopters, Build snow forts and trap skier's inside, Avalances and the list goes on and on, so many possiabilities and this game only provides the bare minimum to take your money, no creativity or imagination.

												Well where do i start...firstly i am a strong simulation game player YES i love simulations so i guess that makes me a bit of a pro when it comes to testing the games and giving a comment and review on a game i have played and tested, so now we come to Ski Region Simulator - Gold Edition i have played this game constant for 192 hours and find it is a very good game it has many missions and you need to keep your eye on your hotels and once in a while change your preferences to meet the holiday makers so you get a good popularity, it is very easy to play and would suit all ages and it has many tools and equipment you can buy to make the game interesting the graphics is good but could be better as we have the hardware in this day and age to have excellent graphics for this type of game but in saying that in the real world you would not see much more in the swiss alps then what you see in this game lets be honest you would see mostly mountains with snow and some cabins and that's about it.I do find that the vehicles react just as they would in real life as they slide on the snow and each vehicle has it's own carectoristics the general design of the game is good for a ski resort game as one can't expect too much for a game that only costs £6.99 let's be honest here this game should of had at least a retail price between £11.99 to £12.99 so for £6.99 which includes DLC 1 and 2 we should be very happy as they are almost giving it away.You will need to put in a lot of time playing this game to advance and achieve the the tasks of completing the achievements it has set you and this game has 18 steam achievements which are not all easy to do as it takes time to build up money to buy equipment and vehicles and run your resort (That's if you don't cheat and use any cheats to achieve the goals set for you) the hardest achievement will be to find all 100 gnomes as i have only found 68 so far as they are well hidden, i find this game will give you much enjoyment and you can even add mods to improve the game even more and maybe add more different types of missions and equipment, this game has a level editor and is single or multi-player and much more.It would be nice to see steam add more achievements and trading card drops and the developers even add more expansions as i think this game has much promise and will be a good seller to all types of game players also what would be nice is if the player can ski (1st person and 3rd person mode) in the game and see ski tournaments in the game and take part in them too and even gamble on who will win also it would be nice to see the clouds move in the sky just like real clouds and a place or large shed to store your tools and equipment that you buy also it would be nice to see vehicles parked in the car parks and RPGs coming and going from car parks and hotels and see the RPGs having snowball fights and interacting with each other like romantic couples walking together and you can interact with the RPGs too so to try to make it as real as possible, there is much one can do to take this game to the next stage of advancement, I am no game designer but if i was i could improve this game better and add more things to do and items in the game and make this game a simulation that will live in gamers minds for many years to come.I can see a couple of issues which is not nice such as the car parks don't fill up with snow as they are supposed too they always show up 100% clear also 75% of the equipment is not needed as there is no mission to use it but i am sure the developers will correct this soon.I am impessed with this game even as it stands now but would buy more DLC if ever released.This is a game you will want to have if you like simulations i agree it is not the best simulation ever made as i have seen some very top end flight sims but then they cost at least 8 to 9 times more in price and this type of sim is rare to find and at such a low price you won't get dissapointed after buying it (I have no wish to offend anyone) but for anyone to comment on a game when playing it for less then 5 hours really can't give a fare comment as to be truthful you need to give a game the chance to prove itself before anyone can give a true comment and rating and that takes lots of hours of gameplay.

												Being a big fan of Giants Software's Farming Simulator series, I was very curious about Ski Region Simulator when I first saw it.  Being Canadian, you just have to love snow, or at least like it, if you're to remain sane living here.  A love of skiing might be something you'd think of useful of this game, but you won't be snapping your boots into those bindings and shred the slopes in Whistler or Blackcomb.  You get to manage a ski resort with some pretty detailed aspects of the whole business.You start off with just 2 stations which are connected by a ski slope, and you need to ensure there's enough powder there and that it's groomed just right, which is a bit hard packed for my taste, but it's not back-country heli skiing in deep powder.There are helicopters flying around, the rescue kind, but you don't get to fly them, only bring the 'injured' skiers from some of the missions to the helipad for medivac.You get to buy more ski stations, from small to very large ones, which cost more based on their size.  Own the stations at either end of a ski slope and you own it.Then you get to build small to large support buildings all over the mountain, and these include from a simple Tourist Information outlet, to full size Conference Halls, Spa Retreats, Movie Theaters, and so on.You get to choose what kind of service is offered in each building, which have a few selections for each one.  The trick is to cover all demographics of your guests/clients, and the game has some nice statistical breakdowns to help you manage your resort.  Young, Adult, Young Senior, Family, Single, Couple, Romantic, Party, Business, poor, middle-class, rich, and so on.  Lots of info and details to manage day to day, even hour to hour.And of coure, the best part!  You get to drive all kinds of heavy machinery and 'play' in the snow.All in all I'm really enjoying this Giants title, and the Gold edition includes both DLC packs.  Also, there's some mods available, but not many.  I think the best mods for the game have been made, and still being made, by Don Chris which can be found here: (Apparently posting a link in your review is considred 'spamming'.)  So let me try to cheat here by masking the website for you.   donchris.jimdo dot comAll in all I'm very happy with this game and glad I finally decided to buy it.			"

												Basically a dulled down, even more casuasl game, than Farming Simulator. Pretty much same engine it seems, with different machines, slightly different ""economics"", but generally more of the same, but just up and down mountains, instead of fields. Only buy this if Farming Simulator isn't enough for you, otherwise stick to FS, which is the superior game.			"

												This game is not for everyone, but if you love simulations and building terrain parks for ski and snowboarding your in luck. I have played this game for over 50 hours and im still not even bored of it yet. You can buy snow cats, snowmakers, and pretty much every other machine used to make a great slope. I probably will never get bored of this game as it keeps me entertained and teaches me how to run+own a great ski slope. If you love simulators and skiing+snowboarding then this game is for you!!!

												I didn't mind this game too much.  There are alot of extra things I never needed to use to get the 100% achievements (like snow makers), but that is simply because I hired away the grooming.  You can get into more detail doing that grooming yourself, and if you are hard core then it makes sense.  It does have some tedium (like plowing parking lots), but all in all it is a casual and relaxing time waster, and that is all I asked of it.  It was bought in a bundle for maybe 75c (US) and well worth it.  It is a tough sell at full price, but look for it on sale or in a bundle and have fun with it.6.5/10			"

												7/10Basically a farming simulator clone.  If you love farming sim, then you will like this!  You won't find many better games with this much value for such a low price.  I give it a 7 because it doesn't have quite the same feeling as farming sim.  It doesn't have the depth. These guys have the sim genre down pat.  Controls are smooth and not complicated.  If you have made it this far and are reading this...BUY IT!			"

												At some point simulators just go overboard.  Most of them are garbage while a few are worth the time.  Farming Simulator 2013 was decent from many who advised me to get it but I was still skeptical.  My buddy bought me this one forcing me to play something I'm normally not into.  Honestly, for ten dollars, you kind of get what you paid for.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't say it is something I would enjoy for hours on end.  I plan on getting the ten dollars he spent out of it in gameplay since my general rule is one hour per dollar spent.  You don't actually ski in this game but you do maintain the slopes, purchase property, and do random missions for money while bailing yourself out of a bank loan.  There are needs of the people of various classes such as youths, seniors, middle class, singles, couples, etc.  They all have a happiness bar and all require something unique.  You can tailor your resort to a specific audience or do what I did and try to please all of them.  So far, I own two slopes in multiplayer with a friend.  Getting them to stay snowy and not barren can be a chore at times but when it snows you just go rake it with the piston bully you are given.  There are quite the few vehicles in the game, and the graphics are something of about 5 years ago.  Sounds are fairly decent, but the mechanics and detail of the vehicles, their attachments, and whatever else you need are done fairly well.  If you are extremely bored, get this game and give it a shot.  Otherwise, stay away, it is a money pit.			"

												This is definitely a Giants game.  Uses the same engine as the Farming Simulator 2013.  Physics aren't nessisarily perfect but atleast work.  A great deal of micromanagement is involved.  Its less take care of the slopes, more take care of the resort guest needs.  A decent selection of vehicles, they are setup to add some DLC for sure.  If you want to make money quickly it involves alot of mission running.  You can't ski but you can certainly go crazy on a snowmobile or the tracked hummer.  Overall 7/10			"

												A fan of skiing and a fan of simulation games, so this one clicked. The original map was odd, lack of simulation abilities. Kind of turned me off. Would still recommend this game, however. The modding community for this game is quite large. You'll be able to find plenty of better maps, along with other scripts and vehicles that hugely improve the game along with simulation capabilities. The way I play the game, it's actually multi-faceted and not as boring as originally.Bottom line: Vanilla game is awful, but with modifications it could be made great. 7/10.

												""Makes me wanna own and operate."" 7/10I've scored many games in many bundles over the last year, and  I must say that I couldn't be happier with this one in particular. 'Ski Region Simulator' is exactly what you'd expect out of a simulation game. It's relaxing, it's not very challenging, it works perfectly with a controller, and it offers just enough variety and just enough incentive to keep itself interesting for a good four or five hours, at least. Giving you some money and a dream, 'Ski Region' gives you the tools and the talent to take a single trail and turn it into a massive ski empire. And I'm not sure about you, but personally, I've always wanted to build my very own highly successful virtual ski resort. I guess somebody out there was listening.It's not an easy road though, as you scratch and claw your way to the very top of the premiere ski resort league, and many obstacles will surely get in your hair before the journey is through. Maintaining trails, transporting injured skiers, and other various tasks such as moving salt, and adjusting daily prices occur throughout a busy ski day and it's now your responsibility to take care of the minutia. Buy trails, hire help, and build businesses such as restaurants, schools, day-care centers, and more as you repay your loan to the bank and gain a reputation as a world class ski resort operator. And let's not forget about the vehicles like snowmobiles, tractors, and other things that are fun to drive around in the snow, messing with the trails that you hope to own some day. So like I said, this game is pretty relaxing, and if you're not looking for a challenge, then it's easy to burn a few hours trying to build a successful resort. And ten dollars is a really fair price as well, considering how well the game works with a controller and the overall quality; although the graphics are somewhat dated. 'Ski Region Simulator' is easily one of the better simulation games that I have played on Steam.			"

												As you can see, i played this game for about 22 hours. This is how long the game held my interest.The game is a unique and original idea, something i have never seen before. First playing the game, i enjoyed grooming the slopes and buying snow plows that actually push around snow! I very much enjoyed these features of the game until i started to look farther into the game.SlopesSlopes require much maintenance from grooming to delievering snow to keep the slopes in good condition. I Love all the different tools and attachments that can be used to care for your slopes. The problem i have with this is core feature of the game is the ability to ""hire a worker."" If you have played GIANTS other popular series, farming simulator, you may ask, ""why is hiring a worker so bad?"" Because you are not really hiring a worker. You pay one flat cost and your slopes are instantly in perfect condition. This has ruined the core featue of the game for me. There is absolutely no point in buying or paying to maintain any equiptment for your slopes when you can have your slopes groomed instantly.Parking Lots/Plows/SaltWell when the core feature of the game has been ruined, there is still caring for your parking lots that no one parks on. Yes, you spend time clearing parking lots of snow that no ai traffic goes through to park, not even magicly appear in a parking spot. Well okay, clearing snow is still sort of fun.. Using snow plows i expected some monster of a plow that pushes away all the snow in its path mush like you see in real life, but in this game all it does is make one small path that would make clearing a parking lot take hours of real life time. Well when plows are horrible at their job what do you turn to? Salt. Salt is nothing special, we see it on the back of all snow plow trucks but in real life, tell me, do you instantly see it destroy all the snow it touches? No? well it does in this game. Salt is extremely overpowered and makes clearing parking lots too easy.In the end, there is no real gameplay that is worth your time and turns this simulator into a micromanagment mini-game.			"

												No idea what i am doing,this game is simillar to FS series.This game is driving me up a wall,it's just hard to understand the concept of the game just like FS.I pretty hate FS series and SRS.I'm a casual player and i just want to understand the game easily and clearly.If you guys want a good simulator,just go for Euro Truck Simulator.In addition,The tramway controling part is sort of fun to me,i enjoy this part very much.But after a few times of controling the tramway,i got nothing to do anymore and i have lost in this game.This isnt what i expect for a casual game,however it was just my opinion.Besides sp gameplay,there are almost no one play in mp.It's hard to find a player to play mulitplayer with you unless you have a friend to play with.I can told you the mp community is almost dead.Therefore,i only recommend this game if you love theme like ski or manage ski resort.If you do you would love this game very much.pick this up when it is on sale and buy a copy to your friend for more joy and delight "

												It's not the greatest game and there is clearly a lot that could of been done. If you are dying to play a game where you operate a ski place, then yeah this is for you.Otherwise, it's not really a game I could recommend. It is basically just farming simulator except with a different map, different vehicles.			"

												Just when I was about to give up on work related simulators, along comes Ski Region simulator. I wasn't expecting much from the game, but I couldn't pass up the deal I was given, so I bought it and I am very glad I did. It is a remake of Farming simulator 2013 to farm skis slopes and invest in a swiss alps ski community. What a enjoyable contrast to most other simulator games I own and consider it one of my top favorites!			"

												This game is made by the makers of Farming Simulator, so I thought I would love it. But there really isn't a whole lot to do in this game. Its mostly just grooming the hills, which consists of driving a machine up and down, up and down, and up and down again. This is basically all you do, plus plow some snow once in  a while. Even though it was cheap, I would say its (in my case) $10.99 out the window			"

												As someone who has worked in the ski resort industry for over 10 years, I was interested in trying this game out. My thoughts on the game:-It's boring and repetative-The economic system is unbalanced and makes no sense-The managment system seems to have no effect on anything and does not contribute to the success of the resortIn other words: It is the most accurate simulator of anything, ever.
