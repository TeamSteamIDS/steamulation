												This game is unique to the genre because it has an Evolutionary Human Emulator (EHE). This is the name given to the game's AI. Each country in the game has it's own unique AI system, which evolves the more you play the game. Each country has certain priorities and takes actions according to the perceived outcome of its actions. As you play, the EHE ""learns"" new behaviors, drawing connections between actions it didn't know existed and updates previous connections. This EHE makes for very thrilling and unique situations the more you play. There is a dedicated community that has been keeping the game up to date for the last 12 years. Taking into account the community mods available: the game is set in 2015, practically every nation in the world has updated GDP, population, military values, treaties and diplomatic relations. Also with mods, you can now fight Hezbollah, Taliban, Daesh/Islamic State, etc. There's also mods that set the world in WW2 or the Cold War, all these are also turned into multiplayer sessions.  Play in multiplayer matches with your friends and conquer the world together. Or play peacefully and manipulate the world through proxy-wars, espionage, subterfuge, black market funding, economic exploitation and diplomatic cunning. Play in multiplayer matches with 20+ other world leaders and roleplay an international community as you wage cold wars, forge alliances and strive to develop into superpowers. In multiplayer matches, it is common for the host to set ""rules"" for the lobby to abide by, which keeps order and stability to the game world. When you have a good server with a good host, this game rivals that of any strategy multiplayer experience. If you're into geography, history, politics or current events, you'll love this game. Play in singleplayer sandbox mode: design your own military units, transform the economy of Malawi to have the largest share of fruits and vegetables in the world, become a monarchy and ally with the royal families of the Arab world, start a pan-African/Middle-East Alliance to counter the global North, create covert ops cells to steal military secrets from China, research nuclear weapons, deploy and launch your ballistic missile subs off the coast of India, declare war and conquer your neighbors, then trade conquered territory to your allies, give money to the poorest nations of the world and watch them develop into regional powers, build attack helicopters and put them up for sale, force Israel to annex the West Bank and then watch WW3 unfold. In terms of gameplay, you can set your own game speed. The pace really depends on you. The game technically never ends. So you can choose to get to year 2100 in two hours, or you can play for hours and only get to year 2030. The learning curve is not as hard as you might think. It's way easier to learn than Europa Universalis or Dominions, if you ask me. It's not nearly as buggy as it is made out to be. Judging by its low-scores on IGN and Gamespot, you'd think this game would be unplayable; it's a complete exaggeration. The game is very much alive through its Steam and Gog communities. It also has fantastic modular support that allows many new features, such as changing your country's name in-game. This game is actually one of the most powerful pieces of educational software available. If you're an educator, I highly recommend this game to you. Supposedly, this game has been used by governmental agencies worldwide. If you're a parent, buy this game for your children. I know of countless people who grew up with Civilization I & II or approached the game later in life and learned so much about history from it. This game has a very similar effect on people. Don't know the population of Bangladesh? Not for long. When you play this game, you'll learn quickly where all of the most populous countries are, who produces all of the world's tobacco, as well as the difference between Bahrain and Brunei. It's worth more than its price on Steam for just the reference/educational value alone. It's like a digital encyclopedia. The depth of this game is a bit difficult to explain:  There's 193 default countries,each with up to ~30 territories/provinces,each territory/province has a production value for 24 different resources, each territory/province has a population that is divided into under 15, 15-65 and 65+, each of these population categories contributes to the territories consumption of resources,each of the resources is listed in the world market and traded with all of the other territories from all of the other countries in the world, each of the resources have a tax rate that is adjusted by the player,each of the countries have a dynamic economic ranking that id based upon them meeting their production/consumption ratio, political stability, human development level, etc. that determines their priority in the world trading list,each territory/province also has its own infrastructure and telecommunications level that is influencable by the player, each country in the world has it's own budget sliders for ~12 different spending options (health care, military research, education, tourism, etc.)each country has its own expenses based on debt, political corruption, imports, budget sliders, etc.each country has its own inflation rating, interest level, GDP/per capita, personal income tax....that's just economicWhen it comes to politics:Each of the 193 countries has its own approval, stability and corruption ratingInternal laws (illegal/legal freedom of speech, child labour, polygamy, abortion, etc.) Government type (democracy, communist, theocracy, dictatorship, monarchy, etc.)Capitol city (can be relocated)LanguagesReligionsImmigration and EmigrationPolitical partiesTreaties which are divided into ~15 typesDiplomatic relations with every other nation in the game (from -99 =biggest enemy, 99=best ally)These diplomatic relations are influenced by the similarity between their religions, languages, government type and treaties.These diplomatic relations determine everything from who the AI chooses to trade with, goes to war with, builds military units from, etc. The military side of things are equally compelling...~12 unit designs (infantry, bombers, tanks, fighter jets, artillery, etc.)~12 stats for each unit (speed, stealth, missile damage, gun precision, armor, etc.)~10 levels of military technology (i.e. stealth 1, stealth 2, stealth 3, stealth 4, etc.)Each country has an infrastructure level that determines how many units it can build concurrently (infrastructure is determined on a territory/province basis and influencable by player decisions)Each country is automatically ranked for its worldwide competitive compared to every other country in the worldEach type of unit can be named by the playerEach unit can be sold to the world marketEach unit can be trained up to three timesEach unit can be build domestically or outsourced (built by an ally)Each unit can be merged into army stacks and moved anywhere on earth that you have military access to (regions you control or that of military allies)Each army stack can be sent into a battleI disagree that this game has a bad community, as other reviewers have said. I also disagree that the political, military and economic spheres lack depth.			"

												I rarely write reviews, but I MUST contribute here.Where to begin! Well... I’ve probably put in over 1000 hours of play into this glorious gem over the years. Incredibly detailed slider control over just about every relevant aspect of a country. You can micro-manage just about everything.  Such as, determining exactly which natural resources to exploit, how much money goes into building infrastructure, and which religion you want to convert your population too. Not a big fan of micromanagement? No problem! let the AI handle the areas you don’t want to bother with. Every decision matters and can have huge consequences. Take control over military research, including nuclear arsenals, naval, and land. Battles on land and sea have neat little animation scenes. Nuclear conflicts are VERY satisfying. Reminds me fondly of the War Games movie in the 90s. The game is a bit dated now, but still looks and feels nice on a new PC. Unfortunately does not support high resolutions but, once you get past this, it’s worth every penny and every minute in playtime.There is really something quite satisfying about turning Gaza Strip and the West Bank into a global superpower! Or perhaps you would like to nuke Canada? Then this is for you.			"

												I highly reccomend this! I love RTS strategy games and this one is quite interesting. I like the game for It's economic system and how the AI Doesn't completely fail in the economic side, unlike Supreme Ruler where the AI builds nothing but Tanks, jets, naval stuff, ect ect, this is quite fun. I have already put 44 hours into the game and in that amount of time, i managed to turn county's like the Congo and Israel into superpowers. It's not all about agression in this game, it's about getting on everyones good side. You can't just simply take a random country and just build tons of units and destroy the world. It takes time and i love the way it does it. You have to sometimes depend on other country's for aid and you have to work your way up bit by bit untill you can actually annex something. I love how the resources work, I mean, you don't have to manage resources all the time. You can get that all privitised and let your people expand it. That doesn't work all the time, you need to put some money into it so you can help your resources grow and the people will carry that duty on. Let's say Canada was the leader in Dairy production and you take that place, Canada will start to hate you and I love how it works.Nukes, oh how I love them. They are not too over-powered, but yes they do pack a punch in this game. Nukes are quite cheap, depending on what nation you play as,but they take a long time to build and are quite expensive to maintain them. In packs, nukes can destroy populations and damage your enemy's resources heavily and turn military's to dust. Think before you use nukes, because using nukes will devistate your relations with other country's and if you use nukes in very small packs... Well, you will be better off throwing toothpicks at your enemy.Here's where it gets bad. This game wasn't really made for Windows 7 or 8 and so it tends to crash a little bit. There are bugs in the game where some country's are nothing but luck to try and set up for becoming a superpower. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rebels and some others. There's also a bug where you can't take certain land and so on. The game really does have some downfalls, sometimes relations tend to mess up. I got nuked by Russia and instead of people hating Russia, they started to hate me more. I don't understand this much, but it doesn't matter as long as you have a much more powerful military then your enemy's.Is it worth the price considering the bugs? YES! You might get annoyed from the bugs, but indeed it's a fun game. Very easy to get used to and you will always find new ways to beoming powers. If it's from economic domination to just pure agression.			"

												I have played this game for longer than I can remember, so much that I bought it as soon as I saw it on Steam without even considering where the money is coming from, a new type of Multiplayer has been added from the previous title with the help of Steam, this game was also Greenlit by the community, the game itself can be improved with much needed setting changes and most issues with startup can be prevented by allowing of the joshua.exe which may may see as a virus, of which of course it is not.I recommend this game to anyone who plays games such as Europa Universalis IV, as its a Modern Day Simulation built on the basis of real information in the time it was set, on release before Steam it had bugs and so on, but doesn't every game? Which have been on a constant fix since the games release and reviews by gamers such as myself have decided to help bring this game forward with the hope of SuperPower 3.The game itself focuses on the year 2001 start date, where you take a country in the world and forge an empire, either through your politics, economy or military, just remember that when you take over the world, there is nothing left to take over! The game itself is the sort of game that puts you into a Multiplayer experience unlike any other, where you can RolePlay (RP) country politics, such as terrorists in Iraq or Russia invades Ukraine like the real world, the game itself is a brilliant Modern Day Simulator and I have played literly every game in this time period and will say, this is the best I have ever seen, I just dream of the day of the release of SuperPower 3.How can you go wrong for £7.19 - £8.99 or less, depending on what it is for this review? Usually they charge huge prices for games like this, its a bargain in my personal opinion.I hope to see you online! Get the game and lets start playing!			"

												I love this game. The epitome of being simple yet complex featuring economic control, politics and a lot of military options. I think what makes it stand out from a lot of GeoSim games are the fact that you have so much freedom. From the tax rate, languages your people speak to how many kids they can have... it's up to you. Plus, ain't no country like my sweet, sweet Djibouti.

												Superpower 2 has a great concept, having the potential of dominating the entire Earth. Which is different from pretty much any game I've ever seen (except Shadow President). I love this game, I love everything about it. So you may be wondering ""Why did you not recommend this game?"".You see this game is perfect in every way (like I have said) apart from one major flaw which kills the game, puts it in a coffin and buries it in the ground. You can only play this game for a short amount of time after paying money for it. I played it for around 5 minutes before it crashed. And I'm not the only one. If you go onto the forum page, you'll find hundreds of accounts of the game crashing or the game encountering a fatal error. And most of them are from 2014. It is now 2015 and the game still isn't fixed!Because of this, it is absolutely impossible for me to give this game a positive review as I can only play it for about 2 minutes before I get forced to stop for having too much fun. The game had potential. The game could have been something special.			"

												As an old user of this game since 2009, it is very exciting to get its steam edition with lots of improvement. It does not only still sustain its own strong points, which are noticeably distinguished from other strategy games, but also gets free from some previous unrealistic and exaggerating weakness. If you prefer to strategic game genre, this game is worth being played.			"

												I really want to recommend this game to people, but there are just too many flaws with this thing for me to do so. First of all, the way battles are done in this game is crap. When you invade a country, what happens is all of your and the enemy country's troops move into the same spot and have one really large battle, after which your enemy's armies are completely obliterated (or yours if you screwed up), leaving you to capture all their points with little resistance. The interface for this game is also pretty bad; they tried to go for a minimalist approach, which would be good for a regular strategy game, but in a grand strategy game such as this you'd want as much information as reasonably possible on screen at the same time, which this game fails to do in a way that's not stupid (you get to open a bunch of windows that can get cluterred very easily, and it can sometimes take a lot of fighting with the interface to get to the information you want). There's very little flavor to the game as well; if you're coming from Paradox games like I did, or even from Creative Assembly games, both of which have a lot of historical flavor in their games, you might be a bit disappointed with what you see here. I guess there's a bit of flavor in the tutorial missions and in early game when the game has some startlingly plausible events take place based on the data within the game that was ""taken from U.S. military and C.I.A. databases"" as the box proudly proclaims (I've had a Pakistan vs. India war in my game, and have heard of stories of the Arab Spring happen in some people's games despite this game being released years before the Arab Spring took place), but other than that the game can get very boring very quick if you're in it for the flavor, unless you aren't looking for historical flavor in a history simulator.Also, you're playing Russian Roulette if you buy this game to play it on a newer computer. Despite all the fixes, this game still refuses to work on newer computers, and getting any support is next to impossible from what I've seen. You'll also need to be connected to the internet just to start the thing.			"

												I got this game two days ago when it was on sale for $2.49. I thought it would be one of those games you get, play once, and then never touch it again, and I though; well I’d play that for two and a half hours so I guess it was worth it. I then went in and did the tutorial and then got into the game. Automatically I chose America, like most people who choose their home country, and at an instant I realized I was dead wrong, this game is absolutely amazing.In this game you control one of over 150 countries; you manage their politics, economy, and military while dealing with debt, invasion, terrorism, natural disasters, and nuclear annihilation. Politics allow you to create treaties, change laws, and change your government (for instance democracy to communism). In your economy you will first have to get your country out of debt, then you have to manage your budget, inflation, interest, income tax, resource production, financial aid and agreements, and trade. Finally, military; your military can be either your life saver or your demise depending on your economy and diplomatic relations. In your military you can build, buy, sell, and deploy troops and vehicles. Besides that you can design your own units and research more technology for better stats on your designed units. If you are have a problem with another country why not strike them with your entire nuclear arsenal or send covert ops into their country and wreak havoc on their product and economy.But this game isn't perfect. The games multiplayer doesn't run unless you open unsecure ports on your router. Your military can't invade a country unless your navy is 750 km away from your enemy’s shore, but if they have even a single boat within 1500 km of your navy you can't invade and occasionally the enemies ships don’t appear and you can't make a land invasion, which is beyond frustrating. But besides that I haven't run into to many other problems.So is this game worth your $10? Yes. Would I recommend you wait until a sale? Not necessarily, it would be better if you did but this game is worth the full price. I've played this game for roughly 14 hours and t has become one of my favorites.			"

												I decieded to remake this review, as the previous one was a bit disorganized.Wasting more than 1000 hours of my life on this game, I hope you can trust me with this review. That being said, welcome to Superpower 2. Superpower 2 is a ""geopolitical simulator"" sandbox game, you can design and build units, wage war, annex territories and entire nations, and a whole lot more. All in all, you play as the country you'd like.Now I can't stress this enough, this game is made in 2001. There will be broken things, but you can overcome them (more about that in a bit), and a word of advice, if the game doesn't work for you, don't write a damn negative review. Just because the game doesn't work for you doesn't mean it'll work for others.There is singleplayer and multiplayer. Singleplayer can be fun for a while, but the AI is incredibly stupid and doesn't do much, add to the fact that there are long-term bugs in the vanilla game, singleplayer gets really boring.Multiplayer is the GO TO place for this game. Or atleast, if you want to have real fun and challenges. Now, there are plenty of bad servers that go up through the day with abusive hosts, but there are also RP servers. RP as in roleplay. Now some are good, and some are bad. But assuming you know a thing or two about geopolitics, they can be a HELL lot of fun. Despite playing through hundreds of them, each experience is different. Some games don't last long and are really boring, whilist others are really intense.The drawback is that its really hard to get into, espicially since you do need some experience prior to getting into the servers that I'd personally recommend. As for the bugs in this game, the game CAN be modded and there are plenty of mods. This fixes the games bugs and can make the game way more fun. There's one for present day, cold war, WW2, and I'm working on WW1 right now.That being said, I can't really recommend this game for everyone, I was little when I first discovered this game and waited years for it to be greenlit, I do not regret buying this, I've made so many friends here. Nonetheless, if you're interested in geopolitics, and think you might be getting into some good stuff, by all means, buy it. It's not that expensive, either.The only real downsides I can say is that once you get used to it, the game is not very complex. And there are some ""bugs"" (i.e stackdropping) that mods cannot overcome. But these can be overlooked fairly easily.			"

												The Year is 2015.I am the new Prince of Monaco.Little do they know that I am a semi-GOD who has the gift of Immortality.From day one I start my rule by granting all rights like Poligamy, Same Sex Marriage and Legalising Drugs; soon, hedonistic parties and drug filled orgies would be a common thing to find in the streets of Larvotto and in the high-rises of Fontvieille.I banned all the heretic foreign languages and forced everyone to speak the divine Monegasque.But it wasn't enough, I needed to expand my faith despite having only 30000 loyal servants to my cause.Diplomacy and subterfuge were key: infiltrating in every NGO's worldwide helped me creating plots and alliances, which were immediatly broken when it was convenient to do so.Tensions started to rise between NATO and the Russian block and the one to light the fuse was...me.After False Flagging a terrorist attack in Turkey, and blaming Iran, the former attacked the latter and World War 3 started.Soon, my secret agents would infiltrate the Russian missile Silos and launch a nuclear strike worldwide.The US never stood a chance: under a barrage of a 1000 nukes Fallout 4 suddenly became a reality, with it's population dropping from 500k to 100k.Russia soon fell under military occupation by Sweden while half of Europe was burnt to ashes.With my demi-god powers, I took advantage of this situation and developed Monaco into an Agricultural and Raw Resources powerhouse, regardless of the fact that I had no space whatsoever for crops or for digging up resources.Population grew and soon, in just 2 km2, it reached 500k, all stacked up in luxurius and gigantic towers.But one nation was envious of my success, Greece.After breaking diplomatic ties the hellenic cowards launched a series of terrorist attacks destroying the sacred temple of the MFF Threesome, one of the main structures of the Monegasque faith.Revenge was mandatory: after destroying their Feta cheese industries I blew up their Government which was swiftly replaced by one aligned with my ideology.The Hedonistic Hellenic Republic of Greece and Macedonia was born.Now the year is 2700.Monaco now has 3 bil in population and has recently bought from a greatly depopulated France the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Corsica regions, is now the 12th economic power and has nuclear weapons and advanced warfare tech.Soon the Liguria region will be taken away from those filthy Italians and the dream of a Greater Monaco will  be complete.All is good and well in the Kingdom of Heaven.UPDATE:The year is 3900, a devastating plague has devoured many countries around the globe, literally exterminating the populace of every country it has hit.Countries like France, Netherlands, UK, USA, Mexico and many others are devoid of life.In order to face the crisis of this very dangerous disease I decided to go Full Metal Trump and surrounded Greater Monaco with a gigantic and luxurious wall made of diamonds and gold, with a gigantic writing in monegasque ""If you are going to die slamming on my wall you might as well do it while looking at something pretty"".The french, stacked in millions around my defenses, pleaded me to open up for immigration, but I knew that it was already too late for them; also, as ordered by the Divine Monegasque Goddess of Mockery (I forgot to say that the pantheon of monegasque gods throughout the years grew larger and larger), I placed swinger parties right at the border just to mock the suffering disease-ridden french.After a few months they were all dead.Now the few surviving countries that remain are taking advantage of this situation by expanding into these depopulated territories.Even I expanded the borders of Monaco by annexing the whole of France, England and Wales (Scotland is placed under quarantine) and declaring the new Greater Monaco Empire.But this New World Order does not come without tensions: the isle of Fiji, now a pension powerhouse composed primarily of old aged retired workers (roughly 70% of it's populace, out of 15 bil, the rest are nurses), is trying to dominate the world market by mass-producing diapers for old people.With the stocks plummeting and an ever-increasing inflation, the world may fall into a new World War, what will Monaco do? .

												A decent 2004 game if you can get past the frequent crashes (every hour) and you are willing to take the time to get the hang of the weird and flawed economy system. You basically have to abuse the economy system and abuse the design flaws to have a working economy. I bought it for 2 bucks, it's okay for that price.			"

												SuperPower 2 has to be the best Geo-Political Grand Strategy-esque game I have ever played. This game is almost a genre of its own. My first game I thought I would start off playing as the Congo (Not to be confused with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our big neighbor to the east) to give myself a bit of an extra challenge. It turns out that I accidentally picked the easiest country to play as in Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to the DRotK's whopping GDP per Capita of 52$/year, the Congo seemed cozy at ~14k/capita/year. You don't need to know all of the terminology and the geography involved with Geo-Politics (although it does help) because the game has a tooltip function that is both concise and descriptive enough to be a very useful tool. One of my favorite aspects of the game has to be designing my own military units. Although the number of parts of designing the look of your unit is limited, modifying the stats is where the fun comes in. You can make your unit a cheap, low quality overall or high quality specific, or an expensive, all-around excellent machine. The detailed political system in the game models International organizations like the EU, NATO, WHO, and many, many, MANY others. And if that isn't enough, you can start your own! Finished developing your nation in Africa yet? Go ahead and start the African Union and limit membership to African nations only, and help your struggling brethren climb out of the hole that you yourself just emerged from. Then, form an alliance with your fellow African nations to form a strong military coalition that can threaten even NATO. Or, you can take advantage of the struggling nature of your fellow African nations and use your advantageous position and conquer them all and have all of Africa for yourself, you evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ;). Don't worry about the age of the game, the game, unlike others its age, has stayed compatible through the ages, and will work up to Windows 8 x64 (what I have), so do not fret. This game will run at maximum performance on your common everyday laptop (also what I have XD), so there is really no reason to not get it unless you are simply uninterested in the topic of the game. And hey! If you are a heathen 'Merican pig like me, this game will help you learn about foreign politics and also the good it could do for the US and the rest of the world if we trimmed our military budget down to a reasonable size, and began investing in healthcare and more foreign aid. :D 10/10 would play Turkey and get annexed by Iran, then launch my ICBM's from my last province and kill 90% of their population in a last-minute ""♥♥♥♥ you too, buddy!"" again.

												Bwee. This be similar to the grand strategy titles made by Paradox, except it is set in the present day and has no real time limit. Like those Paradox games, you can pick any country you choose and you more or less choose your own objectives. Unlike the Paradox games however, SP2 is chiefly a multiplayer game since the AI isn't very good and either brings countries to ruin or become completely outclassed by player-controlled countries to such a degree that there is little real challenge in solo games. Therefore if you are no fan of multiplayer, I would probably avoid this game.But... the multiplayer can be pretty good in this game when you get a good group of players together, and there are enough people still playing this that you can get good games fairly often. However, if you are looking to play this game online, extensive knowledge of the nations you play and the modern world in general is pretty much required. Hosts for this game tend to be elitist and have few qualms about kicking and banning people who play 'unrealistically' in their games. While this may sound obnoxious (and it sorta is), this also helps keep games interesting rather than just devolving into world war nukefests that, while fun the first time, rapidly loses its appeal after that. In other words, the multiplayer for this game is ideal for people with in-depth knowledge about the modern geopolitical scene and are able to apply that knowledge to their gameplay.The game itself is pretty solid and does not take too long to learn, but there are numerous issues. Aside from the AI being generally bad, runtime errors can ruin your fun and crash your game with virtually no warning. The world economy tends to destroy itself after a few decades, though mods try to fix this and are almost always used in multiplayer games. The game does send ""mails"" about high-priority events like economic problems or the use of nuclear weapons, but other events, such as when other nations start a nuclear program or even when wars break out, can slip by almost totally unnoticed. Lastly, the game is lacking some critical elements that are major parts of the modern world, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that keeps almost every country in the world from building nuclear weapons. This is something that would be particularly useful for multiplayer games, where too many people build secret nuke stockpiles that can end up ruining games because the lack of information the game gives about them. This can result in a small nation building a giant nuke stockpile, and then using it, without anyone else having the faintest idea this was going on until it was too late. From my observations, secret nuclear stockpiles and their usage are a major cause for multiplayer games ending early, with few people wanting to play after a nuclear apocalypse.Overall, SP2 is a competent and deep multiplayer strategy game that, nevertheless, has enough glaring issues to lead me to suggest that anyone looking to buy this game should think carefully about it (and probably wait for a sale). When played right, it is an excellent game with endless amounts of replay value. But since these good games rely on every other player in the game not acting like a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ patience and a willingless to put up with some annoyances is also necessary to enjoy this game. But if you are able to endure all the irritants that this game and its players can throw your way, then you will find an often very fun experience awaiting you. :)			"

												As far as I can tell (just from the reviews), I am one of the most active players of Superpower 2. I played the first Superpower game a ton as a kid and when I found out SP2 was on Steam, I couldn't buy it fast enough. The game is a little buggy, sure, but not as bad as some make it seem. This game has allowed me to do digitally what I'd do with physical maps and pens as a kid. Geography/Political nerds will absolutely love this game.			"

												It's a little outdated, and a bunch of the strings appear to have been translated incorrectly from French, but the game itself is awesome. This is by far the best superpower simulator (way, way better than ""Us&Them"") currently available. That said, there are some easy-mode almost cheaty things the game lets you do that can ruin the experience a bit. Civilian espionage is probably top of that list. It's far too easy right now to build a super-power from nothing by spying on the civilian sectors of larger countries that do not employ large spy networks. India and Taiwan are great examples. Spy a few times on each sector and suddenly you've got a trade surplus in those areas without having to make massive capital investments. That said, turning a tiny Pacific Island nation into a massive nuclear superpower is part of this game's attraction, so a little unrealism can be forgiven.			"

												I'm just gonna let everyone know what my opinion is on the game.I love it. It's one the best geopolitical simulators out there, if not the best.But, fact is, while I'm extremely happy that it's released on Steam, it's still a broken mess. These ""features"" for Steam are already present in the non-steam version as mods (modifications for the base game), it's not new. For whatever reason the fullscreen option has been removed (yes you heard that right you can play with fullscreen on the non-steam version), and the widescreen resolutions (which was also present in the non-steam version) are still broken.I love this game, I really do, but unless the developers fail to adress these issues, it is going to fail. I can recommend it, but do not expect a game superior to the GolemLabs version, the Steam release might boost this game up in popularity, but the word has to come out that this game still has problems that are not yet addressed by the developers.Also, the screenshots on the store page do not represent the game at all, they are early screenshots of the game released by GolemLabs.

												        There is no other way to put it, if you have any interest in geopolitics, history or just wondered what would happen if the US were to launch all their nukes into a random country than this game is for you! I first got this game at a EB games (When those were still around haha) and I loved it except for the fact it was more buggy than a camping trip and crashed so often I thought it was in the code. Well with this Steam version all those problems has been addressed. I haven't had a single issue when it comes to game breaking bugs or glitches and in fact the game runs a lot smoother and faster than the box version.         For those who haven't even heard of this gem, it is a geopolitical simulator that goes deeper than any other geopolitical simulator I have ever played. You will lose hours micromanaging your country from internal laws that can affect foreign relations, to trying to balance your economy. All of which is important if you want to build or maintain your Superpower status. You can set the game up as you like either playing premade sceienos or by setting up a sandbox game. But if you are feeling lonely sitting on your throne, Superpowers 2 offers a multiplayer side too.      Superpowers 2 is a unquie simulator that just got it second chance at gaming life. This game is pure politics, pure simulation, and pure fun. If you are a fan of the Civ games or any kind of politcal simulator than this is a must buy for you.			"

												I have the first Super Power on disc. It's a simple game where you get to essentially pick a country and rule the world. There is really no way to fail other than Unexpectedly get invaded by every other nation on earth because you are growing too powerful Get nuked by every other country that has nukes, without warning, because once again you have grown too powerful.In Superpower 2, you could say that the difficulty has been ramped up exponentially.NATO, controlling over 1/3 of the countries, is extremely powerful and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off will have you bombarded with assassination and espianage attempts every fifteen seconds. If you try to invade a NATO country, this is exactly what will happen to you. It is very annoying.Additionally, you have to really, really work hard to manage your resources as they will be the determining factor of economic growth. And thusly, how much stuff you can research and churn out of your factories.If you are ethnically anything other than American or Chinese, and you want to see your ethnicity rule the world (or at least part of it) this game will be excruciatingly hard for you. You will definitely want to save after every invaded country. I have yet to make it past invading Slovenia as Hungary, simply because I'm getting roughly 50 messages every minute because of either the US, Germany, England or France throwing as many covert ops units as they can at me simply because I decided to redraw some borders.Like I said, it's very, very hard.

												When I first bought this game I was expecting something along the lines of DEFCON. I guess I got that, with a touch of civilization (minus the turn base), and ultimate control over diplomacy/markets.This game is interesting to say the least, and was worth the buy ON SALE. This game as stated previous, gives you a world map (or the Earth in 3D) and you are allowed to choose a nation. With this nation you can build up your military, work your political magic, and look after your monetary situation. The military tab you are allowed to build anything that walks to anything that treads water to anything that may fly in the air. You can also customize vehicles which is a brilliant perk. In this tab is also covert military actions which allow you to manipulate political structures around the planet, and there is also a nuclear launch missile control available as well. Onto the 2nd tab which is the political station, one can choose whether they want to be fascist, communist, socialist or whatever. You also get to decide internal laws such as same-sex marriage and can limit how many kids a family can have. The diverse control the game lets you take into your hands is amazing. Some would say it's better left to the computer (which you can have) and some say it's better to micro manage (which you can choose to have as well)! I like the fact you are given the chance to choose what you want. Within the third tab which is the monetary settings, you can literally choose what you want to fund down to the level. Want to enhance education? Go ahead? Want to fund the military, screw it and do it! You can build more nukes if you'd like, or heck start getting covert warfare going by hiring some spies and sending them to other countries. And yes, nuking is oddly satisfying but really can screw up your political reputation. What is another cool feature is that you can watch your units fight the opposing side in real time (double left click on the battle to see).Another interesting feature is that anywhere in the world you can right click and do quick treaties, such as alliances, common markets, weapon trade (or even embargo), research partners (and a lot more choices - you can even annex countries). BUT.... (DEVS PAY ATTENTION HERE)!The only few complaints I have is that you are not able to use the keyboard to quickly select which countries are in for what treaties, and can get extremely annoying using the mouse to select EVERYTHING (especially on the menus). Another complaint is that some countries are literally impossible to select. Even if you right click and attempt to do a quick treaty, sometimes if you try clicking on Israel you'll get Palestine. Same thing with Chile and Argentina. Overall good game. Would be even more intense if they let you control the units when you can watch them fight. I would give this game an 8 if it was something that was truly unique to it's genre. Even though it didn't hit an 8, I would recommend buying on sale and playing!RATING : 7.65/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-EDIT : Just had the game crash... Joshua.exe stopped working ?			"

Posted: July 22, 2014
												Ricks ReviewSummary:Gameplay: 9/10 - Simple and complex political-combat-economic action which is realistic yet playable.Combat: 8/10 - Very basic combat mechanics which require the construction of units, from Land, Sea, Air and Infantry. Many unit types are customizable for better battle performance and outcomes for the selected state. However in battle the player can not perform direct actions in the battle screen and is mearly the observer to the battle.Politics: 9/10 - Limited in political details compared to games like Ruler of Nations and Masters of the Universe. But the game provides very indepth fields around the countries language and religious demographics, laws and government types. Although little is made in the changing of demographics, laws and governments except from saying Yes, No or Maybe. It does allow for a detailed and easy way for you to create your nation.Economics: 9/10 - Amazing, indepth field of economics which allows the player to experience how the economics of any nation works. Through trading, diplomacy and domestic taxes, you can influence how your economy sways. Managing the budget can be tricky and challenging in various states, it is exciting and sometimes thrilling to compare various strategies and tactics which can improve the states economy.Audio: 9/10 - Dynamic music to the situation, losing, winning and nuclear war are the main music types.UI: 5/10 - Beautiful UI for the game type, however can be a bit quirky in situations. Where the movement of troops can be difficult and unpredictable where the units move several miles from the intended location.Technical Side: 7/10 - Editor fails in stability and many stability and technical issues arise in the main game. Sometimes with many players experiencing game crashing on high-spec scenarios like nuclear war, dramatic economic changes or huge wars.Moddability: 6/10 - Various mod types are available from historical scenarios to gameplay changes/additions to some fantasy and hypothetical scenarios, you can experience a game where Hitler wins or Communism is supreme. However the poor score is detailed because of its poor modding methods and editor, with its poor technical stability on modern computers and the extent of the moddability to scenarios only, it can limit potential and the lifespan of the game.Community: 5/10 - Although this is not directly affected by the game, there is a large community atlarge in this game. However do expect a lot of bitter members which vary.Servers & multiplayer: 2/10 - I honestly enjoy Roleplaying servers and messing around with servers. But it is so difficult and awkward to start a server, it is not worth the trouble. And starting a public server risks potential hackers, trolls and generally unwanted visitors. Although you can enforce passwords and friends only, those threats can exist still.Main Points:This game was made back in 2004, making the technology behind the game pretty old compared to modern standards, but with the games potential it proves superior among many other titles. But before considering buying the game, make sure to get into contact with other players to compare specs and computer technology to make sure the game will work on your machine.Great Gameplay for a Political Simulation game which extends to Combat, Politics and Economy which can diversify depending on the nation you play as.Amazing dynamic audio which changes depending on the current situation of your state or the global situation.Stability can be poor on modern computers and the modding editor will not work on Windows 8.Servers can be hard to set up and not advisable for quick games with friends.Improvements:Improve upon the modding capabilities to allow for modern computers to be accepting to the capability. Meaning modern computers can use the editor or an alternative means to mod the game. And making sure the player can mod anything in the game, from scenario to UI to menus.Improve the servers by making sure a anti-cheat/hack system is installed and allowing for every player to create their own servers with players capable of joining.

												I only just found this game since apparently it's been resurrected for Steam from an older incarnation.  It's a great, deep strategy game and that's easily seen even after only playing for a few hours. One of my favorite games of all time was Third World War which was available for the Sega CD waaay back in the day. I LOVED that game and have always looked for something comparable on PC. Well, here it is!			"

												If you want to control a country to greatness or just to see it's demise, this is for you. 193 countries... Think about that for a second. Thats 193 countries to control, and 1 for you to conquer with. Great game, 9/10 strategyonly bad thing, is that the AI is kinda noobish, and when you invade a country it'll send all its military into that one battle. This doesn't happen ALL the time, but at some times it does.			"

												My honest opinion on this game: If you like the ldea if managing a country, world dominance, and maintaining relations with the world. This would be a game you'd enjoy. But you must be patient as it frequently crashes. Usually by year 2040-2050 an autarky bug kicks in which causes the world's trade to essentially end occurs(unless ofcourse you download mods). I suggest getting into the Rp servers in this game as they tend to be more enjoyable(depending on how you want to play the game) while other superpower 2 games that are full conquest can be fun if you form a team to take over the world and form massive empires to later betray eachother if another player becomes more threatening. This game has fun and it has ALOT of faults, i suggest the best time buying this game is during a sale, otherwise you might feel ripped off.			"

												I have absolutely no idea how this game recieved positive reviews. It is riddled with an insane amount of bugs, often which make the game unplayable.The user interface is shocking, unintuitive and incredbly basic. You are incredibly limited in what you do.There is absolutely no realism, you set your taxes to 80% and you take a popularity hit - ride the wave out for a few months (with no negative effects) and then your back with high support and rolling in cash.There is also no realism with ""treaties"" either. Want to enter the EU, but defy every requirement? No worries, just request to join and they will most likely accept.Warfare? Absolutely ridiculous. Disband your army, hire a new one with max stats and train them to be ""elite"". You can steamroll over the entirity of Europe (as Denmark) and the AI will constantly send small amounts of troops against your troops and destroy themselves with no need to even use and strategy. Occupy countries in seconds, force an annexation of all of europe and the whole world won't bat an eyelid.Want to get America out of debt quickly? Just reduce all public spending for a few years, before you know it you have trillions in the bank and the public STILL votes for you in the next election (even with them having 80% taxes).Horrible, HORRIBLE game - I severely regret buying this.

Every nation has the potential to take of the world if you know what you are doing.The Idea that you can design new units to your liking is also very nice.Economy is easy to get a hold of in this game, Putting taxes at 80% and adjusting the spending sliders will get almost any nation to be debt free ina matter of years ingame.

												Superpowers 2 is the best and probably only global world simulator in which you are in charge of monitoring and changing a country by means of Politically, Militarly and Economically. You can choose to be in charge of over 150 countries which are officially recognised by the United Nations before and on 2001. You can choose to be to control a small third world country on the verge of economic collapse, or you could be a well built and supreme booming first world country. There is no difficulty level on this game, it all depends on what country you choose to control. There is also multiplayer for the game, although not many people choose this option most likely due to the lack of players who play this game. You need to know before you do this, you can't just play it, understand it quickly and finish it quickly, this game requires a lot of concentration and understanding. You need to do the tutorials a few times to understand the game and how to perform will at the game. I recommend that if you don't like concentrating at a game for a few hours, you shouldn't really play this game. I really like this game and have enjoyed every single hour of it. I was skeptical of buying this game at first purely due to how old it was, but I was hooked within a few hours and absolutely love how you can conquer countries, research nuclear weapons, research weapons, become a superpower, build a massive economy, become a communist, military or even a monarchy state and much, much, much more can be done with this game. Here are my pros and cons quickly narrowed down.PROS:- Over 150+ countries to choose from.- Multiplayer.- Nuke other countries.- Research tanks, APC's, mobile launchers, air defences, bombers, fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, patrol boats, submarines etc. and then build them.- Watch how you crush other countries.- Annexing option to conquer countries is available.- LAN option.- Very cheap on some Steam sales.CONS:- Old graphics.- Some countries names and flags are outdated.- Sometimes some countries won't attack you or even bothering defending if you have an extremely strong military.- Infantry units are effectively useless.- Requires a lot of concentration and effort.- Multiplayer has very few players.Overall, very good game but requires a lot of concentration. 9/10.

												SuperPower 2 is pretty much eRepublik on your desktop without having to go on a browser. The game itself is pretty much that game you'd play if you want a political simulation roleplay. Pretty much, this game is more of a simplified Summer 2001 version of eRepublik. The modding in the game can be pretty hard if you don't know how to use the GL Editor right (since its full of errors) and the game can be quite laggy even on single player. However, if you want a good roleplay Poltiical simulator, this is the game for you, and honestly, I can't wait for more patches, and wait for the upcoming Superpower 3. This is pratically the only game that makes you in command of a country in real life.			"

												SuperPower 2 may not look like much, but it is very good. The game allows you to pick from any country in the world and manage your economy, military, and your politics. You can pick from real political parties and even choose what type of government you have. It also allows you to legalize or delegalize certain things such as freedom of speech and women's rights. You can gain so much satisfaction from taking a small, third world country and making it a dominant superpower.  Note: If you are having trouble moving your troops across the water to invade another country, move them to Antartica and then to where you wish to bring them. This actually works.One of my favorite things to do is restore the Soviet Union..			"

												If you enjoy looking at maps from a Google Earth perspective and love playing Civilization games, then this game is for you. I really enjoy this game, I got addicted to it to the point of having to cool down from it. I played 21 hours straight as soon as I got the game. I found this game from /pol/, and I thought I'd give it a try. The generalization of the game is that you can pick any country recongnized by the UN from 2001, and then build up its economy and military power. You really have to be careful with the national budget as every country starts off in debt, meaning you have to instantly pull your country out of it and fast. Failure to do so in under 10 minutes and you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Aside from economy I mentioned military. You can custom build your own vehicles, how many of them you want, build you own nuclear missle defenses, the whole nine yards. You can also make and break treaties, but be very cautious in doing so. Overall, this is a 10/10 game for me, I love it, love it, love it.			"

												tl'dr HIGHLY highly recommend this gameI've played probably over 10k video games in my life, spanning every generation, this is by far one of my favorites.If you like the campaign map gameplay of TW, the Europa series or Hearts of Iron, you will love this game.I really hope GolemLabs makes SP3, SP2 on its own is great and the Realism mods make it even better, even though the game is great if feels kind of like a template, with its few policies, lack of events and not having to really having to worry about domestic issues. Regardless of the issues, I can't recommend this game enough.GolemLabs, if you're reading this, you have a diamond in the rough here, take SP2, ADD ADD ADD features like more micro-policies, domestic issues and events in SP3 and you will have made a candidate for a GOAT.I payed 1.99 for this game and have got around 55 hours out of it already, one of the best purchases I've ever made.

Got Istanbul Constantinople back for the glory of Hellas with the help of the Italians. Doubled my GDP. British and Spanish peacekeeping forces patrol what remains. Bulgaria and Russia gaze lovingly in each other's eyes waiting for a chance to strike at all of us, China took over Saudi Arabia while I wasn't looking.

												I'm telling you this. (No **** sherlock.)Superpower 2 is unique. It has deep geographical technology which makes you zoom into the planet Earth to the point of seeing pixelated highways. While that may not be as cool as it sounds, look at the geography around it. Cool huh? But I am going to focus on the more 'economic' side of this game.SP2 goes in deep with the economic system of the country you picked, and the free will to change your country's market from state controlled, to mixed, to free market, which is pretty awesome considering you can almost take control of 6 sectors and either import or export the amount of the resource you have. Most games don't have such in-depth-ness-ness. You can adjust the spending of specific areas such as health care, education, infrastracture, environment, propaganda (If you plan to be a very, very evil country with a brainwashed populace.), and et cetera. You can adjust your interest levels and see how inflation is going in your country, and adjust the personal tax income to whatever you wish to get the most dough out of it, but it will always result in the cold shoulder of your populace, so be careful when you want to go over 60%.If you like to focus on the political aspects of this game, there isn't really much for you other than either legalizing/illegalizing a few dilemmas such as freedom of demonstration, freedom of speech, same-sex marriage, woman suffrage, polygamy, etc. But there are also the religions and languages, which you can either allow (Meh reaction from the populace in this religion/language), outlaw (I DON'T WANT THIS LEADER ANYMORE! reaction), or officialize (LEADER 4 LIFE! reaction). You can also participate and make various treaties, where it is also possible for you to play as Turkey and join the European Union with the approval of the countries inside the treaty.You don't like economic or political but the more military aspects of this game? Well then. NUKES! Yes. Who does not like nukes? I do like nukes. And so do you, probably. You can research military technology to make more military designs such as fighter aircraft, attack aircraft, tanks, bombers, infantry vehicles, artillery guns, and so on and so forth. There is also a ranking system that determines how strong you are compared to other nations, which is influenced by your technological prowess, which ranges from 1 to 10. If you plan to dominate the world with the US, best to start with a lvl. 10 technological level.And the most important thing?: There is multiplayer. FRIKKIN MULTIPLAYER!I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a taste for taking control of a country and changing it around completely. The sky and the autarky bug are the limits! Maybe.10/10			"

												I will keep this shortPlay through both tutorials first and then (using youtube and guides to help you) play the beginner and intermediate political scenarios. THEN decide if you want to play more or get a refund.I found the tutorial easy, but didnt explain the economic or political side of the game. Even the beginner scenario for politics was difficult until i looked up how to do it and i realised that once you learn the basics the game is actually very fun and interesting.My recommendation to you is this: If after 90 mins, the tutorials and the scenarios and you still are not sure how to play, then get a refund as this game is not for you.I have been looking for a game like this for a long time now. And i am amazed that a game created in 2004 can still be fun even after 11 years. Well done!			"

												Good geopolitical sims are few and far between, that was even more the case back in 2001 when this game was first released. It still holds up quite well. Yes, there are a few glitches, mostly due to the modifications made in order to adapt the game for modern displays, but on the whole the game is every bit as enjoyable as it was back then.The multiplayer is great, and few other games offer such a wide variety of nations to play as. While some may deride the game for a lack of realism (you can make virtually any nation a super power if you know what to do) I think that's part of the charm. Also, that means that anyone can potentially be a viable threat in multiplayer. If you enjoy strategy sims, I cannot give this game enough praise. It's cheap, and it's awesome. Check it out!			"

												First thing first, I'm using Win7, and there's not too many crashes. However, one of my friends did have quite some crashes, for like every 10 minutes, and he's using Win8.Hope that help.And about the game, what can I say? It's great. Kinda out of date, of course, after all it's been made around 2004. But the game is still AWESOME. You can control any country, along with other 192 countries. And you can make your conutry better throughout developing the economic, or by conquering other countries. Either way it's too darn fun. Highly recommend it.			"

This, is by far, the best real time strategy geopilitics simulator game i've seen and found so far. Even tho there are bugs, unrealistic situations and a few things else, i'll stil love this game and I reccomend it to everyone who likes his kind of game.Besides, many bugs have been fixed with this new Steam version =]			"

												Well, I've put 100 hours of my life into my game, so I believe it's time to send my opinion.Let's start with the pros:- Extensive Replayability- Short learning curve, easy to play- Huge options- Choices on what to do.And let's go with the cons:- Reported crashes, frequent crashes on the game- Very little/no chance that the game will ever be updated- No chance of a sequelThis game, is EXTREMELY fun, you can now finally live out your fantasy of turning North Korea into a superpower that matches the US in size and power! Or perhaps you wish to nuke Israel, get payback against China or even re-establish the apartheid in South Africa. This game really challenges you to make the future different, although it isn't THAT realistic, it still is fun. However, there are some issues, the saddest part of this game is that the company that made it, went bust (to my knowledge) so there will be no chance of a sequel unless another company picks it up. Also reports of widespread bugs that make the game unplayable, which is sad, the only patch, the 1st patch, was released, and you can expect no other updates.Overall I recommend it, it's heaps of fun, and for me, it works well. I just wish some of the most annoying bugs could be fixed and the game could be improved on.			"

												This game is like the most realistic real-time strategy game I've ever played. And I LOVE it.I had an amazing battle over China and they were split into 4 different areas controlled by other countries (USA, Egypt, India, Japan) looked like the way Germany and Berlin once were.I really recommend this game, it has great strategic gameplay, graphics are what you'd expect of a 2004 game but it doesn't need better graphics anyway, and it really has a lot of options for the advanced player. This game is for people who enjoy gameplay over graphics and enjoy advanced combat and systems. It's not really for casual play or people who like simple games, as this is a VERY advanced game and it does require some knowledge of geography, economy, math and politics to play.Tutorials could be better.I also don't get why people argue so much over that the game isn't full-screen, because I don't have a problem with it.

												Wow, this game is fantastic, hands-down THE best RTS I've played. My friend says that he'd play it over DEFCON, and with good reason. It's an RTS that has a great combination of economic, political, and military control for any nation of your choosing (The game takes place in the year 2001 though, so some nations may not have up-to-date flags, territory control, etc.).Pros:-Play as ANY nation. Some nations are harder to develop than others, but if you'd like to make Nepal or Sierra Leone a world superpower, then you can do it.-Game makes you feel like you're actually running a country. Multiple layers of depth are found under economy, politics, and military tabs. You can control things as intricate as raising taxes of vegetables and fruit for your nation.-The battle system is pretty well designed, with multiple types of vehicles with different uses and statistics. You can even design your own mechanical weapons.-If you manage to find a multiplayer roleplay server, the experience is greatCons:-The game doesn't come in full screen. It's not a huge issue to me, but devs said they're working on it for those who do mind.-The AI can act a little funky sometimes. Nations will sometimes declare war on nations 2 continents away for no reason.-I didn't find the game to be easily moddable, such as when I tried to install a ""modern-day setting"" mod that crashed the game upon startup. Maybe I did it wrong.-The multiplayer server lobby is glitched, with servers not being taken off the list despite them being shut down. I recommend going to the game's discussion site to find multiplayer servers.The game is well worth the $10, and devs are currently working on fixing some bugs it has, so I'm looking forward to playing more.9/10			"

												So there is a legacy to this game involving me. I can't even remember where I first saw this game in 2010. I think it might have been YouTube.  When I first saw it though in 2010, it interested me greatly.  I watched all the YouTube videos I could of super power 2 on YouTube while I anticipated my own copy of the game’s arrival. I waited a few months for it, and when I got it, it wouldn’t work on my computer. I tried everything from patches to seeking advice from people who knew their way around a computer a lot better than me, but to no avail. 4 years later though, in 2014, Superpower 2 is on steam, updated for windows 7 and 8. Seeing as it was on sale and my history of the game, I got it immediately. Let me just say it’s worth the wait. If your into the Supreme Ruler series at all, this game is for you.			"

												SuperPower 2 is a geo-political game from many years ago, from GolemLabs. It has been requested on Steam many times and due to the recent Greenlight campaign, SP2 is now available on Steam.Nothing has quite matched this particular game's vibrant feel. What was created many years ago still has a quaint charm that puts this game far up my list of personal favorites.However, there is a double-edged blade to this game.Enjoyment can and will be interrupted by bugs and functionability issues with the game itself. There's not much mod support for the Steam version and the starting debts can really put a spoil on your game.But despite this, this is still a must-try for anybody who likes RTS games!			"

												This is one of my favourite strategy games i have ever played. I personally prefer to build a base, then an army, then conquer like in most RTS games but SuperPower 2 offers a whole new realm of Strategy warfare. In this game you must take over the emtire world and you can try doing this with brute force and thousands of nuclear missiles, or you can exploit the games countless features and options rampaging from your political corruption and military prowess, right up to how your trade of vegetables is going. This game is tough to get around with so many different options to change your country but once you've played a few hours it all sinks in. This game is well worth the money and I highly reccommend getting it. Just be warned, if you start nuking other countries, chances are, they will nuke you back...a long with every other country with nuclear missiles. I learnt this the hard way. :p			"

												I recently purchased SuperPower 2 to play with friends, and right away I loved it. The  game seems to offer endless possibilities (especially when you're playing on a server with others), and each country you play as results in a different scenario each time. This game gives you everything you would want in a geopolitical simulator, and more. Choose a country, build alliances (among other treaties), start wars, conquer land, control your economy, military, goverment, and of course, build nukes. While it can be slow to start off, you can even turn countries like Kenya into economical powerhouses with a stacked military. Many reviews make it seem like this is easy to do, and this can be offputting to those looking for a realistic simulator. In reality, it is only easy if you are willing to put your country in billions of dollars of debt and anger every country on Earth, and this will eventually backfire. Despite all this, the game does have a tricky interface. It's not exactly welcoming to new users, as there is a lot of menus and options to choose from, but this is expected in such a complex game. Of course, as many people complain, this game has its share of bugs, and your screen resolution can cut out most of the battle screen, but this is abosolutely not a reason to overlook this game. Overall, if you are going to buy this game, I reccomend that you do it with friends, because it makes things much more interesting, but singleplayer is fun as well. For the price of $10, you are easily getting a good deal.			"

												On sale for 2 and a half dollars, you are looking at a great entry level geo-political stratagy game. It is definitely a lot less complex than the big dogs like EU4 or Hearts of Iron, but it is a lot of fun. I recommend some mods to update the political landscape and units, because at default, it is looking at the world in the early 2000s and the world has changed quite a lot since then. Even if you are a veteran stratagy player, it could still be a lot of fun. The diplomatic options are pretty good, as well as economic management. Warefare is a bit lacking though. Since the enemy/ies usually send all of their units after you if you go to war, there isn't much room to win or lose; whoever has the biggest military usually wins. Mods can improve this to a certain extent, but it is still a bit poopy. Regardless, in all it would be silly not to recommend it at my current rate of just under 100 hours played for every dollar I spent on buying it.			"

												This is a fun game for the time in which it was created. The game finds its most charm in multiplayer where you can freely send nukes over the globe and bomb the hell out of your friends. However, there are a lot of problems that plague having full enjoyment of it otherwise. A lot of things need to be addressed for when SuperPower 3 comes out and I will address some of them here in my review.First and foremost, there needs to be a much better interface. There are a terms the game wants you to handle in this game that go on unexplained in the National Budget. Things such as inflation, global tax mod, telecommunications, education. Inflation in particular you're told is very bad and you want to keep it around 2%, but you're never told why and there is no visible effects of anything going bad in your economy even if you keep it around 10% for 50 years. Additionally the only way you're given to control it is the interest rate for your economy, which has a negative effect on it. So why would you ever mess with a good thing? The entire interface just needs an improvement altogether. I'd like to know how each bar directly effects the economy. Secondly, there needs to be popups for important events and a system that allows you to make certain events in the game popups and ignore the rest altogether. For example...I was hanging out as Israel and doing my thing. I had just reannexed the Gaza Strip and everything was going well. And then suddenly, the United States and China had declared war and nukes were flying over the globe. I would have loved to have a popup that would have paused the game in this instance so I could switch to slow-mode and watch the nukes fly and decide for myself after the damage whom to support and who to try to take land from. But as the game sits right now someone can declare war on you and invade your entire nation and you have no notification whatsoever. That's a thing that needs to be improved.Treaties need to be improved upon. There's not really a way for you to improve the relationships you have with other nations. Eventually if you wait long enough and no great wars are started, the positive effects of the EU and other treaties already in place at the start of the game will bring you to positive relations and will result in world peace. But I should be able to give money to any nation I want to bring relations up. And currently, there's no way to do that. Nations you have bad relations with will always have bad relations with you because they'll carry out hostile actions against you. The only way to fix it is to take em over and annex them, which pisses off the world and makes them do the same thing.Fourthly, there needs to be a great wikipedia and a company web forum for this game to help with misunderstandings. This has the capacity to be a pretty complex game and people love them and would love to enjoy them. But even now there are things I don't understand like how to do naval bombardments and marine invasions. The game doesn't explain it to me in any way. I'd love to ask on web forums, except none exist. I'd love to check a wikipedia, but the one existing is sorely lacking on almost all subjects. So that needs to be improved.All in all, SuperPower 2 is not a great Geopolitical Simulator. It's a game that finds its most charm in nuking your friends online as a Wargame. So if you're into that, you'll find a lot of fun in this tame. Go for it!			"

Posted: June 7, 2016
												Been a long time fan of the Superpower series. First off, Superpower 1 was a very different game: focused on a 2D map, with the ability to create cities and bases anywhere you controlled. Combat was sending your army to another city or base where you could auto-resolve or watch/control in a (funky, crude) tactical RTS mode. The game was turn-based.NOW came along SUPERPOWER 2, which basically threw most of that out.Superpower 2 plays in full RTS (pausable, with ability to slow/speed up) on a fully 3D globe.Think ""Google Earth"" but with Armies and nukes. The game retained much of it's complexities with domestic issues, economic controls, convert ops, research, unit design, etc. You no longer build cities/bases, but rather control territories.You can zoom on them as if from a satellite, and the resoluation updates and you can see more cities and roads.Pretty cool considering the age of the game. You can put your units anywhere you want.But the territories don't require any direct management, instead, you manage everything on an ""empire""-sized level.Quite nice, because it takes out tons of micro-management that would otherwise detract from the RTS experienceRTS-style combat was thrown out for a sort of RTS ""Heroes of Might and Magic""-type ""standoff"" battle, where you have a single unit representing all of that type, and a number indicating how many of that type are in the battle.Since the overall game is in real-time, when two armies meet on the globe, a dust-up of smoke appears representing a battle. You can have as many battles as you want raging all at once. If you want to see how the battle is going, you click on it and it will take you to the screen I just mentioned. You can watch them sit there shooting the air and occasionally taking damage (you see'll their numbers drop, a pop-up showing how much damage they took) or exit out. After any battle is done, you'll get a notification in your in-game mailbox, you can click on to see the results to cheers/applause, or boos, depending on the outcome.There is also an ""event"" box that reports any significant news of the world, color-separated into catagories like Military, Domestic, Economy, etc. which works very well in the game.COMBAT:There isn't too much strategy to combat. The main thing I noticed, is whoever has the best units, and the best trained, best numbers, usually wins.But way to increase victory and reduce losses is focus heavily on researching weapon RANGE.You can research everything, from Gun/Cannon Damage, Missile Damage, Armor, Stealth, Countermeasures, Range, Speed, etc. All that. You can research everything simultaneously; how fast it goes, depends on how much funds you allocate. I love this! I hate games where you can only research one thing at a time. How dumb is that? SP2 gets it right.You can custom-design your units, what points in each stat you want them to have (the max depends on how far you researched each stat). Focus on stealth? Focus on damage? Range? Up to you. How much you put into it, the more expensive it will be to upkeep.My advice: GROUND FORCES: focus on range. develop powerful, long-range artillery, anti-air, and that's it. Infantry is fodder, usually get chewed up before they can get in range to attack. AA will take down aircraft no problem. Artillery will chew everything up. Focus thirdly on tanks, and then MRLS units. I've had armies with massive artillery wipe out ones 5 times it's size. AIRCRAFT: Useless, they die so fast no matter how good they are.NAVY: Most critical in the game. Enemy nation will always attack your navy first, sending ALL of their ships to attack yours. Best to keep them in one place, and focus on building tons of Patrol Craft and ASW helicopters (range, damage research helps), and a few powerful larger ships. *ONCE YOUR NAVY IS DESTROYED* that's usually when the computer will invade. More on this later.BUYING units: You can buy units on a sort of ""game market"" in the game, this is a good way to beef up your forces fast.All units can be trained up to 3 levels: Recruit, Veteran, Elite. The higher the level, the better they perform.NUKES: You can build nuke subs, and nuke missiles. No nuke bombers. I usually build nukes with maximum range, and minimal accuracy and damage. One nuke usually always wipes out an army, so better to build custom ones this way because they'll be cheaper and faster to build.Becareful with nukes, your game can devolve into GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR, very fast.***If you're playing to conquer the world, it's best to focus on taking out the nuclear powers first. Once that is done. You can nuke anyone without worrying about getting nuked back. This makes invading them EASY AS PIE. Nuke their military to pieces, and then roll in with a small army.****An ABM system can be built and it greatly reduces effectiveness of nukes though.LASTLY: The AI.THE AI is: dumb, sneaky, weak, weasily, evasive, insane, antagonizing.Don't expect anything to play out like it would in the real world. One day, Tongo might declare war on Syria. Or Seychelles, tries to invade China. The world is a wacky, wacky world in this game. Israel might join with Iran to conquer Australia. Japan might decide to ally with Paraquay to conquer the UAE. DIPLOMACY: non-existent, mostly just making treaties to increase relations. If nations declare war on you, you can go to the WAR LIST screen and select you want PEACE, and sometimes they'll call it all off. Lol.ECONOMY: You can let the AI run a lot of things in the game, but it never does them well. Economy: I recommed reading about it. You can manage funding for various programs, taxes, resource production, etc. Like a spreadsheet updating in real-time inside modest pop-up screens. The game's economy is really buggy, but sometimes it's not, if you can understand what's going on under the good. DOMESTIC: you can ban abortion, ban religion, make child labor legal, polygamy ok, closes all the borders, make languages official, legal, or illegal, there are a lot of choices. They don't affect things too much except mostly how your people feel about you. If you conquer a Buddhist nation and make their religion illegal, it will affct your overall rating. If you're playing as a democracy, you might not get re-elected. On that note, you can suspend elections, ban rival political parties, or declare martial law, and change your government to dictatorship or whatever.STEAM EDITION changes worth mentioning:-You now need a capital ship to occupy water near where you want to land forces. Previously, you could send ground forces ANYWHERE, over the water no problem, making Navies totally useless. Now, there is at least SOME purpose to them.-Enemies will not wait for it's navy to conquer yours before invading (used to do occasionally before). Now, they'll launch full, smarter invasions, form stacks, and go through weak points. HOWEVER, the computer can glide right across unguarded territories, whereas YOU can only take one at a time. This gives the AI a totally unfair advantage. Additionally, armies no longer are forced to engage, meaning the AI can pass through territory where you DO have an army, claim it, without having to fight your army, continuing on to seize more territory. When YOU invade, the claim is not given, unless you destroy the enemy army there. So it's very tedious now.While the AI armies perform better, more believable, the unfair advantages they get, turn strategic combat into micro-management nightmare. Before, you could have a dozen big armies. Now, you need a plethora of smaller armies everywhere. Ugh!-There was no fix for the ""Autarky"" economic bug/flaw. Google this to find out what I'm referring to.Too much else to mention. So...FUN GAME!9/10.			"

												The SuperPower 2 RP community was something truly special. This wasn't the most popular game, and the game mechanics didn't age very well since it was a 2004 game, but we dealt with it. Sadly after I stopped playing two or so years ago, I've noticed the game slowly dying, at least from the likes of my friends list. There just doesn't seem to be a lot of people playing anymore, which is sad. We've dropped thousands of hours on this game, from golden era of the GameSpy servers, to Tunngle, and now here; on Steam were it is forever immortalized.The role-plays on SuperPower 2 were honestly some of the most fun I've ever had with video games, these past 10 years as a member of this community is something I'll never forget. Here's hoping that one day, we'll finally get our SuperPower 3, or a new game that could live up to SP2. And we'll all reunite for some fantastic RPs again. Semper Fidelis,- Hex			"

But it seems to be worse and worse. Now it crashes almost immediately.If it helps - I'm running Win10 64bit, I disabled firewall, Windows Defender (no other anti-virus installed), tried various compatibility settings but nothing works.I also uploaded core dump when the game crashed: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B27QN0TU2QUmYWpNd2ExNHdCZ00 if someone can get some info from it.

												It's a really fun and detailed game, it's actually the strategy game I've been wanting for ever.The cool thing is that you research technology (which isn't unique) but then you can MAKE your own unique units, unlike Civ 5 where everyone basically has the same♥♥♥♥♥♥(with the exception that there are some nation specific ones).So if you think it looks and souns fun, you should get it ;)However, there are some problems.The game keeps crashing due to the offline server ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the diplomacy could be a bit better.It would be cool of you could for example arrage meetings with the leader of a country and have dat♥♥♥♥♥♥all over da news.Also, even when you turn the AI aggressiveness all the way down, they're still pretty aggressive. Like I invaded Sweden with Norway, and shortly after I had annexed them THE ENTIRE ♥♥♥♥ING WORLD DECLARED WAR ON ME!But then I just loaded my previous save and invaded Finland, Estonia and Iceland instead, which was fine... For now. France declared war on me once... but yeah, get this game, it's cheap and fun.			"

												EDIT::: The game has changed, the important fixes such as fullscreen and MP are made. DO NOT read this review to consider the game is worth or not. Loving this game and played it for days but Steam Edition can only get 10/0 from me! The game is buggy alot, cant run in fullscreen, multiplayer doesnt work, no active community, cant install my old saves to this one! They didn't do anything for years! I can only see new ""Steam Edition""! Also I cant see the good old ones.Old GameSpy Arcade is way better than this version! Hoping sp3 will be better, fixed and more active... The worst part is there is no active community, if you want to play you should learn yourself and try to fix yourself... 10/0			"

												This game seems very interesting but I cannot recommend it. I tried playing the game, but the selection for units and countries seems to be buggy and unreliable. Normally I would not give a game a negative review for something like this, but it seems like it was an issue the developers were already aware of and even released a beta-patch for which helped a bit but still did not solve the problem. They seem to have abandoned efforts to resolve this issue since then. In a game where you're going to be doing a lot of clicking on different countries and regions this is a really big deal.As an aside I tried all the standard tricks including compatability mode, disabling scaling on high DPI settings, etc. Nothing worked. Shame - the game looks like incredible fun.			"

												I always wanted a new version of Defcon with more unit types and politics. This could of been it but it feels like a half finished game. I think the crashing mentioned in most reviews has been mostly fixed in patches but you do need a very good PC which seems strange since its basically a 2D game. The reason I think it seems half finished is because there are some glaring interface flaws which should not be there in a modern game. These will really put off new players that may of enjoyed the game but will leave it feeling frustrated.One of the most obvious things that could of been improved and would of made a bit difference for the time invested is moving across oceans. It doesnt say it anywhere I saw but you need a destroyer or cruiser to do so. If you dont have one you will just be trying and trying to move them and they wont move across the water. To make it worse the game has two beeps. One for succesful movement and one for an error. Sometimes it will play both noises!On the whole I enjoyed this game simply because it inspired me to make my own version. It was a great concept excetud Ok but it could of been so much better with some proper playtesting and refining.			"

												SuperPower 2 is a very old game and you should be well aware of it when you purchase the game. The graphics are outdated, the gameplay is very limited and even the sounds are not comparable with modern games sounds. The above made clear, this game is absolutely brilliant, fun to play (as it was back when it first came out) and a superb idea, but to me not worth the £8.99. I would certainly say give it a try if you can find it on offer for cheaper than that but do not spend the 8.99 unless you are a collector or you totally admire the game. Enjoy!			"

Joshua.exe hasn't worked great before and neither does it today. Save the 10 bucks until the developers get it working and buy a six pack instead.			"

												I love this game! Been playing it a long time, before there was a steam edition. It's totally worth the money, even though there are a few issues with it. Pros:* Tons of gameplay hours, and it never gets boring. There are always challenges and other ways to do things.* Good AI that makes the game very realistic* Uses real life data in politics, forces and financial data. (Although the numbers are from 2001)* Many mods avaible. Best one in my opinion is from Mr.Monday. He has made a mod that updates the game to our current world time.* One of a kind game. Great value for moneyCons:* Game could use a update, as it still starts in 2001 and therefor has outdated financial, politics, and forces situations.* Game WILL crash! from time to time... Remember to set autosave interval low (5 or 10 minutes)* To actually take over the world without cheating is next to impossible!* Moving troops over sea areas is... tricky and full of bugs.I hope that with this steam edition, the game will be brought back to life, and that we will see new updates, mods and maybe even a Super Power 3 game. I absolutely love this game, but it does need some work before it's perfect.			"

												SuperPower 2 is the only global geopolitical simulation game which allows players to control entire countries. Players control countries in 3 major areas: political, economic and military, but this time, in a beautiful real-time 3D environment.Players build up their own countries and increase their influence in the broader world while competing against sophisticated A.I. Along the way, gamers make use of economic sanctions, political alliances, and military actions to wage their battles. SuperPower 2 offers the ability to fine-tune each country's performance, from creating or breaking treaties, to making tactical decisions in particular military conflicts.Creating a superpower from Haiti isn’t an easy task but it sure was a fun run, I recommend SuperPower2 to people that like world simulations or to people that wish they could run any country on earth in anyway they see fit.The number of options, the good graphics for the globe and almost limitless gameplay adds up a game that is worthy of United Nations attention.The world is beautifully rendered and is capable of giving a wide variety of thematic maps and the capability to drill down into any region.RULE YOUR COUNTRY, CONQUER YOUR ENEMIES, DOMINATE THE WORLD!

DO NOT BUY ON STEAM - BUY ON GOG INSTEADThe steam version crashes after 10 to 40 minutes of play; the devs have stopped supporting the game and stopped providing updates, patches, tech support, and fixes. Buy the version on Good Old Games, it's cheaper (by £2.40) and is guaranteed to work.Link to the GOG version that works: http://www.gog.com/game/superpower_2 "

												note my playing time is not accurate i was able to play for 20 or so hours befor the problems...........Before i buy a game i read the reviews and they usually give me a good idea on if its a good enough game to purchase and or worth the money with known bugs or glitches. Before i purchased this game i had read a review stating that after 20 to 40 minutes the game freezes or unexpectedly closes mentioned a web site that has this game on it that works  called gog.com, but i went against my better judgment and went ahead and bought this game on stream and now i wish i would have bought it on gog.com because it not playable everything he said came true. I would recommend this game just not on stream.			"

												This game is hopelessly buggy.There are numerous threads reporting this issue, each one of which ending with no resolution or feedback.Simply said, the game crashes every time the most exciting part of the game gets involved: warfare.  Even the simple task of clicking on a unit and training it might lead to a game crash.I could wax poetic about the ambition behind the game, the feel of micromanaging entire governments and armies, but all that is useless if the game doesn't work.

												The first thing I do in this kind of game is push the limits to an extreme that should result in some obvious consequences. On January 1st, I took control of the United States. By January 2nd, Spanish was the official language, Other was the official state religion, narcotics were legalized, every economic sector was privitized, and the entire military was decommissioned.Three years later, no country had made a single move against this new United States. Public opinion in the US took a dip for the first week then went back to normal, and the economy stayed the same. Even if the game is supposed to be about the subtleties of international relations, big changes like the ones I made should have SOME effect, even if it's an instant Game Over because the people booted me out of power.

												The game is decent for it's genre even though it's incredibly easy once you get a good economy and lots of research going. Nuking Israel is always fun, though. The game gives you a bit of options regarding laws and systems of government to choose from, these are always nice. Though, I've noticed that there are virtually no real 'right-wing' parties to choose from, I feel as though the political side of this game is heavily biased towards the left. For some reason the official language of Iraq is Kurdish? There may be some other things the developers are biased towards that I have not encountered.I can live with the things mentioned above especially since I get to ban certain languages, parties, and laws, however, the game is unplayable, it crashes if you nuke a country and it crashes constantly for no particular reason (please note that this may not be experienced by some people). The game has some game-breaking bugs such as not being able to take the capital of some countries because the unit has not been fully deployed and it never will be, you can always get over that by playing LAN and removing the unit from the capital then switching back to your original nation to capture the capital; but the point is that this game should have been released when the bugs/crashes have been looked through and fixed. Evidentally, the developers can't be bothered releasing fixes and as such, do not currently deserve the $10 they're asking for.I will happily change this review to 'recommend' once the game is playable.

Can still play multiplayer if you set the autosave to 1 or 2 minutes. But still giving it a thumbs down cause its EXTREMELY annoying. Imagine playing Dark Souls, you're just about to beat the boss then game crashes, and it continues to crash during that one boss fight, you could've killed it 10 times now if the game didn't crash all the damn time. That's what SP2 multiplayer is like. if you (an your friends) can handle that with no issue, get it, otherwise dodge it for a more STABLE game.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last patch was in 2014, it is now 2017 with no mention of an update.As a Singplayer experience, I've heard this game is awesome.But I got this game for the Multiplayer, something that MOST strategy games are best for cause playing against the AI will inevitably get boring & repetitive. If you are getting SP2 for multiplayer, LEAVE NOW!How to get multiplayer working: Open specified ports (you an your friend have to do this), then one hosts a game whereas the other joins. Theres a big problem though.... IT DOESN'T WORK.Even if you manage to get the ports open (some ISPs will say no - pray you don't have one of those types), the chances of the game quitting to main menu are ridiculously high.The devs have blamed other things (besides themselves) for those errors occuring, like virus, proxies, isp, antiviruses, openned wrong ports, and even ""maybe you set up the game wrong"". But no, the true blame lies with the Devs who MADE this game. We did EVERYTHING just to get multiplayer to work and nothing worked, we even used Tunngle an that makes multiplayer work for EVERY GAME. We got maybe 3 mins in to the game an it kicks all us to main menu. There's even a bug (that devs havent fixed) that crashes the game but tells the game your server is still running but you can't join it. Yeah..... If you have ZERO intention of playing with others, then yeah you'll like it. If you're getting it for Multiplayer only, YOU WILL HATE IT.-------------------------------------------Latest patch - May 25th 2014:We just set the first update live.Here is the list of changes:- Fullscreen support added- MP phantom servers no longer displayed after game is terminated (still happens)- MP connectivity errors better explained (they didnt fix them)- small german localisation fixes --------------------------------------------------------Its now 2017 an no fixes an no word from the devs. This game is abandoned. I do like the concept but I hate the lack of effort to make this game great, right now it is total crap.			"

												This is a pretty good game. If you only plan to play on singleplayer i don't recommend. The multiplayer is what makes this game so good i host multiplayer servers name is: Joel's (target mode) RP server. There is quite alot of racism in the community and so are there many turks who often nuke someone's country if they don't like it in real life. Turks destroy alot of the servers in this game :(. There is alot of bugs because this game hasn't been developed in like 3 or 4 years also the game has alot of MODS what modify the game a bit, they make the game pretty good! The AI in the game is pretty bad atleast that is what i think. The soundtrack is pretty basic it has maybe 2 songs and they aren't that good either.Now the review!Multiplayer: 9/10Singleplayer: 5/10Mods: 9/10Community: 7/10 becuz of turksArtificial Intelligence (AI): 5/10Overall Gameplay: 8/10Soundtrack: 7/10Overall Rating 8/10 "

												While playing as Kazahkstan on multiplayer with Russia, a third player took the helm of Ukraine and made a high enough trade to buy Florida and California from the United States. When the kid left, computer controlled Ukraine was dumb enough to attack Belarus, whom Russia was an ally with. Russia promptly annexed all of Ukraine, INCLUDING Florida and California.In exchange for giving a few of my provinces in order to make Russia's borders nice and pretty, I got Florida. Immediately after integrating the state into my mighty Khanate (yes, I chose Monarchy as my governing style), my budget exploded from barely breaking even to BILLIONS in profits. I used my glorious Floridian money to max out my budget spending in order to make everyone in Kazahkstan as prosperous as Florida.Superpower II: ten of ten. Would bring a khanate to Florida again.

												This game left me confused. There are only 2 short tutorials to explain movement controls and basic combat. But they make no effort to explain: Trade (the whole stock exchange window), Treaties, or any of the economic options. What does raising or lowering the interest rate do? If I increase production of something, why does it say my output is constantly 0? You also have an approval rating. What makes it go up/down? I have no idea because that's not explained either. You have no way to know what your people want, so you won't know how to make them happy.So unless you like graphs or you're some kind of economics expert, stear clear. Not very user-friendlyEdit: Do you want to train your units to make them more effective? Good, because if you do, there's no progress bar to see how it's going. You do, however, get a progress bar to watch as you ready your covert operatives (although their effectiveness in terms of what they do is not explained and it's hard to tell if their actions mattered at all)			"

												NOTE: I have in fact played this game before, so I have more playtime experience than the steam counter claims. My review mostly compares the game to it's state prior to the steam ""special"" version. Utterly horrible. I bet most of the thumbs up reviews come from the fanboys that helped this trainwreck greenlighted in the first place. Right of the bat before I even beginn playing (or try to play...), I find out that the game only runs in windowed mode. After reading some threads on the game's steam forums, I find out that this is intentional because the game is so broken that it's devs can't even get this ""new and improved"" steam version of the game to run properly in fullscreen mode. Afterward, I got to play the game for like 5 min before it crashed. I also hear that the editor which is suppose to be a new feature is broken and doesn't work, though I haven't tested that myself. Really the whole idea that this is suppose to be a ""new and an improved version"" is just laughable. As for the actual game, it is still the same pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that it was before it came on steam. The AI is bad, the economy makes no sense (you can have insane income taxes without any real long-term penalties, basically removing lots of the challange out of the game), war is dull and not fun. This is really just a very bad game, and how this series even has fans is beyond me. Don't listen to the thumbs up reviews, they probably just come from the same small minority that got this pile of garbage greenlight in the first place. I am not even kidding, this is one of the first games in a long while that actually gave me buyer's remorse  in-spite of costing only 10 bucks.  Avoid this disaster of a game at all costs.			"

												This would be a fantastic game, if it weren't for its consistent run-time crashes. Every 5-20 minutes, SuperPower 2 crashes out with a C++ runtime error; and diagnosing the problem appears to be isolated into a medium of witchcraft across the internet. Some people can fix it with mundane solutions; re-install the VC redists, or simply restart Steam - others however, unfortunately including myself, have had no such luck.Tested on two machines; PC (i7 5820K, 16GB DDR4, 3x GTX980), and a Laptop (i7 3770K, 12GB DDR3, GTX675M). The only similarity between the two being that both machines are used for development; and have fully up-to-date redists / libraries.The game seems to boast a lot of depth - and albeit it's a little aged at this point (and it's a little sad to play as Ireland before the economy with♥♥♥♥♥♥up), its level of complexity would be fitting for anyone looking to sink days/weeks/months into developing a third world Country into a superpower.. or turning France into a monarch which has banned cereal. If their machine is in the lucky configuration set that won't non-stop crash out.			"

After spending £9 on this game, I can't even start a game.. i've searched for the forum's for the invalid SDK problem but even the developer's dont know. How this got on steam is a mystery, obviously not compatible for windows 7 and 8. Not worth the risk of whether it will work.			"

												It's a mess, nothing works well, if it does work it won't work for long. No go zone this one. Avoid this one it's old and unsupported with bugs to boot, you can (sorta) get it to kind of work with some tinkering but it's still annyoing, crashes, and has some bugs. Maybe if enough of us give it sordid reviews they will update the game. Doubtful so I tried to refund.:(  Runtime Error!This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an usual way. Please contact the applications support team for more information.(Windows 8.1)You have numerous bugs in this game, your armies won't move, your time won't speed up or slow down when you need it to, some of the nations have their own specific bugs, you can't play in full-screen, you have to play at a wierd resolution if you want to stave off the crashing bug for a time but eventually it finds you and haunts your dreams. Sometimes you can't save, sometimes you cannot close the game without using Task Manager. This is a game with potential and there is something fun about it if you can get past the barriers, if you know how to that is, the last time this game was patched was in 2014. So it's not worth your time just move on, really.			"

												Don't buy the game!It's so broken that you can't even start it when you have a new computer don't play with your money only if your are really sure that your hardware is outdated buy the game than you have a 50% chance that you can play it. i recommend you to install vista so you can play a broken game on a broken system. all i have to say is F*** this game.if you are asking yourself  how i got 5 min play time. the only not broken piece of the game is the configuration menu you can choose your desired screen setting and your able to tick the fullscreen box. you can choose 2 quality settings 32 bit and 16 bit and your graphics card. you don't get more interaktion so this game gets 0.10/10 because none of this actions influence the story or characters (or your graphics)  in the game, except for the fullscreen option were you can choose to have a big black box for 1/2 seconds or a smaller black box. i recommend you play cod or bf there you have the same amount interaction.

												This game is good for its time back in 2004, however, nowdays with games like Supreme Ruler and Victoria 2 etc, this game is extremely shallow and hard to enjoy.First off, the military aspect is SOOO gamey! Want 100k troops? Not a problem! Just click the 'train men' button and BAM, 100k troops in months. The battles are very boring as well, and military movement is horrendous.Diplomacy and politics are alright, but the AI never wants to accept any treaties. Ever. And they never make offers. So have fun with that.Overall, this game is not good anymore, and I would stay away from buying it. For a better experience get Supreme Ruler Ultimate or Victoria 2, as they are more up to date, and not over 10 years old.			"

												Going to go ahead and say, 9/10 for me.Lets get started.Graphics______Graphics are not important for this game, but. I am going to say they are pretty damn good. The Globe is amazing looking, in my opinion. There are not really any graphics like you would see in a FPS, or any other RTS games. They just arent needed for this game.But, with the graphics that are there, 8/10.Gameplay_______This is one of the most advanced Grand Strategies games I have ever played. The ammount of work you need to put into this to learn, is pretty damn high. You have to learn where to put your: Interest Rate to counter deflation, your personal income tax, your global tax mod, your task mod for resources, and much more. This is hard to learn at first, I am still learning of course... But, after 2 hours of playing around with Economics, I pretty much found the sweet spots for China. The military aspect has you: Commanding troops, building troops, building a design out of templates(not that advanced, but still pretty cool) and picking your upgrades. This includes Strategic weapons!. Also, politics are controlled by you. You must: Keep high diplomatic relations with other nations(keeps from being invaded), refrain from using nukes as it causes everyone to hate you(but whats the fun of that :P) and a little more. I like setting AI agressiveness to max...Overall I think the gameplay aspect gets a 9/10 for me.Bugs_____I couldn't find any bugs, but I only played 2 1/2 hours. I have not played enough to give my humbe opinion on bug status.?/10Anyway.Overall for me is 9/10. Sounds are pretty good to me in this game also.I would recommend the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game to anyone who loves Grand Strategy Games( Also recommend Victoria II, EU IV, Hearts of Iron series, although these games are not as advanced.) My first full pledged review, so its probably very choppy. Worth the 9$!			"

												This game is awesome. - The realistic Economy & Political System makes it fun to play. - The Military sections, including designing units, researching technology, training units, creating a Special OPS team for assasinations, terrosim and so on, just so good. - The trading system is really good, you can trade money, military technology & country regions with other countries, increasing reputation between the countries, giving you even more benefits. - The battles are okay, but I think that's what makes the game good and different from Total War. The game wants you to focus into realistic things such as control over Economy, Politics & Military as well as relations with other countries.   - Your Units can not move where they seek, for instance if you want to move your units from USA to Russia, you need to ask for military trespassing rights from all the countries that stand between USA & Russia, if you don't get the rights through a treaty, they will declare war onto you when you move your units through these countries. Also if a country you want to attack is split from your country by an Ocean or Sea, you will not be able to attack that country, otherwise you may need Airforce & Navals, Transports, etc, or simply Nuke War.     Overall this game may not be for everyone, but I mean ITS FREAKING GREAT in my opinion, so fun, I played it more than 18 hours, I recently bought it on steam but I've played the non-steam version for alot more.  If this was helpful  please rate ^^. Thanks			"

(you can not sell anyting on the world market). Your state balance will go in the deep red. 3 You can not invade some area's and can not annex some nations.4 Effects of goverments are sometimes not noticeble, other times they will ruin your production.Do not buy this game!

												There are some good things about this game. 1. Detailed world map 2. Geo-political mechanics are realtively decent 3. Lots of options and can create your own units.Here are the problems.... 1. It crashes a lot. 2. Some countries it is too easy to rule. AKA USA, UK,CHINA 3. It's very very easy to have almost every nation on earth to declare war on you.For the price, and if you have a good system that can handle the game then you should get it, although there are some other simulation games that do better and are more fun than superpower 2. I wish there would be a superpower 3 but that will never happen.			"

												The game superpower 2 is a really well done game. its really fun to see the random things occur, for example i was playing as the United States of America, and all of a sudden China nuked somebody (cant remember who as this was my first playthrough) and, it was just cool seeing other countries interact with each other, diplomaticly and economicly as well as with their armies. and the company behind the game is really good to say the least, they really value the customers, and make good products such as this.

												This game is too simple for its own good. While yes, a game can be simple and still be deep, when it comes to grand strategy, a certain degree of complexity is required. This game leaves the player with too few options, and about half have almost no impact. I could recomend the Paradox grand strategy games over this(Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron) over this game. Hell, if you want a modern-theamed strategy game, go with Democracy 3 instead. This game is not good or bad, just bland and mediocore, and not worth the ten dollars on steam. If you want this game, please buy it off GOG rather than steam, where it is cheeper.			"

												I used to play SuperPower 1 and 2 back in the day, and had fun with both. Having lost both games over time for one reason or another, I decided to purchase Superpower 2 for Steam for nostalgic purposes. What I encountered was a little underwhelming.As other reviewers have pointed out, realism pretty much flies out the door with this one. One time I played as Croatia and, after an hour of play, had China randomly invade and annex me. In another game I watched online, Italy invaded and annexed China, then started eating up African countries, with no one in the world seemingly caring. I know there are realism mods out there, but as is, the game leaves much to be desired in this regard. Related to this is how the game's mechanics react to your decisions. Example: I started with a multi-party democracy nation with basic political freedoms, and then - practically overnight - outlawed every religion and language except one, removed freedom of contraception, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, then transformed the government into a military dictatorship. You know what the drop in popular support was? MAYBE like 5%. I'm not kidding. It went back to normal after a while. Government stability didn't take a hit either. I had done this to see just how insane my nation would go, but discovered that it didn't do anything even negative in the short-term. For a supposed geopolitical simulator, that's a bit lacking.One of the most aggravating aspects of this game is the economic model. At first glance, it can seem like a wonderful simulation of the world trade, but after trying to figure the thing out...I just can't make a surplus. Well, to be fair, I did once, but I don't even remember how I did it. I've tried various methods, and I've read tutorials online on how to set up your economy, but nothing seems to work. I've dealt with the economic models in other games from a variety of developers, and even if they were at first difficult, I managed to figure them out after a while. SP2, however, has a model that will aggravate the casual gamer and give them headaches, trying to figure out how to keep those numbers from getting red again.One of the few things I appreciate about this game is the way wars and armies are done. Unlike SP1, which were a bit more clustered and limited to various cities, you can move armies around the map like you could in real life, and let them engage across a wider front. It's fun to see the symbols flying around on the spec-ops-style map, and watch the battles between two sides unfold.Is SP2 worth purchasing? I honestly don't think it's worth even $10. It can be that one game you take out every year and play for a while, before you remember why you uninstalled it in the first place, but it probably won't be something you play on a regular basis.

It's actually fairly good. You get to control the legality of trade and a few hot-topic issues, enact treaties, declare war, launch nukes, do sneaky spy stuff (including wetwork and general terrorism), help the poor, feed the hungry, steal resources, make it illegal to buy or sell plastics...It does gitch out sometimes though and the path finding isn't the best.

												Going to go ahead and say, 9/10 for me.Lets get started.Graphics______Graphics are not important for this game, but. I am going to say they are pretty damn good. The Globe is amazing looking, in my opinion. There are not really any graphics like you would see in a FPS, or any other RTS games. They just arent needed for this game.But, with the graphics that are there, 8/10.Gameplay_______This is one of the most advanced Grand Strategies games I have ever played. The ammount of work you need to put into this to learn, is pretty damn high. You have to learn where to put your: Interest Rate to counter deflation, your personal income tax, your global tax mod, your task mod for resources, and much more. This is hard to learn at first, I am still learning of course... But, after 2 hours of playing around with Economics, I pretty much found the sweet spots for China. The military aspect has you: Commanding troops, building troops, building a design out of templates(not that advanced, but still pretty cool) and picking your upgrades. This includes Strategic weapons!. Also, politics are controlled by you. You must: Keep high diplomatic relations with other nations(keeps from being invaded), refrain from using nukes as it causes everyone to hate you(but whats the fun of that :P) and a little more. I like setting AI agressiveness to max...Overall I think the gameplay aspect gets a 9/10 for me.Bugs_____I couldn't find any bugs, but I only played 2 1/2 hours. I have not played enough to give my humbe opinion on bug status.?/10Anyway.Overall for me is 9/10. Sounds are pretty good to me in this game also.I would recommend the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game to anyone who loves Grand Strategy Games( Also recommend Victoria II, EU IV, Hearts of Iron series, although these games are not as advanced.) My first full pledged review, so its probably very choppy. Worth the 9$!			"

												There are some good things about this game. 1. Detailed world map 2. Geo-political mechanics are realtively decent 3. Lots of options and can create your own units.Here are the problems.... 1. It crashes a lot. 2. Some countries it is too easy to rule. AKA USA, UK,CHINA 3. It's very very easy to have almost every nation on earth to declare war on you.For the price, and if you have a good system that can handle the game then you should get it, although there are some other simulation games that do better and are more fun than superpower 2. I wish there would be a superpower 3 but that will never happen.			"

												Overall a good game, but what kills it for me is that you spend hours and hours playing it, only to be beaten not by other countries but by the infamous ""Autarky Bug"". Incase for those who don't know what it is, it is basically a bug that comes later on during the game where everyone or most of the world's countries have become self sufficient and hence no longer want to buy anything on the world market. In simple terms, when all the world's countries produce everything they want ""meet their demands"", they no longer want to buy from you. This in turn causes your economy/personal income to slowly deplete/decrease over time. The bug basically sends you back to the stone age and apparently there is no other way around this bug just yet.So for those thinking about buying this game, don't do it till they fix the ""Autarky bug"". Otherwise its your money down the drain as I've found out.			"

												This game when it was first released quickly became the baseline for which i rated all Geo-Political simulators. Has a steep learning curve for some, however those who like a more real time strategy game that brings all elements in a nice thought provoking game this is it!You likely wont get through a round  in an hour long session. Instead you will find you can spend weeks playing just one round. It was great back then and it is great here. It has crashed only twice on me in steam. So its pretty stable and patched.			"

												I have spent a lot of hours and multiple play throughs on this game. Although it may not be the best real-time strategy game out there, it's definitely a dark horse for the genre. In terms of the geopolitical genre games I've played, this has to be the best. Mods (from current times in 2015, to WWII, Cold War times etc) made from the community make the game even sweeter. Worth the money for anyone that likes real-time strategy or geopolitical games. 9/10.			"

												I used to play SuperPower 1 and 2 back in the day, and had fun with both. Having lost both games over time for one reason or another, I decided to purchase Superpower 2 for Steam for nostalgic purposes. What I encountered was a little underwhelming.As other reviewers have pointed out, realism pretty much flies out the door with this one. One time I played as Croatia and, after an hour of play, had China randomly invade and annex me. In another game I watched online, Italy invaded and annexed China, then started eating up African countries, with no one in the world seemingly caring. I know there are realism mods out there, but as is, the game leaves much to be desired in this regard. Related to this is how the game's mechanics react to your decisions. Example: I started with a multi-party democracy nation with basic political freedoms, and then - practically overnight - outlawed every religion and language except one, removed freedom of contraception, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, then transformed the government into a military dictatorship. You know what the drop in popular support was? MAYBE like 5%. I'm not kidding. It went back to normal after a while. Government stability didn't take a hit either. I had done this to see just how insane my nation would go, but discovered that it didn't do anything even negative in the short-term. For a supposed geopolitical simulator, that's a bit lacking.One of the most aggravating aspects of this game is the economic model. At first glance, it can seem like a wonderful simulation of the world trade, but after trying to figure the thing out...I just can't make a surplus. Well, to be fair, I did once, but I don't even remember how I did it. I've tried various methods, and I've read tutorials online on how to set up your economy, but nothing seems to work. I've dealt with the economic models in other games from a variety of developers, and even if they were at first difficult, I managed to figure them out after a while. SP2, however, has a model that will aggravate the casual gamer and give them headaches, trying to figure out how to keep those numbers from getting red again.One of the few things I appreciate about this game is the way wars and armies are done. Unlike SP1, which were a bit more clustered and limited to various cities, you can move armies around the map like you could in real life, and let them engage across a wider front. It's fun to see the symbols flying around on the spec-ops-style map, and watch the battles between two sides unfold.Is SP2 worth purchasing? I honestly don't think it's worth even $10. It can be that one game you take out every year and play for a while, before you remember why you uninstalled it in the first place, but it probably won't be something you play on a regular basis.

It's a deep geopolitical power brokering game, covering every byword you are likely to hear in a broadsheet newspaper or on some fiscally entertaining news bulletin.It's incredible how long ago the game was made, and yet how it still manages to apply to today.Intellectually appealing and stimulating, I am going to immerse myself in this bureaucratic power struggle for hours on end, I just know I am.

												I highly reccomend this! I love RTS strategy games and this one is quite interesting. I like the game for It's economic system and how the AI Doesn't completely fail in the economic side, unlike Supreme Ruler where the AI builds nothing but Tanks, jets, naval stuff, ect ect, this is quite fun. I have already put 44 hours into the game and in that amount of time, i managed to turn county's like the Congo and Israel into superpowers. It's not all about agression in this game, it's about getting on everyones good side. You can't just simply take a random country and just build tons of units and destroy the world. It takes time and i love the way it does it. You have to sometimes depend on other country's for aid and you have to work your way up bit by bit untill you can actually annex something. I love how the resources work, I mean, you don't have to manage resources all the time. You can get that all privitised and let your people expand it. That doesn't work all the time, you need to put some money into it so you can help your resources grow and the people will carry that duty on. Let's say Canada was the leader in Dairy production and you take that place, Canada will start to hate you and I love how it works.Nukes, oh how I love them. They are not too over-powered, but yes they do pack a punch in this game. Nukes are quite cheap, depending on what nation you play as,but they take a long time to build and are quite exspensive to maintain them. In packs, nukes can destroy populations and dammage your enemy's resources heavily and turn military's to dust. Think before you use nukes, cause using nukes will devistate your relations with other country's and if you use nukes in very small packs... Well, you will be better off throwing toothpicks at your enemy.Here's where it gets bad. This game wasn't really made for Windows 7 or 8 and so it tends to crash a little bit. There are bugs in the game where some country's are nothing but luck to try and set up for becoming a superpower. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rebles and some others. There's also a bug where you can't take certain land and so on. The game really does have some downfalls, sometimes to relations tend to mess up. I got nuked by Russia and instead of people hating Russia, they started to hate me more. I don't understand this much, but it doesn't matter aslong as you have a much more powerful military then your enemy's.Is it worth the price considering the bugs? YES! You might get annoyed from the bugs, but indeed it's a fun game. Very easy to get used to and you will always find new ways to beoming powers. If it's from economic domination to just pure agression.			"

The game is brilliantly executed with the ability to fully control any country on the planet and alter it as you please. You can also take over other countries and enherit their money if you're running short. SuperPower 2 is a great example of a good real-time strategy game.Pros:+ Ability to control and alter entire countries+ Great economy system+ Replay value+ Nuclear weapons + Nice global view+ Realistic+ Moddable+ ChallengingCons:- Glitches - Some typos in city names - Can't control battles between units- Can't exit battle screen7/10			"

												Considering it came out in 2004, this has aged really well. I enjoy the fact that I can turn Somalia into one of the richest nations in the world and dominate all of eastern Africa with my armed forces. Yes the game can crash and has many issues, but it's still fun to play.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games like these and is up to a challenge!Not only does this game guve you the oppurtunity to become a Stalin or a Bush, it also let's you turn a country from a sh#t hole into a paradise.Don't get to aggressive though,  the world might invade you if you annex to much countries or wage alot of wars.

												The game is fun but the warfare system IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID apparently building 10,000 tanks is enough to take on the words military and dont even get me started on the stacking which basicly means HEY LETS JUST SEND IN MY WHOLE MILITARY AND SEE WHAT HAPPANS and if you lose then your basicly screwed I honestly think that the creators were high when they making the way war works in this game it has no strategic value but if you can suck it up and get past this and hopfully get into a server that doesnt allow players to do that (which is very unlikely) then this is a pretty fun game yeah its old and by god its laggy as hell but still fun even though everyone is an Hitler wanna be and take over the world and♥♥♥♥♥♥but what ever cant really play an RP game without it turning into world domination honeslty though if you want to be baned from every RP game server ever because you want to stop somone from taking over the world or you just try to have a conversation with the people in your game then dont play this			"

												SuperPower 2 is, by far, one of the best political simulators I have ever played. The game is brilliantly executed with the ability to fully control any country on the planet and alter it as you please. You can also take over other countries and enherit their money if you're running short. SuperPower 2 is a great example of a good real-time strategy game.Pros:+ Ability to control and alter entire countries+ Great economy system+ Replay value+ Nuclear weapons + Nice global view+ Realistic+ Moddable+ ChallengingCons:- Glitches - Some typos in city names - Can't control battles between units- Can't exit battle screen7/10			"

												There are some good things about this game. 1. Detailed world map 2. Geo-political mechanics are realtively decent 3. Lots of options and can create your own units.Here are the problems.... 1. It crashes a lot. 2. Some countries it is too easy to rule. AKA USA, UK,CHINA 3. It's very very easy to have almost every nation on earth to declare war on you.For the price, and if you have a good system that can handle the game then you should get it, although there are some other simulation games that do better and are more fun than superpower 2. I wish there would be a superpower 3 but that will never happen.			"

Multiplayer sessions can be worthwhile if you have the time, creating an interesting roleplay experience. Whether it be choosing between two alliances and eventually creating a Second Cold War, leading to a large scale global conflict, or a game of diplomacy and peacekeeping. With the amount of countries, single player can always offer a new experience, allowing for you to try a different style. Overall, one of the best games I have purchased.			"

												The game takes place on a beautifully created globe with over 150 playable countries to take into the world scale. There are many things that really make this game addictively fun--the environment is very well made with excellent music, the game allows you to create and design your own units, with about a dozen categories of different units in the game, from infantry to ballistic submarines. Lastly, you're able to control the fate of the world and your country through war or diplomacy. Some downsides though, the AI is poorly made. Also, if you're looking for a quick game, leave now, because this game is extremely time consuming. Time passes too slow to provide for enhanced gameplay. But there's no reason not to get this game if you like strategy games, it's generally cheap compared to the more popular ones, and the entertainment you'll get from this game is worth the low price.

												I bought the first Super Power when it first came out and loved it. There were a lot of odds and ends that made it rough at times but was playable. Geo-political is my favorite type of game of my strategy list... If you are looking for a more in-depth strategy game with plenty of complications this one is worth the $10.I will sy that there are game-ending bugs in SP2 that you almost cannot get around. the worst I have found is enemy units stuck in deployment mode....which means you can't take the territory it is stuck in. If you are looking for conquest victory...this bug ruins it all... I have yet to get around it.This is a time consuming game....one of those that you leave running while you sleep if things are looking good. Although I liked SP1 better in most of the mechanics... SP2 is still good and has been simplified but with better UI. A combination of both would be epic for me. I would say it is worth the $10. If you live on strategy games this one is a good addition to your collection.			"

												EDIT: Initially, I gave this game a negative review. For people who said I didn't play the game enough for a fair review, I purchased the game back in 2001, I have seen plenty of this game.What changed my mind about the playability of this game was not the developer, who re-released this game for a quick cash grab on steam without fixing major issues, and it wasn't fan boys coming to leave little angry comments about my subjective opinion of their favowite game.No, it was the 2015 Realism mod. This excellent mod not only updates the game to 2015, but adds the balance, depth and ai common sense I would expect from a game that purports to be an Information-Age global simulation. As such there are a few things to keep in mind:1. The game allows you to delegate decisions about economic, political, or military matters to the AI. This means the game allows you to get as general or focused as you want without having those other areas fall apart. For those confused by the game I would recommend utilizing and observing the AI behavior and slowly getting more involved.2. The game (for me at least) has some delay in when it reports feedbackback, particularly involving money. This means that you have to sometimes be a bit patient and wait for changes to register.3. Single player is merely a primer for what is actually a gigantic united nations simulator community on the multiplayer servers. The real reward for learning this game is to play against more challenging human opponents, but be warned that they take roleplay kind of seriously on most servers.So in conclusion, the 2015 Realism mod makes this game playable. The game runs stable for me, and seems well optomized. If you like grand strategy titles you should enjoy yourself. Multiplayer is where the real challenge is. If you can't see yourself enjoying geeking out with foreign policy nerds on rp servers, or dealing with some of the learning curve issues, steer clear.			"

												Overall a good game, but what kills it for me is that you spend hours and hours playing it, only to be beaten not by other countries but by the infamous ""Autarky Bug"". Incase for those who don't know what it is, it is basically a bug that comes later on during the game where everyone or most of the world's countries have become self sufficient and hence no longer want to buy anything on the world market. In simple terms, when all the world's countries produce everything they want ""meet their demands"", they no longer want to buy from you. This in turn causes your economy/personal income to slowly deplete/decrease over time. The bug basically sends you back to the stone age and apparently there is no other way around this bug just yet.So for those thinking about buying this game, don't do it till they fix the ""Autarky bug"". Otherwise its your money down the drain as I've found out.			"

												After playing this game a bit more i have came to the conclusion that it is wayyyyyy to expensive for what it offers you unless you mod it. It needs to go on sale more so more people will buy it. It's hard to find a good friend on the lobby's to because they are all nut jobs talking about politics when they know nothing about it. The worst is when i confront someone who acts like they are canadian. If you are Canadian like me watch out for the telltale sign of a fake Canadian. #1 Say's that the best Canadian hockey team is the Toronto Maple Leafs. They are wrong all of them are ♥♥♥♥ thanks to the American teams taking all the good Canadian players. #2 Say's that it's cold all the time. It's not in the summer it could make an African sweat. #3 Use's Celsius instead of fahrenheit. I hate when this happens even if it sounds like a beleiveable Canadian if they use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit they should be executed. Finally somthing actually about the game. Save your money and wait for a sequel to come out. I still recommend it but it's to expensive for what it has to offer. Thank you for reading. "

												I give this game a 7/10 for the steam edition because of constant crashing and bugs, and 8/10 for the non-steam edition because the game is pretty fun especially the fact you can design your own Tanks, Arty guns, boats, nukes, IFVs, etc., but it doesn't really go much into uniqueness of each nation really the only unique things about them is the flag, name, and how powerful/technologically advanced they are at the start. There isn't anything like having revolutions force government changes, seperatists breaking away from the nation and forming their own or joining another nation, and combat is really just putting all of your forces into one giant glob and fighting the enemies forces which is just one giant glob then occupying their whole territory and just freeing their regions until everybody loves you then annexing the territory. But even though there are these two bigish issues the game still has a lot of good content in it, and I would recommend looking up videos of it before buying or not buying it.Edit: In the game's current state on steam I cannot recommend this anymore. The battles can't be exited out of, forcing you to watch until the end before you can exit, and sometimes the entire world will get extremely angry at you for no reason at all (i.e attacking a country everyone hates then everyone declares war on you for attacking said country)Edit (Again): The problems only happened in singleplayer, multiplayer works fine and might even be better to play than singleplayer.

You can control almost any country in the world with the fun of singleplayer or multiplayer, aswell as have certain scenarios made for you by the devs themselves! There's also plenty of mods for this game which increase the fun! I've got over 200 hours, and aslong as you don't mind slow games... I think you will enjoy.8/10 in my opinion!			"

All this is made very easy by the unique interface of a three dimensional globe and multiple dialogue boxes for controlling all strands of your nation.			"

												*Disclaimer: sorry for my bad english, i'll try my best to give this game a review that makes sense*Superpower 2 is a great game, it lets you control entire countries, from the economic, military and politc view, the game it's not complicated, actually its controlls are very simple, letting you change a lot of stuff in your country in a few seconds (even if the menus are badly designed and counterintuitive) i would not recomend this game to everyone, even if the controlls are fairly easy, the difficulty is atrocious, and the pacing very slow (i find these good things, but i guess not everyone likes it), if you're looking for a deep political/strategy game, grab it up, but if it's not your jam i suggest you look for something else "

												The learning curve for getting into this game is quite steep, but once you overcome it, the game really opens up. I noticed some bugs when playing, but nothing game-breaking. 8/10			"

												Great game for Numberjerks. The Game crashes ""quite often"", but in the look it's an very old Game it is running fine (Win 7). Experience only in SP.AI agressivity must be mid high (60-80%), otherwise it feels like the enemy only tries to fix ther economy and do nothing else. Or just play with war Treaties to crush their diplomatic reliance in the deep red. "

Nothing really happend. A few enemys, thats all, and while central europe was burning, countries around just went on like yesterday, promoting the freedom of speech.			"
