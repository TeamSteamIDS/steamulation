												At first I thought this game was wonderful, but oh how things can change. Don't be deceived by the joyful horse pictures, this is a hazardous game that should not be sold without severe warning. After countless days of raising horses, I was grazing on some nearby greens when my roommate dropped a dish on the ground. It broke and the noise of it spooked me, causing me to rear back and kick him in the head. Now he talks with a speech impediment and has a wonky eye. I haven't launched this game in 3 weeks because it will remind me of the incident. I can't face the reality of what I've done. My family won't speak to me, I have badly infected rug burn on both of my knees, and I'm malnourished from eating nothing but carrots, although my eye sight has never been better. Damn you Petz Horsez, you've ruined my life!!!!			"

												I do not recommend this. This game has one of the worst user interfaces I have ever seen in my entire life. You are required to use the arrow keys AND the mouse, for example. Even if the game allowed complete key re-mapping, it would still be clunky, hard to navigate, confusing, and unintuitive. They do not remind you how to perform actions (coming back to the game after a while? I hope you have a good memory!), the clock/time of day system is insanely confusing, navigating the world is beyond ridiculous, and the horses look like weird mutants. Get the console version instead. It's a completely different game and way, way better.			"

												In this intense and proudly renowned MMORPG, You take the role of Emma, who is fairly MLG, her horse riding skills are enough to make any man cry with joy. The mare's and horses all agree that her skillz are madd. The farm could not quickscope without her. Sadly there no weed on the farm, so no danking, she meets a gai camper boi called Oliver who can't noscope and uses ballista instead of DSR 50. (gay noob). Liek srysly get on Emma's lvl cheeky scrub. She also gets tons of hitmarkers when riding the horse on the training track. I would like to know what happened to that hardscoper at the beginning of this magnificent game called Hugo, he's a fukking hacker. Overall I would rate Call of Duty MW2 a 14/3. I liked the map rust. Sample Text   Sample text	 If you do not subscribe to my red tube account, I chop my knob off!Overall good game!Lol i'm joking, who the ♥♥♥♥ plays this game?? "

												I tried marathoning my way through to the end of this and somewhere around 10 hours in I fell asleep. When I woke up, the game was running an endless credits loop. Apparently I beat it in my sleep, or trained my horse sufficiently, or something.I don't know if I should be proud of, or horrified by, the fact that I apparently sleep-gamed my way to the end of Petz® Horsez® 2.

												Sad that this 2007 hidden gem of a game was overshadowed by such lesser games that came out that year, like Bioshock, Portal, The Elder Scrolls IV, and Super Mario Galaxy. It only shows how unaccepting the mainstream game consumer base is when it comes to smaller or less-marketed IPs.			"

												This game is the best game ever! I dont know why i bothered putting 60 hours into fallout and 400 into Civ V when all that time was wasted not playing Petz Horses 2. This game really takes you on a fun joy ride adventure were you play some girl whose stuck in france, because the deer from the begining cutscene sabatoge your car off camera. Thats the only explanation to how it happens! This game takes your horse riding fantasies and removes all the boring things. Like father figures, realistic responsibilities, and the putrid smell of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ Other than the poor resolution in the cut scenes, and the failure to let me strap a flux capasitor to my horse and ride 88 miles an hour through the French country side. This game is good, in fact its the best game ever. IN FACT! Its the best game Ubisoft has ever made! Why play as a boring native american assassin in the colonial era, when you can talk to characters who personalities resemble chalk, in Petz Horses 2.Not to mention all the people on the farm are idiots. I mean seriously how can you live on a horse farm for years, and not have a vet! Thats was a ""Quest"" in the begining of the game, at the end of that same ""Quest"" you have to walk into a barn and pet a horse with a sponge. Thats it. WAS THAT SERIOUSLY THAT HARD? I BARELY DID ANYTHING! But the horse was fine after that. The horses, now sponged foot, was magically ok and we did thousands of random jumps over strategicly placed wooden walls that were most likely left over peices of the Maginoe Line.  Best game ever 200/10			"

												For real though, this is one of the best horse games I have ever played. Don't let the title fool you, this game is legit. This is not your ordinary, boring af, 3-day event competition with no story horse game. This game has a real story with a cast of very interesting, well rounded characters, each with in-depth backstories you can discover. Yeah, you heard me. A horse game with actual characters that talk about actual things with an actual plot. This is the real deal. Real talk.The plot has got some cool mystery elements, lots of scandal, social commentary, romance if you choose, and it adapts to how you play the game. There are multiple paths and multiple endings. Do you mostly care about eventing and breeding horses? You can choose not to concern yourself with solving the mystery and the focus of the plot will shift.  The interesting side character backstories? You only discover them if you chose to interact with them. Very adaptive. Yes. Good. Encourages the player to interact with the in-game world. Yes. Good!Since the the story is a mystery it can get a little intense at points and might get a little bit scary for some younger players. This game is pretty gosh darn ugly, but fortunately, it is very easily modded. The textures, text, sounds, meshes/models, and animations are all there for you to fiddle around with. Unfortunately, if you can't mod the files yourself, you gotta deal with the ugliness because there are no mods out there for this game. It was 2007. A more innocent time. A simpler time. An uglier time. Much uglier. Very ugly. Bad. Mouths do not move, some people don't blink, the saddle clips through the horse, the girl clips through the saddle AND the horse, the chestnut horses are not chestnut and the cream horses are NOT cream. Currently trying to find a way to upload some of my mods to the steam workshop for other people that are bothered by these things.There's lots of neat stuff in this game. You got all sorts of collectibles, sidequests, and secrets. It's got a stat system, a training system, a breeding system, a rider skill system,  an affection/morale system and each of these systems effects your game in tiny ways. Very fun. Yes. good. On foot, the controls can feel very clunky. On horseback, things are easy-peasy. You can configure the keys to your taste, but not all of them. Gotta go to the config.ini to change them if you can't handle the good ol' 2007 clunk controls. They are very bad.Like most horse games, this has a ridiculously long grooming sequence. Unlike most horse games from the time, you can actually rotate the camera and brush the ENTIRE horse instead of just one side. The shower option was actually developed in hell itself by the devil. I have proof. I can confirm this. There is also a hoof-picking sequence in which you have to avoid hitting the frog or else the horse will scream VERY LOUDLY. AMAZING! REVOLUTIONARY! Yes. Good! Oh, and get this, GET THIS: you get emmerse yourself in an AMAZING FIRST PERSON STALL MUCKING EXPERIENCE! YES! There is a training and trust bar you can fill up. The activities you need to do to fill them up are awful. The lunging minigame is very confusing and very difficult. Actually had to look up a tutorial. Very hard. You need a good mouse. The other minigame is just memorization based but there is a very loud buzzer noise that plays if you answer incorrectly. Very scary. Mute your volume for that. You will pee yourself. I know this.Ugly yes, but a quality horse game with a lot of depth and character, which is saying a lot because horse games are notoriously bad. The stat system is well made, but simple and won't confuse younger players. More realistic than most horse games targeted at a younger audience, but realism fans will likely not rejoice. This game has something for every age group. Good enough that you can genuinely enjoy it, and bad enough that you can still make fun of it the whole time. Very poorly made, but that's part of what I like about it.			"

												One of my favorite games on Steam.It is a sequel (which I consider non-cannon due to some retcons) to the beloved gaming classic Petz Horsez.It is one of the few Petz games that I know of that has an open world, a plot, and makes the featured Petz more of a set-piece than a focal point. Horsez 2 is more of a murder-mystery adventure game than a horse game, though there are some required areas of horse gameplay and lots of optional horsing around if you're looking for more riding. They've also stored most of the textures for the game in plain, easily editable, formats (.png if I recall - it has been a while) that totally allow you to make the game feel more like a cross between Silent Hill and Call of Cthulhu than a Petz game.

												This game is a deep journey of earth-shattering proportions. You might know the direction you're headed when you start out but LOOK OUT, LEFT TURN. It is a mammoth of crippling proportions filled with deep, soulful characters and plot twists that put M. Night Shyamalan to shame.If I could buy physical copies of this game, I would buy a million and build a house using them, so I could live within the walls of its glory for the rest of my days. It is the game I will play on my death bed, the game I will give to my grandchildren. It is the game that defines every aspect of my character because it has changed my oulook on the world in such fundamental ways. A masterpiece.An epic.Thank you, Petz Horsez 2.			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops is the sequel to the famous and well known Petz Horsez: Horsez at War. Everything about this amazing adventure oozes quality. From the first moment you see the polygons flicker and distort across your screen during the many broken animations and watch the mouth movements fail to sync with the psychotic and inane spoken dialog badly translated from what was probably originally a French release, you'll be hooked on CoD:Black Ops. The best part is the tutorial that you are given early on, as your friend Oliver shows you around the place you'll be staying and working. After teaching you how to cure the infection in your starter horse's foot, you are shown where it can participate in challenges. Unfortunately, your horse's stats are not high enough to participate in that day's challenge, so instead of clicking Confirm you must select the Back option. Which doesn't work. At all. Alt-F4 does, however, and so your quest is finally at an abrupt, although satisfying, end.			"

												Petz Horsez 2 combines amazing visuals with addictive gameplay that'll have you whinnying for more. Developer Activision consulted with many Horse breeders, experts, and gluemakers in the creation of this game, to deliver the most realistic in horse simulation thus far. Using the most realistic graphical polygon shader bloom particles to date, I can assure you that Barbie Horse Adventurez 2 is going to be an impressive simulation from start to finish. Definitely a good purchase for the mature horse-loving individual, My Little Poniez 2 gets ****FIVE ST*RS***** and a major high-five on the hoof from this reviewer!			"

												As someone who is horse crazy, I thought this would be a really fun and cool game to play like the DS version, but...Not so much. The start was ok until you had to navigate Emma around to different places. It's really too complex to do. The arrow keys seemed to be reversed as well. The way the camera is faced makes it more difficult because it's hard to see where you are going. Overall, navigation is kinda sucky and when I tried to make my horse jump (hitting space as I was instructed), it wouldn't jump. I do not recommend this game as it's a bit of a waste of money and time...			"

												Please believe me that i tried...( I hate you for this Alpaca )First impressions was errors calling for installation of Direct play, alerts for debugs....etc.  all fixed and ready to play.For some reason my gaming name is to long for the game....seems more than 8 is taboo.ok so on to the game:Day one - meet allot of random people....maybe on drugs?....and wait for the magic yellow school bus to pick me up (druggy lied and dissapears....no bus).  The character development was already amazing in day one as i went from a graduating university vet student to a prospective horse riding show rider..thingy.  Aaaand the hippy people i just met are perfectly happy to let me help with the birthing of a foal....or something, which i was yet to see and with no practical experience.Day 2 - got so lost in the surrounding area that i somehow managed to arrive at the abondoned village......oddly next to the thriving one....with allot of cats inside, and the mysterious door with a clue on.   Day 3 -  I just could'nt anymore.Pros - It's cheap?        - The horsies are cute?        - Alpacca bought this for me....so its free....that has to count Cons - For 7 Gig I assumed the graphics would be more than acceptable... i was wrong         - The controls was developed by some nitwit with the IQ of a 5 year old....who the **** uses up and down arrows for                        movement anymore??          - strange map system which should have been much more developed          - 5 of the character does nothing....or i havent done enough other than hearing them say querky odd lines.          - the ""cute"" goat in the front of the line looks like it took the same amount of time to develop as the entire game.....and it still looks like a misformed bull terrier.All in all a terrible game which forces me to wonder how someone is allowed to sell this for profit.* Note :  I took the same amount of effort in my grammar and spelling that the game developers took on the game.

												I spent 13 hours trying to kill the damn horse. There are no consequences in this game. This warped reality will have you staring at your screen like some sort of zombie waiting for that glorious, ""You horse has died, you lose. You are also a horrible monster."" However, that moment will never arrive.			"

												Game is missing 3 files that are needed to play the game. But i would say it would be funny to see my friends reactions to see me playing over 100hrs of this game! Note the game does not run and i just idle on it.			"

												Totally worth the 5.8GB download! Only thing missing was a better internet connection so I could have played sooner! ...possibly better than Petz Horsez 1?			"

												This game appears to be a happy clappy game about raising horsez and having a great time with life. But ITS A TRAP. I am the lucky one, I bought this game planning to play it when I came home from school but as I was doing my homework my kitten Jimmy opened the game by accident. He took one look and I heard a high pitched scream. I ran into the room to find out that Jimmy had hung himself I burned the computer as it let out a demonic cry and summoned Satan. So the moral of the story is ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO BE LED TO SUICIDE.			"
