												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Positives* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Negatives* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.ConclusionIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.

												Let me give you a history lesson.  In 1989 Simcity was relased.  And it was great.In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great.In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great.  (Are you seeing a theme here?)In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.Now... it gets sad.2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing.And in 2013 brought us Sim City.  And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.  By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park.  Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support.In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up.  Still dont have one.Buy this game.			"

												So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.			"

UPDATED MARCH 2016Alright, let me start this off with this. If you already love city-builders, this is for you. If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally  or partially) were done. The traffic AI has been greatly improved since release.Pros:- CURVY ROADS- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.- Mods, 74,000+ mods.- Intuituve Menu Layout- Great AI- Base Game is worth the priceCons: - DLC has too little content for too high a price.Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.			"

												Saw this game on the front page, never knew about it. As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them. PROS:No EA.No EA Origin.Did I mention no EA involved?Also no EA.-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.The only thing I don't like about this game so far?@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)So far and still hours later, 10/10.**EDIT 5/23/2015**I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.Game still kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)- Play without an internet connection- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash- Edit terrain in a nice map editor- Play without logging into Origin...- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense*** Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live ***- Manage traffic properly- Have funI have been a big SimCity fan for many years. I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.So long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order. 9/10PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/  What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.Also please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.

Cities Skylines Review Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:========+  Solid graphics and rich detail+  Realistic simulation elements+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings+  Variety of buildings+  Many customization options+  Easy-to-use UI+  Extremely high replay value+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Pleasant audio/background musicThe Bad:======-  Lack of random events/natural disasters-  Graphics could be more life-like-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplayFinal Thoughts:===========Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Pros++Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre++Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work. +Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers +Runs well on my GTX 770 and i5 3.8ghz CPU on max settings+Day 1 modding and Steam works integration+Custom ingame asset and map editorsCons--No day or night cycle, meaning no rush hours or changes in traffic patterns-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly. -Bigger cities can reduce performance -Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each otherIf you like city builders, this is honestly the best one to come out in years. Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens. Rename and customize everything, even custom buildings and maps can be created in the in game editors included. And with a very fair $30 price tag, there is honestly no reason outside of a few minor bugs to not play Cities: Skylines.			"

												This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!			"

Cities: SkylinesNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8 The design in Skylines is certainly well thought out. A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke?    Gameplay 9.5 This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.   Story N/A No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.   Multiplayer N/A No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.   Replayability 10 This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.   Overall 9.6/10 If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

												Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.Sim City, eat your heart out.			"

												My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own♥♥♥♥♥♥ RIP in peace Squidney Saxton, garbage man, 2015-2015.On the bright side, my traffic problem went away.			"

												For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, ""screw it"" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The ""basic"" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshopNeutral± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown. After Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!Snowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. Verdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!Cons- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)---------------------------------------------------------All in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, bravo: thank you for this amazing game.Overall9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!---------------------------------------------------------Update 11 June, 2016: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, Colossal Order - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.---------------------------------------------------------Worthy Questions & Answers1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.Prefer watching a video instead of reading? Check out my video review right here:

												Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.MAP SIZE: 10/10The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.AI: 7/10They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.INTERFACE: 9/10The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.HOW IT RUNS: 10/10It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video:

			All credit goes to the creators of these cities :) Like, comment, and subscribe for more!		

THINGS TO DO: 9/10There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.DIVERSITY: 9/10The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.CLUTTER: 8/10Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..PRICE: 10/10For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.OVERALL SCORE:90% To PerfectWould I recommend this? Yes!			"

			Finally, a promising contender for SimCity's city-building crown. Is it any good? How does it compare to its predecessors? Find out in this review!		

If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.			"

Q: What I think of this game?A: Best city builder game I played... ever... periodQ: What I don’t like about it?A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...Q: What about user generated content?A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game. I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all. But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...Q: Does it worth the price?A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time. Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?Q: What I would love to see added to the game?A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added. Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.Q: What are my advices when playing the game?A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.It's easy to ""cheat"" the game, but it will not make it more fun. - Watch tutorials to get some ideas - Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it... - Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any timeQ: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU! But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud?     I am sure you are ;) You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work. Kudos to everyone!!!Q: Where am I going?A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!			"

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.			"

												Not owned by EA.What more is there to say?10/10------------------------------------------------------------------Edit : This is truly the best city simulation games no doubt. But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams. And also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once. http://imgur.com/gallery/5xz1CYa  What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once. Other than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this. Some of the mods are fun and helpful and they are easy to configure. If you are a new Cities Skylin-er, I will recommend you these mods : https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/3c5sku/been_seeing_questions_from_new_users_on_essential/ "

												This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.Pros:+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod toolsCons:- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.			"

												Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the ""best"" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.PS: Kill Chirpy.			"

Cities: Skylines is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the After Dark DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).Pros: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. Colossal Order's experience with Cities in Motion shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.Cons: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. Cities: Skylines is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition, equaling or surpassing most innovations SimCity ""5"" brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the Snowfall DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming Natural Disasters DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.P.S.: I haven't mentioned the Mods available through the Steam Workshop, but I just have to point out Bryan Shannon, a former Maxis artist who does professional-quality building Mods for Cities: Skylines. If you have any interest in downloading Mods for this game, you should browse his collection.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

This is the City Builder of my Dreams!If you're unsure if you want this game because other City Builders put you off...Trust me, I've played them all and this one is by far the best!Things I really like:- Buying surrounding land, the starter map isn't overwhelming.- Map / Item Editors... - Customisation makes any game better.- The launch price isn't greedy...- The graphics are beautiful and the game is amazingly optimised!- Little animations such as ambulances, fire engines etc. add that character to the game.- Workshop support!.. The developers fully support Modders! :D- Right-Hand Drive option - This makes it more realistic to me...Things I don't like:- The roads are good but they can be a little awkward to place every so often.- Placing pipelines.. I rather this just be auto-added under streets- The Unlock system is good but things like Taxes or Public Transport shouldn't be Locked.- Doesn't seem to work on triple monitors... The game loads but you can't click ""Continue"" or ""New"".I'd Recommend this game to anyone who Enjoys Building games or Simulators. 10/10There's a few really minor issues but overall this is the best game of its sub-genre.Another game that makes me happy to own a Computer!

												I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my ""capital of capitals"" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - ""buy more of this, it will enhance the experience"". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, ""Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?"" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.

												This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.Pros:- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). - District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.- Natural resource exploitation for more income.- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)Cons:- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.			"

												Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :DDo I recommend this game? :D  Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.			"

												Bought it on release day. Within 1 hour I uninstalled....Simcity 2013, Simcity 4 and Simcity Societies. Simcity was THE game growing up and now Skylines has brought that back in tenfold. Skylines is missing three things that I would love to see. Disasters: No not zombies or monster attacks... Disasters..a weather dynamic system such as rain, snow, tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military baseElections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.Major Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot. Let us bid for the olympics  then have to build the buildings should we win the bid! Or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team. World events such as a Worlds Fair, or Papal Visit, or other major world events. That's my three wishes. Maybe a developer will see at least one ;) "

Cities: SkylinesDeveloper: Colossal Order LTDPublisher: Paradox InteractiveIntroduction==========I've never been particularly great at city building games, though I have been sort of playing them since the old Sim City 2000. Actually in that one I spent more time loading up scenarios and dropping various disasters on the city than playing...but still. There were very few offerings in this genre apart from Sim City, but then Cities: Skylines happened, and suddenly Sim City wasn't top dog anymore. Some will argue that Cities is better in every way.Gameplay==========As city builders go, Cities: Skylines is pretty simple. New players might be a little confused in the beginning, just as I was. I was so used to the Sim City UI and flow. First you need to setup roads, then zone the areas beside them. Residential, Commercial, Industrial, etc. Hook up power, water, and sewage, then watch as buildings start to pop up and people start to move in. As your population rises, new features, monuments, and buildings become available. There are tons of options for setting up your city, such as different kinds of roads, buildings leveling up, the ability to rename literally everything, and terrain redesign. As long as the basic needs are met, your city can thrive, but obviously some configurations and setups are better than others. How efficently things run is entirely up to you and how you plan out your city. You can freely manipulate the passage of time, by pausing it or speeding it up by 3 different levels. There is a nice option to have unlimited funds if you don't feel like being constrained by anything or just want to test out different layouts on a different save. Planning is probably the most important step of setting up a city, and finances is part of that. If you aren't particularly great at finances, the unlimited money option will be your best friend. It's recommended to pause the game right away when you first get started and make sure you go through the in-game tutorial prompts.Oh, one little tiny extra detail that may make or break your purchase decision: STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT. MODS. Enough said!Graphics==========This game is absolutely gorgeous. Every tiny detail is amazing. Once you get your city setup, zoom in and check it out from time to time, especially when you get some skyscrapers or monuments set up, or at night during the hustle and bustle. This game will provide you with some amazing screenshots for your Steam profile showcase! Pure eye candy all around.Sound and Music==========Cities: Skylines has a very relaxing soundtrack. Perfect for long or short sessions. When zoomed in enough, you'll also hear your citizens as they go about their daily lives. Car horns honk during busy traffic times, and of course there's the bustle of the industrial zones. Nothing was left out here. It's completely possible to get pretty immersed into your city, in every aspect.Performance==========The game runs wonderfully, I didn't experience a single problem even on the highest settings. Stable framerates, no lag, no stuttering. Mouse control is highly recommended. I'm not even sure a controller works, I didn't try. Might do it next time I play and update this, just for those who enjoy controller supported games.Final Thoughts==========What a wonderful game! Whether you enjoy city builders already or are looking to get into them, Cities: Skylines is a great title to introduce you to the genre or keep veterans occupied. With a couple of DLCs available, and of course all the mods currently out, you'll have plenty to keep you busy managing your city for dozens or even hundreds of hours. A great buy for sure.Gameplay Demo==========

												When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.

			My cities Skyline review, I spent over 20 hours playing and building cities.You can listen to why I loved this game but at the same time got bored with it, also steam review is up.		

 Pros + Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place. + The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for + Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with. Cons (Or things that Cities Skyline needs to add)- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it. - The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game.

												Cities: Skylines is a brand new city-building game in the vein of Simcity but built with modern sensibilities.What is Great about this game:- The city-building simulation is deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying to master- The agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage- A variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city- The game looks and runs beautifully- Available areas for expansion are massive (and truly huge with easy to acquire mods)- Modding and Steam Workshop support is pervasive in the game, and the modding community is prolificWhat is Good about this game:- Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)What is Bad about this game:- Some of the mechanics of the simulation (e.g. freight train depots, RCI) are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problemsConclusion:Cities: Skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games.  This is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre, and everyone should at least try it once.10.0 / 10.0			"

												With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!			"

												Whats good -HUGE Playable area versus Simcity 2013Workshop = Endless modability Even without buying the DLC, you still get some stuff every DLC releaseWhat's not so good -Resource hog ; you need a NASA computer to run this on all highNo disasters or random eventsTraffic is at rush hour all day everyday without modsThe last DLC (Snowfall) includes some good stuff, but the main crux is merely vanity and only useable in new games (again, without mods)If you loved SimCity 4 and are yearning for a modern remake that's not SimCity 2013, this is a good attempt to revive the series. Beware that you'll *need* a few of the mods/workshop to really make the game shine.Free badges!			"

												Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. What I love:Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.Not so great:DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.			"

												I had an ice factory catch on fire. 69/10.No, but seriously. I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn't seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder ""why can't I place this here"" or ""why isn't this working?"". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.This is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.9/10			"

To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.You should know that this game is a long-term investment. You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you'll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with no knowledge about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes. Although you need a bit of patient or else you won't like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don't see it as negative point and don't get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture. Since this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic. No one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.Positive:great graphics. Subjective yes, but you can customize the colors (LUT). If you install the correct one it will look photo realistic instead of colorfuleasy to learn. Even if you're a total beginner you will find fun in creating huge ""Wuselfaktor"" as we say in German. ""bustling factor"" might be the translation for itextreme high replay valueawesome community with massive amount of mods on the workshop. I highly recommended to install at least the following must-have.low system requirements without modslow price for base gamehuge maps to build ondifferent map themesSome content from DLCs is free for base game ownersweather and day/night circlecreating own districts and add policiesNegative:traffic sometimes doesn't want to use up all lanes. Thankfully I don't have this problem so often. There are multiple workarounds you can find, nevertheless it's my only real critics point. I managed to avoid this mostly by using highway exits only on one side. (So there are 2 lanes in total for the main traffic and one for the off/on ramps) As of writing the review the developers rejected to ever fix it. As reason for this they state the increase of the system requirements needed. no real on/off ramps for highways (they are basically just one-lane highways)vanilla buildings without mods are a bit too repetitiveexpensive DLCs (for that little content they add. Nevertheless you support the developers and got a cheap base game. I got myself most DLCs by now on a sale)chirpy can get annoying ;)the following must-have mods should have been in the base gameMust-have mods:Move it! (Honestly my favorite one. For details please check workshop)All 25 Areas purchasable (exactly). Mod Achievement Enabler (Or else you won't get achievements if you use mods)Dynamic Resolution (If you have a decent PC, get that to have way better AA via downsampling)Ambient Occlusion (Adds nicer and more realistic shadows on objects)Traffic Report Tool (Shows traffic routes. Good for beginners as well as experts)NoPillars (So you can easier build bridges)Network Extension Project (So you have more road types to build with. Not sure why so many are missing in the base game tbh.)Network Skins (Change the tree type on your road and more)One-Way Train Tracks (What it says)Fine Road Tool (Change road height in smaller steps)Don't crash (most important: it improves loading times)District UI Tweaks: Hide Names (Hides District names. Why is this not in vanilla C:S??)Any kind of traffic manager. Right now I use Traffic Manager President Edition. (You can play without fine, just needs more patient fixing AI traffic manually.)Extra Landscaping Tools (Very good!)Right now I have 280 mods installed. The game doesn't crash on my system regularly but it can happen. As always I recommend to save often with that many mods. PS: On the workshop there are 96.363 mods atm. Skyrim has 49,910 on Nexus mods. ;)			"

												Cities: Skylines is a single-player city-building simulator game developed by Colossal Order, and published by Paradox Interactive. SUMMARY:  This game is great. Anyone who plays this, even if you're not a fan of the city-building genre, will enjoy this game. Pros: -simplistic and colourful art style-great UI-lots of tabs & information-good camera controls-music fits in with the atmosphere of the game, and is also well made-zoning is easy and simple, same goes with power and water-real-time water physics-plenty of variety when it comes to types of houses that are built-cities are simple and fun to create-Steam workshop support-comes with a map & asset editor, and again, easy to use-the ability to see pollution-big maps-the ability to expand your map limits-UI animations are clean-balanced loans-taxing system is great-being able to see the sewer water flow down the water is a nice touch-you can stalk each and every person in your city, and see where they live, where they work, etc. (This is ASTONISHING)-depth of field adds a nice touch to the graphics-graphics, audio, etc. settings and sliders and detailed enough-optimization is decent-the ""twitter"" function at the top of the screen is nice, and it is enjoyable to see the tweets from your citizens-Steam achievements-monuments are detailed-pretty much everything is detailed in this game-health care, police, schools, and fire stations are all cool-green energy-animations are great and mix well with everything else-SFX are great-multiple brushes for filling in zones or other things (Plus like 50 more pros, as I cannot name all of them of the top of my head) CONS -bulldozing abandoned buildings are a pain to do-no big events/disasters-traffic sometime merge together			"

												Dear Maxis,If you had done Sim City 5 like that, you'd still exist today.Dear Focus Home Interactive,This is actually how you do a city simulator. Then again, you basically bought Cities XL/XXL from Monte Cristo before they tanked and re-release it every year by adding an X to the title, so it's not like you ever tried anyway.			"

												The +'s+ Very Detailed Buildings, Roads, Cars, down to the physics in the water + Huge areas of land+ Multiple landscapes to pick from+ Ton of premade worlds to get started in+ Trains, Boats, Airplanes, Subway, Hearses, Trash Trucks, Fire Engine, Police Car, Ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles!+ Every person is doing something in the city, with cool activities like a ton of different style parks, and hey actually animate them doing it!! Create a bus route and don't enough stops ? Hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand.+Awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery+ Steam Workshop+Easy UI+ Progressing with milestones feels rewarding+ Wind Turbines turn against wind, I thought this was really cool.Now there is a ton more +'s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight soHeres the -'s-Pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad-Not really many events other than random fires which don't spread =( ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets-No Auto Save Feature (Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively)-No Cycle of day and night ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace that's not desirable, usually people like to speed it -up but if you have a decent city, the demand for structures will never stop or slow down! ( Can pause but a slow down option ? )-Wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that wayThings I would like in the game*Riots ( Maybe a military base with units ? or swat team that could stop riots ?)*More Events*Spreading Fire ( Natively ) *( I am not sure if it exists outside of a mod ) But snow?*More things for people to do other than parks and plazas ( Baseball Park, Football Stadium, etc... I *know the workshop will have tons of this stuff, but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations! )  Btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool!*Seasons that change on time of year*Night Mode with lighted sky scrapers and other modelsI highly recommend this game, although it's more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations ( at the time being at least ). $30 dollars is a great steal, if you are affraid of DLC, the workshop should ease that a but with over 20,000 items and growing!

												Cities Skylines is said to be a ""modern take on the classic city simulation"" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it's the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it's the best we will probably have for a while.This is, to an extent, the city building game we've been waiting for, at least the best one we're going to get that's is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that's made with care, that's free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that's design nicely, combined with support for community support.


YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines Gameplay Preview 

			Views: 176		

			We go to play around with it, and it's better than all city building games of recent years. More info at: http://KSalue.com End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...		

The look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it's working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.The gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.The transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.The problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.Overall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.Shameless link[ksalue.com] to original post			"

												To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine. 


YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines - First Look - Gameplay 

			Views: 4,363		

			Cities Skylines is a city builder game, that shows SimCity how a city building game SHOULD look! This First Look shows many details of Gameplay, including even things like mods!		

Pros:> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder. > The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.Cons:> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.Overall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful.It is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.And no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.Downsides: traffic isn't perfect, so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns. The devs are working on this though.Music is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/And it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...TDLR: Best City Builder in over a decade. Buy it today.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.PROS-Steam Workshop Integration-Massive Cities-Enjoyable Challenge-Cities Feel Alive-Hours and Hours of Content-Great Price for Launch-Allows for Cities of All Shapes and SizesCONS-Traffic Needs Some Balancing-Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps)-Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to TrafficAll in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow. The $30 is fair, but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price! "

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.Perhaps my father had a point.Oh, an achievement unlocked!Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.♥♥♥♥.I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum. And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.			"

												Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder, it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive.Pros:+Beautiful.+Camera controls are nice.+Crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name, house and job to street light flickering before they change.+A nice selection of maps to choose from.+Has that nice classic city builder feel to it.+Looks very modern.+Day 1 mod support.+Easy to use level editor+ building creator thing.+Lots of options for obtaining resourses.+Developers seem to be active and nice.+Sounds are nice.+Rewards you for milestones+Has actual water physics (which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature).Cons:-People are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere-Some people won't be educated even though there is a school next to them.-Some of the random ""tweets"" get repetitive.-Dosen't have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before.-Because there is no tutorial I have no way or pre-planning anything that's about to come my way and I end up not being able to build things I need.-Citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didn't build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb.-Vehicles sometimes dissapear.-Bus, Metro, Trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial.-Sometimes the game won't let you build a road/build ext. because there is something in the way, but there isn't.Overall I rate this game a 9/10 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game.

												I used to play and enjoy SimCity but I was sometimes disappointed especially with the traffic simulation. Then a friend recommended me to try Cities: Skylines. At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!P.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D			"

(More road types, ability to place props, etc)Canals are slightly buggy when trying to build bridges over Tsunamis are a little op - barriers/greenery do little to stop waves :(Overall, I still give the game a solid 11/10 XDTake my money!!!! *Flings money at paradox*			"

												For me, a teenager who does no chores and has no source of income besides holidays and birthdays, $30 is a lot of money. It took me some convincing before I would buy a game worth that much. After I've watched/read various reviews of the game, which were all positive, I finally decided that I'd buy the game, and I'm happy with the decision. As of posting this review I only have about 2 hours played, but I can tell already that I'm going to love this game and probably play many more hours. There are so many features in this game, from big things like creating individual districts that have their own policies, to small things like renaming the residents of your city.The only visible flaw of this game to me, is the game's font. It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell. As of now, that is my only problem with the game and I hope that it'll be fixed soon.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the City Builder genre. This game is the game that Sim City 2013 should have been.			"

												TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.I have tried so hard to like the game.Hands-down, technically the best city-builder since Sim City 4. The problem is: I don't have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I can't find the fun though I'm looking hard.Therefore it's aimed at creative players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.Lack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. ""Ok, I can improve traffic, but what's the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway"". ""Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget's fine"".""Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don't care and won't ever use it because there's absolutely no point"".If you're the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you'll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.If you're anything like me, then you will find that there's no point in moving away from the ""grid"" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that's the more efficient choice. So if you're a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.That may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that's the only spot where our ancestors didn't build anything...I dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you'll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts. Industrial revolution comes around and now you need housing for workers, railroads for supply: means you have to burn down some of those outskirts houses and decide what to do with their poor inhabitants... Enters XXth cenury, in order allow cars into the city you need larger avenues, so then again you need more space! Residents won't be happy... Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...You could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...If you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.Now, THAT would keep me playing till 4am. Cities: Skylines? Sadly, no.			"

												I find it difficult to 'review' Sim games because the tend to be more like toys than actual games.Alongside that, I've never really been that good at them. I have some tenure with three different SimCity games and it usually amounts to moneyflow being non-existent, and I just get frustrated and nuke the town with UFO's, Tornadoes, and Volcanoes. It was great fun for when I was younger, but now at my age I demand something more satisfying.Cities: Skylines delivers. With a modicum of patience, starting relatively small, I am actually capable of creating a city that functions.Granted I have a few issues, usually with traffic and land value. (My games I can’t usually afford to throw decent parks on every corner to make everyone happy). Regardless, my values tend to be over 70% in most cases and I call that a victory for my usual tenure in City-Sim games.That's not to say how much FUN I'm having with the game. There's just something so satisfying about seeing all those plots of zoning evolve into buildings, and in turn watching those buildings evolve on their own as they get better educated, higher land values, and more customers. I want to see them succeed because I want to see what they look like next!The workshop helps in this endeavor. One of my earlier complaints was that, after a few hours, building after building looked a bit same-y. The workshop introduces entire collections of buildings and downloading a few helps with variety and it's lovely to see.Using mods locks the ability to earn achievements. Practical, due to the infinite money mod available in the base game. However it's annoying in practice since I am treating this game like a sandbox and a toy, so I activate a few mods and then just let the fun fly.Thankfully the fun factor outweighs my need for achievements.Ultimately, it's one of the first Sim games I've been able to succeed at. It's taking me away from some of my other duties on MMO's and the like, and considering playing one MMO is like having a part time job in its own right, this is quite the accomplishment for a quaint 30$ game.

												Oh boy, this ♥♥♥♥ing game.Cities: Skylines is Sim City. No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.I never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥ups. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?Cities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.If you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.			"

												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Highs:* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Lows:* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.Verdict:If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												I've been a big fan of city simulation game since simcity 4 came out, and after dissapointing of recent city simulation games, Cities:Skyline become something that we fans are waiting for, a new benchmark and worthy successor of sim city 4.Cities skyline has massive map, great complexity and details for a city simulation game especially on traffic, i dont even know traffic management can be so frustating yet so challenging However, despite its addictive gameplay cities skyline still have something to improve, it lacks of disasters, day-night cycle and varieties of buildings.it seems so repetitive on building models.Fortunately, community of cities skyline so lively, i spent so many hours just browsing mods in steam workshop, choosing building models, gameplay mods and many more.Finally. Cities:Skyline has so much fun to offer.I think Cities:Skyline is the best city simulation game right now and im impressed when i knew that only 9 people worked on this game, yet it deliver such an astonishing experience, 9/10.

												Cities: Skylines is the best city-builder in recent times. There's no bullcrap always online, you can expand your borders quite far - and they all merge into one map so you don't have a loadingscreen while switching between them. There is also support for a modding community to add to the game.Building a stunning metropolis spanning a huge area is both easy - perhaps a bit too easy, but I expect patches and mods will add some more challenge - and a lot of fun!It's simply everything SimCity should have been, and more.Gameplay:

Best city building game out thereI can‘t really tell for how long i have waited for game like this. I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.As in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.People in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.Of course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.The traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much. The game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.Graphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.Developers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.If you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly.Pros:Lets you build big citiesLooks gorgeosBuilding themes lets you build a different looking city every timeMod supportCons:Lacks depth in managingDumb AI causing traffic problemsPerformance  "

												If you're reading this, I'm glad you take the time to read reviews before you buy a game. But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).So stop reading this review and buy the game.For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).

												I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.But that's the only real problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.			"

												I've always liked city builders and this is a god sent after the latest disapointment in certain other series.Graphically it's easy on the eyes but nothing mind blowing. Warm colors.Game is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.Big area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build. You can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.Dealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.There is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.Game runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.If you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.There are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.Doesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either.

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while. 7.5 /10 "

												For anyone looking for countless hours of fun, this is your game. Cities: Skylines provides countless hours of fun, but challenging, hours of game play. In cities: Skylines, you get to basically manage your own city. To sum it up, Cities: Skylines is the best city manager simulation I know. Here are some pros and cons of the game.PROS:-Beautiful Graphics-Good concept-Has amazing workshop Mods-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)-Easy to learn about-Provides a challenge (in some ways) -Great for players looking for something to do-The new Natural Disasters are amazing-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopterThese are just some of the pros this game providesCONSEvery game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great game. I've been playing this for a while now, and I believe I will continue to do. I look forward to the next update and recommend for players to buy this game.			"

												This is pretty much much improved/fixed version of the latest SimCity, with some pros and cons of its own:Pros:- Maps are much bigger. Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.- Pipes and power lines are back.- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).Cons:- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.- No landscaping tools.- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.- Weather and time of day do not change.- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the ""news ticker"" from SimCity.- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.So i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.			"

												It has a lot to love and some not so much to love.It is one of the best City Sims in years and it can be a blast to play and has lots of mods and no online needed.It also does not look to shabby given the size of the maps.I must admit though due to some issues at times it can just be boring and frustraiting to play and deal with as a full on SIM.The maps are decent size and if you have the pc a mod can make it even bigger.The mods are plenty and quiet a few of them are nice.Depite the poor choice for AI and driving it can still be managed without getting the dreaded wave of death by simply not expanding at a rapid pace and they will not die in waves.I do think they should have invested the resources into other things because frankly the biggest eye sore of the game is the fact that they all pile into one lane.They plan out there trip ahead of time and lack the smarts to change it on the fly.I would have prefered to have simulated traffic on roads that just showed generic traffic as highways are useless since they all tend to use one lane the whole trip.Though all of that i can forgive as no game can be perfect and have all the right things but one thing that should have been in since day one is seperate funding for each service instead you change it for everyone and also forces you to put down way more services then needed.Then forces you to spend twice as much as needed becuase of the lack of sliders to each service building.SimCity 4 had this and that was on single core and how many years ago?So that would have to be my biggest irk of the game the rest i can over look as its managable but i waste way to much money on this issue and still have issues with coverage.Do not get me wrong as pure building sim it is a lot of fun and can be great but as anything more it fails badly at it.The challange is weak, A.I is horrible.The DLC is over priced unless 50% off just not worth it.As i said before if they would have put more into other things then the worthless A.I. driving this game imo could have went from good to fantastic as a simulation.As it stands now trash services is well excuse my pun but it is trash.How you mange death is terrible because of how terrible the driving A.I. isThe management end of the game is not so great due to lack of much depth and the biggest issue other then the driving A.I. screws up trash and other services.The way money is handled and control of each service is terrible because you can not decide which building gets what funding and coverage it is all shared across all services on the whole map.SimCity 4 did way better on the simulation end then this game most likely ever will out of the box.As a city builder this game shines as a simulation its damn near a flatline.ProsNo online needed.Tons of mod support.Huge maps.Bicycle and Bus lanes,Trams with DLCConsPaying for Disasters that even Maxis included for freeTrams need over priced DLCTerrible services on all fronts due to terrible A.I traffic.Busted micromanagementServices budget changes across whole map instead of each buildingNo real challange and day and night seem to have little impact on the economy in fact school seems to run 24/7.In the end it still one the better city sims and i would say buy it if you love building stuff but sadly a pass if you like simulation of running a city SC4 does this a lot better.If only CO would have just took some cues from SC4 and how they did simulation of being a mayor this would be a must buy for all simulation fans regardless if you like to build or manage.

85/100 This new city sim has taken all of the good things from previous sims and builded upon it to create a solid and polished experience with new added features such as a nice water simulation including fluid physics. The sim is a bit on the easy side and for my taste it could have had more micromanagement to keep you busy and challenged, but what is there in the game is all very well done and it offers very enjoyable gameplay. On top of that the performance (unlike other sims) stays excellent even if you have a massive running city.			"

												Easy to learn, easy to master. If you though Sim City was disapointing, and wished it was better, this would be the game they would make. It has so much replay value, and thanks to user created content. It can extent the life of this game for ever. There will most likely be DLC's to come out with it.9/10eNjoy =^-^=			"

												Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games.  If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you'll probably feel at home here.  For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc.  You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow.  It's an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of ""one more turn"" on your lips.  As with most of these games, one of the things you'll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines.  The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways.  It's a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life.  Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.  Skylines also features an intersting ""neighborhood"" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one.  While I don't feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I'm not reviewing the expansion content, here)  Things I don't lke about the game?  Primarily, it feels too easy.  Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing.  This seems like it'd be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.  Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason.  The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.  The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor.  For example, faced with the situation I'd frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers.  Thinking that I'd simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I'd try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.  Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.  Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I'd feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system.  It's not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.  All in all, I'd heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life.			"

												Beautiful Game Cities skylines,it is the best city builder game now i think.I think ıf you look how many hours ı have  played this game you will understand this game is awesome. On Cities:Skylines you choose a map to build your city then you create your own city.You can build the city in your dreams.You can build a canals city,mountain city,European City,Mediterrenian City,Tropical City,Asian City,American City,Soviet City...And ı think the game is better with mods.for example with mods you can just allow construction of baroque buildings or classic American houses,Soviet houses... but you need to download that district styles.You can download thousands of mods but if you download too much mods you need to wait more at downloading screen.for example ı have near 900 mods and ı wait near 5 minutes at first then ı wait near 10-15 minutes when ı'm loading my city.And you can download lots of famous landmarks,buildings...you can download lots of useful buildings,props,shops,bars,train and metro stations,cars,city halls,statues,Mosques,Churcs,Synagouges,parks,roads,tree,hotels... My advices for new update,DLC or next Cities game:-It would be great if peoples will be satsified when there is lots of trees at their neigborhood.-It would be great if peoples need a place to pray to the God.like Mosques,Churcs,Synagougs.(You can download that buildings but they're like landmark.)-Bicycle roads would be great.

												An ice-cube factory was the first building to catch on fire.This game more than meets all the hopes you may have for a new, modernised city builder.The core game is simply fantastic and if you have even the slightest interest, buy it.Steamworks integration is already showing 7500+ cusomised assets such as buildings after only a week of release. I expect the longevity of this title to be infinite thanks to this. The potential is insurmountable.			"

												This won't be a long review. I will say this. If you like city building games and responsive studios, this is the game for you. There are freebees still being added to the game to this day. Little things that you would normally have to purchase in a DLC are given to us. Support from the studio is amazing. The gameplay is amazing. The ability to mod is amazing. The workshop content is amazing. If I had one complaint, it would lane management for traffic. This has been worked on though and is already better than it was just a couple months ago. With that being said, traffic stops being as much of an issue once you understand the mass transit options within the game.Buy the game. It is worth every penny.			"

												Incredibly fun, easy to learn and definitely one of those games you might be playing for years to come. Cities: Skylines is that one city-sim you were waiting for.The modding community is very active and offers a range of improvements, additions and changes to make your cities even better!Some of the pro's and con's:+ Looks very nice, both in high-up view and zoomed all the way down to the pedestrians.+ Public transport works pretty good and will adapt to your radical changes to roads.+ Decent depth without getting too precise; no nagging citizens unless they really need something.+ Gigantic maps to make your dream cities- Garbage can get a little annoying; get some mods to fix this.- Roads will become congested. Perfect planning will be inevitable or your city will come to a breaking halt.- Certain aspects like organically flowing roads will take a toll on your available lots; you have lots of room though so spread out!All in all it's the best city-sim I've played. Definitely worth the money!			"

												Absoultely wonderful game!  I have played over 850 hours.  This is what SimCity 5 should have been.  This game was obviously made by people who love city building and played previous city simulatons.  Everything works right.  Slow initial city loading time but from there all is smooth.   Many ways to play.  Lay out a design for a big city or small town are the fine as they are, or soon grown and eventually join.   Lots to learn to be more efficient.  Can be played casual or challenging. As with real cities traffic congestion and polution soon become a growing problem.  Lots of in game items that are solutions...  But it is very satifying to figure out your own unique designs and solutions.   A big active community of support is another good feature of this game.   I had all my friends by this game they all liked it or loved it as I do.   I highly recommend it.			"

												In my opinion, this picks up the torch from Simcity 4. It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again.			"

												City Skylines is a 4/5.It's to what most sim games should strive.I'd play it for days,watch my citizens play,if only I could keep them alive.The systems are efficent and clear,Though there may be nothing new here.Zoning and crime,I do it all the time,and it's not hard at first, either.But it gets more complex as the game progresses.And with it comes many stresses.Traffic, dead bodies, and trash,fires can happen in a flash,and then your citizen die by the masses.The infrastructure is often a bother.It's hard to manage the clutter.Need more power, my man?Go build a dam!But, oops, your city's underwater!But that's just how it goes,it'd be boring without all of those!Who wants a town building sim,without some margin,of error, or disaster imposed?So like I said at the beginning,this game is really worth getting.It can be hard at times,managing waste and the crime,but I love it for all its forthcomings.

												This game is what i always wanted in a city builder. From the times of the original Simcity i have been wanting to walk around in my creation. Simcopter made an attempt butit was to far ahead of its time and failed. And now comes allong Cities:Skyline. This game has so much detail you can follow a single person around. He will go to work,chill at a park, play on his tablet in his back yard or on his balconey. And then you zoom out to a City on the scale of mexico city or new york. its enough to get lost for hours at a time. In adition to the amazing vanillla features, the game has full mod support so you can add first person mod,new houses even add tiny props the size of a flower pot. The game itself is extremely robust. i have been downloading random mods giving no thought on compatibility so i can see how the game handles mods. i only started to get problems when i reached page 40 on my mod list. And that stability under mods is the best i have seen in any game. Take Arma 3 for instance. here is a game that was build with modding in mind and that game starts to get game breaking issues once the number of mods break the 20 mod number. This leaves the game open to create your perfect city.dont have a house you want. make it.Put that all together and you have without a doubt in my mind the best city builder game the world has ever seen.

												When writing this I have about 13h of playtime and the ""endgame"" is yet to be experienced, but so far I lack the words to describe the amount of joy this has given me. I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....But boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.It is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.The tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.I haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.I could write alot more about this but I don't have time... I want to get back to play it again!			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Colossal Order Ltd. Publishers: Paradox Interactive Initial release: March 2015Genre: Simulation, City Builder #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationCities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity. Skylines is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive. Initially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system. You'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency. The game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience. You can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment. Anecdotal experience warningThere are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all. Anyways, back on pointThe game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with. There is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services. If I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting.  In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game. It also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal.  Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic. THE GISTSuperb city builder that scratches the niche of well done and in-depth simulation that many games seem to miss.Follow my curation for more "

												EDIT: Released new ""Disasters"" DLCs on 11/30/16. I still recommend the game but there currently are a bunch of game-breaking bugs. So hold off purchasing the game for maybe a week or two.EDIT 2: 1/2/17 - Most of the recent game-breaking bugs have been squashed, I re-recommend C:S. Happy 2017!As of 7/12/16 and with 103 hours of playtime, I think I can make a solid review about this game. Long story short, I bought this because the new Sim City was trash, but I was not ready for this game to exceed my expectations.Now for a short review: (SKIP TOWARDS ""I'M TOO LAZY"" IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE FULL REVIEW) Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal city building game, perhaps even better than any of the Sim City games. It is a sandbox game that has an unlimited replay value and will devour hours of your days.  Its laid-back graphic style, realistic audio effects, and relaxing music provide a calm and entertaining game time.  The game unrestrically allows you to build at your own pace while providing a fun challenging experience.While the game is a little tough on beginners (it has very few basic tutorials) it still seems easy to get a hang of. With time, and the Steam community guides, you will become a master of this game and having done so without much frustration, a simple learning curve.Between all of the user created mods, bountiful amount of vanilla game content, and developers amazing DLC, you will undoubtedly enjoy every game session and you will never find the game repetitive.I, without any hesitation, fully recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone interested in purchasing this. Even if you are new to the city building genre, you will appreciate every cent you paid for this game because of what it has to offer.I'M TOO LAZYPros:- Limitless replayability- Abundant game content (including free mods and game DLC)- Steam workshop support- Challenging but funCons:- Larger cities can reduce framerates, even on beefy computers- Difficult for new players (lacks necessary tutorials)- OST unintersting (unlike Sim City 4) and the DLC radio music isn't very goodI'm sure I will have missed some things (both good and bad) worth mentioning so feel free to comment on this review or ask questions in the discussions. The Cities: Skylines community is welcoming and we all help each other.Also, if this review influenced you to buy the game, please comment. I would like to see how many people I helped.Sincerely,BOT Harvey			"

A City Builder / Management Strategy Game

+ Extremely addicting gameplay.  Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city. + Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn't need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or ""challenge levels / missions"". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.- The road system could be improved a bit. It's a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.Side Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City			"

												This is a great game.And this is a review in progress.---- 5 hours mark ----My main reasons for recommendation are:1. It's built upon existing knowledge from SimCity series: developer (Colossal Order) takes account of both success and failure of SimCity.2. One can see what future improvement to this game entails: good modding support gives developer better insight into what players want.3. A new era for city-building game. Cities Skylines isn't perfect (eg. rough UI, lack of goals, confusing public transport, rudimentary map editor, missing your favorite type of roads, etc etc), but it shows us what's achievable, with SimCity series back on hiatus, Cities Skylines is the new standard.The future for Cities Skylines is bright, will add more comments as I play.

												This is pretty much all I wanted in a city sim since I put down Sim City 4.I'm a bit of a dinosaur in that I still prefer the isometric pixel art of yore, and Cities: Skylines has a more ""clean/cartoon"" art style than I'd like. But apart from that, it pretty much gets everything right. The UI is easy, functional, and still manages to be deep. Systems seem both complex and accessible.I've enjoyed it for hours out of the box, I'm looking forward to player mods, and the future expansions and add-ons. I think this one's a long-term keeper!

												The good: - Ridiculously large amount of workshop content, adding more things to build, ways to customize and other things- Great building mechanics- Simple to use yet very useful UI- Enormous world size - several times that of any other games- Huge amount of things to customize and ways to customize them- Regular updates and plenty of support- Great amount of ways to affect the city without building, eg. managing economy (it's essential and mildly complex but easy to work with when you get used to it)- Good graphics (or, better than most games of the same type)Negatives:- If you build a big city, you're going to have difficulty with FPS as the traffic and people will butcher your PC (however powerful!) That said, as long as you don't zoom too far into the rodas, you can maintain a steady FPS with most mid-range PC's.Absolutely recommend this game as the best City Builder ever made.			"

												This game is what I wanted. This game is what I needed. This game is what SimCity should have been, it is a perfect sequel to SimCity; it's what all of us weirdos that love citybuilders have been begging for. This game is like cocaine, it is a drug to me now...I can't stop playing this game.This game takes city builders, then somehow manages to add a whole layer of depth beyond what I thought was possible. The extra policies, districts, industrial zone types, and various other features come together so perfectly, I honestly am in constant shock how everything ebbs and flows so well in an orchestra of harmony. This game is completely bug free (so far), has the production value of a AAA studio, beautiful music, pretty graphics, mod support, extremely well optimized, and water physics (for awesome some reason).I have not played a game I thoroughly enjoyed in probably 2 years; until this game came along. I am so happy I finally have a game I can enjoy once again. Thank you Paradox, thank you.Seriously, if you love citybuilders or strategy games, GET THIS. "

												So I say to myself, why write a review, when I can fake quotes from other people?""Game is credit to team!"" ~ TF2 Heavy""This is our land!"" ~ CS:GO T""I did not have relations with that dev"" ~ Clinton... yeah, maybe not.By now you've probably seen other reviews saying that Cities: Skylines beats the pants of the comparitive SimCity and the Cities XL / XXL. So I won't rehash that.What I like about Cities: Skylines It's relaxed There are a huge number of community content additions to the game Roads, zoning, sevices etc are all easy to apply (there is a learning curve) Since I've owned the game, there have still been official updates & content additions June 2016 saw a small free DLC pack Expansion of territory is simple Apart from the stock unlimited money mod, you can get a first person one too, allowing you to wander about You can rename anything. Everything has default names, but you can rename people, dogs, areas, housing etcWhat I don't like about Cities: SkylinesI have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can't really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that's part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There's really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that's the only thing.One thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.Gameplay Note: You may be tempted to build all up on your high way access. Don't. You will rue the day you did that. Think space. You don't need to cram things in.			"

(building, road with traffic light, car, and manny more)-we can build a big city (with help from mod)-the gameplay is really simple, and without bug (i never have a problem with bug until now without additional mod)-we can adds mods, or texture and etc, from workshop for your city. (so manny we can choose it and its make more fun)dislike :-the gameplay is simple, because that we really need a mods to make more fun-some a mod, is not conformable with other mod (its not worked)-no night time in the game (its so sad to know this, i wish the development to update night time)until now, its so fun to play this game. i recommended to you buy, its really worth, just 17$			"

												I absolutely LOVE this game.  I'm an old SimCity player who killed hundreds of hours back in the day playing SC before it was ruined by EA.  Cities: Skylines is the game I've been waiting for for a decade!  It's been a joy learning to play it, developing my city building strategies, and building MY city.The icing on the cake for me, is when I'm waiting for my budget to generate enough money to implement my next improvement or build, I can pick out a citizen, and follow them around.  Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc.  Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.I bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.  I won't be surprised if this ends up as GOTY...no doubt it will be a nominee.  I haven't been this excited about a simulation in a LONG time!			"

Steam workshop is brimming with interesting additions to your city. You, yourself, can alter the appearance of any building to your tastes. You can truly build anything to match your imagination.My only gripe is the fact my save files and ultimately my mega city errored and I lost that.

												Traffic Simulator 2015. OCD Simulator 2015. Ambulance Simulator 2015. Trash Piling Up Simulator 2015. Loan Simulator 2015. Still a better love story than SimCity.No, but really. This game IS GREAT, I however suck at it which should in no means deter anyone from buying it. My roads suck, I can't make an circular roundabout ramp to save my life, I named one of my districts ""Trash Town"" because all they ever do is complain about how their trash is piling up even though I BUILT 5 ♥♥♥♥IN INCINERATORS NEXT TO THEM.  But, I still have a ton of fun ♥♥♥♥ing up my city. I never will second guess my decision to not become a city planner. Whether you are an OCD architect king or your town turns into a traffic filled, trash overflowing mess like my town, it's guaranteed that this game will keep you endless entertained and inspired to make your town not suck as much♥♥♥♥♥little by little for endless amounts of time.I am soooo thankful for day 1 workshop in this game, people have already generated game changings mods, worlds, buildings, and most of all pre made intersections (thank you cities skylines baby jesus)Everyone keeps asking ""IS IT BETTER THAN SIMS CITY?!"" and YES. IT IS. I played the newest version of SimCity a day before release to kind of compare it to before I played this one.. The controls are so much more difficult to learn and understand, it feels clunkier and messier and in general like you have less to do and less control of the game. I am so impressed with the simplicity, beauty, and user friendly format that cities skylines has to offer.It has already showed to be immensely popular to both play and watch others build masterpieces or piles of dirt on twitch. Something about this game is just so freakin' good.For a $30 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in building or simulation games. You will love this game!! 10/10 :)			"

												When I was a child, I had a dog growing up. She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her. Near the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to♥♥♥♥♥♥and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best. Later we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog. Why did I ramble on about dogs? The Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end. Cities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog. If you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better.  "

												This is what i would call the ""cream-of-the-crop"" city simulation building game. Coming from the SimCity series, i must say i was truly impressed by the openess of this game. The mods. The supports. The game itself. My tears has been wiped dry. For SGD55 it has given me countless hours in trying to replicate a seamless city. 378 hours and still counting. Truly amazing. With that said, the king ""SimCity"" has ben dethroned. This is the new king! The new benchmark in city simulation. The new yardstick!!! Ps - I've read some negative reviews about this game. No doubt there are some bugs and issues that need sorted out by the devs. No game is perfect. Give it time and it will be the best city builder game by far. Another major complain was that this game focus is more towards modding. As a city builder game you want variety of buildings, roadways, vehicle and etc. And that is where the modding community shines. It adds flavour to the game. I'm sure you will get bored of the plain 'ol vanilla building made by the devs sooner or later. And when i scrolled through the bad reviews something caught my attention. I'd say 80% of them have raked up on average of 30 hours on the game. That's just not fair. Each to their own then.			"

												Only one word:  AWESOME I own the game for 1.5 years now and I'm still not tired of it. There are  TONS and TONS  of mods and assets you can download on the workshop.  If the game is on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game,  buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)  If the game isn't on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game, buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)   or wait for a sale :D  I'do only think there needs to be a transportation DLC which needs to include: cargo planes with big terminals etc., ferries, more in depth transportation options, more vehicles, more roads, etc.then it will be even more awesme! :-)  EDIT:  mass transit is coming!

												Well this game is a strange one. To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues: Traffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them. Pollution: It has only a range of one or two blocks around your industrial areas. You only may not build residentals in this area. If you do so you'll never have any problems with pollution in your city. Energy: You can build several different powerplants. Which ones you'll choose is almost completely irrelevant and just a matter of MW per $. For example: There aren't any calms, so it isn't risky powering your city with only wind energy. Coal energy generates much pollution, but then again pollution only has a range of one or two blocks. . . . . . City-Services (Crime/ Fire/ Health/ Education/ Deathcare/ Leisure/ Garbage): Just build one of these buildings here and there and your growables will be all happy. There's almost no need for a clever placement of those buildings. Growables: Achieving the highest levels for all of your growables is easy, because the level mainly depends on the amount of city services, which are in the neighborhood of this building.  Tourism: It is still completely broken. You cannot focus on tourism, because there are never enough tourists visiting your city. Resource chain and industrial production: They are also very simple. Basic resources (oil, food, ore) are transformed into general goods which are transported to your commercials and then bought by your citizens. You cannot specialize into anything, like car industry or hightech industry, here.Zoning: You almost don't need any strategy for placing your zones well or choosing a good ratio. Just avoid building too much industrials because of the traffic jams and your city probably will be fine. There's almost no variety like ways of specialization here. So appending new blocks to your city becomes pretty boring after a while. Income: You will never know how well your city works, since this game automatically tries to adjust the tax income of your growables, so that your total net income is somewhere between 10 000 $ or 20 000 $. This adjustment only fails if your expenses are much too high. Disasters: Not really available in this game. There are just fires. They don't even spread and only destroy a single building if the fire fighters don't arrive fast enough.I could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better.			"

My Opinion of Cities: SkylinesCities: Skylines is simply an amazing city building game. I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.    Pros- Very good graphics.- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic. - The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city. - Well optimized. - Frequent updates and patches. - Water physics. Cons- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make. - Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.  My Verdict: 7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)			"

												Cities: Skylines.... Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.You start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it. The only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day. Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.			"

Posted: March 10, 2015
												[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.Review with screenshots: http://fg-2.com/2015/03/10/review-cities-skylines/ "

It's a bit rough around a few courners, but basically a fully functional game with a lot of fun. Collossal Order stated that they're going to support the game like Paradox does with Crusader Kings II.

												Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...Thing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.I could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.Unfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.Ok - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.These are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.So here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.I really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job.

												I was always interested in city building games, even if only on the level of mapping the streets and zoning.After the infamous flop of SimCity 2013, Cities Skylines just appeared out of the blue to take over most of the internet, as one of the most comprehensive and high quality modern city simulators around.Thanks to the After Dark update, the game looks positively gorgeous. Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn't designed to be viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it's magical.The music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city's faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.Gameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.The degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual ""cims"" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player's biggest threat - if you don't plan way, way ahead what you're doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.The modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.It is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.I really like this game. You ought to play it.			"

												First of all, I had very high expectations, and that's never a good thing. Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.Now I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.PROs:- Road-engineering is really next-gen!- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly- The different map layers look good, and are useful - The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)- Mod and custom asset support!CONs:- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing. But overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!			"

												Even though this is a negative review, it comes with a caveat. I want challenge and simulation out of a strategy or management game, and Cities: Skylines does not provide that. If you like just building a nice city then you'll love Cities: SkylinesSort of like Planet Coaster, Cities is basically just a map painter. You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations. You'll never run out of money and never run up against a fail state that you either didn't bring upon yourself on purpose or that you didn't see coming a mile away.I'm really disappointed in this title. Lots of people love it so I'm assuming that I made a mistake in not reading into the game enough before purchasing it. However, I just want to warn anyone who is looking for a good challenge to stay away.			"

												Just buy it (on sale if you're not sure)... So much talent and passion behind this game.  The technical complexity of the simulation is amazing, the pricing is perfectly on point.  Checkout the workshop and have your mind blown.The DLC in my opinion is a way for the developers to reward themselves further of the blood, sweat, and tears they pour into this game.  People often forget that when a DLC comes out, the base game receives free huge content updates and back-end fixes, extended mod support, etc.   The DLC often go on sale as well just like the base game.  You may have paid $60 for SimCity 5 for a water-downed simulation/pretty game.. So far I've spent ~$30 total with all DLCs and this game has added more enjoyment than all city sims before it combined..  I've been playing since Simcity Classic and SimCity 2000!  ♥♥♥♥ I'm getting old.			"

I really hate that, and it really bugs me, but the game is worth it:0  Well I do hate 1 more thing about this....

												I'm not a guy who uses mods in games, preferring the raw, unchanged experience. And although mods seem to be very supported and loved by the community, I can say that this game is not only fun but also very addictive and entertaining, even without any mod. I happily built my first two cities and looking forward for the third and fourth. Maybe I'll take a look into the mods afterwards as well, but really - you can play this game without those.Definately recommended game, this is what Sim City should have been.			"

												If you are looking for a city builder with terrible graphics, unrealistic simulation and mediocre gameplay, you're looking at the wrong place. Cities: Skylines is the ultimate city builder! New roads, buildings, utilities and transportation systems. Check your traffic congestion and pollution. Build oil wells and mining facilities. Amazing graphics. A game that is finally better than SimCity 4. :DThe DLC isn't a must buy, but you will be missing out on the night cycle and the changing of seasons :P. Just click that add to cart button XD.			"

												I never played a city builder game before as they all seemed too intimidating. I checked the Cities workshop Friday evening, saw the amount of content in it and purchased because of that alone. 8 game hours later I can tell you that I now both love city building games and this game in particular. Buy it now, buy it on sale later, gift a copy to a friend, just play it, even if you're not much of a fan of the genre!			"

After 10 hoursThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.tl;dr - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.The Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.tl;dr - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.The only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.All in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!PS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.After 24 hoursStill going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.I still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.The engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.Still very much Recommended.			"

 Over 300 hours enough said ALL PROBLEMS I LIST ARE FIXED BY MODS  Nighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little ""big"" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash.   ALL PROBLEMS i LISTED ARE FIXED BY MODS, STILL BETTER THAN SIMCITY5 !!! "

												Setup a ""Recreational Use"" drug policy on my residential district. Best. Game. Ever.In all seriousness though, this game is a great city builder. Better than Sim City 2013 and much better than the last two Cities XL games. There is mod support right away, you can expand your city to be much much larger, the gameplay is fun, it handles well, runs well and its a blast to play. Sure the art design could be better (seems like a cheap sc 2013 style art design), sure I miss the night and day cycle from SC and there are some bugs with drivers ai and some other stuff but overall those pale compared to all the things this game does right. Want to create a big gigantic city? You have come to the right game!Get your hands on this wonderfully crafted game and you won't be dissapointed. There is alot of options for customization, I can see hundreds of hours being spent on this game down the road, well done devs! Two big thumbs up from me, as this is the most fun I have had building stuff in a videogame since Simcity 4 and the last Anno game. This is a wonderful base game as is and for the future, I can see mods and expansion packs adding more and more down the road to.			"

												This is the city builder people wanted back in 2013. Not to be confused with the Cities XL series, this game is done by the same people who did Cities In Motion. I finally have a good city builder to play other than SimCity 4.- In depth traffic simulation/planning. You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.If you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it. For only $30 at release, it is an excellent price for a game that will keep you entertained for a long, long time. "

There are not the proper words to express how much this game blows the most recent iteration of SimCity out of the water. I know I'll easy log 500+ hours on this game over the next year - and for $30! I would've felt it well-purchased at $50.The road building tools actually function, the pathfinding isn't stupid, the city size is larger than I've needed so far, and the tools to micro-manage exist without requiring use.Value, fun, and only the beginning.

												My first week I was very into Cities:Skylines. But then I quickly realized this game is not a city sim or even city builder/designer game. No, its pure traffic sim. You will lose yourself for hours trying to fix the idiotic AI that is Cities:Skylines traffic. Drivers will only drive in the center lane near an exit ramp. This creates chaos. They will come to a dead stop with two other clear lanes but no one will drive in the other lanes. I'm convinced this is not by design, but a bug due to poor AI. Why have six lanes or a three lane highway if the sims are not going to utilize the lanes during heavy traffic. Also, a town of 50,000 is not going to have enough population or demand to clog up a 3 lane one way highway(total of six lanes), let alone the 2 connecting highways on my map, and then a third highway I built.To add to this chaos, garbage collectors, cops, firemen, hearst drivers, etc, do not stay in their own area. They will abandon their area and go clog your highways while your citizens near the service home suffer. There is no AI to make them only stay in their area. Even if you have every area covered they will still go across your map.The only challenge to this game is making an entire city with no traffic stops - nothing else is a challenge. Even with well executed roundabouts you're still going to have extreme highway challenges that all orginate from 1) too much traffic being spawned despite a low population, 2) poor AI because sims do not utilize highways correctly. At first, I found it fun to try and beat the traffic, until I realize I've spent hours on it, and have noticed the sims erratic, pointless driving. Its just poor AI. I'm sure there are other traffic sims that have proper AI, not that I even wanted a traffic sim, I was hoping for a city builder/designer. So, unless you want a frustrating traffic sim game, with a bity of city builder thrown in I would say only get this if its on sale. And do not bother with the overpriced DLC. If they fix the traffic AI, then it'd be a fun little game.Also, another unrealistic aspect is you can follow a car, and in good traffic it will take this car days to reach its destination. In bad traffic it will take weeks... C'mon. Regardless, just a poor traffic sim game.			"

												Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.With such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.Let’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.Making a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)Mass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.What Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.In that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.It’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.			"

												What can I say?1500+ hours so far, first 300 or so inside the Asset Editor, pretty much the rest writing mods. I probably played about 50 to 100 hours of the actualy game..This is a city-builder fan's dream come true. Enourmous modding possibilities straight out of the box. An immersive simulation. Large map area to build on. Freedom in the creation of roads and other networks, districts, policies, in short:Everything I've been waiting for over a decade. The few flaws this game has will probably be have been modded out of it in due time, or fixed by the developers themselves.If all this isn't worth 30 bucks, then I don't know what is.An absolute must-have.Update: If you grab this during sale, you can get the game + all dlc for the price of just the base game with no sale. Definitely worth your money as you'll get endless hours of fun and creativity out of it.			"

In my opinion this is the best city-building game by now and it totally worth bying. The game is so easy in mastering, that you don't even need any kind of hints or tutorials when you start playing it (even if you didn't play city-builders before). You just pushing ""new game"" and play, interface is so handy it's like you already know where and which tool is placed. Cites: Skylines is extremely absorbing so make sure that you can allow yourself to spend huge amount time on things like videogames. Trust me, you won't even notice how your precious hours will be gone without a trace. However, the game is not perfect, there are pretty much of flaws left by developers (poor traffic AI for example). The good thing that almost all of them can be easily cured with help of mods from Steam Workshop. So if you install mods from following list, the game will be definitely a piece of cake for you :з Recommended mods Automatic BulldozeAutoSave - ConfigurableAll 25 Areas purchasableMod Achievement EnablerPrecision EngineeringTraffic Manager + Improved AIP.S.After Dark is nice, but not really essential. The game is pretty complete already. "

												Excellent city building game. Very addictive, reasonably priced and has mod support. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff people come up with.There isn't much in terms of a tutorials, but the user interface is pretty easy to get to grips with.  It's the sort of game where you learn from your mistakes. I must have started about 5 or so cities before I figured out how to even get the ball rolling, but once you do, it's incredibly compelling.I am on my first city at the moment, and although it is proving profitable, the way I laid out the roads is pretty random and has been causing traffic problems.Also, I started drawing in a totally random bus route, adding stops all over the place and now it is telling me that I haven't completed the loop for my insane bus route and I can't figure out how to complete it for the life of me...or erase it. hahaIt seems pretty bug free, and it is very well optimised. Been playing it on my GT650m laptop and it is running great at 1080p on high settings. It's a very entertaining time sink. You can easily lose hours just evolving and maintaining your city.			"

   Overview    Cities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.The overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.Aside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.Where the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.Now, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass. Once you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to ""lose"", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.I feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers.   Pros    Modding Community - The modding community brings out this game's full potential. Building Space - The maps are huge, opening up a lot more options and the ability to have widespread districts and cities.The visuals - The game is colorful and detailed enough to give your city a diverse, pretty landscape.Renaming - You can remain everything - from businesses, homes, vehicles and even livestock.What It's Not - The game is not Sim City 5.   Cons    Management Systems - The game lacks any in depth management aside from taxes, budgets and ordinances.Difficulty - The game can feel too easy once you get the feel of the mechanics. Increasing the difficulty helps to mitigate some of that, but in the long run it can still feel that way.Natural Disasters - As of this review, there still are none. I hope this changes in the future.Resources - The game can be a little resource heavy and if you're like me and like assets (currently have 400+ new ones), the game can take some time between load screens, even on higher end computers. Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it.			"

												Cities Skylines is not so much of a game as it's a sandbox in which you can build a city.Granted, there is a lot you can build, and the city is very soon very beautiful. The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks. The graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city. And for me, that doesn't cut it.			"

												If you want a city builder that you can chill to, this is it. Complicated mechanics packed neatly in a easy-to-use interface. You can play this at your own pace without stress while bobbing your head with the incredible ost. Spent above 50 hours playing a bootleg version before I bought this on sale but this is definitely worth its full price. You are free to d**k around without long term consequences and the workshop contents are top notch. Pros- *Relaxation simulator*Amazing soundtrack*Gorgeous graphics *Workshop contents are 10/10*Simple mechanics that puts more emphasis on planning than active management*Extreme level of control over your city's economyCons-*You can lose track of time "

TLDR: If you enjoy city builders this is THE GAME to get, it's literally better than the legendary SimCity 4.Cities Skylines offers tons of different choices such as all kinds of road sizes, buildings and services. If you decide to replay the game i recommend downloading some mods as there are tons of great mods for Cities Skylines for even more customization!The only problem i have with Cities Skylines is that it is very easy to gain money and money is really NEVER a concern, a harder difficulty would be a nice addition.As for performance - the game runs a lot smoother than older games from the series, but it's certainly not buttery smooth always, it is a very CPU bound game, an I7 is recommended for the best experience.Final verdict - 9/10			"

												TLDR:The games as a whole feels unfinished, lacks proper tools and objects. Without mods its quite boring, and you fell like you don't have much to see here after 2 hours. Devs are lazy and greedy, releasing DLCs that costs a lot of money but don't change much, and they are basically relying on modders work. Every new DLC makes mods ""out of date"", and no longer usable.This is ridiculous - making life harder for people who actually make your product worth using.Don't get me wrong though - this is a very good game, but unmodified CS is far from perfect.Full story:Pros:+ great graphics;+ quite well optimised;+ unlimited replayability;+ making basic roads is fairly comfortable;+- water physics (acts weird sometimes, but overall works fine).Cons:- without mods allowing prop placement (such as More Beautification) your cities feel lifeless, and spaces between homes / businesses are empty, making them look ugly;- if you want your roads to look realistic, its nearly impossible to build them without such tools as Move it!, Precision Engineering and Road Anarchy;- without mod like IPT, controlling public transport is very basic, and thus not fun at all;- limited graphics configuration options;I keep saying mods, mods, mods... but just think about it - some VERY BASIC things in the game has to be improved by modders, just to operate ""smoothly"". For example, why don't we have an option in game menu to:1. Disable Chirper;2. To disable clouds / fog (especially important for lower end PCs);3. Building demoliton mechanic feels like its designed for tablet / smartphone game. Why do I have to demolish every burned or bankrupt building? They could just implement tickbox ""automatic demoliton"" in base game, if you like to move around your vast city and click like maniac, its your call;4. Placing props while playing, like in ingame object editor;5. Disable ugly pollution texture;I may sound rude, but in my personal opinion, modders make better job at keeping this game fun to play than devs. The game itself seems to be just a frame, designed to be improved by community with no effort of the company that made it.

 Before you read everything: If you want a good looking, easy city building sandbox, don't mind my rating and just go ahead and buy the game.It is definitely not a totally bugged or bad game or total rip-off :)And for some time I had definitely fun with it and still might in the future.Otherwise continue reading:FYI:I played loads of hours Sim City, mostly SimCity 4 + rush hour, which I really liked.Also I did not like the newest Sim City, for its small building zones, not-really-simulation and - most important - for EA, a company I learned to hate => In case of SC, for their false online only claims because of ""CPU heavy simulation only achievable in the cloud and not possible for home PCs"" blah blah. Yeah, you saw that very intensive simulation in spreading work force and trash trucks, haha. (besides it was obviously possible to play off line from the beginning) UPDATE [24/05/15] Some minor stuff has been fixed. And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.When rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a ""build the prettiest city sandbox"". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.And even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting. This game is sort of a hate-love-relationship. When I started playing it I really love the game:- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves- relatively good balanced progress- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time- building/maintenance costs are fine- tax management simple but still ok- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)- street system is doing good- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )Then I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.This is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.But - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.In general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city,  with a tax rate of 12% for everything after setting it to 14 for a short time, then going down to 12   I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.Up until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on ""how to make it look nice"" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.Besides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.These are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot! Overall:- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.As said before:If you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.If you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)			"

												I feel very rude and it frustrates me to write this, but I do not recommend Cities: Skylines unless it is at a good sale price. I love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.The first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I'd be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. There are no ""scenarios"" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You're just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that's all you want, this game will be perfect.My major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city's population adds up and you unlock more features, there's not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you'll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.... and to follow that up, you may say ""there are mods, though!"" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game ""Content Manager"" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.If you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don't mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but ""more, more and more"". This is a sandbox game for you, no question. I understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself.			"

												I like this game, but I don't LOVE this game.  Why?  The traffic A.I. is miserable.  Emergency Vehicles follow the flow of traffic.  They do not run red lights.  And all traffic in general takes the closest, not fastest route.  The Dev's have said it would take too much work.  Really?I will not be buying the DLC for this until traffic is fixed.  I probably won't play until then either.  This could be never though.  The dev's would rather sell DLC than fix bugs or try for a better base game experience.I really wanted to love this game...			"

												Overall, the game is pretty solid. The simulation, the tools and the gameplay is all just so fluid. Everything runs extremely well and cities feel legitimate and alive.The game does have some flaws here and there, yet it's still a very simple and straight to the point city builder with no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥attached. (DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out. With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.Graphics: 8.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10Interface: 8.75Traffic/Simulation: 9.25/10Mod Support: 9.5/10Overall, I give this game a 9/10.

												If you in need of a real city builder - this games has it all! It looks nice, can handle lower end PCs and is capable of scaling right up to your UBER rig ;) The gameplay is rock solid, diverse, highly mod friendly (The workshop is fully of♥♥♥♥♥kicking custom assets and welcome additions like the resolution upscaler) and still manages not to overwhelm newcomers. Forget games with XXL in their title cuz Cities: Skyline really delivers! Period. No, srysly ... there is no other city builder besides Skylines. This is the SimCity we all wanted a couple years ago, for just a fraction of its price. And by the way, their small DLC offers are completely fair - add meaningful content and are completely optional. Like the trams they added in Snowfall - its cool, nice to have - but totally not required for even the largest city. So far I had a ton of fun  ;)			"

												The beauty of Cities: Skylines is its accessibility.  (Video Review Below)From playing to modding. Everything can be played with, tweaked, altered or changed. Noobies or veterans alike will find something to enjoy in this City building, strategy game. While the tutorial does an okay job of explaining things. It does have a little bit of a learning curve. With a focus on proper placement. Once you get the basics of the game down though, the world opens up to you. Every aspect to city management is there for you to tinker with. Transportation, sanitation, taxes, policies, districts and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Developer Colossal Order and Publisher Paradox Interactive lets there experience shine in this extremely well done game. With insane amounts of mod support, steamy goodness and virtually no bugs. This is the city building game people have been waiting for.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

This is by far the best Simulator regarding relativityAs soon as you launch the Cities.exe your GPU starts to render supermassive frames that influence time and space on a gravitational level. The effect you will experience is called Time Dilation. Some are reporting that they lost more than 10 hours at once, after using the Simulation for just a very short time. Leading scientists are trying to calculate the exact amount of time you are going to loose by executing this Simulation - The public is still waiting for the results.Stay Tuned			"

												Did you play SimCity and you were disappointed by how fast the gameplay seemed to stall out? Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never ""finished"" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop. I will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it's current state.  The DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all. Some mods are almost mandatory. I don't consider this a big issue, but I know nothing about the performance implications of mods on low end machines. The game is totally playable without mods, I actually had every steam achievement available before DLC, so I have enjoyed quite some hours with no mods. It is just that when you first start modding, it's really hard to go back(this is why I don't have any of the DLC achievements, lol). Some costs seem very unbalanced. In the ""standard game"" I often found myself splitting my budget 50/50. Between garbage plus death services, and everything else... Why is as expensive to burn your garbage as it is to upkeep all your hospitals, fire stations, and police stations combined? These things are really easy to mod on your own though, so again, it's not a game breaking issue. If you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it's probably your best buy you ever made.			"

												Everthing about this city builder functions perfectly as you'd expect and more. For instance, one thing speaks to how much thought has and may continue to be put into this game: the ability to close off a body of water with a dam, build pumps in it, and drain it. A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.Sure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics.

												This game is awesome. This game is like the latest Simcity, except Paradox thoroughly looked through it and turned bad things into good things. Such as; your city isn't limited as it is in Simcity. In Cities: Skylines your town can be f*cking enormous. Another thing about this game that Paradox did better than Maxis and EA is that you don't need 11,000 watertowers. You can just increase the budget on the water and sewage department. If it still isn't enough, you should maybe buy one or two more waterpumps. Still, this game is awesome. Definitely Game of the Year for me. This is basically everything Simcity  isn't .			"

												I've been waiting to play this game ever since it was announced last year, and because I decided to skip EA's latest SImCity game, I've had tons of hype for this game. Needless to say, this game has very much exceeded my expectations, and I've haven't had so much fun since playing SimCity 4 (with Cheat Engine because I suck at it and I'm impatient) and SimCity 3000.Basically, this game is what SimCity (2013) should have been: larger maps, mod support, single player mode at launch, and most of all, not having the need to play with an always-on internet connection.Would I recommend that you buy this game? Well, it would probably be likely that I'll be playing just this game for the next few months or so, so it's a big fat yes.			"

												The best darn city builder, dare I say... ever? Yes indeed! I pre-ordered this game and it had to be one of the best if not the best pre-order I have ever made. From 11amCST to 2am on release day I played this game like crazy! And the best part I am not even close to finishing with my first city, there is so much content and things to do its crazy that is even a city builder! You like building, you will love this game, shoot if you love managing or sim games you will love this one. This game does everything other games of the genere haven't, a million times better than Sim City of 2013. The traffic  simulation is top notch, there are so many choices for roads, like the ability to build your own highways! There is a load of unique buildings, many transportation options, and so much more. Anything you want in a city builder this game has it! However, it is also a challenge, you wont have incredible city very quickly. A lot of issues can hit you hard while your population expands, my only complaint is that you need many, many, many, service buildings to cover a very large city, To much in my mind, I hope they tweak that because it can really drain your income. Again, though this game is fun, creative, innovative, challenging, and above all a great city builder. You will not regret picking this one up, atm it is the 2015 Game of the Year!			"

Recommended: While there's a few rough edges in the design, I can safely say Cities: Skylines is probably my favourite modern city-builder since SimCity 4, and that's been a long while indeed.  It looks great, runs well, and does a great job in offering a variety of transit and building options.  The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city.  Nonetheless a new paragon in it's genre; Skylines is the new benchmark, the one to beat when it comes to city-building.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Spent hours in this game! There is so much you can do.Pro and con: I feel the game is mostly about traffic and managing which I like, some may not.Con: fps drops significantly at high populations. But what bothers me more is these weird long pauses that all vehicles (trains, cars, taxis, trams, metros) take after they initiate an action. I guess simulations of >100k vehicles really slows the game down even though fps is at 30.			"

												I thought I really liked this game when it was released. I poured countless hours into it and created huge sprawling cities, one after the other. But when I started to dig deeper into the gameplay and strategic elements of this game such as managing the cities economy and taxes, I've come to find that the game falls flat in many aspects. The overall look and feel of the cities you create come to feel quite lifeless with nothing much in the design giving much excitement. Landmarks are very limited unless you go through the modding community, end game structures are completely broken, such as practically leveling up every building to maximum across the whole city with one building, plus unrealistic in their function. The maps themselves are very uninteresting, and flat. I would have hoped that the expanstions would have brought more to the game but the night expansion was a complete waste of money and gave me maybe a couple hours of interest. And an expansion to add permanent snow? No thanks. I also can't understand the idea that poorer people are happy to pay more taxes and wealthy people are capped at paying someting like 11-12% and even if you improve their area, it's not ever possible to raise the taxes without them abandoning. The district system seems interesting at first but despite it looking to deep, I've never really found any interesting ways of implementing them other than 'oh industrial area so I guess I'll add the fire alarms ordinance here' etc... its all very obvious and repetitive. I really want to like this game, and I like Paradox games in general, but I just can't agree with the amound of praise this game is getting. Even the zoning design is terrible as patches of grass appear everywhere making the city look incomplete. Having lived in a city my whole life I know what a city should look like and Paradox are not quite hitting the mark I'm afraid. Also the farms are terrible too, since when are farms zoned in small blocks? They just don't look realistic at all. The one thing this game does well and that is the traffic system. Controlling the flow of traffic on this game is quite beautifully done and that is what the game is, it's basically one big traffic sandbox. I do hope to find a new found interest in this game some day, but unfortunately I think that its lifespan may well have turned out to be even worst than SimCity :s			"

												Actually the game is perfect. Graphics, gameplay, idea, building meachanism etc. are great.But there is one gamebraker:Traffic.Want to spend hours building a nice city?Better prepare for hundred of hours testing how to build a proper traffic-town.Simple mechanics for traffic as used in real life are missing.Also the AI is very very limited on the road.Means: Building a 6-lane-road with 3 turn-lanes-right and still ALL cars will only use ONE Turn-Lane which causes huge traffic problems while a lot of lanes are empty...

												Amazingly good city simulation game. Recommended to anyone with even a light interest in the Genre. For the advanced players of City Sim games it offers many options for late game that can make or break your city. Plus it has a new Add-on featuring an active day night cycle. Will prove to be a good add-on I am sure.			"

												9.5/10-------The last city building game I have played is the SimCity 4: Rush Hours, which I like terribly. However, finally made a decision to get something new for the nicer graphics, somehow different gameplay, modding opportunities and fun. I don't have to say that Cities: Skylines have it all, and moreover it is a pleasure to play this game. There are some graphics and mechanics glitches, but I believe they'll be all fixed (e.g. despite the fact that I dezoned some land, the factories kept building there...). Even the modding tool is so easy to use and accessible that I actually started playing by creating my own park :) This game is highly recommended for all the city builders fans, and will definitely get even better!!!----What I miss in the game:- day/night cycle- seasons- if not seasons, at least winter theme! :)			"

												Cities: Skylines, is perhaps the ultimate city building game, a must have for Steam, and should absolutely be the first city builder someone plays. First off, let me dispell some worries you may have, I know I had some. This game has MASSIVE maps, you unlock them piece by piece as your city grows, HOWEVER, you will only be able to have a total of 9 tiles, so plan out your city according to that. (9 Tiles is still huge, dont get the wrong idea)Skylines is also a VERY easy game to get into. My chief concern about this game was that it would be more learning HOW TO play, instead of actually playing, and wheres the fun in that? Fortunately, Skylines is easy to understand and master. *The biggest reason why you should buy Skylines is mod support. These range from buildings, cars, and all sorts of things. What makes this feature even better is that some buildings created in workshop have requirements that need to be met before they can be constructed (These requirements are chosen by the person who made it in workshop), which can potentially add more to the game. TL;DR: If youre looking for the pinnacle of city builder games, and/or a city builder thats easy and simple to understand, you should buy it.			"

												Another city building game, but it's not quite like the others.  More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;PROS:- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.CONS:- Constant ""tweets"" got pretty annoying after a while.- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.- A lot of specialty buildings had ""noise"" zones that seemed unreasonably large.- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.- Small number of maps included (although more are available).- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.- No streetcars- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.- Road ""snapping"" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.Now that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?Anyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced.  Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.EDIT:Since the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game.			"

												I would love nothing more than to give Cities: Skylines a glowing review as I've played it for several hours beyond what steam shows, but frankly, I'm disappointed in their recent DLC practices. It's eerily similar to Payday 2, where they had a great game and then milked it to no end for every last penny. Snowfall? Natural Disasters? After Dark? These should either be a part of the vanilla game or a singular expansion, not individual ~$15 DLC items. As for the Stadium and Content Creator DLCs, those are just ridiculous, it's like the Sims with endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC that's expensive and shouldn't be standalone. Really disappointed in them going down this route.			"

												It really is the Sim city 5 we should have gotten and so much more value for money too!!,Not many Bugs as far as i can tell, although the death feature is quite challenging expecially in a high density area. Make sure to plop down lots of cemetarys and such or your building will be abandoned if dead people are left un collected.Noise pollution.. it's actually so deadly Dont cut corners and build cheap roads.. it will cause a plague, everyone will die!!! you will lose.. if only i wasnt so cheap. :(It does need more disaster options.. but its so sadictively fun to drown your city with dams.. the water physics are superb""11/10 would drown 80,000 people again!

												Games are only as good as the companies who make them. And this one is no exception. Cities: Skylines is the KING of city building games. Awesome graphics and gameplay, HUGE plot of land to grow your city on and best of all: a modding community that reigns supreme. Simcity 2013 was the equivalent of Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Meaning we waited years and years for a new release and all we got was an atrocious reboot. Colossal Order has answered our prayers and given us this masterpiece. Not to mention that unlike Simcity 2013, theres no requirement to sign in to a server to play.2 thumbs WAY way up for Colossal Order.			"

												This is the true city-simulator successor for this generation. The modding capabilities, districting, road laying mechanics and the large city sizes are some of the big plusses in my book. The down sides include the building and park placement mechanics and also the lack of ability to make farms with huge fields. Cities: Skylines is a new standard for future games of this genre despite some of its bugs and I hope to see what the developers and modders alike can do to make this game experience the best with today's gaming technologies.Totally worth paying full price.

												Pros- Solid, simple yet creative and freeroam city building game.- Beautiful environment.- New features such as Zone Unlocking, District and Asset Editor add more depth to the game.- Better than that ""another City-building game"" in the major ways. Cons- Most buildings are pretty identical.- Road and zone planning can be frustuated.- Just a single city, no regional areas. Nor multiplayers (probably a good thing).Final VerdictFinally, the next-gen, 3D, fully-moddable, functional city simulation game! If you like city-building games, this game is for you. Although the game is relatively small but the revival community will sure keep it going. Great work, Colossal Order.9/10!			"

												I spent a couple hours building a thriving community with a large residential estate and one boulevard of shops.Eventually I decided to make the place look nice, so I added a river - but I didn't bother putting protective walls up.The river banks filled up and overflowed straight onto the housing estate and down onto the shops until it carried on down to the sea again.The flood lasted for weeks and I couldn't do anything because you cant build on water, so I just watched and admired the beautiful chaos unfold.10/10 would flood again.

It's nothing new.

												This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours. Reading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled ""easier"". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself. The gameplay is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps. It is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly! Visuals and sounds are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in. I bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  BScreenShots :  SCREENSHOT 1  SCREENSHOT 2  Pretty much completed Not the ideal screenshot of showing off a bridge  I thought the bus stops in my city were crowded Even emergency vehicles do not pass a funeral procession "

												Ever since simcity-4, city simulation has become more off a hobby for me than just occasional game play. Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is. Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities. Bound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone. Off course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10.			"

The usage of plural noun, in this case 'cities' instead of 'city' really lives up its name. Literally, the available space is big enough to make multiple cities. Thus, put the title alone, this game beats its 'singularity'-ish predecessors.Enuff Said, 11/10!			"

												City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play Cities: Skylines you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking. It took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead. With the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside. At this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff. Now I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city. So after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it. As your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. City: Skylines is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.Granted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women.			"

												This game is so much better than sim city. Its additive and you can do basiclly everything you get in mind because steam workshop support. I have spent these first 100 hours to only one city. Of you like city builders, get this and all it's DLC's.			"

												Surprisingly tight City Sim, coming from the studio that made a name with their Cities in Motion series. Paradox seems to have read the book about how not to make a City Sim and have learned the lessons EA so willingly showed off with their lousy Sim City release. Good job, Paradox!			"

												This is one of the best city building games i have ever seen cause it gives you plenty of vanilla material and sometimes gets you thinking outside the box and get creative. It has workshop support so if you run out of fun in the vanilla game there is the addons on the workshop whit sections like: Mods, Buildings, Transport, Fire, Health and police Department and many more. Also Paradox and Collosal Orders [The Creators Of This Game] make DLCs and Huge! updates to the game every now and then. After Dark DLCThis DLC includes the Day and Night cycle, Better airport, Taxies and Tourisim! Now thats a bunch we also have the Snow Fall DLCSnow Fall DLCIt includes Trams, Heating, Snow Plows And obviosly Snowy Maps. Thats so far with the DLCs. I dont really want to talk about the updates because it would take too long so I leave it up to you to find out whats new and whats gona come out next. "

												This game if of high quality. Smooth, pretty, intuitive. BUT: There is one downside with this game, and it's big enough that I would not recomend it:The game is so easy it becomes meaningless and boring. There is absolutely no chance you wil go bankrupt, and making everyone in your city happy is trivial. Then what's the point?EDIT: I realize that the game might be a challenge to people that either have no experience with city simulators, or know absolutely nothing about traffic engineering or city planning. If you do, however, the game becomes trivial, and more about making the ""perfect"" city than about making a functioning city.			"

 Nice City Builder with ♥♥♥♥ing traffic jam problem after reach 80K population above  It has a good graphic for city builder game  Steam Community Workshop isn't bad either, many interesting items there first time I play this game I think ""wow it's little bit hard to solve traffic jam problem, and why my city population won't increase after 32K???"" but now maybe Cities: Skyline helps me a lot to know what other people think if I do a mistake, because the NPC wont stop complaining before I solve the problem.  If you love city builder game, I recommend this game If you never play city builder, Try this game. Not too hard for starter but after reach 2400 population, you will need strategy If you like a game that requires patience, I recommend this gameI bought this game one week before the discount, and I was a little annoyed with that Overall Ratings:  11/10   "

												One of the best city building games of all time in my opinion. I've gotten more time out of this than Simcity as a whole (in the same span of time) and I still love it. Great workshop compatibility, graphics, and mechanics. Some things could definitely be improved but I feel like the workshop is already on all of that. WAY better than any other equivalent. Also, I can't believe this game is made in Unity! Doesn't run that well on larger cities but is still runs better than any other city builder. It actually simulates everthing, the roads are way better, huge maps, resources, much better traffic AI than other games (not to say that you can just draw grids everywhere and not expect traffic, you still have to use a 6-4-2 method). Roads tools are great and fun and aesthatically appealing.			"

												I will start off with saying that I can't recommend this game. Which is a shame.It just isn't a finished product in my opinion. You will get something that resembles a release ready product if you choose to use the Workshop and download assets and mods. This will however prove to be an unwise decision as when a new DLC+patch comes, you can most likely say goodbye to your city. You will at least have a very hard time getting it to run like it did the day before said content was released. Many are praising the game for its water dynamics, I won't. Actually I think the water is really bad. Build a dam? The water will have none of that and start flowing upstreams just to get away from it. I would had been excited over the water if you could add streams when creating maps in the editor. Like drawing a stream with a special tool to tell the water which direction to go and intensity.Let's talk about powerplants.There are seven of them to choose from, two of which are windpower and two which you most likely will never use. Those two would be the dam and the solar power plant. The dam is useless because of how water functions in the game, no it is not me that is incompetent. I have done a lot of testing in the editor to try and get it right for a dam, and honestly it is such a pain to get it to work that you are better off just plopping down windpower or any of the rest. Even the solarplant would be better. Nice clean energy to power your city, right? No. Nighttime was added to the game, and for some reason in the universe this game plays out in, they have not invented any method to store generated extra power. So when the darkness falls, there will be no tv watching or showering for your cims, as the plant produces 0 energy for the duration of the night.Did you read somewhere that they where introducing weather in the newest DLC+patch? Did you also hear them saying that the weather was cosmetic? Well...it isn't. Apparently the ""cosmetic"" fog will block out the sun and lower the effeciency of your solar plant. ""Cosmetic"" rain will make the temperatures drop so your cims use more power to heat their homes. Doesn't really sound that cosmetic, does it?All that is fine, this is what happens in real life with weather, but the cluelessness of the publisher stating obvious wrong facts in interviews is not. So with the nighttime and fog, you might just want to skip that solar power plant.The AI in the game is horrible. I am sure you have heard about it on forums and such. The cars will force themselves into one or two lanes instead of using the full potential of the roads. Emergency vehicles will patiently keep behind the other drivers and so on.Another thing that is quite annoying is the complete lack of developer presence on the game's forums here on Steam. In my opinion, if you choose to release a game on Steam you should also be bothered with the big community it will gather there. I think that the sole reason for Cities: Skylines ""success"" is that people where desperate after something else after being let down by Simcity: 2013.If you decide to buy this game you will get some fun out of it at the beginning, but you will with no doubt get more and more annoyed later on when finding more and more stuff in the game that simply does not work, or works in a very odd way.Defender of the devs need not comment about this and that, if this is the best game in the world for you and everything works like a charm then go and make a positive review and enjoy your game.

If you Build It, They Will ComeHop in the Review-Well Delorean because we're going back in time, way back to the glory days of  1989.Not because this is the year that Back to the Future II was released,  not because I want to warn my younger self that Indiana Jones isn't really going on his last crusade and not because Kevin Costner is about to discover his ""Field of Dreams""We're going back to 1989 because this is the year that the City Building game was born.Platform WarsWhilst Amiga and Atari ST owners argued over who's computer was better<cough> Amiga <cough>both sides could agreed that the PC with its blocky graphics and awful sound would never be a true gaming platform.Paradise CityThere was also agreement about another equally important gaming matter, that this new game ""SimCity"", no matter which format you played it on, rocked!You could build your own city, your own roads, railroads, infrastructure. It was mind-blowing.In fact it was a concept that rocked so hard that the Los Angeles based Guns N Roses (the ""One Direction"" of the late 80's*)released a song to celebrate its greatness called Paradise City.*(*These facts may be erroneous and are awaiting citation.)Up All NightSo now we've witnessed the city building ""big bang"" we need to get out of here before the Libyans find us.It's time to go back, not to the future, well to the future of the past, but not the future of the present!  (I love time travel!)It's 2011, One Direction have just released their first album (One Direction rose to popularity to fill the gap in the time line left by Guns N Roses who may or may not have gone missing during the alien attack on Los Angeles in 2010 as depicted in the documentary ""Battle Los Angeles"" **)(** Almost certainly true but citation is pending.)Bus Replacement ServiceAnother important event of this time period was the release of ""Cities in Motion"".An excellent little  transport simulation game by Colossal Order which had you placing bus stops and metro stations across little city maps then sitting back and watching the ensuing commuter nightmare as your ineffective planning came to light.My own gaming limitations aside, this was a gem of a game and left me wishing that I could manage the city development around the transportation network I was building.The Ice Queen Cometh...It's back up to 88mph again, a flash of light later and we're in 2013.The Monstrous  Sea Creatures emerging from the ""Pacific Rim"" have failed to take out ""One Direction"" and in a desperate attempt to free our airwaves from the ironically titled ""Best Song Ever"" Disney released a counter attack by way of Princess Elsa begging these Guns N Roses replacements to ""Let It Go"" ****** This information may be slightly inaccurate as I fell asleep during Pacific Rim and went outside to ""build a snowman"" shortly after Frozen started.It Grows if you Play with it.The other big news of 2013 was the release of Cities in Motion 2. The BIGGER is BETTER sequel to the previous transportation sim. It was prettier, the maps were much larger and your transportation decisions would impact city growth.Whilst still only a transport sim and not a city builder this was another great game in the franchise.1,2,3,4.....errr...1The other, other big news of 2013 was the release of SimCity.Yes I know we started our time travelling journey witnessing the birth of SimCity back in 1989, but it seems that,  despite spawning 3 sequels over the interceding years, a meeting was held by shady men of power where they discussed what they could possibly call the next game in the SimCity Franchise.They'd already had SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 (I assume they'd dropped the three zeros because they thought their audience incapable of counting up in 1000 increments any further.....)  so they came up with SimCity 5.I speculate that It was at this point one of them decided that the One Direction haggled minds of the current generation could not be expected to count all the way to 5.... so they decided to drop the number off the game title all together and SimCity was reborn!Sham CityAnd what a rebirth it was, not since Elsa had taken off her gloves and started freezing everything she touched like a frigid version of Gold Finger had such outrage been  seen.You had to be online all the time to play the game,  their servers were overloaded so you often couldn't play at all! (both of these issues were fixed later)  but most importantly, the maps were tiny, tiny things with very little room for the one thing this game was supposed to be about, City Building.On The Road AgainIt's time to charge the flux capacitor one last time, we're going home!It's 2015, Not content with their domination of the airwaves, One Direction are on tour.A public warning has been issued labelled  ""On the Road Again""The announcement includes the groups  whereabouts and an anticipated timeline to allow the general public to avoid several high risk locations, which are often large venues where people would normally gather, despicable.Anyway,  the Bigger news of 2015 is that the city builder is back!City Building Games are like Buses.You wait for years for one to come along and then two arrive at the same time.Firstly we've had the release of Cities XXL, a competent  city builder in its own right, but much like many of One Directions songs, it's almost an  exact copy of what came before it.This hasn't gone down well with people already exposed to that particular franchise, if you've heard one song, you've heard them all, right?And now we have Cities Skylines, but is this the salvation of the city building genre we've all been hoping for ?A Little MisunderstandingWhen I first fired up Cities Skylines I was immediately filled with disappointment.It was pretty, it seemed to have all the features I could want in a city builder, but the map size was tiny, SimCity 5000 tiny.The same white dotted line marked out the edges of the postage stamp sized buildable area as I'd butted against in SimCity so many times before.... but I was wrong!Game ChangerYou can't imagine my relief when I realised I could purchase new plots of land to expand my fledgling  metropolis.The map is in fact huge, you can buy and unlock land to expand out not only in ""One Direction"" but in which ever direction you choose!I swear I've never felt such relief when playing a game before.It was like finding out that Guns N Roses hadn't really been taken down by aliens, It wasn't only an amazing discovery, it was a game changer!Cities In MotionAs you would expect from a developer who's previous titles have been transportation management sims, the transportation mechanics in Skylines are excellent.You can place bus stops, set up bus routes, implement a tube system, play with trains and even boats. The public transport system is so fully realised and well implemented I really can't fault it.Cities In Motion TooRoads aren't neglected either.There's plenty of choice between different road sizes, one way systems, Yes, you can set streets up so cars can only go in ""One Direction"" (Best Pun Ever*) , roundabouts etc. All there waiting to help solve your traffic problems by way of substituting them with the problems of noise pollution instead.(*Best Pun Ever, may have been the  hidden bonus track released by the unexplainably popular boy band - reports are unconfirmed but it does seem to relate to the noise pollution issue). <snip>( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												First time review but felt compelled to about this game. If you are a fan of the whole tycoon, city building genre then Cities SKylines is for you.The support of the product through the workshop is like a treasure trove filled with replica buildings, unique designs and detailed assets which allow you to craft almost anything you can imagine within your city.The mods can be a little bit frustrating and dangerous to your save games but handled correctly (I'd highly recommend reading about the mods you are thinking about using in the workshop before downloading any) they add even more oppotunities to develop the gameplay, fixing minor frustrations and adding more simplitic and unique controls.If you are new to the genre then this is an excellent game to start from. Great value, it was only £22 when it first came out, and an even better workshop, this gane will suck you in for hours.			"

												Remember simcity 2013? Yea this is basicly that but not a huge disapointment. I have been playing simcity for many years, and I am sure that I am not the only one that was very unpelased with simcity 2013. Was it horrible? Nah, but it was not as good as it should be. Cities Skylines is the modern city builder I have been looking for. No city restrictions and no online DRM BS. The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.  It does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.My only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes. If you are like me and been wanting a great modern version of simcity then this is for you, along with the modding community I would definetly say that this game is well worth 30 bucks.			"

												Considering the success of Cities In Motion, I had high hopes for this game.Boy, was I wrong...This game is absolutely amazing. It runs really well, looks good and looks to have great modding potential in future. Little details like the water backing up behind a dam, swaying electricity wires etc make this game look fantastic. It's everything that SimCity should've been and more.The towns look small when you first start, but be rest assured you can grow a city up to 6x6km in a Prison Architect style land purchasing method. This is pretty much rivalling Cities XL in terms of raw city size.Overall, 10/10			"

Districts and policies are a major edition to the game, it allows the player to specialize an area, and make rules for it such as no pets. The city sizes can be unlocked up to 9 tiles, there is already a mod allowing 25 tiles. It also has an amazing fluid simulation allowing you to flood your city from placing dams.			"

												Brought the game, awesome.Created my first city, wow this game looks good.Managed the city's need of water with water tanks, check check and check.Got a population of +8000.Suddenly my citizens got sick, not good.Bodies piled up in and out of cementaries, oh noes.Saw that my water tanks were on pollutred land, well that explains some things.Tried to relocate said water tanks, got no money to do it.More people dying in their own poo, nasty.Went bankrupt because medical attention burned my reserves, with no use.Made -12k $ per month.Nearly 90% of my population died, only 1k over and still dying.Deleted city to start all over.maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan it's good to be mayor!Now for the real review:Cities: Skylines is an awesome. It got all benefits a city builder needs and even more (modding and creating your own props and buildings).I am a gamer who mainly loves MMO's, FPS and 3rdPS. But damn son this game made me nearly lose my job because I forgot the time while playing. If you want to destroy your life (and that of your own city's citizens) buy this game.Pros:+ Highly detailed city, buildings, props, citizens- god everything looks amazing.+ Close-up camera. Stalk your favourite citizen through the whole city.+ Many types of services such as water and sewerage management, medical and fire management and lots more.+ Unique buildings you can unlock and build by fulfill different in-game challenges.+ No moneygrabbing, DLC greedy, ""you need to be always online and connected to Origin""-EA+ Challenging gameplay. If you make a mistake (like I did; read above) your city goes down hill very fast.+ Nice sound effects if you go up-close.+ Taxes!!!! Whooooooho!+ Workshop support and an editor for own creations.Cons:- Nothing. The game is awesome!- Wait- Hmmm- *rubs chin and tries to think*- *scratches head while thinking, multitasking op*- Ah got it- Game needs a day and night cycle with lights and suchTL; DR: Game got no EA so buy it.

												""Suffice it to say that I believe this game is worth the asking price of $29.99.  It’s very easy to spend hours/days/months on a single map and fine-tune it to your liking, which is a tremendous value.  The fact that it supports a map editor and Steam Workshop is all the more reason why the price tag is more than generous.  Some may see “Cities: Skylines” as a “SimCity” clone, but honestly, who cares?  If we put aside the fact that the former does things the latter doesn’t do, there aren’t enough stable and fun city-management games out on the market, so why complain?  I, for one, am finally grateful for a current-gen city-builder that not only actually does the job correctly, but goes above and beyond my expectations.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/cities-skylines/---

												This game is worth its money threefold. Remember SimCity 2013?Yeah you probably do because it was chockfull of bugs and annoyances, however you still enoyed it didn't you?I had the same. Some of those annoyances weren't small however. The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013. Now you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws. This game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4. One of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod! That's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour! Another big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth. Something new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District. It is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly. One of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher. I have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome.			"

												You don't need a ton of time in this game to truly understand how good this game is. Long story short - if you're a fan of SimCity 1 and SimCity 4 and were dissapointed with SimCity 2013 - this is what you've waited for. You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit. Developers also care about modmakers, they supplied us with object editor, map editor and implemented steam workshop, this will give a huge lifespan to this game. It's also not that expensive, so if you really want to get the best city building simulator for this year - this is your choice.			"

												Was one of my favourite games until it was ruined by the Snowfall DLC and free update which broke most of the core game mechanics, and the developers taking the decision to degrade the graphics (LOD distance and such) for no apparent reason resulting in a very blurry game (assuming it was to improve performance).If only rollbacks were possible. It was a good game on Day 1 but it has went downhill since with prominent issues not being fixed, pointless/cosmetic DLC being introduced, and the community being mostly ignored by the developers. Paradox Interactive staff have been brilliant with offering support/help for the game, it's just a shame they are acting as the middleman between the end user and the developers.Until the core game mechanics are fixed, I will not be recommending this to future buyers.EDIT: As of now it seems that the Developers have almost completely abandoned this game and ran off with their money. I'll never buy another game from Colossal Order.			"

												The game all MP's, councils and their contractors should do part of their mandatory training on. You ask why? Well here goes:Road capacity in Truro (Cornwall) is really bad.Cities Skylines solution: Use the road upgrade tool to widen road or make road one way. Traffic flow improves, tax revenue improves and happieness increases.Local council solution: Remove a lane and make it a bus lane! Traffic gridlock, buses cant get to bus lane due to traffic, happieness decreases, business revenue decreases, then council scraps bus lane at a cost of £60k. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-34883680If only they had played this game maybe they could have got it right.............

												I've never felt the need to review a game before, as I tend to play casually and don't really have much to add, but given the enjoyment I'm getting from this game I felt I needed to review.The game, for me, is simply what the SimCity series should have evolved into - it's intuitive, whilst still requiring brain power to plan your city (everything from where the buses stop, tax rates and budget, right down to putting trees next to roads to reduce noise pollution) - the biggest selling point however is the available real estate to build on, which I feel has been sorely lacking in recent city building games.  You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real ""city"" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.Others have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.Highly recommend it!

Exploring new techniques and unlocking more and more buildings is a ton of fun.It has a sophisticated goods cycle, where you earn more taxes if goods are produced inside your city, from resources harvested in your city. The Cims can be seen chilling in parks, using public transportation etc, which looks fantastic. On German it could be said that the games has a high ""Wuselfaktor"".Highly recommended!			"

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												City Skylines is what Sim City 4 should have been. Paradox has done a great job on this guy and continues to support it with DLC and new features. If you like city builders this game will ruin evey other one for you by setting the new gold standard, What few beefs I have with the game are easily remedied by mods which the creators fully endorse and a slew of mod authors with materials, for example not being able to unlock every tile on the map, not sure why they restricted that, performace maybe, but there is a mod for that. With the exceptioon of multi player (not a feature I look for in city builders) I can't think of a single feature missing at this point assuming you have all the DLC.Graphically it is pretty good, not going to win awards but still one of the if not the best looking city builder I have played. Able to controll traffic routs above and below ground if you wish. I honestly cannot think of too many bad things to say about this game, If I was to bring up one point of contention I do think the crime is unrealistically low, but it hasn't annoyed me to the point of finding a mod to fix it. I am not a huge City builder player (looking at my hours played on this compared to RPGs) but I do like this one alot and come back to it when I need a mellow game to play.			"

												This is one of the games that you don't regret after you paid. The Dev Crew was small and they did not expect this accomplishment. Now they are growing! and if there is any plan to make the Cities:Skylines 2, I bet it will be much better than this.Now let's take a closer look to the features, pros & cons;PROSGame allows you to create your own maps, map themes, assets, mods and color corrections(LUTs). -Workshop Support-Dynamic water system by water source spawn points for rivers. -So you'll be able to build dams, water pumps and purification facilities.Free updates are satisfying. -I do not reccommend you to buy DLCs for few features-Road Tools are good enough. -such as 'straight', 'curve', 'Free-form', 'upgrade/degrade'-Natural Resources -coil ore, fossil oil, fertile land-Dynamic Wind -affected by height and sea-Day/night cycleIn-game landscaping options and decorations.Auto import-export according to the needs.Functional harbors & train stations for each, tourism and industry.CONSYou can fix lots of the problems that listed below with assets and mods from workshop but each one of em will reduce your game's performance cuz they re not vanilla featuresDevs did not reseach and observe good enough about roads, city planning, buildings, textures and colors.(ie: minimum bridge height is 12mts -Without crossing the lamps of the road under the bridge- etc)Road types are not enough. - Road junction angles are too big (min:45 degrees) - Road transitions are too sharp/short between large and small roads. - No merged road ramps. - Bumpy bridges upon water.Building zoning sizes are the same for low and high density unlikely Cities XL (max: 4x4 units = 32mtsx32mts)Building textures and models are not so realistic -some of em a little bit futuristic-Building types are not enough.Surface polycount of the landscape is not enough to detail it.Too saturated and low quality textures.Hope it helps. Have Fun. "

												I've played a lot of city builders in my time but I can honestly say that City Skylines is the city builder game that I have waited years for. It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game. I whole heartily reccommend City Skylines.  :)			"

												Technically it is an impressive city simulation, you will have fun building stuff and watching your city grow.  But after the initial wow factor, I am finding it rather shallow in terms of challenge.  There are a lot of tax tweaking options but i've never had to touch them, I have a very healthy income whatever I do.  Where are the problems faced by mayors?  People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn't be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.  Skylines just makes running a city seem too easy.I hope this initial release is kind of a ""here it is, be creative and build things"" and that future expansions will add some extra layers that start to challenge us.

												I've never played a city simulation game before, but this one is apparently considered one of the best, and I had fun playing it. You can be anally involved in the tiniest details of traffic organization, or spend the entire game in god-view 1000ft above the city. At first you will mess up and make rookie mistakes in city planning, but helpful tutorials and obnoxious pop-up messages will have you learning quickly. There is a downside to being successful though. For the end game buildings (Monuments), you must build a variety of Unique Buildings, half of them only being awarded to you for being bad at the game. For example; high unemployment, massive trash buildup,  high crime, poor health, and many abandoned buildings. You must deliberately ruin your city to get these last buildings, which sucks. The rest of the buildings however, are simply unlocked from population checkpoints. When you're not worrying about handicapping your city, you'll be scratching your head on how to solve the various problems that crop up, two examples being trash and pollution. See, citizens need trash services, but these buildings only cover a very small area, and create pollution. Thus, you have trash burning facilities inside the neighborhood- which cause people to get sick from the pollution. No matter how many Health services you have near the area, people still get sick and die, and there's nothing to fix it other than by creating gaps where nobody lives. Now mind you, mods can fix these inconsistences, but the devs punish you for using any mods by locking you out from earning achievements entirely. In conclusion, Cities:Skylines is a competent and fun city sim. It has some problems, many of which can be fixed by mods, but in doing so you are not allowed to earn achievements. The progression in end-game is flawed, but the rest of the game is steady and engaging.Also, apparently the Deluxe Edition doesn't come with ANY of the DLC.			"

												It definitely worths it's price. Very complete and detailed game. The fun and the interest in the game are guaranteed, but it can make you a bit upset when everything is ok with your city and in 5 minutes, the traffic, the lack of electricity or sewage can make you lose everything. Also the DLC's are very nice and valuable for the game but a bit too overpriced in my opinion.			"

Also, it has much more features which makes it realistic. The modding community is great and active. One downside is that there is no multiplayer in this game. The developers of the game know what they are doing and reach out into there community.			"

												I have been waiting to play a more modern version of Sim City 4 for a long time and this game truly delivers, with the more modern and easy to read interfaces and overlays so you can very quickly spot areas that are lacking in services and tons of new features make Cities: Skylines an awesome city building experience.With a huge area to work with you are free to make a single vast sprawling metropolis or small interconnected towns, the ease of use and the space actually allowed me to use the curve and free form road tools as I didnt feel the need to pack everything in to a boring grid structure so my cities look a lot more interesting as well. Visually its a very colourful game with a really cool aesthetic that makes it a pleasure to look at from every angle, there are tons of little details in the city as well.There is even an almost puzzle solving element to the game, figuring out traffic. It is incredibly satisfying when you find the solution to your traffic problem and then just watching everything smoothly and quickly get around your city. I was amazed when I followed a Cim who walked to a train station, travelled to the next city over, got a connecting train, then a bus all to get to his work on the complete opposite side of the huge map. It is incredibly fun and satisfying just watching your city unfold in its daily business.While there are a few minor flaws and issues that could be fixed or improved, like the ability to hide or show only certain transport routes to make editing them easier, the fun and enjoyable gameplay completly blows any issues away. Future free updates are already promised and with modding support I think I will be playing Skylines for a long time to come.It's easy to quickly lose a lot of time and get completly absorbed in this game, absolutly fantastic, highly recommended.

												Finally, a city simulator that has everything we want and nothing we don't.  This game captures the essence of what has been missing in the genre since the days of SimCity 4 (though 3000 has always been my favorite).  The districting tool is fantastic and adds a new element that really makes your city yours.  The city details are every bit as good as SimCity 5, but the game is smooth as silk, and the maps are far larger and even more visually appealing.   No stupid patches every time I log in or online always requirements here.  I cannot wait to see what the community is going to create for this game.  The only negative I see is that sometimes there are mismatches between building names and what they look like (e.g. a laminate floor factory is named ""Burger World"" etc.).  The interfaces are intuitive and slick, and the city progression will keep any gamer interested in pursuing city growth to higher and higher limits for days if not weeks.  Nice work here all around.  This game is being added to the favorite stack.			"

												I haven't been able to sit down and play a city sim in a long time.  All the ones that I actually like are pretty dated, and the older UIs usually prevent me from having any fun.  Cities Skylines is different.  Most the strategy comes from road building where traffic is your major enemy.  This makes prudent planning vitally important and means you can kind of skip over the micro-managing (if you wish, but there are plenty of options too).  I've spent hours in a sandbox-city with infinite money just designing highway interchanges and had fun doing it!The game is beautiful, and with the workshop integration the possibilities are endless.  I'd recommend this to any city builder fan.			"

												I find myself challenged to write an objective review because I am absolutely in the clouds with this game. So, although I am somewhat biased, I can wholeheartedly recommend Cities: Skylines to any avid simulation gamer. The UI is quite intuitive and because of all the available mods and options, you have precize control on how you want to play the game in regards of economics, traffic managing and map design. If you are looking for a particular feature, the workshop is your best friend with thousands of mods and assets.A word of caution about minimal system recommendations, the better your rig, the more you will be able to get the most out of this game when it comes to actual gameplay and not just pretty looks or resolution. I have a 32 RAM, GTX 980ti accompanied with a 4770K CPU. At the moment I have 533 mods and assets installed and it takes about 7 minutes to load a new map. A saved game might be slightly longer but I haven't clocked that.I set all the graphics to max and after the first few hours I was forced to lower the settings slightly because the game began to bog down. A few more hours in and I have to experiment again with my settings because the larger the city, the more heavily your hardware will be challenged. Which is only logic, but I found that with one small street of extra industries or housing added can make the game from running smoothly to the commenly known tack-tack-tack motion the cars will be displayed while driving.It's easy to a add high amount of mods and assets, but it does ask for some insight on the player's side. Because sooner or later you will run into mods that aren't up to date or conflict with other mods. So if you're not too experienced or just can't be bothered, use these sparsely.Recommended because:- Precize control on indepth game mechanics and economics- Stunning graphics- Huge amounts of mods and assets available- Highly detailed and immersive- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the gamePoints of critic:- Gameplay experience depend quite heavy on up to date hardware- Mods and assets will sooner or later cause conflicts- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the game- Railway and harbour feels very basic and more of an afterthought			"

Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders out there.  In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good.  Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders.  The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on management than simply plotting down buildings.  There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc.  But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it.  Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry).  In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build.  If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up.  If you don't have enough jobs people will move out.  If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing.  I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good.  Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them.  The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some.In a nutshell: If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Pros:Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!Cons:More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it.  For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small.  My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics.  This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on.			"

												For over ten years fans of city building games have been met with disapointed after disapointment for anything that tried to capture the greatness that was Sim City 4 (where by knonw as SC4). Sure you have Tropico and like games but they just are not the same, you are building an island nation, instead of zoning you are plopping everything down, much like Sim City Societies which flopped for that very reason (See the paragraph below). For ten years these fans have wonder though the wastelands waiting for a true sucessor to SC4, first came Sim City Societies but it was much like SIm Town, a game where you just placed everything down much to the distaste of anyone who wanted to zone the land and watch as the sims took up shop and resident in to the city. You also had the Cities X(X)L sersies (by NO WAY related to this game, the devs of this game made Cities in Motion). WHose frequent bugs, non working code, and failed promases time after time left a bitter taste in these fans mouths. The dev of Cities X(X)L have a habbit of just releasing the same game year after year full of the same bugs. Then you have SIm City 2013 (aka Sim City 5) This failure of a game was due to many reasons, the inability of EA knowing what made Sim City a sucessful and much loved sersies. Instead of sharing our creations with the world we had to now play againts the world (when it worked!) and always be online which was a ""tenchinal limitation"" (until it wasn't) The failure of the glassbox engine to actually simulate things outside of poop was also an issue (Those who are going to say it simulated more then that I know, I am making a point). So today brings us Cities: Skylines a phenox in the burt ashes of hopes and dreams. Even if the phenox is a circular blue bird who chirps out what sim..I mean cims are thinking it is still a job well done by CO. Although basic in many levels as opposed to SC4 it is a much needed refresh form this small studio, I expect many great things to come in updates, patches and DLC.			"

												Start by imagining EA / Maxis' catastrophic 2013 edition of SimCity. Replace the entire broken simulation engine with something that actually works and scales well. Make the map bigger and massively expandable. Throw in a whole bucket of small ""why didn't anyone think of THAT before?"" features that aren't quite transformative but deliver enough of an impact to get you grinning ear to ear.Oh, and divide the launch price by two. Voila! You have Cities: Skylines.While this is not quite a genre-defining, groundbreaking upgrade over the 12-year-old SimCity 4 (it still lacks region play and inter-city trading), it manages to build on most of that legendary title's major milestones while also replicating almost entirely the presentational charms of its botched sequel. The game has its fair share of mild annoyances, most of which involve the way its massive piles of data are presented to the player, but it speaks volumes that one of its greatest issues is how difficult it is to praise it without comparing it to SimCity.Maxis is dead. Long live Colossal Order. A tiny studio from Finland (with a hilarious CEO) has accomplished a feat that previously eluded more illustrious development teams for more than a decade. Cities: Skylines is a must-buy for genre newcomers and SimCity veterans alike, and it will likely go down as an instant classic and the new high water mark for urban planning sims.			"

												Do you remember being excited by the SimCity remake? That feeling of ""wow this is going to be great, a modern take on city building""? Do you remember the sheer disappointment that was experienced when you discovered that you not only had to queue for hours after purchasing the day, it was online only? EA at the time said it was because their Agenting System Glassbox was doing intricate calculations and that most PCs couldn't handle it. Of course, that turned out to be rubbish. Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool ""tilt-shift"" camera perspective that was used in SimCity. The game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode. With the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps! The game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.I am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that! Pick this game up today!			"

Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool ""tilt-shift"" camera perspective that was used in SimCity. The game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode. With the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps! The game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.I am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that! Pick this game up today!			"

												I don't know what to think about this game... It's good... but not entirely... It came out soon after sim city failure so i guess you know why it got so popular. I've played it for a while and i'm disappointed. There's no target of this game. You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders). So building cities. it's pretty good. you have to provide water, electronics(not by making a building but with pipes and wires), you have to take rid of trash, road traffics, you've got airports, buses, metro(or tubes ya british ♥♥♥♥♥♥s), pretty much everything. So in overall - pointless but very good city builder                                6.5/10(just for being pointless)			"

												It lacks the depth and realism of the old SimCity series. This game is very easy, build any common-sense city and you will be rolling in tax income with no budgetary, social, or infrastructure problems whatsoever. The buildings and vehicles are cartoony and look like candy. Certain mechanics are poorly thought-out, such as the optional day-night cycle disabling solar power plants and the ridiculous six-lane roads causing more problems than they solve. The DLC packs add one or two useful features, usually transportation-related, but are padded with otherwise useless content. Public saunas, really? This is not stuff real city governments are concerned with.Still, it's an impressive engine with some surprisingly intricate modeling, such as the waterworks and traffic simulation. But if you were expecting the next-generation SimCity 4 with countless hours of challenges, urban intrigue, and entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. It's a mildly interesting antfarm that happens to be the only city-building game on the market right now.			"

												Cities: Skylines, is easily one of the best modern takes on the city builder genre in a long time and just crushes Simcity 5 in terms of the agent system and simulation model. It is lacking in terms of finer controls and mid to late game changes, but the modding support has been great and the game is only going to get bigger with future content and DLC.If you're looking for something incredibility difficult to build and maintain like in Banished, Skylines isn't it. It's more about sandbox play and letting the player do what they want, but again all that could change with DLC and continued support. This would also be a great entry into city building or something to show kids the basic steps of city management and planning.			"

												I was an avid fan of the SimCity franchise all the way back to SimCity on SNES when Will Wright was the developer. I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.Then comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).I can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.-> [ Steam Workshop ]The steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]Everything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.-> [ Sandbox Mode ]When I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away. -> [ Game Engine ]Everything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.-> [ Traffic ]It is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).I did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...Overall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not by the game.It looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.Regards,RichardYouTube: IAMRichardT			"

Cities: Skylines is currently the best city building simulator. It sure isn't difficult but extremely fun. The game has so much content to offer so just let your imagination do the rest and build your own dream city. Besides, if you want to add even more variety you're always free to download mods and assets from the steam workshop. Things like unique buildings, props, vehicles and other additions will enhance your gaming experience by a huge amount. In my opinion, I'd say that the game isn't perfect but you can make it near-perfect by using different mods to fill the gaps. For example, the traffic management is so tricky and poor that sometimes you feel like playing traffic simulator but with the help of mods you can solve this problem much easier.The maps are enormous and can be increased in size even more via mods. It may take dozens or more hours to finish the city, especially, if you're making it look pretty and pay attention to small details and not just the population. Speaking of details, the game looks polished in high-up view and even while you're zoomed in all the way (or using first person camera mod).I've been nagging about mods the whole review, meaning, that the incorporation of workshop was the best approach to make this game by far the best city building simulator that you can currently get. But beware, having a lot of mods result in huge FPS drop!10/10 "

												Much as I like to give every distraction remain focused a chance to affirm, certain diversions request examinations. By ideals of Cities: Skylines, planner Colossal Order has obviously demonstrated its excitement after SimCity – not only the key thought and procedures for building and keeping up a duplicated city starting from the soonest arrange, yet a phenomenal part of the look and feel as well. In like manner, on fundamentally every check, Skylines considers insistently to the past driving figure of the city-building kind. It is, truly, the best of its kind to arrive in an entire decade – a remarkable, adaptable, staggering, and all-around marvelous reenactment that permits you to gather sprawling, single-player urban regions to your heart's substance. Building must be its own reward, regardless, in light of the way that the nonappearance of eccentric occasions or catastrophes leaves the control of running these towns feeling drained and wise. Having influence pioneer, part god-ruler with the ability to subjectively bulldoze your reenacted local people's fantasies and make schools with a tick, building a city with no arranging is for the most part standard: set down roads with the simple to-utilize contraptions, dispense zones for private, business, or mechanical structures, give utility associations, secure the cost help, then rehash the cycle with new stuff that has been opened by your making individuals hitting new points of view. Horizons finds an all things considered chipper medium between the multifaceted plan of SimCity 4 and the relative straightforwardness of SimCity 2013 by method for in this way adding zoneable zones to paths as they're laid, yet meanwhile getting a handle on mandatory busywork like laying water channels. Those stray pieces are all attempted and genuine - you couldn't have a city-design without them - so it's required that they be done well. Urban districts: Skylines does that. The crucial way this sim pounds it out of the excitement center is in its scale. Every preoccupation starts as misleadingly little, contracting you to a four-square-kilometer zone (a misty size from a SimCity design, by fortunes I'm certain), yet rapidly permits you to purchase access to a near to plot of place where there is vague size. By then it does this seven more times, for an aggregate conceivable space of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there's an extensive measure of room. Recalling that you can't especially modify space while you play, there's an included guide supervisor where you can make any land mass you pick before you skip in - or download one from the unmistakably combined Steam Workshop mod support. With such wide urban zones, it's extraordinary that Skylines licenses you to depict and organize runs exclusively. Basically paint a lump of your city with the District instrument, and you can not just name it so you can spot it effectively on the guide, however give it novel procedures that control everything from advising smoke locators to lessening fire dangers (at a cost) to supporting recreational prescription use for lower wrongdoing rates, or banning highrise structures to make depicted downtown and common zones. In mechanical zones, you can sharpen the relationship to misuse a guide's normal assets in the region to mine metal, enter for oil, create on rich land, or collect trees for officer advantage. You can even make constrain motivations for a particular kind of zone inside every zone. We ought to zoom in for a minute: we can see specific people strolling around the paths, going to work or school, sharing in beguilement works out, or returning home by the thousands. They drive autos, take arranges, and even walk pooches. (You can openly name them, yet I propose naming them Waldo, in light of the way that there are various to the point that in the event that you watch that particular one again you I say you essentially win.) This is the place you appreciate the time scale persuades the chance to be ludicrous. On the slowest speed a day endures 10 seconds – three and a half on the speediest – which deduces the excursion to work could most recent a week. Regardless, the nonattendance of a day and night cycle proposes time doesn't appear, in every way, to be an excessive amount of unnatural, however rather a reflection, making it hard to serve the speed at which things are made and charge exchange streams out. Mass travel is a sketchy savage. It's missing to set down transport stops and get prepared stations; you need to plot out courses freely, or nobody will go wherever. It's unquestionably not hard to lose all capacity to peruse a compass in that, particularly as courses begin covering and it's dumbfounding to get your vehicle stop set on the privilege half of each obliged street. Nevertheless, there are a considerable measure of choices, and the endorphin surge from making a red advancement information overlay turn green makes everything upheld, despite all the burden. Close, structures are awe inspiring and point by point, direct down to little improvements like housetop fans turning. A slider in the choices menu gives us control over the measure of essentialness of-field obscure connected with inaccessible structures when zoomed in, which mirrors SimCity's drawing in diorama influence. Horizons doesn't sort out the graphical method for SimCity, nevertheless, and given the goliath numbers we see them in they don't correctly have the assortment foreseen that would keep most neighborhoods from emitting an impression of being vague. More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the crucial satisfaction in building. It's a truly magnificent and as regularly as would be prudent staggering reenactment, where a bewildering number of virtual individuals continue ahead over a huge swath of land. Getting in and making something is direct, however acing it will require wide research on social event wikis to comprehend why progression is vexed regardless of when you address your subjects' prominent concerns. Try not to expect strengthening conditions or sporadic occasions, yet do plan to be awed by the scale and different moving parts of this city-build.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												Dear Paradox/Colossal Order,Today marks the 6th time in two years you have arbitrarily ruined all my savegames without warning, and I'm never buying another one of your games. Every update you do this, every update forum threads complaining about it are everywhere, every update you make excuses and do damage control to cover up the fact that you do not care about us, your customers. You're perfectly happy to continue milking this game dry with irrelevent patches and pay DLC that many of us do not even want to touch in any way whatsoever. I've rebuilt my mod set 5 times now simply because you wanted to update the game without warning and give me no option not to update... and I'm never dealing with this nonsense again. Never. The fact that Paradox hasn't stepped in and forced you to use the Betas tab (like they and any other sane developer supporting mods does) tells me they deserve just as much blame as you. This situation has never been acceptable and it's an insult that it still goes on today.I regret buying Cities Skylines a bunch of times for friends, and even supporting you this far. If I could get a refund for all the wasted time and frustration I've had simply trying to enjoy the game I paid for, I would in an instant. I always wanted to love Cities Skylines, but you refused to let me. For that, I hate you.Signed,an ex-fan			"

												I'll be honest, I have never enjoyed city management. So I'm not the guy to tell you about all these management systems, but I hate strickly the management part, I love just building cities willy nilly! I just hate managing things its just not my thing, but I really like designing stuff.  Honestly, I want to just build cool cities, and the base game includes unlimited money and unlock all milestones mods.  I can totally see how in-depth this game could be, and I'll probably get slammed for ""ruining"" the experience.  They were installed when I launched the game, and I've been having a blast ever since!			"

												Out there you can find better and more exhaustive reviews than what I could possibly ever write so I'll keep it short and simple: if you love management and/or city building games, you owe to yourself to get Cities: Skylines, the best game of the genre since SimCity 2000 and SimCity 4. My own highlights:* Complete design freedom: if you can think about it, you can make it in the game. The game doesn't offer what you want to do? There's probably a mod for it in the Steam Workshop; if there isn't, you can easily make one and share it with all other players!* The best traffic simulation I've ever seen in a city management game.* Gorgeous graphics.* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac and Linux compatible.Why are you still here? Go get it!My vote: 10 / 10Note: I have edited this review to up the vote from 9.5 to 10 out of 10. This is the first perfect score that I give in a Steam review, and I think for a good reason: the game has no flaws whatsoever -- if we exclude slowness with AMD video cards under Linux, an issue that is being tackled by Colossal Order -- and it's just extremely addictive; I didn't have this kind of fun with a city builder in ages.

												I would recommend this game as a big improvement on SimCity. It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.I do have a few gripes however...Traffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.Another issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.All in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me. Now I just play it every so often & usually start from scratch. I would recommend at a discounted price...			"

												Outstanding game. Takes almost everything that annoyed me about SimCity, and improves it.Not overly complicated to start a city which produces income, while still being challenging. Enables you to completely control every aspect and let your imagination run wild. The fact its on Linux is everything for me and works perfectly. Very occasional split-second lag when city gets extremely large, but still well within playable limits.Very Highly recommend.			"

												It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.I've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.SimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.Skylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.Where Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.One of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.Where it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.This leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.However, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.The game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.SummaryPros:+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features+ No crazy online-only requirements+ Excellent Workshop support+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was releasedCons:- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.Verdict:Honestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going.

												This game is a worthy successor to Sim City 4(Sim City 2013 was a flop, imo) that offers depth and quality worthy for any city builder enthuasist.  The game offers a diverse and massive modding community, which is a key to enhancing any city building game, and not to mention it's easily accessible with Steam Workshop.  This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles.  I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism).  However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.  With that said, this is a must add for anyones library, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy city building.			"

Huge amount of space to build on and if you run out, expand and buy more land. Full modding support so you'll expect some pretty cool stuff to download. The game still has some flaws such as no day/night cycle as of the time of this quick review, but the pros still outweight the cons found in this game.  If you enjoyed Simcity 4 or any city builder/simulator, get it. I was surprised this game is worth $30 USD. It's so well worth that price tag.			"

												This is a great game! It is great fun to build a city and it is quite relaxing. The modding comunity is great because there are many great mods such as the first person camera mod. The only problem I have had is that not all mods come up in the cotent manager but I was able to resolve it by going into the files of the game. It is slightly annoying but it is still definatley worth it. Also, I shouldn't be able to run this game but I can still run it fine whilst the graphics still looks great. I have a 2.5 ghz processor and intel HD 4600 graphics with 112mb graphics. I can't garantee it will run if you have similar performance specs but it did for me! Anyway I would definatley recomend this to anyone who likes building or managing anything.If you aren't sure if you'd like to get this game I would recomend getting the Simcity 5 demo on origin and try that out. If you like that in the slightest you should like this game even more since cities skylines in my opinion is better that Simcity 5!I thinks it's better than simcity 5 because, this has bigger plots, more of the people are actually simulated in game plus I like the modding comunity for Cities: Skylines!

												Finally, a good city builder after all these years! Cities: Skylines seems to handle very well everything the other recent city builders couldn't.  For starters - it works. I'll admit the game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. After playing 26 hours, this one crash is the only negative I can come up with. The game seems to squeeze all the juice out of my system in terms of CPU and GPU usage (Intel i7 Quad Core 2.67Ghz, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), but in return it gives me a smooth and enjoyable playing experience! Unlike the competition, you can build large cities, but there are no slowdowns, no stuttering and no need to restart the game every 30 minutes. As of now, to my knowledge, Cities: Skylines is the only good city building game available. The other two I'm aware of (Simcity, Cities XXL) don't even come close, as they have too many problems.

												It's more of a road network building simulator than a city simulator. All of the zones you zone and all of the buildings you build are there to drive traffic in & out of your city. 90% of your planning and building and organizing goes towards the road network, to the point of micromanaging and obsessing. 90% of the problems you will face when laying out your city will be road related. Building the city just involves dragging zones with a paint tool and plonking down service buildings like hospitals and schools. All the cities end up looking and feeling very, very similar. The cities are very easy to build and grow. The only real challenge you ever face is designing a road network that flows and is not chaotic. This is fine. This can be fun. This can be interesting, and challenging. But this does not qualify as a city simulator.			"

Though player input is frequent and mistakes can be punishing, you're always learning, and working to build a better city for all.

												Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder game. Its a simple concept but such an amazing game! The graphics are very good and the game itself is amazing, it's such a well executed game! It costs a lot but in some sales it goes down to arond£9.00, you can get it cheaper online though. Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game. (it advertises this on its page!) I especially like trying to control the traffic as it is difficult to keep it flowing; if your traffic flows your city flows! Overall i really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes city builder games!I'd rate this game 89/100			"

My simplified game review after my first major capitol city.  I want to keep it simple because of the lack of hours however, here I go for the new players =D Pros: 101.  Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the  residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.2.  Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents.  There are many more examples.3.  This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc.  You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together.  If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.4.  The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline.  IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict.  No more city buildings to aid your zones.5.  Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.  6.  Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation. 7.  Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.8.  Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.9.  You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.10.  Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour.  Cons: 4 1.  The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.2.  Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.3.  No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope). 4.  Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it.  Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.Conclusion:  If you are into building cities, Get this game.  Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning.  Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world.			"

												I used to play the early versions of simcity, I think about 20 years ago. I really got hooked on them. With Cities: Skylines I didn`t get the same effect. I think it`s a bit boring once you play for a while.  Maybe I should try other games like this and consider if it`s a gametype what I just don`t like anymore or is it just this game what I don`t like. I would rate it 6/10.			"

												This is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long long time. First of all, this is my first game I've played of this genre. The closest I've played is Banished (which I love), but this has a great deal more depth in managing your city. I did watch 6-8 hours of ""how to"" videos on youtube before I played for real. And I highly recommend that to anyone new to the genre. What you'll find when you do play and figure it out a bit is that it is highly addicitve as there is always just ""one more thing"" to do before you can quit. The intricacy of how everything has to be balanced is a sweet feature. For instance, my current town has about 54,000 citizens but I leveled off at about 40,000 for a while and couldn't figure out why. As it turns out (hello Google!), I had over-educated my population so nobody would take my factory/ industrial jobs. So my unemployment rate was a bit high and nobody wanted to move to town! So, I shut down 2-3 elementary schools, 2 high schools and a university. Presto....the average education level of my citizenry took a small dip and the town started growing again! THAT is some sweet relational effects. There are things you can do to make use of a highly educated workforce, but then you better have exceptional outside contacts (road, rail and ships!) to bring in goods to feed/drive your economy. It is fascinating. Now excuse me while I get back to Wertydurd and crack 60,000 residents so I can build a dang airport. 12/10			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit. Until the developers randomly decided to increase the minimum requirements for it. Went up to 3.0GHz randomly out of nowhere. Can't run the game anymore. This should NOT happen with release titles. Games in EA usually have a warning up saying ""Minimum requirements might change"" because of how hard it can ♥♥♥♥ people over. Paradox didn't care.			"

												Fun game! It is what Sim City V could have been. It is balanced by making you look after the city, not just leave the game open and pile up money. Traffic is a difficult part, but that simply adds in character to the game. Definitelly love the fact you can create your own structures as well :) very nice feature! However, tree placement could be better, maybe give people a brush which they can use to paint trees and such, rather than placing one by one. Other than that I would gladly give it 10/10Best city simulator I ever played. I do recommend buying it! It is worth every penny.			"

												This is the city simulator I have been waiting for since Simcity 4, and it has delivered. There are too many good things to say about this game, so I will focus on the -very few- negatives that I've encountered.  I think it it is too forgiving on traffic issues, it could use more building variety, and I think it could use an ""in-game"" terraforming option.I have high hopes for this game being the best city sim ever, especially with day one modding support, and future patches and DLC.

												*Those with Performance Issues*You need to check which graphics card your computer is using when playing Cities: Skylines.  Beforehand, I could only run the game at absolute lowest settings, windowed mode, and a lowered resolution and it was still low fps, which really bummed me out.  I have my computer set to use my Nvidia graphics card (760M) on everything, but for some reason this game was set to use the intel one instead.  All you need to do is set the .exe file to use your high performance card instead. Now I can run the game at max settings flawlessly.  Excellent Game so far!			"

												The interface is a joy to use. It is fun to see your city grow and prosper. The citizens will ask for it when they need something without being too demanding.The simulation is very accurate. Ie adding a goods station will relieve trucks traffic travelling into your city but it does generate a bottleneck around the station itself.I loved Sim City and this game has the same feel to it.Great game.

												If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Let's begin.First, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013? This game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the ""huge"" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.This game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.As far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.Why is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013?  (repeats a bit)First of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.Now, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.If this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.Do you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.I'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES.			"

Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES.			"

												A Simcity clone that surpassed the original. Well at least the Simcity 2013 version. Everything Simcity did wrong in the last iteration this game fixes and improves upon. Larger maps, better transport systems, ability to create districts with different policies and a game that supports modding from day one.If there's anything wrong i have to say about it it's that the game lacks enough buildings variety and the modular design of the buildings from the newer Simcity its the only thing that game did right and would have been good here as well. That's more of a minor complaint since modding or future dlc will no doubt improve that.My impression of it is very good so far and to be honest even a decent city builder these days is enough if you want to play one since there's not much competition out there for it. Buy it!			"

												This is the city simulator I have been waiting for since Simcity 4, and it has delivered. There are too many good things to say about this game, so I will focus on the -very few- negatives that I've encountered.  I think it it is too forgiving on traffic issues, it could use more building variety, and I think it could use an ""in-game"" terraforming option.I have high hopes for this game being the best city sim ever, especially with day one modding support, and future patches and DLC.

												*Those with Performance Issues*You need to check which graphics card your computer is using when playing Cities: Skylines.  Beforehand, I could only run the game at absolute lowest settings, windowed mode, and a lowered resolution and it was still low fps, which really bummed me out.  I have my computer set to use my Nvidia graphics card (760M) on everything, but for some reason this game was set to use the intel one instead.  All you need to do is set the .exe file to use your high performance card instead. Now I can run the game at max settings flawlessly.  Excellent Game so far!			"

While it was sad to see the end of Maxis, I can't help but feel Cities: Skylines is a great start to what a franchise that could very well take ownership of the premier city building franchise. Currently playing this on my second monitor, checking in and out of the game - a great work/play companion.			"

												Really love this game. It's what Sim City 2013 should have been. Plenty of teething problems that need patching though. Poor multi-lane traffic behaviour for one. Vehicles tend not to pass eachother and clump up when merging regardless of the number of lanes. Highway ramps are waay too good. They are one direction, single lane but vehicles go full highway speed on them, regardless of what you're joining to, making them a panacea for traffic troubles. Jam at a junction? throw down some ramps! kinda fun though.Sweet water physics in this game but don't bother building a hydro dam. The resevoir becomes static and you get no energy out after a while, at which point you may as well mercilessly delete it and wipe out your newly zoned industrial district because what the hell you made a save point just before. Also the flood plains don't become any more fertile, and space is plentiful in this game, so what's the point? Huge tankers can (as is a rule in city-sims) turn on a dime at 180 degrees a second in shallow waters, but harbors still need to be placed in direct line of sight to sea... what? Why can't they navigate a simple estuary? Helmsman is wasted potential.I had a major problem with garbage. You can't simply remove dumps without emptying them first. When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing genius.)Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement ""SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles"" - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own. Buy this if you like reading awfully hash-tagged tweets from your citizens. #familyvalues #economicboom #iamso♥♥♥♥ingbasic #education #gogreen #noticememayor-senpai.			"

												A fantastic citybuilder, my favourite since SimCity 4.Since the most likely points of comparison here are SimCity 2015 and Cities XL, I'll break it down into quick points:Compared to SimCity 2015:-Game's fully offline. The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop.-Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff.-Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km).-Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense.-Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes).-No building upgrade.-Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses.-Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation.-Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic.-Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.Compared to Cities XL-Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without).-Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads.-No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks.-Graphics are somewhat similar.-Interface is far more user-friendly.-Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting.-Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods).-So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.Overall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).Modding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.Some of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved.			"

Great user interface (very intuitive)4. The core game engine seems really solid in how every person has logic and can be named/followed/etc.Cons1. 30$ was expensive, but still worth it2. No night-time mode3. No multiplayer, which may have made it the end-all city builderThis is an easy decision if you like city builders, IMO. Well worth the money. Also check out Banishsed.			"

												If you're a fan of cities simulator, you've just found the perfect game for you, buddy. Congratulations.This game managed to overcome Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4 combined, two of my favourite city manager simulators ever. In Cities: Skylines you'll start building your city from just an intersection coming out of a highway in the middle of nowhere, manage your budget, expand, make some decisions (not enough cash, do I build a fire station or a hospital?), expand even more, watch as your small poor village in the middle of nowhere becomes a gigantic metropolis that people from all around the world come to visit.All in all, Cities: Skylines managed to be everything SimCity's reboot failed to be. The only con I have with this game is that it somehow lacks introduction, there are small tips here and there, but the complicated parts you have to discover pretty much by yourself (or search for tutorials on Youtube, lol).Now excuse me while I lose some more hours of sleep expanding my city. ):			"

												It really was a fun game, but it quickely devolved in to a shallow, unchallenging experience.Once you learn the tricks on how to organize your city it becomes pretty easy. The basic core is you have to manage the demands of your city while building new infrustructure. Sounds fun, except it really comes down to 3 demands: Housing, Industry, and Commercial. If the demand for housing goes up? Build a road and zone it for houses. How about Industry and Commercial? Do the same thing.Sure, there are other things like resource management where you actually have to have the power, water/sewage, and other civil services. But a few hours in to my game I guess I found a sweet spot between growth and taxes because my cash flow exploded in to the millions before I even realized it happened. I could put hospitals and police on every street corner.My city had become somewhat of a paradise, and it felt too easy.			"

 Cities:Skylines by Colossal Order A beutiful and addicting game that I probably will spend hours on end playing. If you like games like Civ 5 or Democracy 3, you will probably love this as well! So here are the pro's and cons: Good: - No EA (meaning no microtransactions. Oops, looks like you have to pay £0,99 to read on!)- Graphics- Simulation- Gameplay- Map editor- European maps- The ablility to rename EVERY single car and house, and it stays that way. You can also rename dogs, so I did. I called it dogmeat (Fallout-fans, please, contain your örgasms. I had to write örgasm for Steam to not censor it. And it sounds pretty damn funny.)-And now, contrary to popular beliefs; the Chirper (it isn't that bad if you click the ""don't open the messages automatically. It can actually help you a lot. Also, it's kinda cute).- The feeling that it's alive- Almost everything else The Meh - Hot-dog trucks - Building variation isn't too great.- Not that many monuments... The Bad - Map editor water tool. Uncontrollable and just spreads everywere. Also no undo button for this (10/10 would have to make a new map 3 times).- The #use of #haschtags in #all the #tweets. @developers, please #reduce the amount of #haschtags thank #you #yoloswag.- No special districts for office zones (marketing, software, entrepreneurship etc.)- No actual Hadron colliders.- You not having it in your Steam libraryMy score  10/10 My necessary silly review quote: I renamed a guys car to ""The Hippie Van"" and watched his house burn down, probably because I doused his kitchen in gasoline. I then threw the remains in the landfill. Then I played Cities Skylines and it was fun.  (EDIT) This game has made me realise why the world looks like it does today. I neglected worries about polution, noise and health, focused only on making the city as big as possible. When I realised I became legitimately scared. No other game has made me get such a enlightenment, it truly terrifies me. GG world.			"

Instant Classic - 10/10When Cities: Skylines was announced last year I was super-hyped as it was from my favourite developer, Colosal Order, famous for Cities in Motion 1 & 2.  Furthermore, the sheer fact that it was a city builder and being aware how good Cities in Motion 2 was (350+ hrs I've put into it...) I was extremely excited but I guess you could say I was a bit aprehensive too.That apprehension is long gone.  This game is an instant classic, on par with the likes of SimCity 4.  Let me tell you why;Built to be moddable, at the time of writing (72hrs post release), there has been a staggering 6000 submissions to the Steam Workshop with some fairly advanced mods, it's not just the cosmetics.No more towns- up to 1,000,000 people can be simulated.  They all have their own homes, workpalces and families.  No more GlasBox nonsense from EA here, this is the real thing.Extremely accessible, with more advanced and micro-management available but slightly hidden away so that it's not intimidatingDid I mention this was made by just 19 people?There are obviously some minor hiccups here, nowhere near as bad as SimCity and no DRM or online nonsense either.  Day/Night cycles are gone and so are tunnels but the latter has already been planned as the first FREE DLC for Cities: Skylines.  Also, seeing as CO are a small team, the mod community are working tirelessly to work on the superb foundation CO have set for us - the vanila expereince is amazing but the sheer flexibility and moddability of this game will see this title have a life cycle similar to that of Sim City.  I can't wait to see what's next.Don't delay, you are getting unbelieveable value for money here for one of the best games in years to enter the genre.			"

												Been looking forward to this games release for a while and after having the chance to play it for a while, i am -generaly- satisfied. I am happy to reccomend this game, as it goes back to the roots of proper city building we know from the early days of sim city and beyond. However! There are a few issues, which i am willing to pinn to the fact it's fresh out, though a few of those really should have been adressed prior to release.- No autosave! > Really? Game like this? With no autosave? I've already lost hours of gameplay because of game crashes.- Emergency services being ignored by other traffic reguardless of road type. > What do they have them sirens for then, if they stop at traffic lights anyway? Enough said.- No terrain mod tools available in game. > I would have expected these to be in, other then the map mod tool, they should be available while playing, payed for, certainly, but you should be able to buy some dirt and shove it along the shoreline to make a proper dam, or flatten that big mountain in the middle of your city.- Inability to modify the base maps. > if we can't have tools in game, why can't we open the default maps in the terrain modifier?- Water. > Don't get me wrong, love the water physics, though it does seem a little sluggish in places and crazy in others, bit hard to predict at times.These are the few issues i've noticed thus far in my 10 hours of gameplay, more might come up, but overall i am happy, just really, really missing the autosave and really really baffled by the emergency services.Rock on Paradox!

												In a world filled with overpriced AAA titles and wallet-destoying DLC pricing -- Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have really outdone themselves with Cities:Skylines. Half the price of a AAA title with more polish, functionality, and fun than any city-builder released in the last twenty years. The modding community is insane, and if there's anything you want to add to the game, rest assured that there's a mod for that. Pick it up, you won't regret it!			"

												Bringing in brand new elements in a brilliant way, this game isn’t just a SimCity that works, but a brand new and much better City Builder that you’ll be playing for hours. This game arrives in a strange period I’m calling the SimDrought (not a real game), with no one quite sure of how the genre is meant to progress. They took the risky move of making a game in a rough climate and pulled through making everyone realise there’s still a place in this world for City Simulation games, and they’re better than ever.Check out my full review here![www.idiotbox.co.uk] "

												No demand to be online, no crashing on day one, an unbelievable amount of fun as well as useful mods on day one. What is not to like?The bad - No auto save (but a mod seem to be out that fixes that). Lack of direction to some extent and info details that might have made the game more fun. After a point money becomes no issue and instead of being limited by money I am limited by growth, but might just be me.The good - It is an actual city building sim that is actually good. I am having a blast seeing my city grow, seeing me expand my borders as I can afford new land. Fun with new buildings being unlocked. You can name just about anything and any one and follow em/it around. This is a great great city game.Consider me ready to throw money at any deserving expansion, sequal or DLC to support more of this goodness!			"

 Yes it is the game you have waited for! I’ve watched Streamers for around twenty hours before picking this game up and after sinking a few hours into Cities: Skylines I can say this is a wonderful realisation of how a city builder can be done.The attention to detail is fantastic from its easy and slick UI to the ability to stalk and name anyone you choose. They have made the game wonderfully accessible and deceptively deep if you love the micromanagement side. I won’t list what this game does right and what others fail to do as others already have, all I will say is this game is well worth your time. Side note It amazes me how a small team of six (I believe fourteen now) can make this wonderful gem of a game that will no doubt become the next pillar for city builders meanwhile at EA and Maxis they mess up so badly. Regardless of the pedigree, cash and talent they had backing it. Fantastic job Colossal Order and more power to you.			"

What simcity should of been when it came out but this is like the new simcity.The only bad thing to say about this game is it could have had better optimization though it runs low FPS cause its only requiring around 50% of my Asus GTX 780 TI overclocked when it could be using 99% and be runing around 100fps. Graphics could of been better though!			"

												There’s a lot of tools and a lot to learn. Across the bottom of the screen is a toolbar that contains all the stuff you need to create your city. Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.Features like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.There’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.All this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.The only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game. Once the learning curve and introduction of tools is done with there are very little objectives to give you direction. THE GOOD- Cities offer room for expansion- Beautifully detailed miniature village style looks- introduction and learning curve- Great tool designedTHE BAD- Lack of objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												This GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!! WORTH THE TIME SPENT IN GAME!Pros: this game has so many pros that its hard to start  id say the pricing is about right for a new game could it be cheaper? yes but its fair (talking about deluxe and regular) i preorderd the game (deluxe) and i am very happy that i did so the preorder bonus is nice and the deluxe is nice to having the national monuments etc.... (of course now that the game has launched (per say) you wont get the preorder bonus but dont worry it was a fair bonus cool for those that did preorder but not to lame for the people who didnt get it)the extra stuff from dlx (i have yet to experience but i hope will be good!! extra stuff-----> Originally posted by desc: Original Soundtrack: This Original Soundtrack includes 14 unique tracks mixed from the ambient music of the game, allowing you to enjoy the wonderful music whenever you want. Digital Art book: See the concepts behind the buildings! The book features almost a 32 hand drawn concepts of the game various buildings and the story behind each.some of the other final great things about this game is that  WORK SHOPalot of games have workshop for/on steam now but i didnt expect this game to AND IT DOES!the workshop for this game consists of mods (remove the tweety bird sound  or things like that) maps (with a height map editor people are able to make maps very cool! I:e  U.S cittys Europe etc) asset mods (at least i think thats the name well any ways these mods change/add new buildings like a large                elementary school. probably the last good thing about this game is that according to a twitch streamer there is/will be free dlc like tunnels Cons: there are VERY FEW PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME beleive it or notthe one major issue for me is the GOD DAMN TRAFFIC when your city gets to about 5,000 population ish traffic becomes a really big problem and instead of expanding or adding things to your city you spend time fixing your roads so if there were to be another name for this game it would be traffic simulator 2015 but the game is better to deserve such a demeaning tittle!!!C_O_N_C_L_U_S_I_O_Nthis game is worth the moneyworth the timeand highly reccomended.

												I definitely recommend this game.  I’m a long time Simcity fan going back to the middle school's computer lab playing Sim City 2000 in the year 1999 on a bright and beautiful iMac.  I even remember the teacher showing kids how to play the game.  What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?This game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered.  Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.This game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played.  Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems.  The economics are just a lot easier.  I actually think this is more realistic.  I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot.  Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of what to do.  Same goes for crime, education, and especially water, or even pollution.  City skylines emulates this, money isn’t a big problem, but planning and management is the heart of the challenge.  ProsGreat aesthetics.  Night time is absolutely beautiful. The city looks great.So many options as far as roads, zoning, utilities, really fun variety.I like the easy economics which let you just focus on city building.Steam workshop and lots of mods.The size of the maps is amazing.  As your city grows you will unlock more and more land, faster than you could fill it.  It really puts Simcity franchise to shame.ConsIt's going to push your system a little bit, but luckily frame rate isn't super important in this genre.The mass transit bus/train stop system with routes feels a little clunky and odd to me.

												Absolutely phenomenal. The best City Builder I've played since Sim City 4. Has clearly learned from other city builder games with so many tools to fine tune construction in your city. My main complaint is the numbers/statistics are insane! 600 people dying a day out of a population of 56000?! So many bodies that 10 graveyards and 12 crematoriums can't keep up?! Jesus, just burn them in the streets man!

												This game started off awsome, complete  with the whole new car smell - so to speak. I was sooo happy that it felt like simcity 4 but with a fully 3d integrated world and a fully rotational camera. Then as I continued to play I became overwhelmingly unimpressed with how ""unfinished"" the game was.The game has very limited ""Parks & Rec."" places to plop down and make people feel happy about where they live. You also cant ""Free place"" parks and a lot of buildings either as they are required to snap to a road... So if you find yourself in the alto familiar (atleast for me) situation where as your city grows some areas just dont fully integrate and create pockets of unbildable area, and so you decide you want to make a park or ""Pretty"" area in that awkward area - well you cant. You have to have a road running in there as you cant just make it a spruced up area... even if you dont care that it people cant useit because you just want the area to look better to you... you still cant do it without a road. The game also has limited utilities and services available and instead relies on the modding community to make up the difference in how little is actually available for what you pay for the game... If you can pick this game up for under $10 bucks its worth a buy to tinker with - Anything above that and you will likely be disapointed in this game due to how little you are getting for what you pay for. You will then have to turn to the modding commnity to get key portions of the game patched over with much needed features that should have been included.			"

												I've just started, but since this just came out I want to help the guys and girls still on the fence.   It reminds me Sim City 4, but with modern improvements! It is easy to play, and the game explains the core concepts as you go.  This is the city builder that we have been waiting for. Click Add to cart, now.  Before I describe the game, I have had absolutely no choppiness and I have the game maxed out.  If you have a quality PC you should have no issues running this game.You have 9 different maps to choose from.  There is no random map option, but there is an editor included that you can create your own maps or download maps from other players. So, you will always have new maps to play on.The game has a few interesting subsystems that work together.  The more educated your citizens are, the less trash they will produce.  Poorer the neighborhood will lead to more crime.  You have to keep your pollution levels down or you could risk tainting the drinking water of your citizens.There are multiple road options to allow you to truly customize the shape and direction of your town.Do you want to build a eco friendly paradise or do you want to build the biggest city that you can? The game gives you the tools for you to decide. Also, with the editors available there should be plenty of options coming from other players.For the old timers who remember Sim City on the SNES (I know it was PC first, but back then a SNES was a few hundred dollars and PC's were $2,000 easy) for everytime you reach a population milestone you level up your ability to add items to your city.

A prime example of the benefits of PC gamingCities: Skylines is what happens when you develop a game without consoles in mind. ✓ Fun and addictingHear me out: I've always avoided city building games like the plague because I thought they weren't my cup of tea. The free weekend came along and I thought ""why not?""... look at my hours now.✓ 100% moddableSpecific buildings of all types, colors and flavors, intersections, maps, different lighting settings, gameplay-altering mods... just about anything can be found in the workshop. Be warned though: using mods disables achievements.✓ Fair learning curveYou might think a game like this is too complicated, but the truth is... it's not. Cities: Skylines is as complicated as you make it. Sure, if you're a beginner (like me), your first cities will fail, but that's exactly what makes this game so replayable: you learn by failing, and it's fun as hell.✓ Endless possibilities and replayabilityRural town? Metropolis? European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town? The only limit is your imagination[gfycat.com]✗ No season passAs of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think ""how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay"". Well, look at Train Simulator. Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience? I'm not saying Paradox will take the same route, but they could, and you should be wary.VerdictCities: Skylines has quickly turned into one of my favorite games. I've always liked scale models[www.archivisionmodels.com]. This game is like having your own, but alive. I thoroughly recommend it.			"

												I bought this game yesterday. 24 hours ago. I already spent 11 hours in the game. That's about 46%. This game is more addictive then crack. Do buy, you'll not be dissapointed! As for some actual information:- Cool customisation tools for making parks, and completely inefficient roundabouts.- Great modding community (I haven't touched a mod yet, but I heard from a friend that his game takes 15 minutes to load due to the amount of mods he has installed, so there's a great amount of mod options to choose from)- ""Zoning"" tool for easy city building- Unlike other Paradox Interactive games, this game has a fairly simple UI. As a result Cities: Skylines should be pretty easy to get into. (Like those 11 hours I spent on this game already... I'm so going to regret not doing something productive. But hey, who cares right?)- As far as I can tell, the developer is active in making some great updates for the game, as well as listening to feedback from the community. To summarize, it's all good things really. I haven't come across any things that I don't like in this game, aside from some nit pick's (For example, once you really get your city going and you have some big roads laid down, it can get pretty hard to find the sources of problems, and therefore resolve earlier mentioned issues.). I strongly recommend that you get this game, if you have some free time to kill and 30 bucks to spare. "

												This is what Simcity (2013) wanted to be, and more.  It had a nice solid launch with few bugs, and instant mod support.  The game is loads of fun, though demand seems to drop suddenly and not rise for long periods.

												9 times bigger than Sim City and a third the price (on launch.) Cities Skylines is great fun, and far less frustrating to play as well.So far I'm loving how innovative and creative you can be with roads, creating small walking paths right up to super complex highway systems, and it all works perfectly. The game is fairly easy so far, and I've expanded my city fast, but it's still only about an eighth it's full potential size.Some things are missing. No modular buildings, no day/night cycle, and the graphics are *slightly* less impressive than Sim City. But with the amount of mod support, I imagine any and all issues can and will be overcome very quickly. I recommend this for anyone who loves city sims, and may have been disappointed by Sim City.

As for some actual information:- Cool customisation tools for making parks, and completely inefficient roundabouts.- Great modding community (I haven't touched a mod yet, but I heard from a friend that his game takes 15 minutes to load due to the amount of mods he has installed, so there's a great amount of mod options to choose from)- ""Zoning"" tool for easy city building- Unlike other Paradox Interactive games, this game has a fairly simple UI. As a result Cities: Skylines should be pretty easy to get into. (Like those 11 hours I spent on this game already... I'm so going to regret not doing something productive. But hey, who cares right?)- As far as I can tell, the developer is active in making some great updates for the game, as well as listening to feedback from the community. To summarize, it's all good things really. I haven't come across any things that I don't like in this game, aside from some nit pick's (For example, once you really get your city going and you have some big roads laid down, it can get pretty hard to find the sources of problems, and therefore resolve earlier mentioned issues.). I strongly recommend that you get this game, if you have some free time to kill and 30 bucks to spare. "

												A great city-builder, this game takes all the best city-building game mechanics and puts them together in a well-balanced package.  The UI is a little obtuse in some areas, and not all of the important information is clearly conveyed, but you can get used to it.  Traffic is a big part of the game, and the quality of your road layouts will make or break your city.  Fortunately, the AI is very adept at pathfinding through your streets, and problem locations can easily identified by the traffic jams.  The economy is very easy and forgiving, so you can mostly just focus the fun part of designing and not have to worry much about micromanaging your economy.  Everything SimCity (2015) did wrong, this game did right.			"

												I LOVE this game. It's everything Simcity looked like it should have been. The entire city you manage is persistant and constantly evolving, meaning- people live, work, and commute to the same places in the same vehicle every day (you can click on cars and see who owns them!). and even eventually have familes and die. The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want, with the ability to create districts which allow you to set individual laws and regulations, turning industrial zones into farming areas with low taxes, residential into luxury apartments with high taxes, or specialized industy areas to gather resources like oil, coal, and wood (yes, forestry is a thing in this). Not to mention, EVERYTHING is renamable; Districts, people, and buildings.And buildings. You can't forget about the fact that you can MAKE and SHARE buildings, parks, and even maps with powerful, but easy to use in game asset editors. Its easy to go to the workshop, grab some maps, buildings, or lots you like and add them to your game!Placement of buildings is also important. A lot of buildings will create polution- but not just the regular type you would expect like smog and soil polution- many buildings will also create noise polution, and make people living near them very upset.It's like they took all the best features from the -old- simcity games (water pipes and power lines YAY!), re-engineered them, put their own twist on some things, and made a beautiful game out of it. Incredibly happy with this purchase, especially considering the wonderfully reasonable price. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!? BUY IT. :D			"

												This is a strange game. It effectivelly is just a moddable Sim City. It does not try to be anything else then Sim City. The game it's self you'll most likely find very easy if your a big Sim City player (other then dealing with traffic which is the core of large city developement) .I played it to the point where there was nothing new to build and the game became a balance of just building more. It's okay. It fills the niche that Sim City dropped the ball on, but nothing more. If your looking for a Sim City type game to get abosrbed in, sure this is a game for you, but that's it.			"

												Finally, a perfect blend of two classic genres: urban planning and traffic management. Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic ""take that"" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.Compared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your♥♥♥♥♥without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.Personally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number. And yes, you can mod that in-game too, for free.			"

No always-online requirement, no tiny city plots with vast tracts of empty land in between, no desync between cities and no 'this sim wakes up in this house, but goes to whatever empty house is closest to work when his day is done'. This game, it's developer and its publisher takes gamers and their wishes seriously. You want a game that's challenging, fun to play, beautiful to look at and has amazing replay value?

												Excellent!. Ive extensively played every single Simcity that came out with at least 100 hours on each title. Up to 400 on SC2000 and about the same on SC4, except SC2013 which was, after playing 4 hours, so worthless that i ditched it.I have been playing quite alot now, mainly working on 1 city and changing/altering it and trying out new things inside it.It is a great city builder! It looks good, feels good and plays good. The interface is neat and intuitive.Some people whine about having to place electric cables and sewage/waterpipelines.... i love it! Finally its back, i have to build a network of pipelines and cables to make sure that electricity and water comes around properly. What SC2013 did was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you lay down roads and automatically there power and water? give me a break. The only thing i kinda miss is some more depth in the economics, those feel a bit flat and shallow. The districtpolicies-system tries to adjust that but gives only few options and isnt satisfying enough (for me).Colossal Order does a great job already at bugfixing and is actively involved and interested in making their game even better. This is their 3rd title and also their biggest. A title that they claim is something theyve always dreamt of making so the support from them is expected to be big, especially with over 500.000 copies sold so far and rising.Other than that, this game comes right next to SC4 and thus becomes its only true heir. Job very well done by Colossal Order and Paradox.A must-have for any city-building afficionado, its pricing is excellent. Its alot of game for a very good price. (games should never cost more than 30,- euros in my opinion)I absolutely recommend this game			"

												Was a bit disapointed when they left Cim & Cim 2 pretty quick in a dark corner. But somehow ik get the feeling that they needed to give there full potiental into a full City builder instead of some transport management game.BUT >> They did make it right in a lot of ways ... on the first look you see a mix of cities XL and SimCity 2013 but when you start exploring and playing the game you get a total different feel !!This is actually the game that we would accept from EA in the form of SimCity if it was made like this game was made. But EA and SimCity Failed then and Cities XL and XXL are complete Feelingless games and runs even crap on a Monster of a PC.ssThis game has almost everything just right, Not to heavy on the Grafics but still looks Great, Good code writing and you can make BIG♥♥♥♥♥Cities and even than it still runs Great! Since a long time i realy get a good city building feeling and the indus districts and they different layouts and products are really good and working ideas. Traffic system is pretty advanced, Water is very smart and lovely to see it moves especialy when playing with Dams. With the Mod support and asset tools ingame from day 1 makes it even better !!! Guys and Girls ... If you cried the day that you played SimCity 2013 and lost your hope of any good City Builder game.. Cities: Skylines just Renewed that hope and fullfilled a great part for me. I am going to have a lot of fun with this game :-)Pros:> No EA, No Online DRM ( Steam only \o/ )> Delivered a non Broke game on day 1> Big♥♥♥♥♥Cities (even bigger with Mod)> Good City Builder Feeling> Mods on day 1Cons:> Day/Night cycle			"

												Excellent!. Ive extensively played every single Simcity that came out with at least 100 hours on each title. Up to 400 on SC2000 and about the same on SC4, except SC2013 which was, after playing 4 hours, so worthless that i ditched it.I have been playing quite alot now, mainly working on 1 city and changing/altering it and trying out new things inside it.It is a great city builder! It looks good, feels good and plays good. The interface is neat and intuitive.Some people whine about having to place electric cables and sewage/waterpipelines.... i love it! Finally its back, i have to build a network of pipelines and cables to make sure that electricity and water comes around properly. What SC2013 did was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you lay down roads and automatically there power and water? give me a break. The only thing i kinda miss is some more depth in the economics, those feel a bit flat and shallow. The districtpolicies-system tries to adjust that but gives only few options and isnt satisfying enough (for me).Colossal Order does a great job already at bugfixing and is actively involved and interested in making their game even better. This is their 3rd title and also their biggest. A title that they claim is something theyve always dreamt of making so the support from them is expected to be big, especially with over 500.000 copies sold so far and rising.Other than that, this game comes right next to SC4 and thus becomes its only true heir. Job very well done by Colossal Order and Paradox.A must-have for any city-building afficionado, its pricing is excellent. Its alot of game for a very good price. (games should never cost more than 30,- euros in my opinion)I absolutely recommend this game			"

Cities Skylines offers players a large area to craft and create their very own sprawling metropolis, or prosperous back country farm town. The game looks beautiful, and it is so interesting to watch the people and traffic go about their business down on the ground. The gameplay is fantastic and there are some interesting things that this game brings to the table that other games do not. I highly recommend this game to anyone, it is a must play for all. I cannot wait to get back and see what more Cities Skylines has to offer!			"

												I keep calling this game SimCity inadvertently.  No, not in reference to the misfire from 2013.  Instead this game brings me back to the kind of fun I had playing the SimCity games of the past.Five days in after buying the game and I'm st ill building my first city.  After spending 18 hours (eep) I've expanded its borders as far as it will go, I've built a couple of the big unlockables, and I see no reason to stop with this city for now.There are issues with the game but it's phenominally good fun, intuitive, pretty good looking (even if not as polished as SimCity '13) and most important of all: there are no gamebreaking issues.  This is the best citybuilder in over a decade, and it continues the genre in fine tradition.Back to the issues...It could use more anti aliasing and the tilt-shift effect isn't as good as SimCity '13s.  These are minor quibbles.Road traffic doesn't seem to effectively use all lanes but once you learn some tricks to laying out your roads you can mitigate some of the traffic issues.  In this regard it's still better than SimCity '13.Rail traffic seems to be the wonkiest thing I've encountered.  Trains keep getting jammed up and stopping without any clear indication of where they're trying to go.  I may have made mistakes in laying out the tracks and stations so I'm still trying to figure out if this is something I've caused but something just feels off.Dealing with dead bodies and trash takes some getting used to, traffic can hold up their removal (and police, ambulances and firetrucks).  Abandoned buildings are also a bit of a nuisance because you are encouraged to bulldoze them, but they also seem to take care of themselves if there's demand for growth (they'll get torn down and rebuilt automatically).  That said leaving them up if there's not demand reduces the happiness/land value of the immediate area so bulldozing is a good idea unless they turn around quickly.TLDR: This game is $30, awesome fun, works great, active and extensive modding community.  BUY IT!			"

												If you played and enjoyed SimCity but you are looking for a new game because SimCity repeats itself? Cities: Skylines is the game you are looking for. If this will be your first time in city-builder game, graphics and mechanics are way above than others. Dev team and community relationship is just awesome how it should to be for all games. Cities: Skylines is the city builder game everyone was expecting and deserved. It is a must-buy. Best bonus? Workshop!But yes, you will have traffic problem here, too.			"

												This is what SimCity should be. It's a brilliant little simulator that runs pretty well on most systems, it has an INSANE modding community and the devs care about the game and patch it regurlally. It smashes SimCity out of the water with the features it includes. My only complaint was that it featured no day/night cycle, but they have fixed that with the first DLC. Overall I think this is the best City Builder since SimCity 4 and it's well worth getting			"

												Cities Skylines is a marvel of City Building. (Who knew a Game could build better then real life engineers? (SORRY GUYS!))This game takes the best of every City Builder, and turns it into a simple $30.00 worth of perfection.It's hell fun to play... and of course flooding your city with a Dam, or running your sewage directly into your water, is fun if you DO get bored with the hours and hours of fun this game presents.Build your city... Live your city... Or... Destroy your city. May the Odds be forever in your favor! >:D			"

												I must say, I am really enjoying the game. However, there are a few things I would like to mention.I have encountered a bug where dead people are not being picked up and taken to a grave or crematorium, just left where they are, even if said facilities are nearby.It would be nice if you could make it so you can fit small paths between houses so you don't have to destroy them. Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so. Well done on the great game!			"

Perfect Example of City Building Simulator- The experience of building your city from essentially the ground up is a addicting and rewarding experience, however it can also be a brutal one depending on what problems crop up when you are building your city.- The animations are very good, especially when the buildings are being built. There is immediate satisfaction when buildings start to be built in the zones that you assign.- The ability to assign any area you want as a district and make it follow the unique policies that you set can be fun.- This game also brings a challenge as you ave to figure out how to make the traffic flow without any major traffic jams.It is definitely worth getting and especially if you got SimCity and was disappointed in the result of that game.

												Cities: Skylines is simply said a better Version of SimsCity. It's connected to the Steam Workshop, that means the creativity  is endless, you can install many many user generated content, so much that your game will explode. It's still worked on but i miss the updates. There's only one thing that I find very annoying: The Day-Night Cycle. The roads are every time full as hell and the Day is over before the cars have even reached the City from the highway. If that is fixed in a later version i would be completetely happy with Cities:Skylines.			"

 In short, the best game in its genre to date. BUY IT!  There's no way an ordinary schmuck is going to write a review to top Mayor Todd's, so, instead of the usual review that compares this game directly to similar games, here is a list of some fun things you can do in this game: 1) Play offline, with a smooth framerate and a sensible interface2) Build beautiful, sprawling 3D cities (rather than 2D grids or absurdist skyscraper hamlets), and view them with a few different color palettes3) Get Steam achievements4) Follow individual cars, trucks, buses, trains, and airplanes from realistic origin point to realistic destination 5) Micromanage public transportation, as in OpenTTD (which is free, btw.)6) Build or download  awesome highway interchanges, with ramps, bridges, and tunnels (like the double-paperclip interchange)7) Watch as trucks pile up in one lane of a six-lane road, causing fury and hair-tearing on your part(this is one of the few cons)8) Build ultra-modernist, utopian phalansteries that would make Le Corbusier proud9) Build facsimiles of older, Southern European cities (using ""European-style"" maps)10) Join the urban farming movement, only to watch your semi-realistic gravel roads get clogged with absurd numbers of tractors11) Cause disease due to sewage contamination, floods that disable buildings, and floods of contaminated sewage that causes disease and disables buildings, thanks to improper water management (water physics in this game are somewhat believable)12) Build a surfeit of fire stations, incinerators, and crematoria (or watch your people suffer)13) Build  OP monuments that give massive amounts of electricity, universal (cheap) health care, universal (cheap) education, huge land value increases, and other crazy benefits, after torturing your city to meet arbitrary/sadistic production requirements (e.g., health care satisfaction under 20%)14) See a whole bunch of generic Scandinavian buildings and vehicles that kind of look like they came from a kid's train set15) Speaking of train sets, this game lets you set up digital dioramas involving trains and transportation, and view them with Simcity 2013-style tilt shift shader (don't worry, you can turn it off if you don't like it)16) Make your own maps and interchanges using the built-in tools (or decorate existing buildings)17) Rename people, houses, businesses, and districts (or, for that matter, abuse eminent domain) to get the perfect ""feel""18) Make your own hiking trails and place trees manually along them for aesthetics19) Build huge, attractive residential zones, only to find that, forty years later, all the people there get old and die, thus overburdening your deathcare system, which spreads disease, which causes more death, which causes economic collapse, which causes industries to fail, which causes commercial zones to whine about not having goods or customers, which causes power outages when you bulldoze the commercial zones, which cause all the remaining citizens to pack up and leave.20) Spend 100 hours straight building one city, and forget about your family, your school, your job, and your overheating graphics card (until the game crashes and you lose your city... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!) Here is a list of things you can do in this game with Workshop content and mods: 1) Play offline, sometimes with a choppier framerate2) Build even more beautiful cities, using EVEN MORE SPACE, and view them with a variety of different shader effects (such as ambient occlusion, edge detection à la Borderlands, ""godrays,"" and Dynamic Resolution)3) NOT get Steam achievements (unless you install another mod)4) Follow individual vehicles with a first-person view--and, for a greater challenge, reduce their speeds to make for realistic traffic congestion levels5) Micromanage public transportation a bit more (including dedicated bus roads, bypass passenger stations, public parking garages...)6) Build even better highway interchanges, with better lane controls (seriously, I've spent hours doing this)7) No mods to fix this one yet, though some help mitigate it8) Build post-modernist tract housing (à la suburban America), brutalist slums/housing projects, British row houses, and trailer parks (or ""caravan clubs,"" for you Brits out there)9) Build insane skyscrapers that tower unrealistically over pieds-a-terre and hipster-infested coffee shops, and then surround them with statues of evil hamsters and giant blobs of metal10) Make farms that kind of look like farms11) Cause tsunamis and massive floods12) This one's still a problem; why can't one or two crematoria be enough?!13) Build community-designed monuments that may, or may not, be overpowered14) Download tons of vehicles and growable buildings from the Workshop (from Coca-Cola trucks to Winnebago RV's to Fallout-esque shanties, complete with Nuka-Cola machines), and spice up your roads15) Did I mention that  realistic historical locomotives  are available on the Steam Workshop?16) Make buildings, mods, etc., and upload to Steam Workshop (for more adventurous types)17) Clone growable buildings to get the perfect aesthetic (believe me, this is cooler than it sounds)--or, better yet, place individual props yourself18) Make your own hiking trails, place trees with Tree Brush, and hike the aforementioned trails 19) Do that, but without the incessant Chirpy tweets of ""#movingout.""20) Spend 150 hours building your city; run into 65,536 object limit in game after getting to a population over 200,000... NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! ""Cannot place any more objects of this type.""Must... build... more... stuff... ""Cannot place any more objects of this type.""Must... build... more... stuff... TL;DR (99% of people say so after reading this review) BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!  "

												Cities: Skylines is without a doubt the best city builder/simulator to date. Just imagine all of the other city builders/simulators you've played now combine the best parts and you get this, plus more.What I liked:User Interface- All of the menus and tooltips are very polished and very legible. Extremely easy to use. Simple in overall design, it won't overwelm you.Great Population Simulation- The simulation is very percise especially when it comes to street traffic. It also exists litterally its not just numbers/math in the background. You can see and track whats occurring in the simulation, The combined functions of health, education, police, etc work extremely well and effect the population with the most realisism in the genre. Funding litterally affects performance by limiting say a hospitals actual resources less ambulances, less beds, less doctors has effects that you can really see in the whole simulation. Traffic effects the performance of all elements the use roads. As resources are litterally transported in vehicles and the longer it takes for them to get there stops functionailty of other systems. Well Balanced Population Needs- The creation and coverage of services/leisure correctly influence the land value and allow the population to upgrade its businesses and homes in a detailed and sensible fashion.Excellent Power and Water Grid Simulation- When not enough water/electricity is being generated the furtherest structures based on the distance of connections through other building and powerlines/pipes are the building effected by it. Meaning that the grid actually exists rather then just being production minus requirement.Procedural Appearance/Connections- There is no grid that strictly defines where structures and roads are built. Instead you can draw curved roads that have correct appearances. Building built on curves will connect visually to the nearby structures and roads accurately. Intersections and changes to road types merge well.Policies- you can have global policies and specific policies. You can mark your own custom areas for the specific policies. Many of the policies actually have useful effects that also are shown in the overall simulation.Information Views- Selecting a service in the menus or specifically activating the contextual informative view has a complete full 3-D and statistcal analysis that is easy to understand.Dynamic WeatherTerraforming- The tools for changing the ground itself are also easy to use and the terrain has a very detailed mesh so hills, etc look very smooth.Water Physics - The water bodies actually feature flowing water. Terraforming and Canals will manipulate water flow. You can flood your city. This is also import when it comes to building dams as water has a rate of flow based on the terrain its flowing through.City Specializations- Resources are fully simulated. As in they are not extracted for a single purpose/objective. Normal industry actually needs the materials to function. Industry will either import resources from outside of your city or get it from within your city. Resources can only be found in certain areas in the map or not at all. When you create industry zones over a resource they will need to be specilized using the policy zones. When you've picked say agriculture the industry zones will become farms. The farms performance depends on the quality of the area. The normal industry and commercial structures will use generated resources. If you produce more than your city needs the goods will be exported out of the city.Continuing Development- The game is being expanded upon through dlc paid content and some free patches. Getting seasons gameplay is a paid dlc while the canals and terraforming were added for free. The paid dlc adds seasons, new Night related simulations with new commercial options, and a new public transportation option. The free patches added; road conditions and servicing, dynamic weather, terraforming and canals, stadiums, custom themes and other specific buildings. Do remember if we want to see more in the game they can't do the work for free.Mod Support- Mods are fully supported allowing quite substantial changes. Some could be considered cheating, but for the most part many of them are graphical changes and upgrades. The most useful Mods that are not cheating are very helpful. Things like deeper traffic analysis and tracking, Manual road Intersection options, custom road speed limits, protractors for drawing roads, along with many others. Many of the things missing from the vanilla game can be found as mods as well as nicer graphics to change up the look of things.Things I disliked:Engine Bottleneck- Eventually you will have such a large city that the simulation will become to much to process. Observing the hardware however the engine is making full use of the processor.  Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by your processor bottlenecking if you don't have a good one, but eventually you will start losing performance regardless. Performance/Graphics- The graphics are okay, but when you start getting a lot of structures in your city. The graphics card usage gets unreasonably high for what you get. Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by when your graphics card bottlenecks. The default appearance of the game colour wise is very dull. Theme mods get you past this.Broken Tourism- After Dark has rendered tourism useless and even without After Dark seems to have very little useful functionality. This has been the case for quite a while now.Final Summary:The developers are releasing patches to optimize the engine along with new features. Optimization aside you will still find the game very playable. Even with broken tourism its still a lot better then the competitors in its current state. I'm sure you won't regret supporting the games further additions and fixes if you pick it up today.(I will remove or change the negatives if they are resolved)			"

												I know that this game has got a lot of love in terms of mod content. If I talk about negative points in this game or positive ones they can be fixed or enhanced with mods. If you do buy the game you should try them out. I love how the game provides you the freedom to do whatever you want. You need water,sewage power and roads and from that point you can start building districts and creating your own city without any restrictions. If you don't consider slope a restriction, it shouldn't be considered as one because you can terraform. I noticed while building my cities that I still didn't use all the buildings that are available in this game that's because there are so many options. The transport options in this game are also pretty elaborated. You can build airports, trainstations, harbors, tramstations and busstations. The game also provides a good dose of challenge if you are willing to expand your city a lot. Starting from 60000 population, which is a truck load of people and can't be done in a day, you unlock monuments. For each of these monuments you have to complete challenges to unlock the building itself. Some of these challenges really require you to screw up your city and survive, for example lower your taxes to 5 procent and survive for 5 years. If that isn't enough you have to get back to the point that you were at before the challenge and then save up around a million. If that isn't enough challenge I don't know what is to you.Although this a pretty good game there are some important downsides. Starting with traffic as the main issue. First off the highways leading to your city are way too small. It prevents you from fixing traffic without bulldozing as much of that highway as possible. They are very inefficient, if they were bigger they would be more useful. Another way how traffic clogs up is the bus system. In one city I made around 200 buslines, which is many but it was an experiment, half of my traffic was bus because each line had like 30-50 busses driving on it. I find it unrealistic and unnecessary to have that much busses on a line. I think setting a maximum to 10 per line, or even 5 per line, is definitly enough. Second we have the income system, not that it is something general it is more a visual issue to me than it may be to you. You see next to your money amount how much you earn per week but you gain money daily and I don't get why. It is way easier for the player to understand what is happening when it's either gaining money per week and seeing how much you earn per week than doing the two combined for some reason. Another thing I find unfortunate is the limitation. You start of with 1 plot of land and you can only expand 8 more plot, which is not a lot to me.Overall a good pickup to play once in a while with or without mods.			"

												In 2014 EA and Maxis tried to jump on the train again continue the huge success of SimCity 4 with their new game SimCity(2014) but didnt manage to please the community due to small maps, huge server issues on release date, online pressure and overpriced DLC's.This year things are going to change the city building genre entirely - Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order are publishing Cities: Skylines and get immediately hit scores on sales!The game offers a huge map, which was the most important point that a modern city building game should deliver with even more extended space through several mods from the Steam Workshop. Also the game itself looks nice and offers a good usability for players. The  interface looks nice and most things in the game are already balanced.But now to the greatest part about this game: It's going to get further developed with more content updates and even a chance on multiplayer mode which would mean that SimCity is going to be completely useless. With an growing community and even an subreddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines ) this game is a great start for game industrie into the new year 2015.			"

												Very relaxing game. Easy, satisfying and very pretty. I never sought beauty inside a city until now. Workshop items help you make anything from Victorian London to Coruscant. Very powerful features - first person view - individual doods simulation and generally a well made game. I'm struggling to find a conn here but here goes. The traffic. It takes waay too much time to sort out properly. It's not even challenging it's just not in the tempo of the game. For every 20 minutes you spend building a part of your city, you then must spend 40 min to sort all the little traffic indicator thingies to be green (green is good). It's just something that we could do without but then the game would truly be very easy.			"

This game delivers and pretty much marks the return to the decent city-building genre, you know: the type that's actually fun to play and doesn't suck.Calling it ""just a SimCity clone"" would be extremely unfair to Cities: Skylines.If it isn't clear enough, let me make it clearer: B!tch please, this game IS now the reference, not the other way around!Goodbye SimCity, hello Cities: Skylines. :)			"

												this review is gonna be in 2 parts ( the game itself and comparing it to other City builders games)PART 1:  the game itself.Cities Skyline is a City builder game,  it runs smoothly  on  most machines but not on older ones or laptops , it requires allot of power to run. the game only have 1 mode which is build your own city.  u manage the needs of the citizens from electricity education and other services.  until you build a city big enough to expand and manage the traffics ...etcthe Price tag is acceptable for what the game offers. if u are new to these type of games its a good entire point. the end game is lack luster though but if u reached that level u alreay have inversted 40-60 hours inOverall its worth while. so I recommend it as it's the best city builder game available on steam.--------------PART 2 : Comparison to other city builder games. 1- SimCity5 (2013)the game UI is very similar which is nice, cause u don't need to relearn stuff from scratch . the game graphics in cities skyline is kinda better. but almost similar to Simcity.cities skylines have very Huge building area compared to simCity Which has some major Pros  and cons at the same time.what simcity was aiming at when they did give u small areas is to give the players more challenge on how to manage their city as u cannot build everything in one city thus increasing the replayablily  of the game. where in cities skylines u only need to build 1 city and manage it. there are no neighboring cities to interact with.also in SimCity5 have online multiplayer mode. as u can play with your friends making the best use of your cities co-op to build a huge workplace the benefit the entire region.unlike cities skylines the end game is lackluster. I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.only real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]2- cities XL at first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game. Cities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.from my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series.

												The game is a decent mix of the best features of Simcity 4, Simcity 5 and Cities XL. For such a complex product just after release the amount of bugs is very low, and they are actually minor bugs. Simcity 5 features better graphics, but you'll be compensated for that by a good perfomance and an overall highly addictive game. The interface is good (with some minor flaws), and the economy is a bit too easy too handle. It's 9/10 and by far the best city building game there is. Worth every cent.			"

												I am so impressed this is a game that was done RIGHT.  The game is priced affordably, includes all the components that make a city builder work and none that dont (broken social networking).  It came out day one with steam mod support and embraces the community and its feedback.  This is the greatest city builder in years and perhaps in the last decade and was priced to make this a no brainer.  Don't hesitate and buy this game now!  10/10			"

												Tons of tools snd a great way to ease you into them. It really is the best and sadly only city building game for a long time. Wait is over and this is it. If you like Sim City you have a home with this Cities Skyline. This is not Cities XL/2012/Plat/XXl and has no relation to those broken games. Also $30. Like why are you reading this. Just press the Add to Cart button right there. Scroll the F back up.			"

												I've just only dipped my feet in this game and it has already proven to me to be the next recommended city builder. With the latest disappointment coming from titles like Cities XXL and SimCity (2013), Skyline gives the users a fresh and fun experience by handing them the many tools to create an amazing city of their own. As most people know, city builders are simple in concept when it comes to meeting the demands. However, city builders like Skyline focuses much more on the meta ranging from traffic management, water treatment and noise pollution.This game even comes in with built in steamworks and from what I've seen a pretty loose one with already +12k mods and assets to boom.The price is exceptional and the amount of hours you can spend on your city is plentiful. I would recommend for all city builder enthusiast and casual gamers alike.			"

												This game is very nicely put together, and I hope to continue to see the game grow and advance over time.The game RUNS PERFECTLY FINE on LINUX!However, to do so, there are a few things you must ensure before trying to play the game. 1. Have UPDATED video drivers. Nvidia 345+ is required. Lastest version of flgrx and intel video drivers are also REQUIRED.2. Ensure your audio system is updated (pulse, oss, etc).3. Ensure the following are fully updates: kernel, util-linux, sed, and coreutils.I am on Fedora 21 and the ONLY problem I ran into playing the game, was the loading screen would 'freeze' and sit there while game sounds played in the background upon loading a world. Clicking off-program fixed the screen, until you re-focused into the game and then it would show the frozen screen again. To fix this, DISABLE the steam in-game overlay, and run the game in borderless-window mode (on steam, use launch option -popupwindow, and set in-game display setting to windowed mode, relaunch client, problem fixed)Occasionally my sound driver would break and play very staticish sounds for the game, after a short time they would fix themselves. Updating coreutils and pulseaudio fixed this for me.Overall I was skeptical to try the game due to the overwhelming amount of negative reviews from Linux users due to performance and playability, I caved in and tried it anyway and was not dissapointed in the slightest. I am quite impressed with the game overall, and have not had any other major performance issues, I now have a 40k population city and still do not lag or have FPS drop, tho occasionally, you should save game and re-start client as it will get a tad laggy, but I experianced the same issue on Windows 7 aswell.System Specs: OS: Fedora 21 x64CPU: AMD FX 4300 x4 3.8gHzMB: ASRock 880GM-LE FXGPU: EVGA NVidia 650GTXRAM: 16GB non-ecc Corsair 1666HD: Hitatchi 6TB hard diskKernel version: 3.18.8-201NVidia Driver Version: 346.47			"

												Have played 20 hours and already made 3 cities so far. Retried it because of bad traffic, people complains dead body, no needs new commercial and dam was placed wrong.It is so hard to plan it at first game. Everytime i planned for the new city, it always turn to a bad idea and i have to be creative to solve many problem. It is like planning before working on new software project. Plan first, but need creativity at the end.So far :Pros :- Beautifull graphic, especially water simulation.- Too detail. I could see my ""sims"" walking around the town, so do the vehicles.- Nice feature (district, making power line, need pipe for sewer and water)- Easy for moding- Can create our own map!- The trafic flows perfectly- The budget is usefull in this gameCons :- There are some annoying bug (my pipe drain couldn't work although there is power. Need to replace it until it works)- The game pace is too fast. I could get new land at although my city is still small. - The price for buying new land is too cheap. How can new land is cheaper than my drain pipe.- Some traffic's flow is annoying. The decision for choosing side of road by driver is just for the direction for next intersection.- Stll lack of variety of model. Especially, when building is high level.So far it is great city builder game in market. You could design your own city freely. Tools of making road is userfriendly and the UI is so minimalize so you could get all information fast. And then, i played a lot of Paradox games and they give their sincere for their game, in which you will get e new expansion for every 2-4 month!My life is in danger now. I rather play this game than eat :( Luckily, i am in distance relationship, so there is no other bussiness which could hold me to play this game. THANK YOU CO! Paradox!			"

And now that After Dark came out...125/10 I'm making a new city again :DOn a serious note:I love the gameplay of C:S. The controls are smooth, the modding community is awesome (and I mean, it's up there with the Skyrim modding community for me, and that's really freakin high), it's the best City Builder that I've played, and I highly doubt anything can top it. Then CO/Paradox adds more to the game, and it just keeps getting better and better.Long Live City: Skylines!			"

												Being a player and user of many simulated games in my long time playing simulated city games, i found this one too be great. I love the atmosphere of it and the building in it. In my opinion, it is not too hard like i found some A-Train simulator games, but not too easy either, like city life simulators. It is right in the middle of difficulty. It might not be too friendly to new users who have never played a city simulator, it does have nice tips in the game to be helpful. Also, the modding community for this game seems very active and looks like it will be for a long time. Because of the pleasant atmopshere and how the game is adding things quite a bit, and the modders beautiful works for this game, i give it a very good positive review due to many of these facts. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do. Thanks for reading!			"

												Everything a city builder should be. Is it perfect? No. A city builder simulation will never be perfect. However, this is close to perfection. Knowing we will get flooded with new content, patches, mods and whatnot, this is Christmas for gamers addicted to city builders and simulation games. It was easy to learn, fun to plan, not as easy as it looks, you always want more, it's a toxic sleep killer. Finally we have a real successor to 2003's SimCity4 with a lot of similarities. As if SC4 was now Cities Skylines (the policies, the districts, the neighbor plots, etc). Oh and I'm able to play on my 2 year old laptop, without a hickup, it played well instantly. This is a winner and the game will be even better down the road. Don't even hesitate to buy this game.			"

												My record for this game speaks for itself.  I got excited for it the minute my gaming buddies started talking about it.  The only downside I see to this game is the fact I can't find any patches for it.  Otherwise, everything is top notch all the way!! Graphics are beautiful and it has an easy learning curve.  I feel that Paradox backed the right horse in forming a partnership with Colossal Order to make this miracle of a game!!!! I have only pity for the gamers who have yet to introduce themselves to  this wonder of a game. C'mon, guys, let's get on the bandwagon and  cheer Cities: Skylines to the heavens for we might not see a game of its ilk in our lifetime again!!!For those who have yet to pick it up, I strongly suggest that you pick it up NOW and don't wait for a sale. This was the best $33 bucks I ever spent here on Steam. This game is a life changer and is as addictive as all get out.Cities: Skylines--pick it ASAP. You won't regret it.			"

												My favourite city build-up game to this day! Not an unique style, basically it is like sim city, BUT, while sim city had huge mistakes, this game improved the gameplay and did not include this mistakes. So all in all, this is THE must have for every simulation/build-up fan out here. Also both add-ons are really good and worth the money, nice little expansions, that kind of missed, even though there is a great and very good modding community.			"

												My favourite city build-up game to this day! Not an unique style, basically it is like sim city, BUT, while sim city had huge mistakes, this game improved the gameplay and did not include this mistakes. So all in all, this is THE must have for every simulation/build-up fan out here. Also both add-ons are really good and worth the money, nice little expansions, that kind of missed, even though there is a great and very good modding community.			"

			Views: 687		

			Cities Skylines: Quick Look (City building Simulation, gameplay, and review) Is Cities: Skylines the Sim City we've all been waiting for? ""Quick Look"" is our short impression series of various games.		

Cities Skyline gives the player everything you would expect from a proper modern city builder game. It has expansive maps, detailed cities and population, intricate micro management, yet it's accessible and easy to pick up.Graphically the game is a looker. With detailed models, atmospheric filtering effects, and all the little things happening when you zoom in, the game look and feels alive. The audio design is immersive with the hustle and bustle of the crowds and traffic pulling the player in. Though the music seems over dramatic and on default settings it's strangely loud, but it does the job at keeping the player company.Mechanically the game can get deep when you learn all the details, yet the basics to get going is pretty easy. With that said, the game still requires a degree of self research as all the finer details in it's mechanics aren't always fully explained. Overall Cities: Skylines is a very enjoyable city builder, and at it's core, every thing I wanted from a modern Sim City.Pros:- Easy to learn- Lots of fine detail to micromanage- Great looking, very immersive- Supports mods- Huge map to build onCons:- Finer detail mechanics aren't always explained well- Some quality of life issues could use smoothing outCities: Skyline hours played at recording: 22Completion Status on Cities Skyline: N/AThis copy of Cities: Skyline was purchased on Steam			"

												Cities Skyline is a great game if you like to build modern cities. The road system is incredibly well done. I like how they chose to link zones directly to roads. Everything feels neat and clean. It has in-game tools for creating your own maps and game assets. You can create, for instance, a custom power plant with your own model or build it out of pre-existing models and determine it's stats such as cost and power output. Best of all your creations can easily be posted to the steam workshop and the game is incredibly mod-friendly. I like almost everything about the game; in fact my only major complaint is that the game is too easy. It's virtually impossible to ""lose"" at cities skylines. Even if you play like a complete idiot, going bankrupt is very rare unless you want it to happen. You can just have insanely high tax rates and let people move in, get totally reamed, leave angrily only to come back later. You could be the worst mayor who ever lived and make millions with ease. With the exception of losing a valuable structure to a fire or something, there's virtually no consenquences to anything you do. Some might say it's not about winning or losing, aiming instead for effeciency, but there's a fine line between ""min-maxing"" (making your city as effective as you can) and having no challenge whatsoever. Sim City 3000, for instance, was much harder to get into the green; requiring you carefully plan your city or to plague it with casinos and toxic waste dumps (which were unique buildings you can only build when given the opprotunity to do so) in order to get ahead. Whenever you had enough money to build something big, it really mattered. You had to decide if you wanted a new hospital or some reinforcement to your educational system - and if you would have enough income to support your new object. Expanding your city size and adding more zones was also a very careful decision players made in Sim3K, because if you could not adequately support a new burst of population it could mean trouble. There were legitimate consequences to your actions - cranking up tax rates won't just make people leave, they will riot and start fires. Even with Skyline's ""hard"" mode which is tucked away as an optional mod you can turn on (right next to infinite money) the game feels way too simple at times.Ultimately if you just wanna mess around and build stuff, Skylines is obviously a massive upgrade to the original sim games - but it's kind of terrible as an actual game that imposes challenges and problems you have to overcome. With modding, though, I'm sure the community could find a way to make the game more difficult. The game has a good soundtrack (pretty sure I hear some references to older SimCity music in there, too), cozy aesthetics and enough variety to keep most players entertained for at least 20 to 30 hours. Definitely a good purchase for both people who like city builders and those who are new to the genre.Rating: B+PS: Death to chirper.			"

												WOW! I've been playing for 90 minutes before work and lost track of time. This game is pure gold, and they absolutely delivered on the premise of being the game SimCity should have been! So far I've run into zero bugs. Getting off the ground is a bit confusing but once you're going, it's hard to stop. Only issue I have to complain about is you can't zoom all the way to ground level, and there was a crash to desktop when I quit to desktop.Can't wait to get off work to play it more...			"

												Can't...Stop...Playinggggg!!!!Arrragh!I have to be honest that I pirated it before I purchased it. The reason is simple: I was skeptical whether a team consists of roughly 10 people would be able to deliver a game matches its price. You know, think about EA's SimTown...And that infamous Cities XXXXXXXL...Not trying to make excuse anyway. Just don't want to be let down.And after log into the game and start playing, it's like time slitting away from my palm. Normally in SimTown as long as you cover the city limit with buildings there will not be much point keep playing on it and in Cities XXXXXXL long before that it's going to lag to unplayable. So generally I will not be absorbed in it and will eventually lose interest and get a life. However in Cities: Skylines I have already obtained ""Metropolitan"" title and the city just looks astounding. There are much, much more buildings in my metro than you can ever build in SimTown or Cities XXL, nevertheless the game is still smooth like hell. I mean it. I'm using a Core i5 and GForce 750M laptop and the fan is blazing, but any camera pan/ rotate will be in order immediately. The mechanics is similar to simtown. Nothing can be blamed since simtown has already got a pretty good system, yet of course the bloody ""seperate township“ has to be excluded. Notable differences include the induction of ""Noise"" and power grid, etc etc. The power grid system is a bit unrealistic since as long as your suburb is extended to the point you would like electricity to flow into you don't need to pull high-voltage wire to connect it to the power plant. Clearly it can not be achieved otherwise we'll not see utility poles around in our daily life.  (Sorry to be pedantic but I'm doing electrical engineering :( You can open an economy panel and tune tax rate/ policies however this bit is oversimplified IMHO. For instance there is not much noticeable effect if you change the tax rate for houses except your income. The graphic is not bad. You can complain it to be rough and undetailed, but I would rather want smoothness over a bit of detail, since with the game itself lag like s*** nobody will ever interested in zooming in to examine the minutiae of the city. Tweeting system is freshening but annoying in late game. Developer might want to expand the dictionary.This game is even equipped with a tool to form the terrain your city will be situated on. Even with a tool to enable importing of geographical data to automatically generate height offset! You know, I am currently using double screens, with google map on one screen and the game on the other, trying to create a city of Melbourne. And after terraforming, I am going to copy the city of Melbourne, street by street, building by building, onto it. What if you can't find the exact building in the game, you may ask.Create it then. This game has building creation tool. Pretty much like it in Spore. See, the replayability is vast. How amazing will it be, if you duplicate your hometown onto it, and do a bit of experiment on it maybe? Blast your home away from it? Merge this road with another to see the impact on traffic? Do whatever you like. It's your city.20/10TL;DR : BUY IT.			"

												Best sim city type game since Sim City 4 Rushhour,  without question.  Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game.  Roads that are curvable, the ability to make your own buildings (think BAT tool in SC4 but a ton easier to figure out and use), custom bus lines, custom train lines, custom subway lines, taxis, ferry service, expandable roads, click and follow cars/pedistrians ...It is not perfect mind you, the ability to bulldoze and flatten land does not exist (well it does on slopes with low % grades, but you want to flatten a mountain, that is not happening as no option to do it).Also, once you reach 8 expansions of your city limits that is it.  No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found).  That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more.  Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while.  Thing is there is a huge online community that has gives tons of FREE downloadable content which makes the game interesting.  Currently I am on 92 plus hours and still loving it.  Just downloaded the expansion AFTER DARK (that costs money in case you were wondering) but it gives more eye-candy and transport options.I currently give it an 8.5/10 which says a lot as it is rare I  ever give a game 8 or higher.

												Cities: Skylines experience in one word? Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don’t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I’ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don’t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10 "

												You're into macro management more than micro management ?You're fed up of small maps ? (*winks at SimCity fail*)You just want to relax while watching your city grow on the plots you simply designed ?Then this game is for you ! A combination of the good parts of one city sim with another along with new features not yet made in any of those sim.The bad point ?- Localization suffers some typos/mistakes here and there, but it's still alright.- Tunnels can't be made ... A mod to fix that ? *winks at modders* - No building customization (giving it a continent style over another) ... Again, modders are there for that !The good point ?- Even after 4 hours, I still didn't fill the map and yet I could expand it more.- Easy to understand.- Traffic sim is quite alright, even though vehicles sometimes don't use all the road lanes for some reasons.- Limitation ? What's that ? You're limitless ! Even doing a highway across your city is possible if you wanted to. (Although I don't see the point of doing it ...)			"

												I can quite put my finger on why I do not recommend this game to be honest. I was so happy for this game that I preordered it and I downloaded it and played it as soon as it became available. After a bit of time setting up towns, parks, commercial buildings and industrial areas I started to get that feeling of repitition. I built my town and everything is running great, I build my wonder building and I have alot of folk coming into my town. All my buildings are upgraded and all of this I did within 3 hours of play time. I feel as if the developers mostly focused on the road and traffic aspect of the game. It doesn't really matter what you build or where you build it, as long as there is not traffic you're fine.The 1 and only reason I dont recommend this game is because it gets repetitive after a short time span. The game itself is beautiful, the fact that I can zoom in and see such great detail is the only reason why I still play every once in a while.5/10 GAME "

												TL;DR The game is a nice leveling sandbox hampered by unintuitive gameplay, unusual traffic decisions, limited building styles, and confusing UI decisions. The less micro you like in a game, the more you will like this one. If you don't like being on rails while you play and want to have fine tunning controls, this game is probably not for you.Edit: As of the most recent update, while many things have been improved, the core complaints below has not been addressed. I do hope they address at least some of this, but for now everything below is still accurate. I have also clarified the maximum zoning size.Unfortunately, I have to move this review to not recommending for now. Once the rose colored glasses come off, there are some major issues that need fixing before I recommend this game to anyone but the most forgiving of individuals. The game is pretty good and can be a lot of fun...but those who haven't bought it yet will probably be heavily annoyed by the many frustrations this game also provides. Issue #1 Traffic. People will tell you there is nothing wrong with traffic, but there really is, and I can explain that problem in a sentence. Cars are always moving. Car leaves origin, travels towards destination, returns to origin, and heads to destination again. Because of this loop always running, there is no way to fix the traffic problem. People, businesses, factories work on cycles in real life. What's more, they are not constantly productive. Some forms of agriculture produce goods daily, some weekly, some monthly, and some are a once a year thing. Major comercial sectors time their shipments to arrive at night when there is limited traffic and thus deliveries are more efficient. With no day/night cycle and thus no low traffic/heavy traffic cycles the game punishes otherwise efficient designs by having only one mode of traffic, heavy. This is what creates all of the other traffic problems observed. Sure you can build around these problems, and there are many people who gain great pleasure from dealing with such. If that is you, then this game is probably for you. Otherwise, there really needs to be cyclic traffic flows in this game. Low traffic weekends in industrial areas, high traffic commercial. Residential needs to be low traffic most of the day.Issue #2 Limitations. There is a lot missing from this game. Asthetics, public building options, utilities, even auto constructed building have very limited and generic asthetics. Because of this, you will quickly find that one city looks just like any other quickly leaving the game feeling very cookie cutter. Having multiple building styles that alternate every 10 years or so would go a long way to fixing this and creating a feeling of a progressing city. Mods can only help in a limited way here. This is a fix that really needs to come from the devs. Issue #3 Zoning. There is only one way this game zones, that is automatically as you lay your roads. You can color in the blocks representing what can be built, but no matter what, you can not define the shape of the area you want constructed in. This forces you away from more organic designs as the game attempts to create numerous obnoxious shapes when a simple rectangle would have done much better. Such choices are not in your hand, and there are no creative work arounds as zoning is immediatly deleted when you remove a road, and anything built on it. Even if you are just trying to fix something and all buildings would still be with road access where they need it. Fix, let the player zone an area as industrial, commercial, or industrial then let them build the roads afterwards. The game can then highlight areas wasted due to lack of road access. This would allow for more organic, fun designs. As the game currently exist, and as a reply to ""NGB"" the image below represents how it currently works.

			This image goes along with my review for Cities: Skylines. This was in response to an individual telling me I had missed certain UI elements. The inset explains everything else that requires explanation.		


Issue #4 Building Footprint Sizes. Thanks to the way the game is created, you will never have large flowing fields of green on the outskirts of your city. Every single building has a maximum size of 4X4. Yes there are limited buildings that are larger you can construct manually, but you will never see large areas develop on their own. This is a direct result of how zoning is handled. Fix for this, fix zoning, then let the building bases have larger sizes.Issue #5 The Fan Base. This is going to be the number 1 reason I am not going to recomend this game to most people. Currently, the fans are to put it mildly, hostile to any criticisms of the game. Collosal Order has made no mistake and can do no wrong, so any issues you see are your fault and that's all there is. This isn't a problem in itself, it's a problem because there are so many like this that people with real issues can't talk about them because these fans derail threads and stop any form of productive discussion on the proplems. This is a good game that needs work, it is not a priceless work of art that needs to be preserved in its release state. There absolutely are design decisions in this title that need to be reconsidered. When you have so many that attack those that would suggest this game needs more work you can't have the discussions that need to happen. What's more, it's hard to get help when the fans are so abusive. There are many aspects of this game that just are not intuitive, and there is a significant portion of this fan base that will leave you not even wanting to use the forums. This is the real shame of the success of this game. This game was almost too successful for its own good.Edit: A screenshot from the comments on this review which shows an example of the response criticism of this game recieves. Notice that no points are refutted or discussed, just a blanket everyone else thinks this game is wonderful. I think he may have also been trying to criticize me...but the jab seems to have gone over or under my head.

			oldeguy provides yet another example of why any discussion that doesn't praise the game is difficult to have.		


There are an abundance of places where you can read the virtues of this game. This is the devil advocate review that only focuses on the bad or at a minimum the questionably implemented features that detract from the experience. The bird is not an issue to make you not buy the game, however, you will be punished for modding it out by turning off achievments. While there is a mod to re-enable achievments, what will probably start nagging you is how you have to keep downloading mods to fix questionable design decisions. An ingame option to turn off all nag screens and the bird is not too much to ask. These are the basic things that serve to move this from a must have to a marginal recomendation depending on whether you can ignore the issues and are willing to work around the ones that can't be ignored. For me the answer is no, which is why I have stopped playing for now.I am aware that the devs have planned a number of improvements to the game, if any of those improvements affect the issues I have highlighted, I will gladdly return to fix this review and its recomendation status. While I have highlighted the fans as the #1 issue for me not recommending the game, it doesn't really factor in. I hope people that applies to read it and reply proving me right, even better, maybe they read it and realize they could be a little more civil to their fellow humans. Who knows? If any 2 of the above issues become resolved I will move this review to a solid recommend. If this game goes on sale for $15.00 dollars, then that is also a solid recommend from me even with the issues.			"

												Yes. I absolutely recommend it. I bought this game for my wife initially, but also bought a copy for myself just because it's Paradox and I'm a fan of their strategy games. I didn't think I'd play C:S beyond five hours or so just to check it out, but here I am, a full weekend later, with my first Megalopolis of 50.000 inhabitants. I've been spending fourty hours with this gem of a game since thursday and over the weekend and it's earned a place in my heart. It wasn't my kind of game, I thought.It's not very hard, nor very challenging, which I initially thought was a balance issue and was disappointed in, But great disastrous challenges are not the point with this game. I can spend half an hour just planning the perfect intersection to make traffic flow seamlessly, or try to boost the productivity of my industrial zones. The great challenges are in the fine details. It's genius. The game wouldn't be half as fun with masses of city-threatening challenges to be dealt with while I'm trying to design the next suburbs.The game flows superbly. Fourty hours of playing and I haven't had a single crash, nor the simplest notion of lag although my city is getting very large with lots of traffic and citizens. The game is beautiful like a painting; I can spend a lot of time just admiring what I've created. Balance problems are present though; like my bus stops seem to be overpopulated with masses of passengers waiting for their buses.I recommend using mods as there are already an ocean of them. I've downloaded new buildings as well as fun camera tweaks that make it possible to actually walk around the streets like an ordinary citizen (The First Person Mod). Superbly immersive and gives you some awesome screenshots! I can't wait to see what the future brings with DLC's and mods. There's masses of potential.			"

												It's a gorgeous game that's for sure, but it quickly gets ""samey"" and enevitably you end up playing traffic simulator 2016 trying to get the road network to work.  There is also very little actual management you can do.  You designate a zone and the game builds everything for you.  Sure you can adjust taxes and make bus/train/plane stations (again, traffic simulator) but it always feels like you're doing nothing for the city.  However, the aesthetic appeal and community mods do add some replayability.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless it's on sale.			"

												This is a really fun game that i think the earlier sims should have been. The traffic mechanic is really well optimised although the flaw that i have found in the algorithm is that the cars are programmed to take the WIDEST road and not the most direct road, eg. If i have an industrial estate with 3 entrances, one a 2 lane 2 way road and the other is a 6 lane 2 way road, all the cars (or at least 90% of them) will take the 6 lane road as the cars think that taking the wider road is the better option as you can fit more cars onto them but when all the cars think that then they soon build up and you have to rethink all your roads... But thats what i enjoy, finding problems in my roads and then spending the time to fic, fix and fix again to make to they work as best the can! Also i have found that more entrances and exits DO NOT make the traffic smoother as more roads mean more junctions with more traffic lights, slow the cars down so 1 entrance is more effective than 17.  I hope you enjoyed my little chat about this game but for the price, I highly reccomend this game to everyone!			"

This is not the case, this game have def. taken over the 1st. place on the list. This game has almost everything that Simcity did not and does not have. Be aware that the developers haven't actually completely finished the game yet. Tunnels are missing and some minor bugs is to be found in the game. Overall not anything you really notice. I would definitely recommend this game and I'm happy that the successor to Simcity 4 has really come out now.			"

												A great step forward in the City Building Genre. Not just a mimic of Sim City 4, but a unique format, as others have put it Sim City is a City Building game with traffic, Cities: Skylines is a traffic strategy game with city building. The subtlety of the balance of the game is the best I've seen in a long time. When you first start out it isn't too hard to make a profit (unlike other games which are primarily based on the monetary mangement concept) but as the city gains size it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain growth as your services get drained and the requirements become more complicated.The same goes for traffic management, you start the game with your little roads thinking everything is hunky dory but as the traffic grows within your originally built infastructure it requires meticulous planning and investment to get a city running efficiently.I haven't even touched public transport as well as other things in the game and I can say I am already satisfied with the game. Great playability.The modding community has also been a huge success and has added some great features + assets to the game which compliment it perfectly, not just make it a cheating game breaking fest, which is a big plus for me.DOWNSIDE: You can't recraft the land, not a massive thing but sometimes you notice it is missing.

Initial ImpressionsWell, I can honestly say that I was looking forward to it. Many comparisons made to Simcity, stemming from a place of fondness of course. While the ""Sim"" brand will always have a place on my gaming rig (I miss you so much Sim Tower![en.wikipedia.org]), Cities: Skylines delivers on many levels.Current ConsiderationsOkay, lets be succinct: I'm wringing every last bit of playability of the vanilla version for this game before I move on. It's just that good!Future FixationsCities: Skylines has an asset editor to create your own mods in-game or you can import your own models. The modding community just blossomed within hours of the game release. Without a doubt, I will be using these creative mods in the future and quite possibly creating a few myself.			"

												This is an amazing game. Following what SimCity 2013 brought of issues, terrible choices and problems, this game was released with a lot of similar ideas, but making pretty much all of them better. It is really fun building your city and placing your public services to offer power, police, education, and others. It is a great challenge to manage space for all of it. And for this I recommend playing this game without placing service buildings and roads over residences, commerce or industries. It makes a much better challenge that got me to enjoy the challenge much more. While really fun to build and plan your city, the variety of buildings makes me feel like there is slightly too few options and no modifications or customization to the buildings, but I really don't think this takes anything away from the game, it is more like something I'd like than something that is missing from the game. And when you know that a group of 13 people made all of this, it feels like it's not really missing anything. On the other side, the lack of expansible service buildings help you make better use of space if compared to EA's SimCity 2013.The best part of the game is probably the traffic management. Following the Cities in Motion games, that the focus was to manage traffic, many amazing ideas and features come from it. The way that you can manually build roads, railways and metro lines is amazing, giving space for a lot of different ideas and customization, you can build it the way you want it to be. I spent a lot of hours building and rebuilding roads, planning bus lines, bringing railways from far away to transport people and cargo from and to the city, and planning how my metro lines and stations would be placed.The traffic is not without it's flaws. Sometimes you can place a 6 lane road and for some reason all the vehicles will be using only one of them and making a huge line instead of spreading around and allowing the traffic to flow. In some cases it's possible to fix this situation, but not everytime.And one other thing that I really missed is any kind of negotiations with neighbor cities. I'm not talking about the multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from SimCity 2013, but something like how it was on Sim City 3000, that is a great game that had a nice feature that you could make agreements with neighbor towns, it was really nice.My final verdict is very positive, I think this game is great and if you're into city building, or even have a slight interest in it, you should buy this game. It is at a reasonable price, and offers a lot, it will probably take away dozens of hours of your time, but you will enjoy these hours.I'm really looking forward for what can be made better in this game and in a possible sequel, but am also afraid of the strategy from Paradox of selling 10 thousand DLC's per game. Hope it's not the case for this game, that the DLC's offer really good content for a acceptable price.			"

My only legit complaint is it doesn't have as much convenient city information as SC2013. Other than that its a better game in every way imaginable. The bugs that are there are slowly being ironed out. Hopefully we can get some more info menus in future patches/xpacs but overall not bad from a team of a dozen people or so.			"

												I really love this game and I think it’s better than any of the City Simulations available at the moment - being SimCity and Cities (X)XL. Don’t get your hopes up that you have much of a control over the public transport feature. Unlike many people hoped, these have been reduced to a very rudimentary feature. Likes:* I personally quite like the fact, that I can also create additional public transport systems to reduce traffic load in certain roads.* Being able to expand the city by buying new tiles right next to it* I like it colourful and C:Skylines is very colourful.* The inhabitants have a fix live/work place whilst in Sim City everything was rather random and some Sims had split personalities or some sort of a dementia.* Despite the lack of some roads and the really simple traffic AI, traffic is much easier to handle than it is in Sim City. Though I’d partially also put this on the available public transport services.* I love the drawing kit to split the city into several suburbs (hello CiM2’s zoning tool), but more importantly, adjust city policies for single suburbs (as in smoke detectors for the industrial park only!) which either can generate a lot of money or cost you less money than changing a policy city-wide* Getting bored of the standard buildings? Add more with the Asset Manager! I absolutely love this feature as it's also great to pre-create certain road sets (i.e. roundabouts, crossings, etc.) once in the editor and then just copy/paste them in game when needed, rather than having to recreate them over and over again manually, especially for roundabouts or highway crossings this is a VERY neat feature!Dislikes: * The industry/commercial/residential view and demands are not always quite clear and sometimes one wonders why after so many industrial builds the bars are not changing at all and suddenly they all changed within seconds. So I think sometimes that's lagging a bit.** As in Cities in Motions 2, sometimes buildings of the same type are built several times next to each other. Which is not as bad in Skylines as it is in CiM.* The biggest downside from my point of view: it seems to be the same engine used as in Cities in Motions 2, hence it comes with the same bugs/features; mostly I am referring to the very simply traffic/lane assignment. A two-lane one way road will only have traffic on one lane, certain road combinations therefore make no sense (like the roundabout that’s being promoted in the loading screen).* Another road issues are the available road types available. There are 2-lane one-ways, 6-lane one-ways. The 4-lane is missing (probably because they have the same block size). There are 3 lane highways. A highway that splits into two directions will result in an unused middle lane (which basically applies to all roads due to the engine’s restriction/simple AI)* Many roads available in CiM2 which I was looking forward to have been removed, such as bus lanes, one lane one-way roads, sharp crossing in which cars can only turn into one direction.* The game starts off with either wind power or coal. Wind power barely procudes enough power as you quickly have to build 10 of them to keep your town running.* There is no tutorial how certain features work, i.e. the city zoning too, certain power productions (coal power, etc.)* In the beginning of the game there is only a waste dump. Until the endgame when the incinerator is introduced, there is no way to get rid of waste. Also it is not clear if the incinerator is also burning up waste from the waste dumps or only new collected waste. I wished there were more options (i.e. a recycling depot like in SimCity)* Generally the game lacks introductions, tutorials or explanations, features are not entirely clear and need a lot of guess work.Edit: I have now reached Megapolis status of my city and as soon as I reached ""Metropolis"" status the game got slightly slower, with no stutter on speed 2. Microstutters on speed 3. Since roughly Megapolis status the game got really slow and even on speed 1 there are more than just microstutters. Basically the same as with CiM2.			"

												Its been more than a decade but, 8 hours into the game, I think Simcity 4 finally has a worthy successor, Cities Skylines.This game offers;- A decent artstyle, the first decent replacement of the 2d Simcity style.- Much greater infrastructure detail, customisation & ease of use over SC4- The traffic model appears more realistic and your actions have logical impacts on it - Good modding support and tools- Whilst the scale, in terms of population, is much lower than SC4 it appears more realistic and accurate- I would estimate the maximum city size is 2x the size of the larger city tile in SC4The only negative thing I can say about the game is that it is very difficult to fail, however its something I'm willing to overlook. The unlocking of buildings/services/functions as your city progresses does not feel limiting but serves a vital role in ensuring less experienced/casual players find the game easier to play.90/100Only improvements I can think of would be;Adding a Region, allowing cities to interactAdding multiplayer region or easy way to exchange city tiles.I hope paradox will consider these improvements for the sequel, they are certainly on a distinguished road.

												Essentially everything the sequal to SimCity 4 should have been, this game is. Huge maps, the ability to create districts with different governing policies, and the budget management that was lacking in other games exists here. The transit system creation (down to being able to place the lines, and add express trains to busy subway tracks, etc, and the ability to create unique highway interchanges and road paths make this game come to life more than most city building games ever have.

												About six thousand years ago when the dinosaurs ruled the Earth, I discovered this game called ""SimCity"", and it was good. So insanely good that I played almost every incarnation of the game for the next 20 years, except for the really horrible ""social"" versions, which were terribly dumbed down.Then after the great flood washed away the dinosaurs, and took with it the last of EA's great developers and designers, we few surviving life-long SimCity addicts were left playing SimCity 4: Rush Hour for long year after year, hoping for the light to shine down from the heavens and impart on us the great knowledge, wisdom and truth of a brilliant new version of SimCity. That's when EA shoveled on us the massing stinking pile of dinosaur dung that was the ""new"" SimCity (aka SimCity 5), and lo, it was dark, ominous, horrible, and shockingly tiny. And DRM-restricted. And generally awful to the point where we all agreed SimCity was forever dead, killed by a greed-driven troll in the dark mountain keep of Electronicus Artus.And then Cities: Skylines appeared. And there was much joy and celebration! And lo, it was not only good, it was GREAT, and instantly assumed the torch of being the true spiritual successor of SimCity 4. If there had been a real SimCity 5 in the spirit of its predecessors, then Cities: Skylines is that game.True, Skylines doesn't have all of the options that SC4:RH did, but clearly the developers are on the right path and doing the right things. Tunnels are now in, and I honestly feel that these folks ""get it"". I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true spiritual successor to SimCity 4: Rush Hour.

												The first city building game since SC2000 to keep me glued for a nearly 8 hour session. Even taking the day off to indulge a bit more! The main negative for me currently is that it is honestly WAY too easy, but the devs have stated that they will add scenarios and the like in the future, so this may be remedied. Speaking about the devs, the most impressive thing about this title is that a team of 13 people put it together, so kudos on pulling off elegantly what EA/Maxis and AAA funding couldn't do.			"

												Its everything that Simcity failed to create.- There are several reasons this game gets a 10/10 from me but... The main reason is I can actually build a big city and not be choked off by one grid.Your allowed to purchase more land as your population grows to expand your city.Maxis, wtf were you thinking? To this day it boggles my mind how you constrained users in such a small area to express there buildings skills.			"

												Imagine an updated Sim City that isn't made by EA. That's essentially what this game is. I definitely found it quite hard to get my head around at first but I've really enjoyed it. If you're someone who enjoys management and strategy games I'd definitely recommend it. 10/10 would city again.			"

												Cities: Skylines the logical progression of classic city builders, and yet it has something more; something for everyone. Whether you're like me and played Simcity 2000 but could never last very long without going bankrupt (which is the case for me now with Skylines) or you're a municipal control freak and turn these games inside out, you'll find something to enjoy.The games ""living"" traffic system adds another fun dimension to the game. It's hard to describe, but you can really watch individual citizens move about. Think of it like Rollercoaster Tycoon in that sense. If you aren't careful, you'll spend hours with unlimited money enabled just trying to create the ultimate roundabout. That's sort of like a rollercoaster, right?The robust modding api and workshop integration means you can really flex the game to work for you. You can subscribe to maps and assets to add some variety to your infrastructure or subscribe to mods that give you tools or tricks like automatically demolishing abandoned buildings or even tweaking the balance of the game. These kinds of things take a few years and shoddy modding wrappers to get working in other similar games, but Colossal Order has proven to be extremely competent and has provided us with a brilliant API. Take your time with this one, the community has a lot to offer when you're done with the base game.			"

												What if I told you that I didn't regretted preordering.Game runs great.~120.000 citizens, 8 areas unlocked (high density residental area alone is whole 2 tiles) and still no signs of FPS drops.About gamplay...Its great city builder game.I would say its a upgraded mix of good features from Sim City and Cities XL.Some cool examples what you can do:- create district in residental zone and ban pet's so you don't need to collect waste (eg. dog ****).- make complex traffic systems (like bridge over bridge that connect to itself)- in farming-only city make all citizens highly educated so there are no workers left for farming- earn enough money to zone huge residental area and have a fun with electicity connections9999999-E/10 would preorder again			"

												Bought sim city for £40 (I think it was a long time ago)- It was first day release and the servers weren't working correctly and it require 24/7 internet connection to play so it kept booting me offline- 1 week later- Spent 50 minutes trying to log on- Took me about 30 minutes to fill out the small square of land they give you- Traffic Ai was driving through my main city causing huge traffic jams because that the shortest route even though there was a clear highway that would them to their destination much faster- Bought another sqaure of land and had to keep using a menu to go between each square this and the traffic Ai made it impossible to fix the traffic issuesGave up and bought cities skyline for about £15- Doesn't need 24/7 internet connection- Traffic AI is quite smart and tries to follow on the highway as long as possible- Fixed all my traffic issues and my city grew rapidly and demand for industry and commerical - I then bought the land next to my starting square and they merged together so no annoying menu- The water physics are surprisingly good and the dam are awesome- Land terrain tools are awesome- Mod supportedWould recommend this game and the natural disaster DLC with it			"

												This game is excelent.  It is everything SimCity should have been but wasn't.  They took the same idea and expanded into all the areas a good city builder should. Workshop support for player made buildings and mods make the game endlessly replayable.Make your own maps and build huge cities on them.  Creating bus lines, subway lines, feels great when streamlining your city.  The game really is best in class by far compared to all of its competitors. Pros- Great Mod/Workshop Support- Huge flexibility in designing roads and districts.- Runs great and looks great!- The details that you can see make the game really immersive.- Cars actually park on the street/in parking lots.- Good soundtrack.Cons- No nighttime (yet)- Had two incidents where the game crashed (possibly mod related)- One of my save files got corrupted. (Has been good for a while though)- Some buildings can be a tad finicky to place sometimes. Silly Airports.- No Multiplayer.- Traffic can be a little silly at times and won't utilize other lanes. Though mods can help.Very fun game, I am addicted.  Very small bumps in a great game!			"

												After playing 9 hours I can definately say this is a great game and puts EA's latest SIMCITY to shame. You can build cities 9 times the size of the ones in SIMCITY. The district mechanic is excellent allowing you to easily name and manage different areas of your city. The transport systems are good, you create bus/train routes and set heavy traffic bans in certain districts. The game looks good and runs smooth as balls and with the support of Steam Workshop I can see this game lasting a long time. If you want a good city builder this is worth full price.			"

												This has become one of my favorite and most played games of all time and it is definitely my favorite city simulator.The best part about Cities: Skylines is the mods. There is so much in the Workshop and it makes the game worth it; some of it is so beautiful and well done. If it weren't for the mods, I probably wouldn't play it, but the color correction filters, the maps, and the buildings available are amazing. Look at some of my screenshots and artwork for examples of what's possible in this game. I'm really blown away by some of the graphics sometimes when I really look at my city.It can actually be quite therapeutic to zoom in and just explore your towns and the nature.Pros:huge mapstons of great mods available; talented moddersalways a different experience when starting overgreat lighting, fog and other graphics; sometimes very photorealisticchallenging yet ballanced city simulator that gets it rightCons:it's easy to get carried away with downloading mods, and subscribing to too many will create long load times (I typically wait at least 15 minutes with the amount I have), errors with conflicting mods, corrupting save files, and sometimes crashingI wish it was better optimized so that subscribing to mods wouldn't lead to crashes/huge load timesI can't think of anything elsetl;drgreat city sim, pretty, lots of mods, long load times, Loading Screen Simulator 2k16 "

												I enjoyed SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, and SimCity 4.  Cities: Skylines is a game built on the same concepts, but with graphics and performance that have raised the bar to a whole new level when it comes to city-building simulators.This game sports a lovely, well-performing game engine delivering all the fun (work?) of zoning land, designing power/water infrastructure, roads and transportation, coverage of education, law enforcement, fire fighting, parks and recreation, trash and corpse management, etc..Without a doubt, Cities: Skylines is the best city building simulator I've ever seen.  It's everything I ever enjoyed about the SimCity series and more, brought, in beautiful detail, into the modern age of gaming.			"

												The city builder we've so desperatly craved for a while now. Or at least I know I'm not the only one who did. An addictive game that sucks the hours straight from your soul if you're not careful. It will take a try or two to get the hang of how to build your city, but once you do the mere size of what you can build is immense. It takes some effort to build a city to last, as it will get increasingly busy on the roads once it starts growing. You will probably spend hours on trying to make a traffic-network that isn't too clogged with all those unique people with their own schedule, car and life .. And somehow have a lot of fun doing it.A small downside to me was that, once you've build your immense city up to a certain size, you can get a bit lost on what to do next. There's only so many buildings to unlock and once the city runs, it runs itself. You could probably step away from the computer for an hour, come back and find that the only thing that has changed is how full your garbage dumps, cemetaries and wallet are (Might I add, that I find it hilarious that dead people and garbage have the same mechanic behind it?).The pathfinding for traffic still needs to be tweaked quite a bit too, but overall none of these things take away any of the fun you'll have if you enjoy city builders! Added bonus that, besides adressing the things mentioned above, the developpers have already announced so much shiny stuff they're working on for the future of the game.A hearty two thumbs way up.PS. I'm still convinced that they've added that gorgeous, gorgeous water engine just so that IGN would tell them they've got enough water.			"

												Alright, after 11 hours in this game I'm still only scraping the surface really but so far, in my opinion this game is everything SimCity should have been.The gameplay is fun, if you like city builders of course, and figuring out what method works best to lure in those citizens is making the game into a sort of crack to me. It's one of those games you can't put down once you start playing, while Civilization has it's ""Just one more turn"" this game has ""Just 5 more minutes"" or ""I'll quit, I just have to get this road straight... what, it's an hour later now?""The fact that it's also Steam Workshop enabled promises that there'll always be fun new things to build in your city.I'm not sure how big the area you can build on eventually will become but so far I can buy 8+ new areas, just as big as the one you start with, which I think is bigger than the full area you have in SimCity.My only complaint is that it's a bit hard to get the traffic to flow properly. It seems no matter what I do I just push the issue further down the road. Roundabouts help a lot, but the two you have access to are waaaay to big. A single one lane roundabout to keep the traffic flowing rather than getting stuck at traffic lights would be great, then again, there might be one available sooner or later thanks to Steam workshop.Scores for those that desperately need them:Graphics: 6/10 - The game could use some more varying buildings so you don't end up with the same three or four buildings repeated over and over.Sound: 7/10 - Music is nice and adds some ambience, which is all that is needed in a game like this.Gameplay: 9/10 - Like crack. Only legal and slightly less harmful to your health and social life.Overall: 7/10 - A really fun game so far with the potential to become even better.			"

												A worthy successor to Sim City 4's mantle, it's everything that Simcity 2013 wasn't; completely moddable, possesses large cities, functioning simulations and much more. Furthermore the artstyle is truly beautiful. Everything is easy and seemless to do. Want  to relocate a firestation without rebuilding it? There's a button for that. Want to create a freehand road junction to navigate an awkward area of the city? Very intuitive to do. It is overall a very solid game, with few problems, so I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in city building.9/10.			"

												The new standard in city-builders is here, brought to you by approximately 9 people.  BRAVO CO!!!!To those of you wondering if this game is not challenging enough for you compared to similarly-styled games, the answer damn well may be yes.  If you want something as ""deep"" as the SimCity series, give the modders a few months to crank out some difficulty adjustment mods and a disaster mod (currently there are no large-scale disasters in the game, just local fires, sickness, etc).  For $30, this game is an absolute steal - but it's going to get a LOT better in the next year as the modders dig their teeth in, so I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting til then to jump in.			"

												Cities: Skylines the logical progression of classic city builders, and yet it has something more; something for everyone. Whether you're like me and played Simcity 2000 but could never last very long without going bankrupt (which is the case for me now with Skylines) or you're a municipal control freak and turn these games inside out, you'll find something to enjoy.The games ""living"" traffic system adds another fun dimension to the game. It's hard to describe, but you can really watch individual citizens move about. Think of it like Rollercoaster Tycoon in that sense. If you aren't careful, you'll spend hours with unlimited money enabled just trying to create the ultimate roundabout. That's sort of like a rollercoaster, right?The robust modding api and workshop integration means you can really flex the game to work for you. You can subscribe to maps and assets to add some variety to your infrastructure or subscribe to mods that give you tools or tricks like automatically demolishing abandoned buildings or even tweaking the balance of the game. These kinds of things take a few years and shoddy modding wrappers to get working in other similar games, but Colossal Order has proven to be extremely competent and has provided us with a brilliant API. Take your time with this one, the community has a lot to offer when you're done with the base game.			"

												This is a really fun game that i think the earlier sims should have been. The traffic mechanic is really well optimised although the flaw that i have found in the algorithm is that the cars are programmed to take the WIDEST road and not the most direct road, eg. If i have an industrial estate with 3 entrances, one a 2 lane 2 way road and the other is a 6 lane 2 way road, all the cars (or at least 90% of them) will take the 6 lane road as the cars think that taking the wider road is the better option as you can fit more cars onto them but when all the cars think that then they soon build up and you have to rethink all your roads... But thats what i enjoy, finding problems in my roads and then spending the time to fic, fix and fix again to make to they work as best the can! Also i have found that more entrances and exits DO NOT make the traffic smoother as more roads mean more junctions with more traffic lights, slow the cars down so 1 entrance is more effective than 17.  I hope you enjoyed my little chat about this game but for the price, I highly reccomend this game to everyone!			"

												Yes. I absolutely recommend it. I bought this game for my wife initially, but also bought a copy for myself just because it's Paradox and I'm a fan of their strategy games. I didn't think I'd play C:S beyond five hours or so just to check it out, but here I am, a full weekend later, with my first Megalopolis of 50.000 inhabitants. I've been spending fourty hours with this gem of a game since thursday and over the weekend and it's earned a place in my heart. It wasn't my kind of game, I thought.It's not very hard, nor very challenging, which I initially thought was a balance issue and was disappointed in, But great disastrous challenges are not the point with this game. I can spend half an hour just planning the perfect intersection to make traffic flow seamlessly, or try to boost the productivity of my industrial zones. The great challenges are in the fine details. It's genius. The game wouldn't be half as fun with masses of city-threatening challenges to be dealt with while I'm trying to design the next suburbs.The game flows superbly. Fourty hours of playing and I haven't had a single crash, nor the simplest notion of lag although my city is getting very large with lots of traffic and citizens. The game is beautiful like a painting; I can spend a lot of time just admiring what I've created. Balance problems are present though; like my bus stops seem to be overpopulated with masses of passengers waiting for their buses.I recommend using mods as there are already an ocean of them. I've downloaded new buildings as well as fun camera tweaks that make it possible to actually walk around the streets like an ordinary citizen (The First Person Mod). Superbly immersive and gives you some awesome screenshots! I can't wait to see what the future brings with DLC's and mods. There's masses of potential.			"

Already tons of mods on the Workshop.-Flow of traffic and people is very smooth and feels very responsive.Cons:-No tutorials, figure it out or find a guide.-City seems to stop growing for a while after you hit a ceartain pop. Then correct itself.-Few bugs, but the ones that are there are super annoying.(No crime rates, etc.)Overall I would give this an 8/10 and would say buy it if you are looking for a great City Simulator.

												Finally!  A quality city simulator that is compatible for Linux!  I should have gotten this a while ago!  That said, I've had a few problems with it randomly shutting down, especially when using custom maps.  But for the most part, there has been no problem and I have enjoyed the gameplay!			"

												I personally really enjoy this game. It is a genre not well travelled, City Building is fun. Unless you can't quite keep up with the pace it builds. Closer to the endgame the challenge will really be trying to buldoze all of the abondoned buildings so More don't arise. Highway clogging is also very common endgame. But personally I've enjoyed my time up on to this point. Slowly or rapidly growing a city and customizing the layout is strangely satisfying. Whatching it grow is a blast. Siren Noises GALORE!!!! this specific game makes me feel like I'm intelligent and a good Mayor I suppose when all is going swell. There is a fair ammount of logic in how to build a proper city as well.			"

												Pretty much the only city builder out there:- Game looks nice, unlike SimCity 4- Engine doesn't start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ itself after you build a district or two (like Cities XL)- You don't fill the map within an hour of playing like SimCity 2014- It's an actual city builder (to not compare it with games like Banished/Anno that are fine in their own genre)And as a bonus it's totally open to mods (can go from extra buildings to new features) with a steam workshop integration and I'm really looking forward to what will be available on that side within a few weeks/months.

												A great step forward in the City Building Genre. Not just a mimic of Sim City 4, but a unique format, as others have put it Sim City is a City Building game with traffic, Cities: Skylines is a traffic strategy game with city building. The subtlety of the balance of the game is the best I've seen in a long time. When you first start out it isn't too hard to make a profit (unlike other games which are primarily based on the monetary mangement concept) but as the city gains size it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain growth as your services get drained and the requirements become more complicated.The same goes for traffic management, you start the game with your little roads thinking everything is hunky dory but as the traffic grows within your originally built infastructure it requires meticulous planning and investment to get a city running efficiently.I haven't even touched public transport as well as other things in the game and I can say I am already satisfied with the game. Great playability.The modding community has also been a huge success and has added some great features + assets to the game which compliment it perfectly, not just make it a cheating game breaking fest, which is a big plus for me.DOWNSIDE: You can't recraft the land, not a massive thing but sometimes you notice it is missing.

												This is a really fun game that i think the earlier sims should have been. The traffic mechanic is really well optimised although the flaw that i have found in the algorithm is that the cars are programmed to take the WIDEST road and not the most direct road, eg. If i have an industrial estate with 3 entrances, one a 2 lane 2 way road and the other is a 6 lane 2 way road, all the cars (or at least 90% of them) will take the 6 lane road as the cars think that taking the wider road is the better option as you can fit more cars onto them but when all the cars think that then they soon build up and you have to rethink all your roads... But thats what i enjoy, finding problems in my roads and then spending the time to fic, fix and fix again to make to they work as best the can! Also i have found that more entrances and exits DO NOT make the traffic smoother as more roads mean more junctions with more traffic lights, slow the cars down so 1 entrance is more effective than 17.  I hope you enjoyed my little chat about this game but for the price, I highly reccomend this game to everyone!			"

												As a fan of sim games in general, I can say honestly I'm in love with this game. The good(simple)Overall a great city-builder game (defintely what Sim-city 2013 should of been as many have said on reviews).Beautiful graphics, love the eye candy.Mods, Mods everywhere!The Devs are consistent with their updates.THE best damn traffic simulator out there! The BadNo terrain modifying tools when in-game, instead we have to use those tools on the map editor portion of the game.  A bit buggy at times, especially when trying to build roads/bridges over normal terrian even though it's suitable for it.Lacking a bit depth on certain portions of the game such as, political/science/medical goodies we all crave in these type of games.Final VerdictThe bad for me are just nit picks and I feel like they can be overlooked in this case (doesn't usually happen) and the game is still fresh/new and has the room to grow.Seriously, if you're a fan of city building sims, Cities: Skylines is amazing and you will not regret it! just be warned, it's ♥♥♥♥ing addicting!!!Edit: Still the best Traffic sim out there too boot!!!!

												Yes. I absolutely recommend it. I bought this game for my wife initially, but also bought a copy for myself just because it's Paradox and I'm a fan of their strategy games. I didn't think I'd play C:S beyond five hours or so just to check it out, but here I am, a full weekend later, with my first Megalopolis of 50.000 inhabitants. I've been spending fourty hours with this gem of a game since thursday and over the weekend and it's earned a place in my heart. It wasn't my kind of game, I thought.It's not very hard, nor very challenging, which I initially thought was a balance issue and was disappointed in, But great disastrous challenges are not the point with this game. I can spend half an hour just planning the perfect intersection to make traffic flow seamlessly, or try to boost the productivity of my industrial zones. The great challenges are in the fine details. It's genius. The game wouldn't be half as fun with masses of city-threatening challenges to be dealt with while I'm trying to design the next suburbs.The game flows superbly. Fourty hours of playing and I haven't had a single crash, nor the simplest notion of lag although my city is getting very large with lots of traffic and citizens. The game is beautiful like a painting; I can spend a lot of time just admiring what I've created. Balance problems are present though; like my bus stops seem to be overpopulated with masses of passengers waiting for their buses.I recommend using mods as there are already an ocean of them. I've downloaded new buildings as well as fun camera tweaks that make it possible to actually walk around the streets like an ordinary citizen (The First Person Mod). Superbly immersive and gives you some awesome screenshots! I can't wait to see what the future brings with DLC's and mods. There's masses of potential.			"

												This is a difficult one to write. Getting straight to the point, Cities Skylines takes the new SimCity back to basics, and nails those basics spot on. This includes huge maps, a terrain editor, lots of transportation options and competant graphics. In doing this, it has also taken steps back.This game comes with the same flaws that the older games had: you would lay some roads, zone an area, and place one of each service in the centre of that area. You would repeat this over and over again. Whereas in SC 2013, they added modular buildings and specialisations to mix up the gameplay (such as adding casinos with different room types for wealth levels), this new game is purely zoning and placing the same buildings over and over. Even the specialisations are actually reskins of the industrial zones, and are zoned with the same tools. They offer little difference to the gameplay.If you want huge maps, and are simply interested in designing a city for the sakes of it, then I can recommend to you this game very easily! It has plenty of tools to make your perfect city ""look"" like a perfect city. But, if you want a simulation that does not rely on your imagination, has more content and is less repetitive, then SimCity is your best bet. For example, in Cities: Skylines you can pretend to have a tourist area, whereas in SimCity you actually see tourists being simulated and affecting your economy based on the wealth levels of the attractions you have built (Cities: Skylines has no wealth levels either).

Skylines is HUGE, and options are as well when powered by the workshop, there is virtually no limit in how diverse your city can get. I loved the last DLC ""After Dark"", adding bike paths to my cities is very appealing to my vision of an eco-farming city. Load and loads of features.

The bugs that are there are slowly being ironed out. Hopefully we can get some more info menus in future patches/xpacs but overall not bad from a team of a dozen people or so.			"

Cities: Skylines by Paradox Interactive is an iterative game. It grabs the majority of things it has on display from city building games in the past and makes up what is effectively a big playground for you to play around in. Nothing is spared from Cities XL, Cities in Motion (a previous Paradox title) and the Sim City franchise. The reason for its hype and stature is not that it has all these things in it. All of these functions and mechanics have been on display before.It is well received by city building fanatics and casual players because it does these things *well*. Sim City 4 has many quirks, and despite the nostalgia surrounding it, that game has some extremely dated mechanics that detract from the experience. Sim City 2013 came around and people wanted a way to enjoy the good old stuff from Sim City 4 in a better, more enjoyable, more modern fashion. Needless to say it didn't live up to its promises, everyone twelve feet from the nearest rock should be filled in on that by now. Cities XL is a buggy mess that breaks apart merely a few hours in playing it. 'Skylines' yanks the best mechanics from these games and others and pull them off the way they should have been pulled off. No essential content is locked away behind a paywall. The cities are as large as they should be -and should you want even larger cities, the surprisingly smooth modding element of this game makes it easy to expand the default 6 tile plot size to 25 provided your PC can handle it- with no holds barred.Your traditional pieces of city building goodness are present here, for all to enjoy. The roads are satisfying to build and maintain, the statistics and logistics make sense unlike in Sim City to the game's best intentions, and the already mentioned mod support is a godsend. Tired of the tweeting bird that never wants to shut up? There's a mod to remove that. Unhappy with the fact that a structure isn't in the game? Download it from the steam workshop without even restarting the game.It's not a very forgiving game, which you may discover if you're migrating from Sim City 2013. The difficulty mainly hangs on to the fact that this game makes sense. It's not always 100% dead on in terms of the bigger decimals and values it pushes, but compared to some of the more nonsensical things present in Sim City it's surprisingly accurate. The game definitely punishes you for doing a sloppy job as city manager. Prepare to have many headaches if you don't pay attention to where you put your water pipes, or if you don't have a backup power source when your power plant burns down because you didn't put a fire station anywhere close. That's on you, buddy.No game is perfect, mind, and the game has legitimate pieces of content that isn't there as of writing this review, a proper way to terraform while in the city and make your own bodies of water being a glaring omission. Some parts of the game also don't make much sense without a proper tutorial, like the commute system which I can't figure out at all. I also don't think you should have to search Google to see if too many water pipes is going to be an issue, or how the water purification system functions. Considering how much Paradox cares about their customers tjough, these issues are insignificant to most when seeing just how well it all performs. My graphics card is six years old, and my processor isn't anything special, and I'm still surprised that six tile cities manage to run this good without a hitch on my system.Anything less than stellar can either be patched by Paradox or simply modded in. As a base game it beats most, and at a £30 launch price it leaves a good taste in my mouth, and it should in yours too. With developer love and a high ability to mod it, this game is sure to be the de facto city builder for many years to come. The future is bright.			"

												I will not write a review destroying Sims city or XXL … This review is what you will experience in game : **********************************************************************This review is for people who are new to city building games.*********************************************************************Good things about skyline:1)Smooth colouring, Identical icons, organized toolbar and clean screen. Unlike many other games, Cities skyline does not confuse you with similar icons or different varieties of colour all over the screen.2) Game provides enough information for the user to keep everything under control and does not get lost. 3)Attractive design, good graphics and fun in-game Activities. Maybe by now, you think the game is a serious strategy game; which in fact it is to some degrees, but it does not lose its entertainment part. This game gives you so many small in-game activities and does not limit you to only designing your city. you can click on a random citizen or a car, get full information of them such as who owns the car, what is the type of car or where your citizen lives, works does or what is he doing. You can rename them to whatever you want and it does not get limited to cars and citizens, you can rename buildings, factories, shops, animals, parks and even streets. \4) I hardly can remember any bug or problem in game that bothered me ... good updates fixed everything*************************************************************************This game is everything that you need to build your dream cities. one of the most important parts of this game is its community. the game has a tool that allows you to create or edit an existing building (that includes parks, houses and such) or even a map. You can come up with crazy ideas and make them happen. Even better you have chance to share it with others via steam workshop and let others enjoy too. Infact I made alot of buildings that people use them right now.You can also get what others made and have fun with unique looking buildings************************************************************************************•	Your creativity and imagination are the only things that matter.  The game does not limit you with rules; in fact you are free to try different designs. With different tools you have option to create your city just as you like*************************************************************************************This game is a complete example of a good interface / well-designed game. It pretty much fulfils all expectations and meets all the principles of a good interface. It is impossible to think of a bad aspect in the game as everyone is satisfied by this game. Even if you have no experience with games; you can start Cities skyline with no fear of getting lost in the game and you can enjoy having a good time playing this gameHighly recommended			"

												Last night I was up until 3 am playing this game. I spent an hour desiging a single four way highway interchangeI'm missing my mealsI'm seriously considering eschewing all social gatherings for the next month.This game is just too good. For years I've been playing city sim games, and I really havent found anything that can beat the old Sim Cities from over 10 years ago. Cities XL series, while fun, just doesn't hit the right notes.Skylines on the other hand is everything you ever wanted from a city sim. This is the sim city game we've been waiting for. This is a genre ender. I dont see how any other game can really make major improvements on this. It's got everything. This simulation is near perfect (it's scaled down a bit to make it easier, you won't notice it). It is very well optimised, Im running a 3rd gen I3 and there is very little lag (CXL lagged a lot for me, in comparison). The devs are involved in the community. The mod community is very active. It's relatively cheap, and the download size is tiny compared to most games.Now, I've gotta have my lunch so I can play more.			"

												This is an amazing game. Following what SimCity 2013 brought of issues, terrible choices and problems, this game was released with a lot of similar ideas, but making pretty much all of them better. It is really fun building your city and placing your public services to offer power, police, education, and others. It is a great challenge to manage space for all of it. And for this I recommend playing this game without placing service buildings and roads over residences, commerce or industries. It makes a much better challenge that got me to enjoy the challenge much more. While really fun to build and plan your city, the variety of buildings makes me feel like there is slightly too few options and no modifications or customization to the buildings, but I really don't think this takes anything away from the game, it is more like something I'd like than something that is missing from the game. And when you know that a group of 13 people made all of this, it feels like it's not really missing anything. On the other side, the lack of expansible service buildings help you make better use of space if compared to EA's SimCity 2013.The best part of the game is probably the traffic management. Following the Cities in Motion games, that the focus was to manage traffic, many amazing ideas and features come from it. The way that you can manually build roads, railways and metro lines is amazing, giving space for a lot of different ideas and customization, you can build it the way you want it to be. I spent a lot of hours building and rebuilding roads, planning bus lines, bringing railways from far away to transport people and cargo from and to the city, and planning how my metro lines and stations would be placed.The traffic is not without it's flaws. Sometimes you can place a 6 lane road and for some reason all the vehicles will be using only one of them and making a huge line instead of spreading around and allowing the traffic to flow. In some cases it's possible to fix this situation, but not everytime.And one other thing that I really missed is any kind of negotiations with neighbor cities. I'm not talking about the multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from SimCity 2013, but something like how it was on Sim City 3000, that is a great game that had a nice feature that you could make agreements with neighbor towns, it was really nice.My final verdict is very positive, I think this game is great and if you're into city building, or even have a slight interest in it, you should buy this game. It is at a reasonable price, and offers a lot, it will probably take away dozens of hours of your time, but you will enjoy these hours.I'm really looking forward for what can be made better in this game and in a possible sequel, but am also afraid of the strategy from Paradox of selling 10 thousand DLC's per game. Hope it's not the case for this game, that the DLC's offer really good content for a acceptable price.			"

												I really love this game and I think it’s better than any of the City Simulations available at the moment - being SimCity and Cities (X)XL. Don’t get your hopes up that you have much of a control over the public transport feature. Unlike many people hoped, these have been reduced to a very rudimentary feature. Likes:* I personally quite like the fact, that I can also create additional public transport systems to reduce traffic load in certain roads.* Being able to expand the city by buying new tiles right next to it* I like it colourful and C:Skylines is very colourful.* The inhabitants have a fix live/work place whilst in Sim City everything was rather random and some Sims had split personalities or some sort of a dementia.* Despite the lack of some roads and the really simple traffic AI, traffic is much easier to handle than it is in Sim City. Though I’d partially also put this on the available public transport services.* I love the drawing kit to split the city into several suburbs (hello CiM2’s zoning tool), but more importantly, adjust city policies for single suburbs (as in smoke detectors for the industrial park only!) which either can generate a lot of money or cost you less money than changing a policy city-wide* Getting bored of the standard buildings? Add more with the Asset Manager! I absolutely love this feature as it's also great to pre-create certain road sets (i.e. roundabouts, crossings, etc.) once in the editor and then just copy/paste them in game when needed, rather than having to recreate them over and over again manually, especially for roundabouts or highway crossings this is a VERY neat feature!Dislikes: * The industry/commercial/residential view and demands are not always quite clear and sometimes one wonders why after so many industrial builds the bars are not changing at all and suddenly they all changed within seconds. So I think sometimes that's lagging a bit.** As in Cities in Motions 2, sometimes buildings of the same type are built several times next to each other. Which is not as bad in Skylines as it is in CiM.* The biggest downside from my point of view: it seems to be the same engine used as in Cities in Motions 2, hence it comes with the same bugs/features; mostly I am referring to the very simply traffic/lane assignment. A two-lane one way road will only have traffic on one lane, certain road combinations therefore make no sense (like the roundabout that’s being promoted in the loading screen).* Another road issues are the available road types available. There are 2-lane one-ways, 6-lane one-ways. The 4-lane is missing (probably because they have the same block size). There are 3 lane highways. A highway that splits into two directions will result in an unused middle lane (which basically applies to all roads due to the engine’s restriction/simple AI)* Many roads available in CiM2 which I was looking forward to have been removed, such as bus lanes, one lane one-way roads, sharp crossing in which cars can only turn into one direction.* The game starts off with either wind power or coal. Wind power barely procudes enough power as you quickly have to build 10 of them to keep your town running.* There is no tutorial how certain features work, i.e. the city zoning too, certain power productions (coal power, etc.)* In the beginning of the game there is only a waste dump. Until the endgame when the incinerator is introduced, there is no way to get rid of waste. Also it is not clear if the incinerator is also burning up waste from the waste dumps or only new collected waste. I wished there were more options (i.e. a recycling depot like in SimCity)* Generally the game lacks introductions, tutorials or explanations, features are not entirely clear and need a lot of guess work.Edit: I have now reached Megapolis status of my city and as soon as I reached ""Metropolis"" status the game got slightly slower, with no stutter on speed 2. Microstutters on speed 3. Since roughly Megapolis status the game got really slow and even on speed 1 there are more than just microstutters. Basically the same as with CiM2.			"

												This is one of the best games i have bought on steam.I played SimCity aswel, but i found that lacking a lot of things in my opinion. (especially the room you could build in)But this game... Ohh this game.... Don't get fooled by my hours i have here... Because i played this game A LOT when i actually had no internet. So steam did not log these hours. It is so damn addicting! All the mods make it even a better experience! So please do take a look at the steam workshop if you have or wanna buy this game!			"

												Last night I was up until 3 am playing this game. I spent an hour desiging a single four way highway interchangeI'm missing my mealsI'm seriously considering eschewing all social gatherings for the next month.This game is just too good. For years I've been playing city sim games, and I really havent found anything that can beat the old Sim Cities from over 10 years ago. Cities XL series, while fun, just doesn't hit the right notes.Skylines on the other hand is everything you ever wanted from a city sim. This is the sim city game we've been waiting for. This is a genre ender. I dont see how any other game can really make major improvements on this. It's got everything. This simulation is near perfect (it's scaled down a bit to make it easier, you won't notice it). It is very well optimised, Im running a 3rd gen I3 and there is very little lag (CXL lagged a lot for me, in comparison). The devs are involved in the community. The mod community is very active. It's relatively cheap, and the download size is tiny compared to most games.Now, I've gotta have my lunch so I can play more.			"

Worth more than they're askingThis game is everything Sim Cities 5 wanted to be, tried to be and failed to be. Colossal Order showed what they had and delivered more at less than half the price AND supports modding right out of the box. I have full confidense that this game will be supported by the developers with the love and attention it deserves forward, especially now that the game has sold over 250.000 copies on day 1 and have proven its rightful place in the market.I have not experienced any bugs in my first 20 hours, though I would like if they can make it easier creating the proper curve on roads. I guess that being my only complaint so far should tell you something about how polished the game is.If you're even curious whether you like these types of games, THIS is the one you should test yourself on the genre if you ever try one.

												Vanilla GameIs the best city builder since Sim City 4, if from a City Builder you like something like the classic Sim City and not like Tropico, Anno etc... So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy. Is easy to get money but your city will suffer from a chain of problems that you can address by adding resurces, reshaping roads and smoothing trafic. Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/mapModsThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.Maps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.TL:DRA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion			"

The graphics are simple but it makes the game seem so much more crisp. One problem I do have is the fact that there is a lot of repeating of buildings. Sometimes I have 10 of the same buildings next to each other! But I love watching the city work. I can just stare at my city for hours watching all the citizens go throughout there busy days. I love how each citizen has a name, a house and a job. This game is truly amazing and I recommend it to all city builder lovers!			"

												After playing 9 hours I can definately say this is a great game and puts EA's latest SIMCITY to shame. You can build cities 9 times the size of the ones in SIMCITY. The district mechanic is excellent allowing you to easily name and manage different areas of your city. The transport systems are good, you create bus/train routes and set heavy traffic bans in certain districts. The game looks good and runs smooth as balls and with the support of Steam Workshop I can see this game lasting a long time. If you want a good city builder this is worth full price.			"

Posted: August 21, 2015
												My mayoral skills were impressive. In a short time I'd grown my little hamlet from just a few hundred residents into a gleaming city of 70,000 people. But suddenly, it all fell apart. My garbage collection services ran into a problem: the roads leading to my district of landfills and incinerators couldn't handle the vast amount of garbage trucks coming and going from all corners of the city. An enormous traffic jam started - unnoticed at first - eventually cascading into every corner of the city, completely locking down the road system. Fires raged through the down town high-rises because the fire fighters couldn't make it past the traffic. Sick people started dying in their homes because ambulances couldn't get to their door. As the bodies piled up and the buildings burned down, complaints rolled in and people started abandoning the city as quickly as they could.Where Skylines truly shines is in its focus on transportation management. As my story at the beginning showed, poorly planned roads can destroy your city once it outgrows the infrastructure. Fortunately, you have scads of options to manage your transportation. You can build underground or elevated roads, low or high volume streets (including one-way streets!), bus stations, subways, trains, and more. Mass transit becomes incredibly important as you quickly realize you want to get as many cars off the streets as possible, and you'll find yourself building pedestrian pathways to make it easy for your citizens to walk everywhere. You can easily spend the majority of your time fiddling to find the most optimal traffic solution if you want to - and sometimes you'll need to, as the game will harshly punish you if your traffic infrastructure can't handle your people.The game also introduces the concept of ""districts"". In the Sim City games you were able to enact laws and policies that effected the city as a whole, but in Skylines you can create individual districts and then enact policies on a district level if you don't want them to impact the entire city. This allows you to build a booming business sector with tax breaks for commercial zoning and free public transport while banning truck traffic and high rises in a quiet residential neighborhood.I unabashedly adore Cities: Skylines.  Despite that, there are still some issues I have with the game - issues which, granted, have been addressed by mods, but still need to be added as official features. Pedestrian pathways were very exciting to me as a long-time Sim City player. The transportation options haven't ever allowed you to build a ""walkable"" city. In Skylines, while you can build them to allow your people to walk everywhere, you can't place buildings or zones off pedestrian pathways, which means that citizens have to use the path to walk to a road to go to a building. They essentially just allow you to place shortcuts connecting roads and don't let you create any sort of walkable city area. You also don't have any fine-tuned control over your intersections. Given how essential a proper road layout is, you'd expect to be able to designate turn lanes, cross-walk locations, and whether your want an intersection to have traffic signals or not. As it is, intersections are automatically created and you have no control over what exactly they look like. This can be very frustrating if you're trying to optimize your traffic flow. Planting trees is also a pain, as you can only place individual trees - there's no way to place mass amounts with a brush, and it's sorely needed. None of those problems have lessened by enjoyment with the game, and indeed, most of them arose only after spending many hours playing. Full review[www.thesewall.com].			"

												Played SC5 for hours and hours, kept coming back to it despite the numerous issues. Always been a sucker for Sim games. Stumbled upon Cities: Skylines thanks to Steam (and it's ability to consistently drain my wallet with Summer/Winter sales). Already jumping in headfirst, nearly forgotten about SC5. Some things are more dumbed down in CS than SC5, like you can't see bus stop wait overlays, and some things are a bit more nuanced like now we can control actual bus, metro, and train lines. Mod support is epic.Looking forward to many more hours to come. Looks like the devs are consistently pushing updates too, which is always awesome.Strongly recommend. I expect this game witll be labeled ""Overwhelmingly positive"" for a long while.			"

												This has become one of my favorite and most played games of all time and it is definitely my favorite city simulator.The best part about Cities: Skylines is the mods. There is so much in the Workshop and it makes the game worth it; some of it is so beautiful and well done. If it weren't for the mods, I probably wouldn't play it, but the color correction filters, the maps, and the buildings available are amazing. Look at some of my screenshots and artwork for examples of what's possible in this game. I'm really blown away by some of the graphics sometimes when I really look at my city.It can actually be quite therapeutic to zoom in and just explore your towns and the nature.Pros:huge mapstons of great mods available; talented moddersalways a different experience when starting overgreat lighting, fog and other graphics; sometimes very photorealisticchallenging yet ballanced city simulator that gets it rightCons:it's easy to get carried away with downloading mods, and subscribing to too many will create long load times (I typically wait at least 15 minutes with the amount I have), errors with conflicting mods, corrupting save files, and sometimes crashingI wish it was better optimized so that subscribing to mods wouldn't lead to crashes/huge load timesI can't think of anything elsetl;drgreat city sim, pretty, lots of mods, long load times, Loading Screen Simulator 2k16 "

												This is everything that SimCity 2013 ISN'T!!! There's NOTHING here that will make you regret purchasing this game, quite possibly like you did when you purchased SimCity 2013.This game has a map editor and an asset editor built in so that you don't have to deal with just a flat land. You can also extend the land of your city when you reach certain milestones, and the tools are easy to use.The best part about this game? Mod support. Through the Steam Workshop, you can search for mods and assets to better suit your gameplay. I haven't seen ALL of the mods, but there's a posssibility that if you want a certain feature, there's a chance there may be a mod for it.With its easy to use tools, map and asset editor, mod support, excellent DLC and a WHOLE bunch of other great stuff that I can't remember right off the top of my head, Cities: Skylines is the city building game that SimCity 2013 promised, but failed to deliver.

												Finally!  A quality city simulator that is compatible for Linux!  I should have gotten this a while ago!  That said, I've had a few problems with it randomly shutting down, especially when using custom maps.  But for the most part, there has been no problem and I have enjoyed the gameplay!			"

												This game is asbsalutely AMAZING. It is realistic and there is so much detail. Each person has a home, a car, a family, an age, and a job. And the number of people it tells you you have.. there IS THAT MANY PEOPLE. Besides a few bugs with building roads and semi-fualty traffic, this game is just amazing and you should buy it now! WHY waste your time reading this comment when you could be building a city?! GO GET IT NOW!!			"

												One of the greatest city builders out there that also includes workshop support for even more hours of fun!-Undoubtedly, this is one of best city builder games I have ever played. Although I cant help to compare this to the latest SimCity from EA, there are many pros and cons that are noticable. Some pros that can be seen is that Cities: Skylines allows you to purchase more plots of land if you run out of space, set districts and apply certain policies, and has definently more variety of roads, buildings, and cars than SimCity. But indeed like every game, there are some cons that are equally noticable. These include (in my opinion) no proper day/night cycle, time should last a few minutes instead of a few seconds, and car AI that should let emergency vehicles have the right of way during emergencies. The cons are not bad, but they should be definently improved or added sometime in the future.But the good news is, Colossal Order is planning to release their brand new expansion After Dark which includes a day/night cycle and adds some nighttime locations like nightclubs to see your city come to life. There is currently no set release date or prices but you can read more about it here[www.paradoxplaza.com]. Along with that, there are many mods in the workshop that can help enhance your experience throughout the game that add more roads, buildings, fixes, etc and also graphical mods.-Overall: If you are deciding wheather to buy Cities: Skylines or SimCity 2015, I recommend Cities: Skylines because it offers more features that SimCity 2015 lacks.

												Cities Skylines is a game where you build up your city from a simple Highway entrance to a large metropolis. It can be fun at times, while still putting the player in stress in the form of fluctuating demand, trafic and complaints of buildings in their city.     Although, the game LOOKS realistic, but it's nowhere even close. The AI of cars, the (small) variety of buildings, and the way boats & other vehicles just phase into each other. And in order to make the city look realistic, you have to go and search all over the steam workshop (a place which has 300k+ items for C:S) and download assets & mods which can be faulty and dangerous for your computer. Plus, you still have decent lag even with a Titan processer (The best of the best) with all the downloads. Overall, it's pretty cool, but it needs more work on AI and preformance omptumization.			"

												Cities: Skyline is a city-simulator not unlike its Sim City predecessors. Unlike EA's most recent installment, however, Skyline understands what its consumers want. None of that token multiplayer online-connection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; it's just a quality city simulator with excellent modding support and a quality developer.I'll get the negatives out of the way first. One of the most annoying things is a Twitter knockoff that pops up on the top of your screen. Yes, it keeps you informed on what the citizens are thinking but not nearly as intuitively as one would like. Plus, it's annoying. Outside of that, there are a few other things here and there; buildings get abandoned like no one's business, and I would much rather have some sort of construction crew I could hire rather than having to go through and manually bulldoze each individual abandoned property. The public transit systems, while useful, don't provide the best feedback on how popular they are or how efficiently they are functioning. Finally, the roads could use a bit less liberal snapping; it's very hard to keep things straight, and you end up wasting space.That might seem like a lengthy negative paragraph at a glance, but I'll be honest: it's just nitpicks here and there. The game is quality with incredible simulation: all your citizens can be tracked, and their cars can be clicked and observed extensively. And when they ask why the mayor is sitting in the back of their car? Who cares. You are the one true mayor. How dare they question the authority of your elected office?There are a lot of nice touches to the game that make the cities you build feel vibrant and realistic. Water flow is key to maintaining a balance between pollution and your water supply, and the physics, while simple, are effective. The game isn't some casual time-waster either; forethought and budgeting are required to stay afloat. But if you don't want to worry about that, there's also auto-installed mods for things like unlimited money and full-unlocks. You can buy land for your city with each milestone you achieve through population growth, as well as gain upgrades to your buildings and districts. The game also runs very well, and the mechanics are very easily picked up--especially if you have experience with your classic city-management builder. If you don't like any of the maps, there is also a map creator you can use, which is fun to use if I do say so myself.So all in all? This is a quality addition to the genre. It's accessible to newer players and refreshing to veterans, and if you are a fan of the genre, I would highly recommend it. The game is full of content, and new content is being added by the vibrant modding community. The developers treat the community with respect and appreciation (UNLIKE A CERTAIN OTHER COMPANY), and they are very actively involved, appreciating feedback and discussion among their forums. So yeah, there are a few faults here and there, but I would say this game is definitely worth it's price.			"

It was definitely worth the weight (*khe khe* because GabeN) and I've loved every minute of it.

 A real feat...	This is the game Simcity was trying to be. If you know and have played Simcity, then you know what I mean. It was a brilliant effort, that was somehow hindered, perhaps by EA's greed. This is the best parts of Simcity, but so much more. Everything is done... well, just about perfectly - and by a team that, compared to Maxis's workforce, is tiny. I'd do a list of pros and cons about now, but the list of pros for this game might be too long. Instead...The most brilliant things this have over Simcity: - MASSIVE cities. This one can't be avoided. You start in a square roughly the size of Simcity's. You can then buy another EIGHT. So, yeah, it's 9 times the size of Simcity. You can have even more (25!) with the help of a mod, which brings me on to my next point... - Mods. And Steam Workshop integration. I don't think I've played a game where adding mods was so easy and fluid, and grabbing assets from the workshop is brilliant - particularly for intersections. And on that matter, adding your own is so simple too. - Fantastic simulation. I don't really know how Simcity managed to get this wrong, when Cities gets it so right. Simcity's glassbox engine was cool to look at, I admit, but... In Simcity, people woke up in the morning, went to work at the nearest job they could find, then went to the nearest home they could find afterwards and repeated the same every morning. In Cities, every person has a name, a car, a house, a job... It's fantastic. Additionally, water simulation is pretty neat too. It's the only game where you can actually drain a river by pumping all the water out, or flood a city by building a dam. A few minor niggles that don't bother me at all, really: - I kinda miss the specialisation thing from Simcity. If, like me, you liked that, you'll probably miss it a bit too. - The graphics, while excellent, aren't quite as perfect as in Simcity. Something's a little off, so I think it just needs a few more settings in the options menu. However, you can pretty much have whater you like using mods too, so... not really much of an issue. - Traffic AI. Now, Simcity had the same problem at launch really. It's just not smart enough. The main problem is things like hearses, picking up jobs on the opposite side of the city, while there's a dead person waiting for transport right next to the crematorium. But, there's also problems with lanes. The AI just don't use them efficiently (even naturally) enough. Fix this. Please. - My train network gets jammed up. Not because of my rail design, but because of the rail design beyond the map, which seems a bit unfair.So, if you like city builders, I can't reccomend this game more. This is the new definitive city building game, and I think it'll remain that way for quite a while.9.999/10 (fix traffic for the 10/10)			"

												Hey look.... a city building game where I can build actual cities, instead of small towns, and I can even expand them!At first I was a little hesitant about buying the game, after being so dissapointed with the recent Simcity, but I bought the game none the less, and I am glad I did. Cities: Skylines have thus far been a very enjoyable experience. I have put just about 14 hours into the game, at the time of this review and I don't really have anything bad to say about the game.Gameplay:+ The difficulty feels just about right, and it seems to increase along with the size of your city.+ The game WILL punish you, if you make the wrong decisions, and let them be for too long.+ I enjoy having to balance my ever changing budget+ Even after 14 hours of gameplay, I still feel I have alot to discover about the game.- Having to delete abandoned buildings one by one, can be very tedious, boring and frustrating.- Upgrading and changing road types could work better.- Elevating roads, making bridges and then connectiong them to other roads can be a bit tricky.The game:+ The game runs smooth on my high-end rig+ The graphics are great considering the small download size+ The game seems to run Fullscreen (Windowed Mode) by default.

This is not the case, this game have def. taken over the 1st. place on the list. This game has almost everything that Simcity did not and does not have. Be aware that the developers haven't actually completely finished the game yet. Tunnels are missing and some minor bugs is to be found in the game. Overall not anything you really notice. I would definitely recommend this game and I'm happy that the successor to Simcity 4 has really come out now.			"

												My sister told me about this on release day.  I hadn't heard of it, but started to quite a lot soon thereafter.  I didn't research it at all - just bought it, knowing how well liked it was and basically what type of game it was.I started playing and, lo and behold, I JUST COULDN'T STOP!  It's one of those games, like the Civilization series, in which the hours fly by and you just want to do a little bit more before exiting.  And then some more hours disappear.  I played 12.7 hours in a single sitting!  Later while sleeping I dreamt I was playing it (and woke up feeling like I was having fun the whole night)!Suffice it to say - this game VERY fun and I should mention it's not too difficult to learn, but complex enough to keep you from getting bored.  I didn't watch videos to familiarize myself with it, but I did have to look up two questions I had in Google during my marathon.  That's not bad, right?  Afterwards, I finally thought I'd click on the icon in the upper left corner, which I had ignored the whole time.  That's when I realized where the resources could be found.  Now I'm going to tune up my city and make it greater than ever!I whole heartedly recommend Cities: Skylines.			"

												Cities Skylines is like everything a (fanatic) city-builder wants to see in a game. With DLC still incoming we can expect a lot from the company for sure! Although it could be benefitial to have a PC that can handle a pretty heavy game like this one.Pros:- Wide range of mods and CC being made in the community for improving your city.- Will not get boring even after I don't know how much play time. (I have like 200 hours at the moment)- All the different kind of aspects of managing like: traffic, RCI and so on, are actually pretty challenging sometimes which keeps it more fun to play.- All the details are amazing and to see everything moving is just wonderful!- The huge area to build on is just a reason alone to buy this game.Cons:- A good PC is needed if you want to play this game (with mods) without too many problems or lag.But in the end you will have a beautiful city to look at!

												Cities skylines, o que dizer dessa delícia? Bom, eu não posso falar muito sobre o jogo pelo fato de eu ter jogado somente quando eles liberaram o final de semana grátis(risos), mas para falar brevemente, o jogo está muito bom, aconselho a todos jogarem. O jogo tem uma temática mais realista do que qualquer versão do  sim city, deixando qualquer fã de simulador piradão, os gráficos estão bons, dá para melhorar mais. A jogabilidade é extremamente amigável, ""muito fácil de jogar"", mas não tão fácil assim. Você tem que pensar muito no jogo, para não deixar a sua população faltando algo. Para isso você deve estar atento a qualquer mudança na cidade, se ela está crescendo e etc.E não se espelhe no nosso governo atual.Abraços.			"

												Cities: Skylines on its own is a very solid game. Everything I loved about SimCity 4, but better. Larger surface area to build to, more extensible, and a good price point. But the real key is in the mods. The mods can let you go from making relatively large towns to megacities. They can improve the sometimes questionable vehicle AI, and allow you to fine-tune the game to your liking. If your PC can handle it, you can creat an entire region, with a central city and suburbs and towns, all interconnected by road, rail, or metro.Great Game++			"

												I bought this game because it was categorically better than Sim City. I invested way more money than I should have in DLCs and the game itself for Sim City, and was massively let down. This game sports one of the largest workshop communities I have ever seen. I have recently met several new friends playing this game where I was able to commission some new pieces in the workshop. I would say it helps if you have a fair size amount of ram on your computer though. I tended to get bored very quickly with what the game initially had to offer and became addicted to utilizing workshop mods and assets. It can take quite the toll on your computer's memory capacity. So ye been warned. However, in my opnion totally worth it. Lmao company even released a free DLC... who does that?!?			"

												This game has taken the throne as the ultimate city building game for me, and I don't say this lightly. My first was the original Sim City, because I am old like that. Cities: Skylines is what a modern city builder should be. Plenty of details to dive into, but you can also take a more casual approach, if micromanaging isn't your style. Although some amount of micromanagement interest is probably not a BAD thing in this case (especially when it comes to planning your neighborhoods and traffic). If building cities is your bag, this will not dissapoint.			"

												This is hands-down one of the finest city building games I have ever played.I've enjoyed games throughout the entire Simcity series (from 3000 on and excluding the newest) and on to smaller-scale management games such as the Anno series. Although these are good games, few have been as utterly absorbing as Cities: Skylines.The game is reasonably ""easy"" in the sense that you won't encounter a steep difficulty curve from the economic side of the simulation. That is, you're probably not going to run out of money, and before long your coffers will be so full you'll have more money than spending options.However, the real difficulty comes from the optimization, and it's baked into the game's design so organically that it makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before. If you want a large city with skyscrapers, you will have to get your services in your neighborhoods ""just so"" to get them to appear. You will hit population resistance points where you simply cannot grow unless you've optimized your layout, traffic, services, and so on.The traffic system can be a game unto itself, I found myself spending 45 minutes designing a complex ""spaghetti bowl"" traffic structure in the heart of my city, then watching and fine tuning it for the next hour or two by adding lanes, changing distances, or rerouting traffic to prevent jams. You can even watch the composition of traffic to get hints (lots of trucks means the industrial area is contributing too much traffic, etc.)You'll spend a lot of time looking, and then making small adjustments, but you won't mind thanks to the gorgeous diorama-style graphics.Simcity made it easy to get overzealous, and as your city grew you often found yourself ""putting out fires"" (sometimes literally) to keep it running, the larger the city, the more new wrinkles would show up that you would be constantly addressing. Cities: Skylines takes on a different style, moment-to-moment management of your city is reasonably relaxed, but if you want it to become a powerhouse metropolis, you'll have to master a number of systems and make it as efficient as possible. And then the traffic jams start...I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone looking for a relaxed city builder with enough depth there to chew on if you want it. It's a masterwork of game design and should be experienced by anyone with even a slight interest in city builders, and the Steam Workshop is well-integrated with loads of additional content available.

I can build an enormous city without having to build any satellite  support cities.  :cartwheels:  Add in the Steam Workshop mods and I can customize my gameplay, maps, and buildings to get the exact experience I want.  I was a bit leery of purchasing this as there have been so many let-downs with the city-builders over the last decade.  I'm happy to say Cities: Skylines is the one I've been waiting oh-so-long for.

												I've not come to Cities Skylines via Sim City like many reviewers here.I've always found the idea of City Simulators to be a bit dull, but after reading reviews on Steam and spotting a 50% discount, I took a leap of faith and boy was I impressed !! Building roads, housing, water, electricity, school, police, fire, trash, transportation etc. in such a beautiful sandbox is about as much fun as I 've had on a PC in years.  Making your population happy and making money for expansion is a surprisingly satisfying activity. Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replayability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners. (Sorry guys, I confess I used to think you lot were all wierdos!)Buy it.			"

												Eight hours in and I've been really enjoying it so far. It's very much inspired by the recent Sim City title (the UI is pretty much pulled directly from Sim City) but it makes some very important improvements. The cities are MUCH larger once your city grows and you can expand to additional squares. The game does a better job following individual citizens around the city. Also, the Steam Workshop support is great. There have already been a lot of neat mods and additional assets created and the game has only been out a few days. Also, the price point is better than Sim City's at launch, so that always helps too. If you were disappointed by EA/Maxis' title, check out this one instead. If you haven't played a city simulator game in a long time, this is the one I'd recommend picking up.			"

BRAVO CO!!!!To those of you wondering if this game is not challenging enough for you compared to similarly-styled games, the answer damn well may be yes.  If you want something as ""deep"" as the SimCity series, give the modders a few months to crank out some difficulty adjustment mods and a disaster mod (currently there are no large-scale disasters in the game, just local fires, sickness, etc).  For $30, this game is an absolute steal - but it's going to get a LOT better in the next year as the modders dig their teeth in, so I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting til then to jump in.			"

Probably one of the best city building games I've ever played (Pharoah and maybe SC4 also come up there).Looks and performs great, modding scene is incredible, developers are in touch with the players and keep it updated well, city sizes are very good (and mods enable it to be 25 times larger than the initial starter square). Go for it!			"

												Quite possibly the best $30 you can spend on gaming this year. I have played Simcity since 1 but avoided 5, instead going back to 4 over and over. This has finally scratched the itch and improved on so many things I wish were more flexible / possible in SC4. They sacrified graphics and sound for what matters most in games like this: gameplay. Cities are still beautiful and sound can be turned off, but the amount of flexibility and interaction between the systems is outstanding.Paradox has set a new standard for City builders. Maxis would be proud.			"

(especially the room you could build in)But this game... Ohh this game.... Don't get fooled by my hours i have here... Because i played this game A LOT when i actually had no internet. So steam did not log these hours. It is so damn addicting! All the mods make it even a better experience! So please do take a look at the steam workshop if you have or wanna buy this game!			"

												One of the best city builders out there. Doesn't really have anything new or special just yet but everything you need it to do it does. There were lots of little things I found going through thinking ""that's quite neat"". With continued support over the coming years this can become something fantastic.I definitely recommend.			"

												Its been more than a decade but, 8 hours into the game, I think Simcity 4 finally has a worthy successor, Cities Skylines.This game offers;- A decent artstyle, the first decent replacement of the 2d Simcity style.- Much greater infrastructure detail, customisation & ease of use over SC4- The traffic model appears more realistic and your actions have logical impacts on it - Good modding support and tools- Whilst the scale, in terms of population, is much lower than SC4 it appears more realistic and accurate- I would estimate the maximum city size is 2x the size of the larger city tile in SC4The only negative thing I can say about the game is that it is very difficult to fail, however its something I'm willing to overlook. The unlocking of buildings/services/functions as your city progresses does not feel limiting but serves a vital role in ensuring less experienced/casual players find the game easier to play.90/100Only improvements I can think of would be;Adding a Region, allowing cities to interactAdding multiplayer region or easy way to exchange city tiles.I hope paradox will consider these improvements for the sequel, they are certainly on a distinguished road.

												This game is phenomenal. Not since I first bought and downloaded Minecraft have I played one game for such a long period of time without switching to another game here or there. This game has the feel of a early RollerCoaster Tycoon game where you can tell the developers took pride in creating and perfecting every little detail and aspect of the game. This game is extremely addicting in the best way possible. Your city, the city that you watch rise out of a field of grass, feels alive. There is always a buzz around town and you truly feel like you and your civs are in it together. You feel a sense of obligation to your fellow city members after a while. If there is a traffic problem, you want to fix it for their sake and your own. After you fix that first problem, you look to improve another aspect of how your city is planned. After that, there is something else to improve. You can see why it is so hard to bank that final save of the night and hit that quit button. There are a few little things here and there that aren't perfect in the game yet. Some UI tweaks are needed and the driving AI is in need of an overhaul but for a game that was developed by a team of under 20 people a few minor issues are to be expected. I've seen blockbuster titles being released with more issues than this game. Mod support is incredible in this game as well. I've never seen such a seamless integration with the steam workshop in a game. If there is an issue that you have with an aspect of this game, there is very likely a mod that will change it for you.I would say I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game already and I don't intend on putting it down in the near future. I can only say thank you to a development team that deserves the high praise that this game has garnered. I can only hope that they keep making games that are as simple yet deep with gameplay as Cities: Skylines in the future.			"

												This is a great game. Sim City 4 will still always hold a special place in my heart but this one comes very close, if not with the flaws of Sim City 4 balanced out with this game, it's the same.The game is fluid. I've had a city with almost 100k residents and no lag moving around the city and taking care of things. the game is a bit more challenging though...don't have the right balance of services and your city and you'll crap out. the flaws of this game:* As mentioned, if you don't have the right balance of things your city will fail, and fast. While laying new subway lines for my CBD my population went from around 15k to around 5k. Turns out that portion of my city randomly died, and fast. I then discovered that I had a minor traffic jam in which ambulances were waiting for a red light! One of the major flaws of the game: The emergancy services don't ignore the traffic lights when they're responding to calls - this makes major problems if you have a minor traffic jam, your ambulences are stuck waiting in it and your citizens die.* More onto the above point, if you have a well established public transportation system, 90% of the vehicles on your roadway are AMBULENCES! This is SO annoying. If you need to get precise, no matter where you zoom, you hear the sirens! EVERYONE in your city will call 911 if they have a bloody nose it seems! THIS IS SO ANNOYING.* The landfills have to be placed in the midst of your city, you can't just shove them off in one corner and have your garbage trucks carry the garbage all that way. This is a major problem as the landfills cause ground pollution. Probably not that badly as an incinerator, but with ground pollution near to your residents they'll get sick.* The onramps/offramps look a bit weird and are hard to manage, same with the curves of the roads. Not a game breaker though.All in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It's fantastic, and with a HUGE modding community already going, it'll only get better.			"

												This is the city builder we have been waiting for, for 12 years now. A most worthy successor to Simcity 4, an improvement both in scope and execution over Sim City 2013. Highlights are the Water Physics, the road building (especially the roundabouts and interchanges) and the sheer joy of the soundtrack (and the fact that it runs nice and smooth even with larger cities). Looking forward to future content, both though the modding comunity, and through Colosal Order and their publisher Paradox.Colosal Order, you have done amazing work, big hand to you, and hope you rain down awesome DLC onto us!

												You can tell when a game is created by passionate artists and developers. This could be the SimCity 4 successor that we have been waiting all these years for. Everything that SC2k13 did wrong, Colossal Order tried to make right. City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13. They didn't only make things better, they also introduced many new features such as districts, specialized industrial zones and dynamic water movement. Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn't make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road & highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).This is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.I look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!This game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.

I waited more, they came out with expensive DLC and finally fixed the always online but heard it still had issues with roads and the cities were so small. So I waited for them to fix that. They never did. Price went down. Still had issues, so I waited.They created a game of the year with all the DLC included, fixed a lot of issues and put it on sale for $20.

												This is what SimCity should have been. Instead of shoehorning in city specializations to make up for the tiny cities, this lets you build GIGANTIC, sprawling cities (especially with mods), where traffic and transit flow is hugely important. Even with the unlimited money cheat, this game is surprisingly difficult to master, but it always feels like your actions have an effect. The only downside so far is that you can't really see what parts of the city rich people live in vs. which parts are poor people. Still, anyone who likes city sims is going to love this one.			"

												This game has taken the throne as the ultimate city building game for me, and I don't say this lightly. My first was the original Sim City, because I am old like that. Cities: Skylines is what a modern city builder should be. Plenty of details to dive into, but you can also take a more casual approach, if micromanaging isn't your style. Although some amount of micromanagement interest is probably not a BAD thing in this case (especially when it comes to planning your neighborhoods and traffic). If building cities is your bag, this will not dissapoint.			"

												Finally a game that can rival SimCity 4! Or so I thought. While there is a lot to like here I have some long standing frustrations that still haven't been fully dealt with. The largest by far is the traffic. For goodness sake use ALL the lanes! I'm tired of seeing a huge line of cars in the right lane of a 6 lane road and all of them are going straight. The AI needs a much better system to deciding where the cars should be. This might seem a minor issue (and it was for the most part in SimCity 4), but in Cities Skylines having cars stuck in traffic has a huge negative impact on your service trucks. Very quickly you have the dead overwhelming areas because the traffic is stacked up in one lane. It's irritating and I find myself really only playing the game in bursts. Usually after a new DLC or patch comes out in hopes the various minor things are fixed.Bottom line though... it's really the only strong city builder out there. Its performance exceeds that of Cities XL and XXL and EA just ruined SimCity.			"

												NOTE:  THIS IS NOT THE SAME PUBLISHER THAT MADE CITIES XL,XXL, OR XXXL. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PUBLISHER / DEVELOPER!!!  Now onto the review.The city of Dinosys was faring quite well, it's many citizens bustling about, families had enjoyed themselves and basked in the city's modest taxes and ample parks services, industry toiling away producing superior ""Made in Dinotopia"" goods at a competitive global market rate.Little did the mayor realize, that the placements of too many sewage outtake pipes in a single spot, had reversed the flow of water back into the pump stations.  The city was in trouble, they tried to mitigate the damage by running a new municipal campaign entitled: ""What can brown do for you?  Dinosys' new drinking fad!""  Unfortunately people did not buy it, people left in droves, and those that stayed, welcomed the sweet french kiss of death.TWELVE YEARS.  since SimCity 4 released, the city building fans have waited twelve years for this game.  It is everything that should have been, but now is done right.  Water physics simulation, home permanence for your citizens (unless they die), expandable map size, and.. oh yes..  OFFLINE MODE. Does this game have it's quirks? Yes.  traffic not yielding to emergency vehicles, traffic piling up on one lane while the other lane sits empty, and airplane paths that tend to ignore mountains, and the twitter analogue; Chirper.  Many hate on it, but I use it as a tool, to find the people responsible for tweeting negatively about my mayoral methods, and ENDING THEM.  #NOHOME4U!But that's the niggly bits that will get fixed as time goes on.

												Great game so far. I stayed away from SimCity 2013 after hearing all the bad reviews, although I enjoyed SimCity 4 a great deal. Being able to customize assets with a neat in game tool is pretty sweet. Having the game be very open towards modding is a huge plus too, and hopefully the developers will update the game frequently with bug fixes and new features.What the game should improve on/add -- Population and job density: After upgrading low density commerce and residential to high density (which at first looks like the equivalent of medium density buildings from SimCity 4), the increase in jobs and population per building is quite low. The city I have right now has a decent amount of medium high rises, yet sits only at around 10,000 population. If I had built this city in SimCity 4 I would probably have around double the population I do in Cities: Skylines. I'm sure some modders will fix this, but it would be nice to be fixed in vanilla too.- Allow for roads to be dragged across other roads: Currently if I want to build a 4 lane street and connect across multiple 2 lane streets, I have to drag and connect to the first one, then stop, click again and connect to the 2nd, since if you try to simply drag them across all the roads at once the game brings up the ""space in use"" error. - The graphics: Yes I know graphics aren't everything, and I don't need an amazing looking game for the game to be fun. My beef with the graphics is that the buildings and terrain have this blurry feel to them most of the time, which is acceptable viewing them from a distance, but up close they should be pretty clear to the camera. - The cars: In my opinion they look too plain and generic. Yes they have different colors and types, but for the most part they honestly look like those colored cars from The Game of Life board game. More realistic and detailed cars would be nice to see.- Ability to drive around your city, akin to the U-Drive-It mode from SimCity 4. Definitely not necessary to add in the game, but would be neat to drive around the city, either first person or 3rd person. 1st person would be much cooler, but 3rd person would be easier to code in most likely.Overall I would recommend getting this game if you like city builders. I wouldn't give it a perfect score, as the population/job density issue is really bugging me, but that'll likely get fixed.			"

												Cities Skylines still remains one of the best city builders available in terms of flexibility, available space, mods, and so on.In terms of available space you get a gigantic 9 tile area to work in by default. Which can be expanded with the 25 tile unlock mod. Since maps are different and inevitably cities get built different every time you play you don't unlock these tiles in any particular order either. You just purchase any tile that is next to another tile you already own. Which means you are not locked down to a simple square.There is a LOT of community content now. The game has been out for a while and the workshop is full of mods, maps, and assets to make your game better.  Of course I always recommend first play throughs be straight up vanilla just to get a feel for the unmodded a game. However, there are some real benefits to using mods.That said though I really can not recommend any of the paid DLCs other than After Dark. This was the first DLC they released and it still seems like the most impactful to date. I would have to say that what makes it better is that it provides things that are useful in building the city or in managing the city. This would be, as example, like the Bus Terminal which is an almost necessary thing for managing your city. Using it you can easily see how many of your citizens will travel between your various routes.Snowfall and Natural Disasters on the other hand always seemed, to me at least, more gimmicky than really helpful. Like they were just put in to say ""here is new content. enjoy!"" but they really didnt help anything like After Dark did.  The Snowfall DLC pretty much only gives you the street car (tram) service to help with actually managing your city and everything else is just winter flavored Skylines. Actually one might even say that Snowfall is more hassle that its worth since you have to build in an all white zone which people have complained many times about this causing eye strain and headaches. Then you have specialized services for heating and road maintenance which eats up more of your city resources than you normally would.Natural Disasters is kinda one of those things i remember from the first SimCity game I played as a kid. I remember working on my city and having the a tornado or godzilla go through the city and destroy things. Then I would have to rebuild. Seemed like might be interesting. Not so much though to be honest.Where in that old game when you didnt have much else to worry about except placing power lines and roads... this game you have a lot more to worry about. Probably the least threatening aspect here is the forest fires, but everything else if it hits your city can really be a problem. The thing I find the worst about this, and I have seen this thought elsewhere too, is that I have to spend so many hours building up a great city then a disaster comes and smashes things. Which I am not even one that goes overboard with a huge amount of detail! I have seen streamers that really micromanage on the details and if I put that level of detail in only to have it destroyed I would quit playing.Mass Transit Will be coming out soon and it promises to be another good DLC that will be helpful in many ways. What is known about it right now is that there will be new public transportation added in the paid DLC which will help in managing the city better and the free patch that goes along with the DLC release will have a LOT of quality of life changes which are focused on traffic and transportation.Here is a run down of the DLC content:After Dark:Added PrisonsAdded District Specializations (Industry and Commercial)Added Taxi ServiceAdded Bus Terminal (handles multiple bus lines where citizens can go to change between lines)Added Bicycles and Bicycle Pathssee the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.2.0Snow Fall:Added Winter ThemeAdded Tram ServiceAdded Snow Plow (only on snow maps obviously)Added more energy consumption and heating requirements (..on the snow maps)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.3.0-f4Natural Disasters:Added 7 DisastersAdded Early Warning System (to warn you about disasters happening)Added Helicopter (fire, medical, and police)Added Evacuation Routes (for disaster events)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.6.0Mass Transit:Added MonorailsAdded BlimpsAdded Cable CarsAdded FerriesAdded Transport Hubs (multi-transit buildings ex. monorail+bus terminal)see the full patch here: TBA			"

												Well what can I say. It's a big middle finger to EA's SimCity. There is so much more complexity and entertainment to be found in this game over SC.I've only played 18 Hours of it so far and in that time I've roamed around Los Santos from GTA 5, Venice, France, UK and Gotham.I've ruined two worlds by accidentally polluting the water and putting thousands of people in hospital running up my debt and now finally after those 18 hours I've finally got the hang of the game and I'm now safely running a 30k pop world and rising.PROs- Higher learning curve required over SM- In-depth tax, resource management, budget system- Mods- Large Landscape- Custom MapsCONs- No autosave feature- Mods disable achievements- Manual BulldozerPossible future patches could include the cons listed.An autosave feature would be a godsend, every so often my PC decides to randomly cut off for no reason and if I haven't sayed for quite some time, that's a huge chunk of my time wasted as I'll have to do it all over again.Some mods actually benefit the game without deteriorating from the experience (unlimited cash) such as a the autosave mod.Having to manually click each indivual road or house item can over time become tedious, automating this like the Bulldozer in SM would be beneficial			"

Although linking in the way as simcity would not be needed in singleplayer as the Cities are alredy huge. A mayor buildning would have been cool i guess too. I probably edit this if i come up with more stuff i like/hate.+Huge expansionzones+Play with or without unlimited money+ Great electricity possibilities.+ The whole game feels more fun when it's huge rather than just a small corner of what simcity 4 was like simcity 5.+Tourists and export/import+/- A house for the mayor would have been cool i guess.- It feels like there is a bit few buildnings at times.- No multiplayer- Just made another - for the lolz like as there is nothing bad to say about this game other than this that i can come up with now..

												as you can see i have played for over 500 hours,and i think its a great gameleaves simcity for dead, bit it has its problems.in my humble opinion, it needs something to better manage its resourses, no matter how much industryi have in my city it always runs out of raw materials,but its still exporting materials,cant work that outit could have the same as simcity and allow you to use the recycle center to give resourses from the rubbishto feed industry.this is the only fault i have with the game.fjm1948			"

												Doesn't ♥♥♥♥ up like Sim City did. Probably one of the best city building games I've ever played (Pharoah and maybe SC4 also come up there).Looks and performs great, modding scene is incredible, developers are in touch with the players and keep it updated well, city sizes are very good (and mods enable it to be 25 times larger than the initial starter square). Go for it!			"

												SimCity was one of the very first games I was ever really hooked on.  I vividly remember building cities in black-and-white on my dad's office Macintosh.  Since then I've jumped on pretty much any game that claims to be city-builder-ish.  And not since SimCity 4, over a decade ago, have I had this much fun building a city from scratch.The scale of the space you can build in is great.  Starting with 2km x 2km and eventually expanding out to 9km^2, you can build truly massive cities. What makes that scale even better is you can really divide up your metropolis in a number of ways.  From districts that can have individualized govt policies (legal pot, smoke detector ditribution), to localized city services that aren't connected to the larger grid.  The game gives you a ton of room to experiment.The one big challenge though you'll face is transportation.  Building an effecient city grid of roads, public transit, trains & subways that doesn't have terrible choke points is difficult.  Use of elevated bypasses, rail corridors etc are difficult to plan as you don't get access to them until an hour or more into a game, so you may find yourself abandoning your initial city area to build up things ""properly"" in a newly opened plot of land, then going back and bulldozing your original downtown to start it over again.Beyond the traffic challenge, it can at times be difficult to know why your city isn't growing.  Sometimes demand drops to 0 for no apparant reason, then 5 minutes later skyrockets again.  There's obviously something going on that's pushing down demand, but as a player it's hard to figure out some times.  A few patches to improve UI and reporting will no doubt solve this issue.In the end, the traffic planning and the simulation feedback issues are pretty minor in the face of what's probably the most fun city sim since the glory days of Maxis.  And at what I'd consider a ""budget"" price point, if you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy game.			"

												This is hands-down one of the finest city building games I have ever played.I've enjoyed games throughout the entire Simcity series (from 3000 on and excluding the newest) and on to smaller-scale management games such as the Anno series. Although these are good games, few have been as utterly absorbing as Cities: Skylines.The game is reasonably ""easy"" in the sense that you won't encounter a steep difficulty curve from the economic side of the simulation. That is, you're probably not going to run out of money, and before long your coffers will be so full you'll have more money than spending options.However, the real difficulty comes from the optimization, and it's baked into the game's design so organically that it makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before. If you want a large city with skyscrapers, you will have to get your services in your neighborhoods ""just so"" to get them to appear. You will hit population resistance points where you simply cannot grow unless you've optimized your layout, traffic, services, and so on.The traffic system can be a game unto itself, I found myself spending 45 minutes designing a complex ""spaghetti bowl"" traffic structure in the heart of my city, then watching and fine tuning it for the next hour or two by adding lanes, changing distances, or rerouting traffic to prevent jams. You can even watch the composition of traffic to get hints (lots of trucks means the industrial area is contributing too much traffic, etc.)You'll spend a lot of time looking, and then making small adjustments, but you won't mind thanks to the gorgeous diorama-style graphics.Simcity made it easy to get overzealous, and as your city grew you often found yourself ""putting out fires"" (sometimes literally) to keep it running, the larger the city, the more new wrinkles would show up that you would be constantly addressing. Cities: Skylines takes on a different style, moment-to-moment management of your city is reasonably relaxed, but if you want it to become a powerhouse metropolis, you'll have to master a number of systems and make it as efficient as possible. And then the traffic jams start...I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone looking for a relaxed city builder with enough depth there to chew on if you want it. It's a masterwork of game design and should be experienced by anyone with even a slight interest in city builders, and the Steam Workshop is well-integrated with loads of additional content available.

			Just something different I thought I'd try. So join me as I endeavor to answer, is it worth it? If you enjoy my videos please hit that like button and consider subscribing!		

Fans of city simulation games have bore an itch that has not been scratched. I’ve felt that itch as well, waiting for a quality successor to one of my favorite simulation games, and possibly one of my favorite games I had growing up. That game is SimCity 4. Since SimCity 4 came out in 2003, there has been no game that I felt was worthy of being called it’s successor. Games like Cities: XL and even Maxis’s own SimCity (which came out in 2013) have failed to produce an experience like the ever popular SimCity 4.Cities: Skylines (Which has no relation to the CitiesXL Franchise) is from the makers of the Cities in Motion franchise, a series focused primarily on managing a cities traffic. And funnily enough traffic is one of the few things I believe this game struggles with, but we’ll discuss that later.So first, lets just have a quick overview of the game.After a brief loading screen which provides you with a few random tips and tricks, you’ll be presented with your map. And a message, on the bottom right that serves as a basic and unintrusive tutorial.I generally don’t care for pop-up text tutorials, but I think colossal order did a good job, the tutorial is simple to skip and disable, as well as read and understand, and it doesn’t impact your game in a negative way.In order to build anything you will need a connection with the outside world. You do this by simply selecting the road, being presented with another easy to understand tutorial, and clicking and dragging the road to its desired length. Simple enough right? It’s been done this way in nearly every city sim I’ve ever played, it works, so it doesn’t need fixing. I think that is the same approach colossal order took while developing this game. They took everything that works in a city builder, and put it in the game. For the most part they succeeded. And where they may have failed, both in opinion and reality, users are empowered via to the Steam Workshop to create the game experience they want.This is all they had to do! This is all maxis and ea had to do to create an experience that will last a long time. Simply take what people liked from SimCity 4 and move it into the next generation of modern computing. Thats it.Now, this isn’t to say Cities: Skylines doesn’t have its faults, because it certainly does.There are some minor ones, graphically the game isn’t stunning. There are no filters and it’s just kind of grey. Although the included color correction tool in the options menu may change the visual styling more to your liking, it is very limiting only providing you with 4 options. Perhaps this can be rectified with mods, in fact it may have already been, considering there are over 30,000 mods as of this review.Another gripe I had was the lack of variety in buildings. From a distance this isn’t so noticeable, but zoom in to any one neighborhood, and you will be presented with a plethora of identical looking homes. Both in appearance and color palate. Additionally, the lack of any disaster mechanic such as what you’d find in the SimCity series is disappointing. It could have been a great way to make cities more memorable. Which brings me to another point.Often times I’d find myself playing this game for several hours in one sitting, building a city up from nothing, to a thriving megalopolis. Only to abandon the city the next day I play simply because my cities don’t feel special to me. Perhaps its just a failing of my personal style of play, or perhaps its a strike against Cities: Skylines.One of the primary issues you encounter is traffic. Traffic management quickly becomes your primary concern once your city begins to grow. It is unclear to me if this was by design or simply an undesired consequence of how the game handles “agents.” What I mean by agents is that every single moving speck, also known as your citizens, has a purpose or function, they aren’t simply randomly moving around the city with no purpose. Every delivery truck has a destination and source, just as every citizen has a job and a home. What this means, is that without careful traffic management and planning, you can experience bottlenecks, due to either your own incompetence or perhaps just how the game handles traffic, which seems to direct traffic based on the shortest distance available, and doesn’t take into account congestion.There are some other smaller gripes I have, but traffic is by far the biggest antagonist I have seen. Which brings me to another point. Beyond traffic, there is really not any end goal or ongoing metric that you have to manage. Which can turn some people off if they are looking for the game to tell them what to do, which it really doesn’t. There are some achievements or milestones, based on population which unlock new services. But these stop after 80,000 population. Meaning if you’re playing just to unlock everything, congratulations, you’ve just done it.In addition to milestones as an ongoing goal, you can also unlock unique buildings, which are earned by meeting certain requirements. For example, once your city has the airport, you can unlock the Grand Mall, which improves metrics like tourism, attractiveness and entertainment. But again, this is really all there is if you’re looking for a sense of progression. You have to create your own milestones if you really want to enjoy this game to its fullest extent. But even then, you are not experiencing all this game has to offer.The best way to play this game is with mods. There are a myriad of mods, which promise to fix nearly every problem I have encountered.A mod fixed the obnoxious color of pollution in the water and ground. A mod let me correct the direction of my roads without the need to delete and replace them. They have added in game terraforming, they allow me to place roads on top of roads. In short the possibilities of this game, as well as it’s long term viability are essentially endless. Thanks to the modding support provided by the devs, and the catalyst that is the steam workshop, making the installation of these mod files painless.This is the game that may very well dethrone what is often considered the definitive city builder, SimCity 4.Now, there's simply the matter of answering the original question I posed at the beginning of this video: Is it worth it?Despite it’s minor failings with traffic management and building variety, I think I can confidently say that this game is indeed worth the bargain price of $29.99.

												This is what SimCity should have been. Instead of shoehorning in city specializations to make up for the tiny cities, this lets you build GIGANTIC, sprawling cities (especially with mods), where traffic and transit flow is hugely important. Even with the unlimited money cheat, this game is surprisingly difficult to master, but it always feels like your actions have an effect. The only downside so far is that you can't really see what parts of the city rich people live in vs. which parts are poor people. Still, anyone who likes city sims is going to love this one.			"

												This is the city builder we have been waiting for, for 12 years now. A most worthy successor to Simcity 4, an improvement both in scope and execution over Sim City 2013. Highlights are the Water Physics, the road building (especially the roundabouts and interchanges) and the sheer joy of the soundtrack (and the fact that it runs nice and smooth even with larger cities). Looking forward to future content, both though the modding comunity, and through Colosal Order and their publisher Paradox.Colosal Order, you have done amazing work, big hand to you, and hope you rain down awesome DLC onto us!

												You can tell when a game is created by passionate artists and developers. This could be the SimCity 4 successor that we have been waiting all these years for. Everything that SC2k13 did wrong, Colossal Order tried to make right. City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13. They didn't only make things better, they also introduced many new features such as districts, specialized industrial zones and dynamic water movement. Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn't make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road & highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).This is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.I look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!This game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.

												I love SimCity4. I always end up reinstalling it to have a good city builder fix. It's a shame that there was no SimCity released in 2013. Cities Skylines is just plain fun. It's not overly easy, nor does it punish you, but simply rewards and scolds you for your creativity or ineptitude. There is just so much to it, it's amazing just how damn well this beats runs.			"

												A real return to city building greatness. I approached Cites:Skylines with a small amount of trepidation, I have already been burnt by the disappointment that was the most recent Sim City. However Cities:Skylines is no Sim City clone. Rather it takes a lot of the best elements of the Sim City franchise, and puts them into a very a slick, playable and user friendly package.  The game is friendly to a new user, introducing new elements and features over time in a gated sense, but don't be mistaken it isn't impossible to fail, on my very first city I managed to bankrupt myself before I had proper infrastructure or even a few buildings because of my complex and excessively ambitious waste management and water system. From the get go there is a lot to do providing an engaging experience, but not so much as to overwhelm. There is enough detail and content to introduce the newer player gradually whilst  simultaneously allowing players with more experience new ways to improve and experiment. You start off small, with a few roads and your very most basic amenities and infrastructure for water and electricity. You attract a few hundred people, build a school, and start expanding your commercial center. Before you know it you are the mayor of a town of 50,000, rebuilding motorways, managing 6 lane roundabouts and trying to build a spaghetti roller-coaster of a highway junction to alleviate excessive congestion as traffic pours into your Metropolis to visit your colossal skyscrapers. It is a very satisfying experience, through your own strategy and planning you have turned a small dull field with a few small houses into a buzzing, noisy city with a real character of your own choosing. Despite how enjoyable the game has been so far in the short term, my most considerable worry going into the future is the potential lack of replay value. You build your infrastructure , you grow your city, you put amenities and services. The play pattern every game is pretty much identical, and there are very few randomly generated elements to change this. Combined with the lack of multiplayer capability really begs the question what will keep players coming back for more. However this is certainly somewhat alleviated by the games innate modability and interaction with the steam workshop, which seems to add a lot of capability and even quality of life fixes to the game. This game has such a low price-tag that you could easily get your value for money in a few play throughs, and even if  you do get burnt out there is not much to lose. The game also has all of the appropriate attributes to evolve and grow with the release of DLC and steam workshop content, making it a really appealing prospect to come back to when you feel like a spending your time building a city.The game is fairly slow tempo by design, this shouldn't be a surprise it's being a  city builder not Call of Duty. If slower simulation games (Civilization, city management games, Rome Total War etc) are not to you preference then I can't really suggest this will do much to change that. It's a great game for relaxing, and thinking, but its not high tempo competitive nor challenging game. Though that does not mean it isn't engaging,  there is always something to do and things ever changing as you grow your city, it always keeps the player considering of ways to improve/diversify or grow the city.The lack of multiplayer is a missed opportunity. Had the game had similar multiplayer functionality to the most recent Sim City, such as if there was some way of building concurrent cities that would evolve and change depending on a friend''s decisions in real time would have made for an even more complete experience. At the very least better functionality in terms of sharing cities and visiting cities created by friends would add a lot discussion and interaction, but  I imagine these  features are possibilities for the future, the game itself is a great platform which could be easily extended to a mutliplayer experience which I feel would round off the experience and add significant longevity.  Conclusion4/5. A very good city building simulation that is very accessible, with a user friendly and functional UI and variable gameplay pacing. The game is simultaneously relaxing yet intriguing, and ultimately leaves the player feel very satisfied. The steam workshop, and other modability means the game may continue to grow, but the static gameplay pattern with very little variability or random events and no current multiplayer make the longevity questionable.

I was a bit leery of purchasing this as there have been so many let-downs with the city-builders over the last decade.  I'm happy to say Cities: Skylines is the one I've been waiting oh-so-long for.  If you're at all into city-building simulators don't pass this one by!			"

												I've not come to Cities Skylines via Sim City like many reviewers here.I've always found the idea of City Simulators to be a bit dull, but after reading reviews on Steam and spotting a 50% discount, I took a leap of faith and boy was I impressed !! Building roads, housing, water, electricity, school, police, fire, trash, transportation etc. in such a beautiful sandbox is about as much fun as I 've had on a PC in years.  Making your population happy and making money for expansion is a surprisingly satisfying activity. Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replayability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners. (Sorry guys, I confess I used to think you lot were all wierdos!)Buy it.			"

The maaps are huge (the default 9 tiels is pretty much enough 99% of the time), the economy and simulation aspects feel right, and all in all, this feels like a pretty, better optomised, remake of simcity 4, which is all most people have ever wanted in a city builder anyway!

There is so much in this game that I missed from SimCity 4 that is in this one. Without a doubt, if you loved SimCity 4, then this is the game for you.

												An amazing City Building game that takes personalization to another level! There's a lot of content, enough to have you playing for hours and hours. Most people viewing or playing this game have been introduced to SimCity so I'll break it down. There is more content in this game than in SimCity and it's also HALF the price that was at launch. The Map Sizes, with the current mod, can be up to 25 times the map size in SimCity, most computers cannot handle that though so it's a do at your own risk which is fine. The graphics are great and it runs flawlessly on my i7 4790k. The content for this game has unlimited potential in the future. Basically if you like City Builders and Simulators than this is the game for you, it's what SimCity and Cities XXL should have been, hands down (: Also there really isn't any bugs, at least none that I've experienced so far.

												It's good but it's not perfect. What this game is lacking is some kind of polishing of the underlying game mechanics. It is more of a citypainter than a citybuilder. On normal mode the game is way to easy and the only challenge is to manage the traffic, which has some flaws though. However you can fix it with mods(if they get updated) but you need a very powerful pc if you want to build a large city.Nevertheless this game can provide a lot of fun and you are doing nothing wrong by spending some money on it.

												I bought this game because it was categorically better than Sim City. I invested way more money than I should have in DLCs and the game itself for Sim City, and was massively let down. This game sports one of the largest workshop communities I have ever seen. I have recently met several new friends playing this game where I was able to commission some new pieces in the workshop. I would say it helps if you have a fair size amount of ram on your computer though. I tended to get bored very quickly with what the game initially had to offer and became addicted to utilizing workshop mods and assets. It can take quite the toll on your computer's memory capacity. So ye been warned. However, in my opnion totally worth it. Lmao company even released a free DLC... who does that?!?			"

												An incredible game!If your a fan of building sims this is the one for you. Simcity used to be the daddy back in the day but has slowly gone down hill over the years and became terrible! Games like City XL tried to pick up where Sim city left off but failed in my opinion. Then this little gem appeared. Pretty much blows away the competition. Easy to use, highly detailed down to the fact you can watch a person leave their home and go to work. The company has endorsed modding so the amount of extra content is mind blowing. From basic stuctures to being about to get into a copter and fly around your city. One of the best games of the year so far!10/10 A MUST BUY!			"

												SimCity was one of the very first games I was ever really hooked on.  I vividly remember building cities in black-and-white on my dad's office Macintosh.  Since then I've jumped on pretty much any game that claims to be city-builder-ish.  And not since SimCity 4, over a decade ago, have I had this much fun building a city from scratch.The scale of the space you can build in is great.  Starting with 2km x 2km and eventually expanding out to 9km^2, you can build truly massive cities. What makes that scale even better is you can really divide up your metropolis in a number of ways.  From districts that can have individualized govt policies (legal pot, smoke detector ditribution), to localized city services that aren't connected to the larger grid.  The game gives you a ton of room to experiment.The one big challenge though you'll face is transportation.  Building an effecient city grid of roads, public transit, trains & subways that doesn't have terrible choke points is difficult.  Use of elevated bypasses, rail corridors etc are difficult to plan as you don't get access to them until an hour or more into a game, so you may find yourself abandoning your initial city area to build up things ""properly"" in a newly opened plot of land, then going back and bulldozing your original downtown to start it over again.Beyond the traffic challenge, it can at times be difficult to know why your city isn't growing.  Sometimes demand drops to 0 for no apparant reason, then 5 minutes later skyrockets again.  There's obviously something going on that's pushing down demand, but as a player it's hard to figure out some times.  A few patches to improve UI and reporting will no doubt solve this issue.In the end, the traffic planning and the simulation feedback issues are pretty minor in the face of what's probably the most fun city sim since the glory days of Maxis.  And at what I'd consider a ""budget"" price point, if you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy game.			"

												Realy good game, I'm impressed.It's has what was fun about the older SimCity games in a new way.The only negative thing is built in auto-save is not a thing, you need a mod for that.That means no steam achievments, unless you get a mod for that as well, wich seem like a long way around for a simple feature that could easily be patched in (probably, I'm no game developer).But I still recomend this game!I like it a lot actually :)			"

												*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder. Every single resident in your city has a home, a job, an education (if you build schools that is), and everyone has somewhere they need to go. You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home. As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released.

												Oh dear god. It's like playing Transport Tycoon all over again. I only bought this late yesterday afternoon. 11.3 hours later with boggled eyes and nowhere near enough sleep for a middle aged man.........I gambled on buying this no entirely sure that my PC would even run the game (i5-2310 2.90Ghz, 8Gb RAM, GeForce 560SE) I was suprised to find I was able to run to quite a high detail level. No doubt the bigger a city gets, the more PC power I'd need, but it's trade off I'm more than happy to do. Even at lower detail the game is georgeous.The game is massive and the editor is easy to use. (Oh the water!!!!!) Click on the supplied, in game, Mod to play without running out of cash and you've got a sandbox mode. Pure joy.I recommend the first person view Mod from the Workshop aswell.Score out of ten? I don't know. Poison me with dirty drinking water, take me through traffic chaos to the city hospital and hope I don't end up at the crematorium... ask me then!!!!!!!!Top job, totally recommend, for once the hype was right			"

												Do you want to build and manage a glorious city? The latest SimCity game didn't give you what you wanted?Look no further, Cities: Skylines is there to sate your needs.- Plenty of ways to build and manage your city- Good variety of city customization options- Compelling and refreshing gameplay- ""Easy to learn, hard to master""- Extensive modding support and toolsThis game hasn't been out for a long time at the time of this review but already I dare say this is the best citybuilding game in years. In Cities: Skylines you are responsible to build and manage a city (obviously) and you are given the tools, many tools, to help you in your adventure.Created by the team behind the Cities in Motion games, this game is made by people knowing the genre and this isn't hard to notice. Cities: Skylines features a solid range of tools to make the city you desire, in my opinion far outmatching other games in the genre such as SimCity 5/2013 (given this title was quite horrible to begin with).You build, manage and expand an ever demanding city, capable of surviving on its own. In Cities: Skylines, you are given plenty of options and ways to customize your own city to your heart's desire. With the ability to create districts you can name certain regions of the city as you please and furthermore, even add policies to that specific district or to the entire city. For example, you can ban heavy traffic passing through a peaceful suburban community, making your citizens happier or assign specified industrial areas to promote farming, improving your income from that district.The ability to customize the city goes in depth, if you want you can even rename your city's inhabitants, houses or even cars, if you're into that.As for the core citybuilding itself, it offers solid mechanics and an appealing visual style that should interest every gamer liking the citybuilding genre. Cities: Skylines offers a reasonably sized area to begin with, which seems to be larger than certain other games in the same genre, but when it comes to size this isn't the most impressive: As your city grows, you become able to buy new zones adjecent to your current area, expanding the city. In total, you can create a city nine times the size of the starting map.Not only the size of the map is a big feat of the fame, its mechanics regarding transportation, water and electricity supplies, education, law enforcement and others is well laid out and the city will change for better or worse depending on your urban planning skills. If you want, you can even build a dam to supply your city with the power it needs to flourish. (Though beware, you don't want to have your city upstream of where the dam will be, the reason why should be obvious.)The last thing I'll discuss is one of the best additions to the game, in my honest opinion at least, is the modding support.Cities: Skylines offers great in-game tools to customize the base game to your own desires. With the in-game tools you can not only design your own maps but you can easily design your own buildings, parks or road areas using either existing in-game props or by converting images into the game. If you can't be bothered making your own assets or ""mods"", feel free to browse the Steam Workshop, barely two weeks after launch and this game already features a massive amount of player-made content including several cool and beautiful assets as well as entirely custom made maps (In this case I refer to the GTA: V map 'mod', which displays the game's map remarkably accurate.)All in all, there is nothing that I would critize about this game, it's a solid citybuilder with extensive customization tools, Cities: Skylines is my personal favourite citybuilding game of the last decade.

												This is what Simcity 2013 should have been. It is the only game since simcity 4 in 2003 to achieve this excellent of a complete city managing system, and is equally as supported by some of the best mods on steam. I struggle to think of enough superlatives to describe this game.(warning, it is a very cpu heavy game, not on the gpu. It also eats up ram, a large city would easily use 12gb on its own. If you're sitting on 8gb or less, i would strongly recommend upgrading to 16gb as you will see significant frame increases.)Furthermore, For what feels like the $100 game simcity was going to be, this thing's only $30!! Simcity 2013 was the first and last preorder i ever made, and i feel now that I spent the $30 on simcity, and the $100 on Cities Skylines. Because that is what those two games are worth.You would be a fool not to buy it. "

 INTRO	It's a city builder game, with civil engineering aspect and some creativity as game element.Recommended for those who loves playing Sim City. PROS	 Decent graphic engine for a 2015 game (It's playable on my crappy laptop that runs on GT 720m) Overlay visualization is well designed (Switching between foreground - Underground not confusing me) Building are actually can be modified Milestone will makes you to play more and more as the city growing Lay your city plot carefully, it's the key to enjoy the game You can uprise and downrise the road-line, thus creating tunnel or bridge is easy Roads are actually can be set as single lane (One way) too Mods are available, but it will disable your steam achievement progress City region can be expanded once your city is big enough CONS	 Map variant too few, lucky the community made more than we need Twitter style as quick-tip, sometime the text are skipped due to its border is too small Terraforming is hard to master, for me. At least. Traffic codes are weird, my ambulances and firefighter trucks are heading way farther than it actually can be done. Despite the traffic is less crowded than it currently use as main route. Resulting casualties and burned down building OVERALL RATING : 8/10 "

												Recommended purchase.The idea behind other city simulations finally done better in every aspect. Additionally deep, but not overwhelming, and complex, but not complicated, with a well designed and easy to use and accessible UI. Simply endless fun.If you are looking for city simulators, you can look at all the others - you found the best one here with Cities: Skylines, no doubt and by far.Now, a year after release, there is even a whole scene of YouTubers, who use the unlimited money mod of this game and spend all their time mainly with the design features of the in-game city editor and who then use the city simulation component of the game only to bring life to the backdrop of their creations - much like building a model railroad, only in your computer and way cooler.If you want to just casually play a few hours and create a small town, or if you intend to go deeper into the concepts, that depends practically only on you, on what you want to do with the game. Both seems to be possible with the game, for one part probably because of the game's accessibility.I've bought it shortly after release, about a year ago, and unfortunately didn't play with it since (only 20hrs seeing if it works), until recently.Now, after a three week vacation, one year and two DLC packs later, I can see bazillions of workshop items to enhance the game, tutorials of varying depth and orientation on video platforms and in written form on Steam/reddit/imgur, that can help mastering the challenges of the game with less experimenting and more method and intent from your side. A lot of people have shared their experiences online, go look..During these past three weeks I've spent about 40 more hours with Cities: Skylines, additionally about 10 hours of reading up on actual urban planning science and watching a number of videos from more experienced gamers. Yes, Cities: Skylines is a game, and because of that it is of course a simplified version of reality. The game's challenges are still very much oriented in the real world challenges of urban planning and you can actually verify your own ideas on how to solve any of these situations of growth and tackle the multicausal nature of your city situation.Also, probably because the game's background simulation is much more complex under the hood than it may seem on the surface, every city you may create is an individual bunch of problems and you'll never find any magic bullet solution for any of your problems anywhere. It's amazing to see how playing the game more systematically can enhance your world view.There's usually far more than one way to do things in the game, the creators seem to have encouraged this by their game design and also seem to have encouraged the community to be creative and enhance the game with mods. Under the hood of the game everything looks fairly modern, my fast i7 4GHz gaming rig is actually doing some work here and I haven't even reached the 2^16 simulation agent limit, yet.Anyway, because of its fine surface polish, low price, peaceful and educationally valuable content, this game can be recommended to anyone anyway. It's a fine game no questions asked, no matter for who or how you look at it. It think there can be not much substantial doubt in this. That's why I thought I'd owe this game at least a review, as it is a masterpiece in every aspect I can think of. And I think it was not just one head who created this game, it feels like many people put their best together successfully to create this game.It's especially recommended for people, who look for more than just a timesink and it can probably easily be like that. I think, I'm learning a lot for my life, like multitasking, making better decisions, being more disciplined - just by playing this game. A perfect gift.There's just one other game I know of that I could easily spend hundreds of hours with, and already did. Cities: Skylines is another one in this rare kind.I'm really amazed by what Colossal Order created here and I'm thankful for their efforts. It delivers on pretty much everything I've been waiting for since 1989 and more. Thank you!			"

												I'm not usually a fan of city builder type games, so I only bought Cities: Skylines because it had modding support so I could fix anything I didn't like. Strange thing is I haven't modded Cities: Skylines yet. I've played this game a lot more than my time in game shows because I play on the Linux version on my laptop which never gets a net connection. I don't know if this game was a labour of love but it does have the 'feel' of something created with real care and attention to detail to me and that is quite a rare feeling for me to get while gaming these days. So yes, I like Cities: Skylines a lot. It's about the right level of difficulty so I can relax and watch my city evolve while planning what to do next. The learning curve is quite steady, but there is a level of complexity that does require good planning and observation especially for transportation.			"

												Good game, but lacks something in the later stages. I found that roads (main) and aesthetics become the only long term challanges, however you can make the city work without paying too much attention to these, so it can become pointless if you are willing to have a few traffic jams/ugly interchanges at key places.  Over all worth buying, maybe wait till the sale.  Prepare to be come obsessed with traffic and public trasnport..... Really like the ability to build on, over and under ground. Also the traffic mod to allow you to set traffic rules, such as give way etc is also worth downloading. solid 8/10 "

												Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder game. You don't just place the appropriate buildings to gain their benefit as in other, more plain, city builders. In Cities: Skylines you actually need to plan your city logically. Traffic, pollution, healthcare, deathcare, fire safety, police safety, and disaster safety all matter.A city can be crippled poorly designed intersection(s) and logistics. This can lead to several outcomes. A fire may take out your industry if fire trucks cannot reach the location. Pollution can make people sick. If these sick people die they must be taken to a cemetary. I think it is fun to design cities that effectively mitigate most of these things. Each gameplay is different for me. This is especially true if you play with random disasters. I would recommend this as it certainly adds character to your city and its design.			"

												My specs: Lenovo Y580, gtx 660M, i7-3630QM @2.4GHz, I should mention I'm not a big city builder fan, past exp has been some simcity game 20yrs ago and er...Theme Hospital XD.Pro:+ No online/server/login problems;+ Easy to pickup and start building;+ Vehicles don't suddenly disappear, you can follow them to their destination;+ Great attention to detail, can name anything from people, vehicles, buildings, etc;+ Great visuals, can zoom in/out and follow vehicles;+ Not overcomplicated with stats, graphs, etc;+ Relaxing game, no disasters or anything trying to ruin your city;+ Mods/Workshop, Map and Asset editor already added;+ Freedom to build simple or insanely complex road system;+ Just a well developed game;Cons:- Needs a fast machine to enjoy graphics;- Might not be enough depth for hardcore sim builders;- Will eat a lot of yr time;- No wind pollution;Colossal Order have done a great job in creating a great city builder. There is a huge amount of content already in the base game. Deluxe edition doesn't contain much in game enhancements but if you have the money and don't mind showing your appreciation you should. They have put in everything from the basics of water and elec to build complex road systems, residential, commercial, industry, trains, planes, farms, forestry, hospital, fire stations, police, cemetery.....the list goes on. You can have numerous bus lines, color code each line and the actual bus color changes accordingly!! Fantastic attention to detail. More importantly its all done in a non-complicated and enjoyable experience.You can't change what a farm grows or how big each building is, you manage the overview of a complete city. The main focus is on building an efficient road system. It'll be very difficult to fail if you can do that, but being able to raise/lower roads you can build insanely complex road systems or be as simple as you like and build a quiet little town.A very well polished game, haven't encountered any bugs or crashes. Everything works as you'd expect it. A slow sense of achievement/attachment to your city as it grows. It's great to be able to zoom right in, hear the sounds of city life and just watch.			"

Why not allow tree drops like painting districts???  It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I have to click per tree. I WANT THIS AREA coated in trees...why can't i spend a 1/2 mill  to do it? If it's an issue due to mapping zones that's crazy because Zones are on a predefined grid, while Trees are point to point. so if i have the ""paint the district"" circle in an area, I should be able to fill that area with trees and click/hold and paint it around.

												Visual style might not be appealing to everyone (it seemed quickly-put-together at first), but UI itself is consistent and it's pretty easy to get around all the game's aspects which is a very important aspect for this genre.It is pretty easy to learn (only took me like 5 restarts from scratch lol) and has great creative potential. You will be able to manage transport, provide education and jobs, terraform your peace of land (or buy a new one, pretty cheap too) and build canals and many other things while the little bird at the top of the screen shows you how pleased your citizens are and if there are problems.The game also appears to support mods extensively which is bound to please us PCMasterricers.Pick it up along with 'After Dark' DLC (taxis and some other pretty-important stuff) and you will easily waste dozens of hours in this game without flinching if you are the slightest bit into that sort of thing.chirper/10			"

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the folks who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The scale of the game is simply astonishing, by default the game features a 36km2 map which is almost 10 times the size of the map you’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to 100 km2, which is absolutely enormous. Even though there are no interactions between cities in different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can simply build multiple cities on a single map.Despite the humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find trucks, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargos to their designated factories, citizen actually live in a permanent home, and ambulances that will rush to the scene, then little paramedics will get out of the vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but at the same time it adds so much to experience, water have currents and flows, and you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite side, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even completely drain a lake dry, or accidently flooding your city because you just demolished a dam, playing with water have never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community with the support of Steam Workshop, and lastly accompanied by an unprecedented scale. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city buildiers, especially with the affordable launch price.			"

												This game is just fantastic in every aspect. You can just go ahead and buy it or you can read my experience with Cities: Skylines first if that is your fancy.Game is all around pretty great, satisfactory, balanced and it has a relaxed atmosphere. In this game there is no arsonists or disproportionate crime rate (I am looking at you SimCity!), everything is balanced maybe aside from everyone starting to die at the same time. You can just focus on building a very well designed city while keeping an eye on what your citizens need. Game itself is also constantly updated for balance or various fixes, and they release expansions in a true Paradox fashion by not making you feel like you have to buy it to access every feature on that DLC as they give you most substantial game mechanic updates for free with a patch, but of course for other optional features on that DLC, you are going to need to buy it. Now I will list some aspects of the game that I am enjoying the most;-Your space limitation basically depends on your hardware. For example, game allows you to have 9 tiles which are 2 square kilometers each and even a single tile is pretty big but if you so desire you can go beyond 9 tiles by using a mod to have all 25 tiles , however, if you do not own a powerful machine you will probably not be able to handle all 25 tiles that are filled with people and things.-Traffic. It is plain fun and pretty satisfactory to solve or at least alleviate traffic jams. I've been more focused on solving these problems than to collect garbage, dead people etc. Mainly because of that feeling of satisfaction after solving a traffic jam and seeing that intersection or interchange flowing... it fills me with pure joy just watching them. As I am writing this review I also am watching an interchange that has been flowing thanks to my awesome mayoring skills.-Mods and modding community. Since Colossal Order is not a huge company, naturally they could not fit every little detail they may have wanted to put in the game because they had to focus on more core elements of the game and this is where our lovely modding community comes in. You want limitless money? Sure. What about everything unlocked from the start? You got it! There are also hundreds of assets, maps and game mechanics in the Workshop. Basically, if you want something in the game that had not been put in by the devs themselves it probably exists in the Workshop or you can just make it yourself since asset editor is pretty easy to use as long as you are not planning to make something from ground up, because then you'd need some experience with that kind of stuff.-Colossal Order had said they will be going forward with Paradox model in terms of dlc. So basically, when they are going to put out a DLC, they will give some key features of that DLC for free like Paradox has been doing for their games (CK2, EU4). This is a huge plus in my book. And it also means that they are going to support this game for a very long time and they will not just release a new game every few years.-Paradox Interactive. These guys are the publisher of the game and unlike EA or Ubishit, they are not going suck us dry. I've been enjoying their games for almost a decade now and they have never disappointed me.-Public transport. You can set up your very own subway, bus and regular train stops that are actually helping with the traffic instead of clogging it (I'm looking at you SimCity!). You can set up as many routes as you'd like if you are into that kind of stuff. -Policies and districts. You can set districts. This allows you to create a specialized industry and/or to implement some interesting policies like only high tech buildings, heavy traffic ban, raise taxes for only that specific distirct etc... You can implement policies for the whole region too.- You can flood your city with poop water and watch those miserable scumbags suffer. I sometimes do that to a region just for fun. If I hear someone complaining about garbage not being collected I just plop a landfill on top of that whiny wimp's house. It fills me with joy, try it out.Warnings: If you like the genre I can assure you that you are going to be addicted to this game so beware. It can bring out the dictator in you. Your mind will see things differently when you are outside. For example; yestarday I took the bus for going back home and there was a serious traffic jam. I got up from my seat and started to analyse the road network around me to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. I am a translator but after having played this game I'm thinking of picking up civil engineering it seems fun however in real life you can't just bulldoze something that is in your way which is unfortunate.To sum up, It is a fantastic game all around. If you like the genre and/or disappointed by latest SimCity and Cities XXL, I recommend picking this game up you'll love it. Price tag is also great. Considering they sold ShitCity for 60 dollars... I am pretty sure that I'm forgetting couple of things but alas, I have to go back and bulldoze houses of some whiny asshats. Anyways, thanks if you took the time to read my rather lenghty review. Also, Colossal Order, if you are reading this, THANK YOU! I give this game 1 GabeN (PRAISE HIM!) BUY THIS GAME IN THE NAME OF OUR HOLY SAVIOUR LORD GabeN!			"

												Fantastic game, which was cheaper than SimCity 4.Each person, vehicle seems to be its own entity, but that is great for simulation.You need a good computer for this, it currently takes two cores and my graphics card seems to be running near the max speed. If you put the game into the fastest simulation speed, it takes up four cores. So, that has the hall mark of a well planned multicore support.The only downside I have is that is has the same commercial/offices to residential density problems that SimCIty 4 had. A few people living in apartments, but not enough jobs in buildings of similar size. The residential buildings have 70 people. All these big office buildings, including level 3 have less than 30 workers in them. I'm not sure that 1-2 person per floor (at the taller end) makes sense. This can be fixed with the multitude of mods though and there's enough to satisfy nearly everyone's wishes.Overall, an enjoyable game. Highly recommended.			"

												If you were in any way disappointed by SimCity, you should buy this game. The design shows a passion and love for what makes city-building games great, and the execution is near flawless. The road building tool is absolutely amazing. It is powerful enough to let you solve traffic issues logically, rather than figuring out work-arounds, or just suffering through traffic. That's not to say it's easy, it does constantly present thought provoking puzzles. But each issue with traffic has a HUGE number of solutions, and each one is fun to implement since the tool is so well designed. In fact, just designing interchanges is a blast.The new district feature is the best thing to come to city building games since map creation (also included btw). The control it gives you over your city allows you to build the city you want.The dynamic water adds some incredible life to the maps, which changes as your city grows and you make changes.City expansion makes planning much more complex and fluid than previous city building games. You will find that old strategies have to be rethought in a more realistic way.You can legalize drugs.There are a few bugs, but none are even close to game breaking. No need to wait for a patch, or servers. In it's current state it is the best city-sim I have ever played. I've only been able to play for a few hours so far, but I'm excited to get to the weekend and sink quite a few hours into this gem.9.5/10			"

												This here is hands down the best city simulator on the market right now.Cities: Skylines takes the SimCity formula, builds upon it and then expands it even more, based upon Colossal Order's (the gamedevs) previous game development experience. If SimCity 2013 was too small for you and your people not having a permanent workplace and a home annoyed you immensely, then Cities: Skylines is what you need.Of course, some things that many people enjoyed in SimCity 2013, like modular buildings, are not present in this one, but this is only true for the out-of-the-box game. The wonderful thing about this game is that you have an enormously creative community that publishes a huge amount of mods that range from simple ""quality of life"" fixes to new game mechanics and total revamps. The game provides easy-to-use mod tools that allow you to stop relying on someone to make this thing you always wanted for you and try to create it yourself.All in all, this is is a great game that motivates you to learn new things (like real-world city and road design) and rewards you with stunning views of the masterpiece that you have built - only to encourage you to start a new city that would be even better and creative than the previous one.I have played this game for more than 100 hours and I definitely look forward to playing it more when the new Natural Disasters DLC comes out.

												3/26/15: Fixed Spelling ErrorsCities: Skylines takes the faults in Sim City (2013), fixes them, adds its own style and begins our path to a long and fruitful franchise. It's the spiritual successor of Sim City (RIP Maxis). As the population of your city grows, the game unlocks buildings, monuments, new sources of power and city service buildings to help you craft your city. The best aspect of Skylines, took no more than a few days to take off- the modding community *slow clap*- you guys will continue to drive longevity and replay value by adding new content, imported buildings from past Sim City games, and mods to enhance our experience. Great work so far. Not to take anything away from Colossal Order. These guys fixed a lot of the bugs found in the first weekend in just 4 days. (keep in mind this is a team of 13!) This is the ""Sim City"" we've been waiting for. Could not be more happy.			"

												Now, I am going to take my time to write a review about this. Cities: Skylines is a city building game which I love. Simcity 2013 didn't satisfy me with the lack of realistic detail, mods and big maps like Cities: Skylines did. I have to hand it to Paradox for this game. You all met my satification with a game. The realistic feel to a big city, the amount of amazing detail put into this, THE MASSIVE WORKSHOP.. every little detail and it's still growing. I own nearly every DLC aside from the Natural Disasters DLC, both building addons and the Radio Station DLC due to some reasons. You're paying $17 for a DLC that yes, adds disasters and some more detail, but it still isn't worth $17. The two building DLC's that add new buildings are kind of pointless too considering you could go on the Steam Workshop and find/make your own. I found the Radio Station DLC pretty neat considering it takes away the plain old CSL Soundtrack but I just didn't bother buying it. I have over 100 hours (Yes it isn't a lot but I just made this account in the summer but I've been on this game for 2 years now) in Cities: Skylines and I still love playing it. I recommend this game with the following DLC's: After Dark and Snowfall. Those two DLC's added a lot and I really love them even though I barely use the snowfall maps haha. This game, be warned, is great but it's a pretty tough game to run at times. If you have a lot of items off the Steam Workshop like me, you'll be waiting at the loading screen for a good 5-7 minutes. I'm not complaining at all, but I'm just sending out a warning. I recently bought a new PC with good specs just to run this game. I run it on Very Good graphics at 60 fps while just starting my city/zoomed out but I hit around 25fps when I have a bigger city with around 40,000, lots of assets/props and A LOT of traffic. (This is on a GTX 1060 3gb btw)I do have some pros and cons about the game that I'll explain here:Pros:-Amazing Graphics/Detail  -Good Maps-Lots to do                         -Good AI -Massive Workshop           -Lots of cool DLC'sCons:-Harder game to run (Had to buy new $1300 PC)-Some rip-off DLC's-Traffic can be stupid at times hahaOverall, aside from my bad Pros & Cons list, I highly recommend this game for city builders. It's such a highly detailed game with amazing & fun things to do. 10/10 buy this game, totally worth it! :)			"

												JUST BUY IT10X BETTER THAN SIMCITY 5 (I liked & supported simcity, I believe it got lots of unnecessary stick (but this is developed by a much smaller team and just is so much better)MOD SUPPORT (Remember having to delete every abandoned building on simcity with that annoying buldozer tool - yea theres a mod which automatically destroys each building {http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=406132323} )Want crazy cool intersections in your City which  were impossible to have in simcity? There is a plethera of those on the workshop { http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=255710&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems&days=90}.Want to learn the GTA map before it comes out for the best platform? You sure guessed it, theres a mod for that too {http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=406684124}Seriously, if you are having second thoughts about buying this game, remove your thoughts from your head, it is truly a masterpiece of its own genre.10/10			"

												A city painter that was fun for a while (my play time is in the context of me having the game for two years, trying various mods to improve the simulation and hoping for gameplay-enhancing expansions that never happened).Unfortunately for me, this game is intended for casual and stress-free gaming only.Not recommended if you are after simulation, challenge and replayability in city builders. This game is full of meaningless, unfinished gameplay mechanics.A missed opportunity.			"

												Visual style might not be appealing to everyone (it seemed quickly-put-together at first), but UI itself is consistent and it's pretty easy to get around all the game's aspects which is a very important aspect for this genre.It is pretty easy to learn (only took me like 5 restarts from scratch lol) and has great creative potential. You will be able to manage transport, provide education and jobs, terraform your peace of land (or buy a new one, pretty cheap too) and build canals and many other things while the little bird at the top of the screen shows you how pleased your citizens are and if there are problems.The game also appears to support mods extensively which is bound to please us PCMasterricers.Pick it up along with 'After Dark' DLC (taxis and some other pretty-important stuff) and you will easily waste dozens of hours in this game without flinching if you are the slightest bit into that sort of thing.chirper/10			"

Its published by Paradox, not EA, which means that each DLC will make a huge load of new possibilities insead of just 5 new buildings. The rest is nearly same like in SimCity 2013 ;)For me 9/10 - im sure ill spend over 40 hours playing it, and i will be comming back to this game from time to time after that.			"

												I honestly cannot express how fun this game is to play. I'm currently studying urban and regional planning in college, and when I play city builders, I like the genre (it's helped motivate me to pick my major) and as a result look for something I can both enjoy and get an idea of how to apply principles I'm learning. I can apply what I learn in the game, and apply what I pick up in the game in work. I grew up for years playing SimCity, but I'm genuinely hooked on this, and if you like reasonable zoning development, competent transportation design, and mods galore, please pick up this game.			"

												If you were in any way disappointed by SimCity, you should buy this game. The design shows a passion and love for what makes city-building games great, and the execution is near flawless. The road building tool is absolutely amazing. It is powerful enough to let you solve traffic issues logically, rather than figuring out work-arounds, or just suffering through traffic. That's not to say it's easy, it does constantly present thought provoking puzzles. But each issue with traffic has a HUGE number of solutions, and each one is fun to implement since the tool is so well designed. In fact, just designing interchanges is a blast.The new district feature is the best thing to come to city building games since map creation (also included btw). The control it gives you over your city allows you to build the city you want.The dynamic water adds some incredible life to the maps, which changes as your city grows and you make changes.City expansion makes planning much more complex and fluid than previous city building games. You will find that old strategies have to be rethought in a more realistic way.You can legalize drugs.There are a few bugs, but none are even close to game breaking. No need to wait for a patch, or servers. In it's current state it is the best city-sim I have ever played. I've only been able to play for a few hours so far, but I'm excited to get to the weekend and sink quite a few hours into this gem.9.5/10			"

												Cities: Skylines is everything that Simcity was meant to be and more. With a streamlined interface, well thought out game mechanics, nice graphics and animations, and a massive map size allowing you to potentially build a huge city on, this is by far the best city building sim to date.Most importantly though the developers didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the game with features that nobody wanted, and there is no forced multiplayer or always online requirement. And you can get all this joy for about half the price of most mainstream games.Buy this game. Not just because it is great, but also because the developers deserve your support for making something that all city building fans have been asking for.			"

												The city builder everyone has been waiting for since SC4 is here. Thank goodness.The original SimCity wasn't called a game by Will Wright, it's designer. It was called a software toy. That's because there was no winning or losing beyond some pretty basic functions (like not losing money) but was  a matter of how you wanted to create your city. How do you want your citizens to get to work? Do you want to create a city where most everyone walks through parks and forests? Do you want to create an ultra-dense metropolis? A suburban community? Now Maxis built on that formula and ultimately created the very complex and enjoyable SC4. It wasn't really a software toy any more though. It was a simulation.Skylines takes it back a bit towards the original SimCity. Whatever your dream is, you can pretty much create it in Skylines. This is the type of game where you can spend 30 minutes just building one intersection or do it in 5 second. You can spend hours crafting that new walking path or add 50,000 people to your city in that amount of time. They've added a host of options - road types, pathways, zones, policies which allow you to create most anything you can imagine. It's a ton of fun and harkens back to that Software Toy designation.Now it's not perfect. At times the game isn't challenging enough. You'll find yourself making tons of money and no real problems in your city (besides traffic). Traffic remains a stubborn problem sometimes no matter what you do. Since traffic impedes city services like fire, garbage and so forth it's not always an easy fix. But beyond that there's little challenge. In SC4 it was very easy to mess up the balance of a neighborhood and watch it crumble into decay. Skylines is much more forgiving and the lack of challenge is probably the biggest flaw.At the same time, you play a game like this simply create and have fun. You can create a small town or a massive metropolis. And unlike the Cities XL series, this one has personality. It's cool just following a vehicle around your city. The day/night cycle is interesting. I find the art style cute and the music charming. But what I like most of all is that you can really tailor the game to your goals and then drive forward towards those goals. And when you want to do something different, the game gives you the tools to pursue those new goals. I'm not just plopping down another generic neighborhood. I'm crafting a new development complete with walking trails around a pond. Or I'm crafting the majestic entrance off the freeway to my stunning metropolis. Or I'm crafing a self-sustainable logging community in the foothills, isolated away from the rest of the world. The choice is yours.The Steam Workshop integration helps too. You have many mods, buldings and other options to choose from and that kind of community involvement gave long legs to SC4. Thus Skylines is perfect for all ages and something that most gamers will greatly enjoy.			"

												Best city builder ever. Just wish they would hurry up with the disasters dlc .. If you haven't tried this game, and you really love creating beautiful cities, facing the challenges of city management and transport services, you really should just buy it already! 10/10.			"

Cities: Skylines ReviewIntroductionCities: Skylines is an utterly fantastic game. Paradox to this day has still never failed to deliver a great game. C:S as I will be calling it in this review is by far the greatest city-builder in it's genre. The realism of the game's details is striking and the way you handle your city's economics is not hard at all. Some people (like myself) will compare this to SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow, and at this point it's safe to assume the C:S has blown it out of the water. I'll put it here in bold: C:S is the better buy over SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow. The last EA game that I consider any good at all, was SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition. I've never throughoughly enjoyed a game that was produced by EA after that.Now C:S; yes, there are DLC's. Yes, they are paid for; but here's the beef on that. The base game is so good that the DLC's are out there to futher customize your city. And not cosmetically (essentially), I'm talking like, take for instance Match Day (which is the only free one at this point), it adds a Soccer stadium to the game. Yes it costs alot, yes it looks cool, and yes it actually does something. Your city must be able to handle the traffic flow of people coming in to see games in the stadium. The game events will cause massive influxes of money, but you have to be able to handle it. Point is, the DLC's in this game are useful (except maybe Snowfall, which has a heck a'lot of snow).General GameplayThe eccentricity of C:S compared to other games is incredible. Here I will discuss how and why it is. C:S offers many, many game mechanics that were never seen in previous city builders. One blatent example is the Steam Workshop. C:S has the ability for the community to create new content for the game and upload it so that others can incorporate it into their cities as well. Yes, SimCity 4 had assets (and dependencies, ahhhhhhhh dependencies), but you had to go through all the generic troubles of installing through directories and have the right dependencies (AHHHH). In C:S you check a box. Boom.C:S in-game mechanics include real-time water. I love this feature. I think it's one of the best mechnics in the game. SimCity 4 has water, but it doesnt...really....move. C:S does, and it moves! If you build a dam for hydroelectric energy, you better make sure that it was placed properly because (coming from personal experience) if you don't, and the water level behind the dam surges up and over the river banks and into your city and suddenly you lose half the populous of your city and then there's like no money, and a crap city, then oh well, you done did bad. That is what makes C:S so good. Your decisions make a direct impact on your society (not to say that you can direclty place this kind of house on this kind of zone (and correction, that is possible through assets in the Steam Workshop)).I don't think it's possible to right a review on this type of game without saying that there is quite a bit of a learning curve. C:S has a pretty big learning curve. Each city starts out with 2 highway connections. 1 incoming, and 1 outgoing. The way to plan this first part of your city will be your money maker. If you plan it badly, then your traffic will cause you some headache when you go to fix it and the placement of certain buildings like medical facilites and schools will make you lose money when you discover that they were placed in an area that won't let you upgrade a road, or something of that nature.Keeping on with the learning curve and moving into traffic. Traffic is another animal in this game. Yes, you have to worry about the flow of traffic in your city, becuase if your incoming traffic is being clogged up with trucks and what not becuase they are making this crazy turn in an intersection, it's safe to assume that you can change that into something more useful. The flow of traffic in your city needs to be carefully managed. Traffic is money. Outgoing goods from your industry earns your city money. So does incoming goods to commercial zones. You need to have an efficient route through your city if just passing through and so forth. C:S has spent a good amount of time developing this system and I have to admit, I'm still a little flumouxed on getting certain parts of my city to flow like they should.Last section in mechanics I want to talk about. Land Value. Ever since release, Paradox has added some amazing and cool looking things into the game. Canals for instance (yes, there are canals, and quays (keys), and other environmental tools) will provide a serious land value bonus to an area. The more desireable the city, the more people come, and the more people come, the more money you make. It's a very pleasing sight to see all that green in an area after you plop down a canal and the water is in there (not overflowing into your city as I have had before). The enviornmental set itself is a very intersting tab. Say you are designing a city not for the heck of playing the game, but because you want to design the most cool looking city you can (and you can, with the infinate money mode (screw the citizens!)), take ""Strictoaster"" on YouTube for example. He is a urban designer, that not only does it as his job, but in games such as C:S (his favorite) and Planet Coaster. His work is phenominal. It's a real testiment to the powerful game that C:S is.VisualsC:S is incredibly detailed. If you were to zoom in all the way onto a road, you could see the minute rocks and pieces of stuff that goes into making a road, IN THE ROAD. When it rains, there is flowing water on the sidewalks, and roads. Citizens will pull out their umbrellas and hats (some are caught off-guard and pull out a newspaper over the head). Not to mention the nighttime graphics. I think the best time a city is in the full screenshotting glory (unless you have a beefy computer (That is, better than this one I have)), is at night. The towering lights of skyscrapers, orange glows of the avenue street lights, and the sky-shining lights of suspension bridges over heavy waters. All of that is just incredibly well designed.I will have to throw this in there. C:S does require a bit of a good computer to get the game looking good. Playing it on a 1.4GHz i5 with integrated intel HD 5000 graphics doesn't do much for you (saying that from experience after looking at longer loading times, trees that look like pieces of plastic, and distance rendering that looks like blobs of paint on a box). I would suggest you actually read the system requirements to get the game running.""Re-use"" and Game LengthC:S is a city builder. The sheer amount of time you spend refining your city is enough to keep me realing on one map for weeks. C:S has an infinate amount of hours in it. Theoretically, as long as you don't get bored of it. As soon as you've spent that 3 month period on a city, and you have that feeling that you've done your best and it's done, you can simply start up a new one. On a new map. Or a community created one.Review OutlookMechanics: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Quality over SC:CoT: 10/10Overall: 9/10**Thanks for reading that, that's the longest review I've ever published. :P			"

												Awesome city building game, reminded me of the Simcity 4 days. Bought this last december during the sale and only touched it this week, and it's a great game.Since there's too many things to say, I'll just say it in bullet formatTHE GOOD-Runs decent on my system, it can handle HUGE cities and has no problems whatsoever, it's about time we use that 64bit architecture. although I would say the performance could do a lot more better.-The city/traffic/civilian simulation is realistic. The cars and the people aren't just eyecandy, they actually do something. Everyone has a name, you can see where they live, see that they go to school/work, they buy their stuff and go to malls, etc. They could own a car or use public transport, you can actually follow them and see them do their daily affairs.-Traffic simulation is the best I've seen in ANY game. same with the civilians, there is an economy system and every car in the game has purpose, may it be delivering goods from industrial buildings to commercial buildings, or providing raw materials to industrial, or civilians going to school, work, garbage collectors, etc. -Public Transport is also the best, you can actually setup bus/train/metro lines or setup taxi services, ship lines and airlines, and see them in action and actually serving the civilians who are realistic as well as mentioned above.-The road placement is very flexible and allows you to build roads of all shapes and sizes, you can even adjust the height, up to the underground level. Because of this, Interchanges are in the game(and it's actually useful, because of realistic traffic simulation) and you can also make your own or get pre-made ones from the workshop.-♥♥♥♥ the grid system, you can design cities that have curvy roads, and it's as easy as doing grids, although I personally like doing grid system cities, a lot of people look for this specific feature-lastly, MODS, THOUSANDS OF MODS, are in the game, and If you've played Elder Scrolls, and Half-Life, you'd know how mods vastly improve the gameplay experience, this is one of those games where it's super mod friendly and allows for countless mods for various purposes to be made. Examples are pre-made road designs, new structures, cars, camera tweaks, maps, skins, even ones that make the game more realistic.THE BAD-the only bad thing for me is that it's hard to learn the basics, thankfully we have Steam Guides so I was able to learn the mechanics of the game quickly. Although I would say it's hard because it's that realistic, if you want a good road system you'd have to take a look at real life road systems. so you're not just learning the game mechanics, you're also learning how city traffic and roads work in real life as well.10/10 The best city building game I've played so far, ok the bullet format isn't much of a help, I still wrote a lot of things			"

												If you want a great city building game, look no futher. It allows a high amount of professional and casual customization alike, with easy access and learning curve for the more indepth stuff for even those players like myself who were never really into the genre but had one or two titles we liked in the past 1-2 decades. Most of the (visual) content that's a paid expansion (night life, winter weather) are even included for free for everyone owning the base game, though more features (such as night and snow actually having effect on the city simulation and all the features related) are still of course included only in the DLC, you don't feel like you are missing out on anything if you don't buy them. In fact, it feels like you are getting great stuff for free, well integrated without ""BUY THE DLC TO USE THIS"" messages everywhere (dear EA, Ubisoft, and all you cashgrabs - this is how you make somebody WANT to support your projects).After SimCity2000 I came back to this genre with Topico 3 and I must honestly say that Cities: Skylines is really missing that personal touch Topico 3 had (and 4 lost, haven't played 5), so if you are looking for a mechanically friendly introduction to a complex simulation system, with a bit more ""colder"", professional feeling, Skylines is made for you. Plus it's usually super cheap for everyone like me who'd buy it as an experiment. You see, I don't have an outrageously high time spent with it, I had a single city that I grew bored of and left the game for likely forever, still I look back at it as a great game that was worth it's price on sale. If you are more dedicated to this genre than I am, you just cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines.			"

												-Created railways in downtown area-Trains coming every minutes so the portal keep closes up-Traffic jam everywhere-Built tunnel to prevent traffic jam-Nobody used the tunnel-Built a freeway with 3 lanes-They only use 1 lane-So in the end i created another disctrict to divert the traffic -Then i realized that i can build elevated rail (10/10) Would like to read tutorialSo overall this game is great, i think this is the best city building after simcity 4. The graphic is good. The AI is funny because they uses only 1 of 3 lanes, and i saw they parked they car in one distric then they took metro to another distric etc. I liked most are mods, there are many mods so you won't get easly bored. Recomended for people who like to build city or wants to become mayorSorry for bad grammar			"

												i've only played a few city building/management simulator games, but i'm a fan of the genre. of the ones i've played, cities: skylines is by far the most indepth one i've come across. i almost didn't get it because i worried it would be too much for me to manage and that it would be more frustrating than fun, but i was happily wrong. i really enjoyed picking the right map and environment for the city i wanted to build. then having to make sure each zone had enough water and power while at the same time making sure the city was close, but not too close to the highway and train tracks. it took several attempts before i got a manageable city going. i forgot to put up fire and police departments one time. another time, i built right by the highway, but ended up backing up traffic for miles outside my city. yet another time i didn't set up garbage routes or crematoriums to dispose of the dead. there's so much going on in this game. once i figured out the different public transport systems and how to use them to lighten up traffic flow on the roads, and remembered all the different aspects of city management, i was able to get a good city going and raised it up to about 110K citizens before i moved on to another game. i haven't been back to this game in a while, but i plan on returning to tweak my city designs and expand. i want to unlock and build more of the monuments as well as try out the different DLCs for this game. i picked up the snowfall dlc, but haven't exploed it much beyond using the trams and setting up tram lines in my towns. i want to get and try out the after dark dlc soon too. perhaps i'll updaye my review around then as well			"

												Let's be honest, you are reading reviews because you want reassurance that its a good game.I'll keep it short. Sim City sucked, this doesn't. Collossal Order is still developing DLC for the game with the intent of making the main mechanics free downloads and the paid DLC big extensions. There are tons of mods available (and I mean tons) to plug the gaps that CO left for us to build on (nice way of saying missed).The maps are huge, this is the way Sim City should have been. If you even have a slight leaning towards city simulation games, stop thinking, reward yourself and buy this game.Besides CO are Finnish, and Finnish are nice humble people, and boy do they know their subject matter. Its nice to know that there are ethical developers out there still and I like to reward developers like that who make a game the way gamers want it.UPDATE: While the DLC has been rather ho hum, with such great mods, you can't half blame the developers if they have difficulty finding new things to add. That said, I think they have plenty of space to go, such as being able to edit lanes on a road? Huh CO? Please?BTW the game is still excellent. Still pouring hours into this thing, especially with the awesome new mods that come out everyday.			"

												Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging.EDIT (25/11/'16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs.			"

												This doesn't just hit a home run, Cities SKYLINES bats it out of the park into orbit and to the moon Alice... and then some.9 Hours into this game and I just can't put it down.  NO LAG, NONE, ZIP, ZERO, this game runs SMOOTH (specs below).Started my first city today, messed about for 5-15 minutes getting the feel, then threw that away to start fresh now knowing what I need to do.  Having been playing 'Simcity' since the SNES version was released around 92 or so...Built roads, facilities, zoned as needed.  Plenty of options.  You purchase more map tiles as you go, they are part of your live city.  No loading/saving to access another tile.  This game is downright awesome with that expansion bit - they nailed it.  I mean NAILED IT.  This is the TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE.  THIS IS WHAT SC2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  I'll write this again so everyone can see it. THIS IS THE TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE, THIS IS WHAT SIMCITY 2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  IF YOU LOVED SIMCITY 4 AND PLAY IT TO THIS DAY, BUY THIS.  ENTIRELY WORTH IT, VERY AFFORDABLE!  There was Simcity on the SNES and pc.  Then there was Simcity 2000 on DOS 6.x on the venerable amd 486 66 ...Then there was Simcity 3000... but 2000 and 3000 didn't quite capture the magic that Nintendo put into the SNES version.  For so many years I kept that SNES and Simcity... and then Simcity 4 came out... it was good, but not until Rush Hour expansion was it great.  Rush Hour combined into the Original was also marketed as the Deluxe version.  Adding in the NAM mod to Simcity 4 deluxe made the game really awesome if you were into highway design, and really could excell at traffic management.  Cities XL was buggy, and laggy... and very vague (and therefor frustrating).  Cities XXL had promise but just did not deliver beyond multicore enhancements - it was generally everything (bad with the good) that XL was... re-wrapped into a new package.  Simcity 2013 had promise, but EA's greedyness and needless DRM and small city sizes/day 1 bugs really got the game off to a bad start.  You just couldn't build to your imagination's content like you could in Simcity 4 Deluxe - beyond the initial degridding.  Simcity 2013 was like a demo, a demo of something that could have been so awesome...  but last week... last week I heard some bad news.Maxis, to us City-Building afficianados - was something quite dear - Maxis was shuttered.  The Sims (EU studio) live on, but Simcity, as we know it, was official pulled off life support and pronounced dead... and know I know why.This game.  GOD BLESS THESE DEVS, SKYLINES NAILS IT.  EVERYTHING.  5/5!!!There is SO much realism packed into this game, and many things I did not expect.Traffic management? Check!Ability to build with realism using roads/avenues/bypasses to hearts content? Check!Highways, offramps/onramps buildable?  Check!Multilevel bridge over bridge stuffs for super-snazzy interchanges?  Check! (Roundabout, cloverloaf, diamond, trumpet, freeform entirely -not just PREFABS only, if you like - your imagination and the space available is your only limit)Large expansion of the city as needed?  Check! (more with MOD support)64bit exe and NO memory leaks?  Check!GREAT graphics (for a city builder)?  Check!  [Directx 11 video card required under Windows!]Sufficient sound feedback and decent music?  Check!  (Music in non-intrusive, sound fx I have no complaints on)Good play control/movement/UI design?  Check!Mod support?  Well, not yet - but devs are promising it!Healthcare AND deathcare? EEK!  Check!Trains for passengers AND freight?  Check! Seaports for passengers AND freight?  Check!  (improves industrial demand)Airports to attract more tourists and connect you better to the outside world (and their money!!!)? Check!Ability to creat custom maps and a terrain editor (and importing greyscale heightmaps)? Check!Ability to build in sunny tropical climate, or the more northern latitudes (custom gfx, sun angle)? Check!Broad range of options to customize the game to your hardwares ability/disability?  Check!Alternative ways to solve the many problems you face, and the ability to see you have them? Check & double Check!!!Game breaking bugs?  Nope - not in over 9 hours into it... not anything I can see. No CTDs, no glitchyness, nothing.I could go on and on...  58,000+ people in the city, 6 million in the treasury and making a good income monthly.I just can't seem to want to stop playing or get bored of this... I am absolutely in shock at how good this game is. Simcity 4 Diehards, This is the game WE have been waiting for - do NOT hesitate!  NO REGRETS HERE!THIS GAME IS NOT AND IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CITIES XL OR CITIES XXL IN ANY WAY/SHAPE/FORM, OTHER THAN IT BEING A CITY BUILDER, A GOOD ONE AT THAT, A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE. There are only TWO reasons you should not buy this game. 1.) If you cannot afford it.  The price IS very reasonable - VERY REASONABLE.2.) If you have a video card that is not capable of DirectX 11.  Do not use Intel video, it's glitchy.That said, those on Intel-based laptops, you need to force this game to use the dedicated AMD or NVIDIA gpu, otherwise it will be slow and glitchy defaulting to the laptop's Intel gfx.  You can do this from inside AMD Catylist, or Nvidia Control Panel.  You can find these solutions in the discussion forums here on Steam.  INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED.As stated above, hardware specs are here:i7 4790k @ 4.6ghz on Asus Maximus Hero VII Z97 Chipset motherboard16gb 2400mhz ram (8gb x2) corsair dominatorAsus Radeon 7850 2gb gddr5 [1ghz core] video card with Direct CU II cooling (the don't-ever-hear-it cooler)Dual Toshiba SSD drives in Raid 0 for OS & Games, for quick loading (almost zero load times. maybe a second or two)Soundblaster X-fi Titanium pro soundcardFractal Arc XL case with Seasonic 750 watt PSU, and Phanteks somethin'-14 red coolerI listed everything in the event someone wants to dupe the whole hardware config, game runs AWESOME.  NO LAG on HIGH settings.Seriously, get this game now.  You'll be glad you did.   The devs really got this one right.  Finally, A SIMCITY 4 REPLACEMENT!If you're a small kid with no money, do some extra chores for money!  Paint the dog, wash the lawn, mow the hedges, trim the carpet, vacuum the dishes, sweep the walls, scrub the garden, tiedye your white kittycat, ANYTHING to make money to buy this game (actually forget the bit with the cat, that might get you grounded, or worse, clawed and grounded).Can't wait to see what the NAM team does with this one :)--Cheers guys and good luck!  ... now if I can just kill that annoying little blue bird...***Laptop users DON'T forget if you have intel GFX to make sure this game uses the AMD or NVIDIA GPU!  Desktop users should be just dandy as this issue won't happen.  AGAIN, INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME/POSSIBLY EVER.			"

												Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging.EDIT (25/11/'16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs.			"

												About time we have a good City Builder from a reputed company.After playing this for some time, here are some feedback compared to SimCity4: Deluxe.PRO:1. Game starts as expected. Build some roads, electric, water, and zones.  Bulldozing gives money back instead of costing money.You don't spend money to zone or re-zone.  You can easily lose if you screw up this part. A second failure point that can crop up at this stage is placing something now that creates a pollution hub later.2. There is a lot to manage but you start small - then as you get bigger, the more you need to manage. Progression feels good and appropriate for a game in this genre. Pacing is also smooth. The Pace is dictated by Milestones, as you reach certain goals in the game you get to purchase more land, unlock buildings and more upgrades.3.  Mods in this game are pretty good in their potential.  Anyone can make Assets or Maps.  4. There is enough to simulate to entertain you but there isn't too much depth.  The level of depth feels appropriate.  Not dumbed down by any means.5. Lots of potential room for DLC, Expansions and more content WITHOUT being stripped down to nothing.  This is not a half-game awaiting the rest in microtransactions. CON: No big flaws yet.  1. Some parts of the UI are primitive.  When you click to view Energy, Waste, Fire or Crime, it doesn't tell you how much money you are spending on it. So there is some juggling of one tab to the next.2. You cannot move or re-size the windows that open for you when you click buttons.3. The music could have a better presence.  It is a bit quiet and often I hear nothing but birds.4. ""Forced"" to start small and build big from scratch.  You ""can cheat"" if you like, but playing without cheats you cannot just start building a large city. Some people might dislike having the same starting situation evey single time on terms of what you can build and how you advance.Linear Progression is the rule of this Sandbox.  Fortunately, you can advance in a non-linear way. Overall:  9/10.  The only thing that could have made this game better is to have more control over the size of Zones - the ""Zones"" appear next to road types when you build roads. You don't place ""zones."" Once the road is placed and the ""Zone Spot"" appears next to the road, you may designate that as Residential, Commercial or Industial.This is the best City Builder on the market, period.			"

												Speechless. They listened to us and gave us everything we wanted. Also I have never seen a game where nothing disapears, like cars and people. Every person is accounted for, every car, even dog. Someone drives to the store, then dont just drive into the builder and the car vanishes, nooooo, they acctually park in a parking spot or on the road and walk. SUCH LITTLE DETAIL brings the GAME TO LIFE!!!!			"

												Day One review:GET IT... it's awesome, does have a few glitches, but they will be worked out....DAY TWO UPDATE:Well I'm 18 hours in... I have noticed a few hiccups, I have 2 pc's, one @ Work one @ Home, The work pc is technically slower than my home pc, but loads Skylines quicker. Don't ask why IDK... Also, I was one of those people who subscribed to mods before release, bad move.. Most got duplicated instead of updated, and my game went bonkers, I had to remove each mod in game, which for some reason is a chore, you can only delete one at a time.. Also, gameplay, The core game is weird, and I hung around long enough to get a few acheivements, but I've switched over to Sandbox mode, why? because the finance model is flawed, I can have 10% tax on everyone and still lose money..  I will just play with unlimited funds & a few good unlimited resource mods.. The map editor could use a video tutorial, I have played games with map editors before, but for some reason this editor just doesn't feel as good as it could...So, definitely get this game it is better than SIMCITY & Cities XXL series.. just don't think it's all peaches & creme.. there are some head scratching moments... But CO is good about support for their games...Day 2 update part two:28 Hours in, I have ditched the base game mode for now, the MODS & Sandbox definitely save this game, I have built a city w/ 100,000 people in it, but still somehow, industry didn't have enough people to fill the jobs... REALLY? Also, building up for the monuments is pretty difficult if not somewhat impossible without mods.. I have unlocked 25 city tiles, and have laid out seperate districts, so in a sense, from some screenshots i posted it looks like a free form region builder, instead of the constrained regions of SIMCITY 2013.. I would be able to fill in all the gaps, but That could take a few more days, besides that, a full 2x2km section in my city is all railroads & highways.. I honestly can't see myself going back to no mods, not until some stupid routing bugs get squashed.. Why have 3-6 lane highways? The CIMS only use 1 freaking lane... But other than that, this game does beats the tar out of Simcity as a whole.. I can't see myself ever going back to SIMCITY 4 or 2013.. Skylines has definitely won me over... I am patiently awaiting TUNNELS & major bug fixes..			"

												Refreshing city building game that touches on the roots of the original Sim City games. As a complete package I would rate this game over Sim City and it's expansion pack ""Cities of Tomorrow"". Bigger zones to build out on, basically these equal the size of Sim City regions. Better road management options, better public transport option (subways!), Day/Night cycle based budgeting, mods, great graphics, overall a more complicated but more rewarding game.Couple of things it falls short on would be budgeting, while you have more fine tuned options to adjust your finances, it lacks the ability that Sim City has where you can indivualy reduce/increase funding to say schools. In Cities Skylines if you adjust the budget for Education it affects all schools, so for example one school may need more funding because it overcrowed. By increasing the funding to education it increases all school funding nore matter the type. So while I may now have enough money to suuport the Elementary school, my high school is now over funded. Region play is missing from Cities: Skyline but makes up for it in the size of maps. Plus the avaliability of terraforming and making your own map!Industry is handled better in Sim City than Cities: Skylines hands down. While in Sim City specializing in certain industries (Oil, Ore, etc..) has a progression type mechanic too it, you dont start out with all the goodies. In Skylines you more or less lay down Industry tiles, district it to whatever you're trying to produce (farms for instance) and just kind of let it go. No real interaction with it like there is with Industry in Sim City.In my personal opinion it's still a vastly more fun game and with Steam Workshop support the possiblities are endless!			"

												It's been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, it's been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. It's not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:+ Solid graphics and rich detail.+ Realistic simulation elements.+ Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings.+ Variety of buildings.+ Many customization options.+ Easy-to-use UI.+ Extremely high replay value.+ Mod-friendly with editting tools included.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.+ Pleasant audio/background music.The Bad:+ Lack of random events/natural disasters.+ Graphics could be more life-like.+ Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay.Final Thoughts:Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.			"

												great and not so great at the same time. vanilla game is pretty lacking, DLC overpriced for the content (after dark is borderline), steam workshop really gives it the ""umph"" it needs, very large mod community that does great work. very CPU intensive though the higher your population goes, especially with mods aswell. Vanilla traffic AI is extremely sad, 90% of your population will funnel into the same lane, regardless how many are free and what traffic rules are in place. definitely managable you can force traffic to flow a certain way and it works still, sort of. Mods do answer this, but it adds to the intensive CPU usage.  good builder lots of fun still although does get boring after a bit, the only real challenge after you learn whats going on is battling the awful AI :P,  definitely wait for a sale though or just grab the vanilla game + after dark. the other paid DLCs, youre just paying for weather effects, which is not worth any more than 5$ each imho.

												let me first say that I really really enjoyed this game when I bought it! I spent a lot of my time playing, and I loved it! I finally figured out traffic I think haha. It ran really smoothly, no problems whatsoever! I currently have: Snowfall and Match Day installed.Then the update came, along with the Natural Disasters expansion pack (which I did NOT buy)... I tried running my game and I don't know how to check what FPS it runs at now, but I can't scroll or zoom without very painful delays which end up sending me all over the map, let alone actually do anything. If we could revert to old versions, that'd be great. I'm really sad because this game was so enjoyable and now it's just frustrating to no end and I can't actually play it.Edit: extra comma			"

												I bought the game when it first came out and had fun setting up my cities. My main compliant, is that the AI is dumb and there are to many traffic jams where there shouldnt be any. No matter what you do, it's really hard to fix traffic issues. I also think the DLC is a fu<king joke. Those are things that should be free with an update, no something we should have to pay for. I mean really $15 for night time and $15 for snow??? Those things should be included for FREE, I hate that companies just release stuff like that for more money. If people would stand firm and no buy stuff that should be free, the company would be forced to include it in a update for free. I think the game could be really good, but feel like you're limited in certain areas that you shouldn't be... I don't really think the game will change directions though, so you have to like it for what it is...			"

												As it was said before, this is not an economical simulator. This is just a 'city painter' without any thought behind the game play or any challenge. I really tried to make thing better and installed a bunch of mods supposed to make the game harder or more realistic but in the end it does not help.  You just sit and paint new blocks. That is it. I would recommend to play Sim City 4 with NAM mod instead.			"

												Veteran player of Simcity 4 here - There are a lot of small things that add up to make this game irritating. The UI is too minimalist and text can be hard to read. Instead of a board of advisers with detailed assessments and advice, you're left deciphering a stream of shallow and repetitive tweets (along with zots over buildings in crisis). Road building is less impressive in practice that it looks at first. Creating highway over/underpasses is finnicky and there's no way to remove auto-created stoplights at intersections without mods.			"

Vehicles don't use 2/3-lane road properly, so building larger roads doesn't change a thing to the traffic except making them drive fatser.The buildings are too much the sameThere is no recycling center, who makes a 21st century city building game and does not provide anything else than dumps and incinerators ?It's cheaper than SimCity (2013 version) so it's not a rip-off and at least you can here install mods to improve what you think needs be improved.

												I've played 10 hours and I have seen everything the game has to offer.There's next to no challenge is this game, once you get your city of the ground. After that, it is chugging out more zones for the city to grow.People complaining about not enough healthcare? Dump another hospital somewhere in the vicinity and the issue is solved. Once your city is going money is no longer an issue.This cycle repeats until you are too bored to continue.The only interesting and difficult part is managing your traffic, which is somewhat annoying since you need to reach a certain population milestone before you can start building highways and such, making it hard to plan your infrastructure in advance.There's also this amazing feature of the game (or maybe Unity) eating up as much RAM it can get its hands on. My system has 6GB of RAM and Cities: Skylines decided it should use 4GB of that storing god knows what. Chrome even had to move all of my tabs to the pagefile to make room for the game.This game is fun, but only for a short bit. Don't pay much more than a tenner for this game.			"

												This game is advertised as a 'challenging simulation' so I bought it with expectations to get a city planner/builder with depth, challenge and realism. All I got was a shallow sandbox game. You can spice up the difficulty with a hard mode and mods, which basically results in having less money and income thus having to wait longer to be able to buy the stuff needed to progress.Yet there is nothing that can make up for the lack of more complex game mechanics. The game offers an over the top local traffic simulation which is far from believable and some minor challenges which are easily overcome by building appropriate infrastructure at the right spots.There are indeed a few mechanics where policies and economy matter, but nothing to write home about. In general the game feels incomplete and oversimplified.+ If you like sandbox games with good mod support and simply enjoy building beautiful cities you will probably also like this. - If you're a fan of simulations and believable game worlds you will be highly disappointed. Not worth your time and money. Gets boring quickly and lacks replay value.			"

												Your city is like a painting, but for a paintbrush you use roads and tress, parks and whatnot. There is none of the old Sim City micro management of your city. Sure you can change the tax rates and give few policies but that's about it. It looks nice and is a joy to watch your city grow, but it all feels too empty and gets boring really fast, unless you really like the traffic management. Which is what this game really boils down to. Just have The most efficient transport infrastructure and you are good to go.			"

												This game is good as a City builder sandbox. But will fail to captivate Simcity 4 fans. Why?Because he management part is simple! There is no real challenge to the game thanks to a progression system and the inability to experiment.All these flaws rears it's head 5 hours into the game. Visual and performance-wise it's fine, nothing to really complain about, the workshop would solve the generic art direction. There are few good ideas here and there,  like how far a service can be reached is shown by street instead of the usual circle. There are some other good ideas which seem incomplete or not having a prominent, noticable effect - e.g.: Day and Night budgets.But the game focuses on macro-management rather than micromanagement. Pro: it's less overwhelming for those looking for a sandbox experience.Con : it's too limited for challenges in maintaining a city.  Examples would be how taxation is done, how zones are handled, how structures are available.  All of these have a formula to them, without anything disrupting the formula. The game overall becomes a formula.  No Natural disasters. Fires are harmless and only burns down the building without spreading. The problem solving? Formula!Decision has a consequence, consequence has a solution, 99% it ends there No rinse repeat. Therefore the game just doesn't throw challenges.The progression system is the big deal breaker here. It allows you to play safe without experimentation. In order to get buildings you need to cross a certain amount of population. In my first city I happened to unlock buildings conveniently as I could afford them and sustain them. For some reason it's easy to  earn more money than you spend. There is alot of bad UI decisions, one notable one - the annoying twitter bird, that sits inconvieniently on top-center of the screen. The game is also missing a way to control day and night cycle, however I realized that that would break the game budget mechanic (which allows you to set budget for services based on time - Again a good idea which is very underdeveloped).It's here when the mirror begins to crack. The games popularity and critical acclaim comes from all the anger and spite towards EA's Simcity 5, which I though was such an awful game that people consider mediocre titles like ""Cities Skylines"" as the resurrection of the city building genre which we've been desiring since Cities XL. Yes, that game we would be playing if it wasn't for the crappy engine. Bottom-line, C:S is good as a sandbox for your young one or casual relaxing city building experience. It's bench-marked with SImcity 5, a game which can make a - square drawn in MS paint and exported as a jpeg then renamed to a .exe - look better.Planning takes a backseat here, sadly that part was never advertised. Because this was always advertised as ""A deserved sequel to Simcity 4"". This game seems unfinished and the gameplay is very underdeveloped.			"

												You can stalk your own citizens! I followed a guy named Mark (I forgot his last name). I was for sure Mark was a terrorist. He looked like a terrorist, smelled like a terrorist, and even talked like a terrorist, or so I imagined. He had just gotten off of his boat as a tourist.All his other tourist friends took the subway, but not Mark. Mark took his car... Fishy right? I followed him in his green van. I knew something was up. Who drives a green van? Mark does. He got onto my freeway and this is where I knew it would go down. Traffic was backed up for miles. What did Mark do? He waited, just sat there. His plan was failing, and I knew it. All of the sudden he merged into the left lane. Oh no! His plan was back into action.He later turned into my industrial area. Well played Mark, you though I would be stupid enough to think you worked in industry. Well guess what MARK! I know you were a tourist! You don't work in MY city! He couldn't shake me, and he knew it.He continued on with his plans to terrorize my city! There he drove back onto the freeway. Trying to cover his tracks I see... He merged left. Then left again. He turned... right into my tourist area. How suspicious I thought. He only wanted me to think that he was a tourist in my city. I wouldn't fall for it. He parked his green van on the right side of my road, only this road was no parking! Mark had slipped up. I knew he was up to something as he got out and went to go ""sight see."" I would NOT fall for that Mark. Not this time.Hours passed, days it seemed, and yet he was still sight seeing in my tourist district. I had to think of something before he carried on with his plan. It was too late. Mark got back into his car... I knew this would be it as he turned on his blinker politely and merged back onto my freeway. He was going to blow up my bridge... I saw it in his eyes, eyes that deceived everyone. Those crystal blue eyes hid a dark secret that I had yet to find out.The sweat ran down my face as Mark crossed my bridge. It was safe. But he was heading back to the tourist ships, there he would surely make his move. He didn't... He left my city. Until we meet again Mark. I'm onto you.9/11 ......Mark			"

												Citites: Skylines is both more forgiving and more in-depth than the likes of SimCity 4. Running out of money is a lot tougher, and there's a lot more to manage like the size of your roads, sewage, and cemetaries. The game starts off really slow as, unline in SimCity where unlocks are based on the year, the unlocks here are based on population, so you start off with coal power and no high-density zoning. Over time, the game opens up, and you get a lot of room to build and experiment. If you like city builders, this game is definitely a solid 9/10, it shines in comparison to the likes of the newer and even the classic SimCities.			"

This is truly, an amzing game.As a SimCity player, I found this to be astronomically better than SimCity 5 and topping SimCity 4.First of all, it doesn't force anything to you. You can do whatever you want; create small/big cities, have education or not, even to having parks or not. This game leaves it all to the player to decide.With the addition of Steam Workshop support, you can add different building/vehicle models, as well as having a new Traffic mechanism (with Traffic++), and having the freedom to unlock all 25 tiles.This game will last for decades, just as SimCity 4 did it. It will be fun to play it every years to come, as new expansions come out and as the game evolves to be that one perfect city simulator.There is only one thing that I have a problem with. No, it's not Chirpy, not the stupid ""Have you tried this building yet?"" when I get new assets, no. It's that it doesn't have multiplayer. That is the only thing that I miss from SimCity 5. I don't have the option to play with my friends.If that is no problem for you (as it isn't a big of a problem for me), then you should definitely get this game. I totally recommend it.			"

												See my hours played... 'nuff said.  It still has some UI challenges (counterintuitive/uninformational info screens), but this is a solid must-buy for city builder fans.The developer is a small team, yet still responsive to the player base when bugs ARE found.UPDATE: Adding this three months later. I am still happily playing this thing! The After Dark add-on is my next purchase. For those considering it, if all you want is day-night cycles, you get that for free from the developer. Most of the previous annoying true bugs and limitations (world holes, low polygon limit, drivers lining up in one lane) have been patched now. I want to buy the DLC for the added commercial district specialization (not too excited about prisons, as crime management is not that difficult).Note on the drivers only using one lane: if you're still getting this, it's your road design,not the game. See the citiesskylines reddit for how to fix your roads to prevent it.			"

												The first thing i was extremely happy with is that it was not affiliated, bumped shoulders nor even glimpsed at focus home interactive ( Cities Xl ). Cities: Skylines is a game thats well put together, extremely fun, so much to do in so many aspects of the game and it runs smooth with no issues that i can see.I Love my city builders ever since simcity 4, then simcity 2013 got released and i was let down big time. then came cities xl wow !!!  what a mess of a game that was, i was truly losing faith in city builders since focus home interactive were obviously run by wild monkeys who should just stop now and give up in the gaming industry. But then the day came when cities: Skylines was released and yes i did have my doubts since i have been burnt before. but after purchasing and downloading it, i pressed play and something magical happened it didnt crash, in excitement i quickly drew out roads and placed resedentials and commercials and industrials and laid down power and water and to my amazement my city was coming to life smoothly, beautifully and with ease.Graphics Are Great, NO LAG !! NO LAG WOOHOO, Game Is Amazingly Put Together.The is so much to do and its filled with pure gameplay !!I am definately impressed by this game and look forward to what the developers will do next with this game.10/10 no doubt. they basically learnt from other developers mistakes and created a masterpiece :)			"

												This is my first review I've written, so here it goes.I've played Cities Skylines for 350+ hours so far, including the After Dark DLC, and I can truly say that I am addicted to this game. Ever since it came out on March 10th, I barely have time to play any other game that I've bought because I just can't get enough of it. I downloaded Steam primarily to play this game after playing SimCity 2013 for two years prior.I can honestly say that this game makes up for the mistakes SimCity 2013 made. Cities Skylines contains bigger cities, cims have a home and job which they actually travel to (instead of randomly parking at the nearest home or building), creating your own maps in the map editor, and workshop support which modders have posted some outstanding work on. I could list even more pros but I would be rambling on forever. The other thing I like is that the devs at Colossal Order are actually listening to the community, replying to users questions and concerns, and are working their absolute hardest to satisfy everyone, and if they can't do something, the modders are always willing to give it a try.Now the game is not perfect. It can get laggy (at least for me) sometimes but that's really minor and I can deal with that. I'd like to see some weather changes added to the game but I am in no hurry to see huge updates as the game has surpassed my expectations. I'd like to have the population limit of 1 million increased although, I completely understand why the devs put it in. Although, I thought I saw that in the last update that several limitations were increased, though I can't be sure if the population limit has changed. Other than that, I have no real complaints or concerns at this point and I fully recommend Cities Skylines. If I had to give it a rating, I'd give it 9 out of 10.			"

												Cities: Skylines by itself is enjoyable city management simulation that I have ever played in all the years of city simulation games.Though starting area is small, you could eventually expand to a vast area that you can you can build a different area on the same map like a different town. You can assign policies to specific districts, or the whole city, where you can specify things like free transport, or higher/lower tax just for a district for a specific industry.I have played enough to encounter traffic congestion where finding the source requires careful attention to what caused it. It can be as simple as having too many intersections close together, to as complicated as to how to direct the massively long traffic headed specifically to the cargo ports that weren't somehow using the train freight depot you placed right next to it. Sometimes you find out that using 2 lanes instead of 6 lanes for one-way roundabouts results in smoother traffic. It's something not immediately obvious that you need to think about to solve it. The post-release update that allows tracks and roads to go underground makes building through hills and crowded districts easier.Just as if that is not enough, there are additional content in the Steam Workshop that makes managing things like public transport easier, or you could even create your own assets and maps from within the game itself to publish to the workshop.If you like managing or building cities, this is the game for you!24 November 2016 edit:While After Dark DLC adds day/night cycle, you don't actually need to buy the DLC to experience it. What you do get with it are jails to move criminals away from crowded police stations, massive bus stations (handy for me as I build multiple lines through a busy downtown), taxis for tourists to get around plus deports for the taxis to spawn from. Dedicated bus helps keep your citizens from blocking your buses and taxis. Bicycle lanes too to help your people get around faster, but without the problems of a car. And finally, Leisure and Entertainment districts (you can set them like how you set up different industries). Paid aspect of the DLC isn't really game-changing, but I did it to support the developers.Snowfall DLC – This adds snow-covered maps, plopable buildings unique to it, as well as trams! You don't need to create a new snow map just for trams: it will work with your existing maps along with other utility related features. Heating adds additional difficulty in managing your map, and is somewhat mandatory for snow maps as, if you do nothing about it: surge in temperatures can cause issues for your power supply as electrical heating is the only way for people to keep warm. To bring more efficient heating, just build a heating plant and upgrade your existing pipes for water and sewage. People may not like how the snow is eternal, or not able to convert an existing city, but as someone who rarely ever experience a snow-covered city, I find it quite fun.			"

Simply the best game of its genre. Colossal Order Ltd. (developer) really did their home work on ""How to make City Builder Game"". The game reminds me of Sim City 4 alot. If you liked it as I did, you will definitely love Cities Skylines!You can build huge cities, set up wonky road systems, rename everything, set districts... and much more.If you like city building games, you do not want to miss this one! 5/5			"

												Okay... first things first. You might learn something about yourself playing this game...I enjoyed the simcity series as a kid. It was awesome, building away not having a clue what I was doing. All was well.Until I am 10-15 years older and now I play cities skyline... I learned that I am a perfectionist. I cant get past a population of 15k because I keep restarting again again again and again because of some small fault.I love this game but its also slowly driving me insane.tl;drIf you are a perfectionist, dont buy this game. If you're not, buy it cos its the best damn building game out there.PS. I just wish I wasnt a perfectionist so I could play too :F			"

												Fun, simply and addictive. Skylines has done what the simcities have been failing to do for the last few outings: it's managed to be super fun. Building a city is easy to learn but difficult to master and will always keep you on your toes. The game does a good job of spacing out tasks and demands until you can handle them and never overwhelms you. Your fledgling city will have a host of differnt things you can build, differnt paths you can take and differnt policies you can implement. Well worth every penny. I got it on sale and it feels even sweet. Totally reccomended.			"

												Better than SimCity. Get it.I'll eventually spend the time to write a massive, helpful, and unbiased review, but I want to put at least 75-100 hours into the game and do just about everything first.For now though, I leave you with this:-Traffic is pretty good, there's mods that will make it amazing-Zones are great, there's a mod that makes them even better-Customization is excellent-You don't need to make multiple neighboring cities for your economy to work unlike earlier SimCity games-Adding public transport such as busses and subways actually decreases traffic realistically-Mods actually work and are easy to get-Balancing the budget isn't too difficult after the first city or two, meaning the game becomes a relaxing simulator after a few attempts when you know how to make a proper city.The only complaints I have are:-Need more tutorials or even tutorial maps, please. Not a big deal, just that it took me 50 hours to learn how to 100% properly manage traffic.-Schools in high density residential zones fill up super fast, would have been nice to have larger capacity schools.-Traffic can be a bit overexaggerated sometimes, but mods will help you make traffic better.-Taxes only impact growth and happiness if they're too high (which reduces happiness and growth.), would have been nicer if having low taxes made the city grow faster and more businesses and industry pop up.-The DLCs aren't worth the money (except maybe Snowfall), they just don't add enough, would be better if they were only $5 DLCs or came with the game. Not a huge complaint though.			"

												Fun game, but sort of a more simplistic simcity with not that many small details playing a huge role like in simcity 4. The biggest con is that you can't even play the game on a mac, linux, or a windows 32-bit computer right now. Currently it is 64-bit exclusive making it unplayable for people who bought this game on a os that isn't windows 64-bit. Other than that puffy black eye cities: skylines is probably the best up to date city management game with traffic as the main focus. The modding community is also rapidly growing making this game better by the second with custom buildings and new game mechanics or features to help you grow your city. If you have a 64-bit computer i would recomend this game, but if not you're out of luck because you will not even be able to play it. Oh yeah you can also feed your citizens with poop water and have your cities drown in dead bodies because hearses can't get to them  because everyone is high and will only drive on the right lane.

												Great game and a good simulation, other than being a big middle finger to EA showing them how its done it is a very funtional Simulation. Is it the best? No, but it is good. Add that to a very vibrant modding community and the ease of adding mods to the game then i definatly recommend the game, especailly if its on sale.			"

												Cities: Skylines does a great job of taking the fundamental ideas that Sim City 4 attempted and addressing every issue that the community had with it. The resulting game is something that has the same look and feel of its elder genre brethren but has many of the features the community wanted in it. That doesn't necessarily make it the game that Sim City should aspire to be, indeed Skylines lacks any real originality or direction to where it might be going in the future. It's a solid title, one that plays a heck of a lot better than Sim City 4 did, however it's derivative and the onus is on the community to take it in new and strange directions to help differentiate it from its main competitor. That being said it's still enjoyable to play and most certainly worth its current asking price.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/03/20/cities-skylines-i-am-a-generous-mayor/ "

Full MOD support and updates regularly, they really do a frickin' good job of this. Every city you make is different and the stuff you can create using the asset editor and the map editor is amazing.

That isn't to say it doesn't have its fair share of problems, especially in the way the grids are created in curved roads, or the limited models, or minor issues with traffic pathing, but it generally does significantly better than Simcity 2013. It's very much riding Maxis's (rest in peace) coat tails, but it does it better than they ever could. If you like city builders, this is the one for you.			"

												Cities: Skylines is what the latest Sim City should have been.  A complete city simulation but be warned of the expansions as they do not yeild enough content to warrant the price!   Cities: Skylines in a brief description is a city simulation in which your ultimate goal is to design a city that meets your requirements.  There is no actual objective, no missions, just a pure sandbox play.  You start with a tiny town and slowly grow into a spawling city.  As you level up your city through population milestones you unlock more necessities of a large city.  Proper planning goes a long way when it comes to city and even town design.  You can quickly have a large traffic jam for miles if you don't engineer your roads correctly.  Even if you create a 6 lane highway to bypass traffic, the rules in this game will insist the that inhabitants of the area take the shortest route not the quickest route.  This must be considered when designing the road systems from the very beginning.  It is all too easy to get caught up in building out blocks and areas for your industry and commerce and totally forget about the road requirements.  An easy way to start off is to build a road then delete it, this opens up other roads that are not initally available for some reason.  As you progress you can make freeways, underground roads and suspended roads for more efficient travel.  It takes a civil engineer to make a good road system and I obviously need much to learn in this department despite my advances in understanding how to properly build a road system.  As you grow you zone your areas much like Sim City.  You have your basic residential and commercial and then as you grow you can get into the high density residential (skyscrapers) and high density commercial as well as office space.  Offices provide commerical output and don't generate noise like a typical commerical zone would.  Think an office versus a diner or gas station.  Day and night, rain and fog, as well as snow if you have the expansion are all weather effects.  The day and night were free additions to the game but the expansion for the nights adds other buildings as well.  You can adjust budgets per time of the day.  If you want, you can increase budget during the day hours and decrease the budget for the night hours since they have two independent sliders.  What I find interesting, is that school is also in session at night as well as a few other services that normally wouldn't run during that time.  Elementary at 2 am? Sure thing, get your♥♥♥♥♥to school.  There are mods out there and tons of add-on buildings that people have created using the asset and map editor.  There are so many mods that you could easily fill up a quarter of your harddrive if you went nuts about it.As I continue playing Cities: Ckylines, I find myself always coming back and wanting just 5 more minutes.  Sometimes I'll expand into a brand new district I have planned out and end up wanting to quit in 5 minutes but end up playing another 45.  This game can really take some time out of the day if you let it.  You can design a small town with sewage spilling into the river or expand enough to get water treatment plants and build dams.  If you don't want skyscrapers you can implement policies that limit how big the buildings can get, it is completely up to you.  For what it's worth, I haven't had this great of a time with a city simulation in quite some time.  Since the last Maxis Sim City now that I come to think of it.  With mods, you can easily fix some of the annoying problems like the traffic issue that I explained earlier in that they don't care if the highway is a parking lot, they would rather sit thre than take the new 6 lane bypass you built.  A few other things can get annoying too such as education and the industrial area not building to demographics.  It would have also been nice to deny education to certain schools for a more granular control process but there may also be a mod for that issue as well.A bunch of small issues that don't really get in the way of the big picture.  Build whatever you want, make it look awesome or turn it into North Korea.  Ultimately it is your choice and with a load of maps both official and custom, you won't get bored!			"

												I've always been a fan of sim games, including all of those sim city games that ended up being massive failures. Cities: Skylines is exactly what I was looking for. It's fun, has hidden humor (ever tried following the hurse around?) and you don't need a degree in order to start playing. The price can't be beat, and they've already pushed out free content. That doesn't even begin to touch on the amazing mod community. If you're tired of paying for overpriced city building games, I would certainly reccomend Cities: Skylines, it's hard not to be addicted.			"

												Hey, I have about 20h in at the time of this review, so I think I can make a pretty quick overlook.Short Version: Good Game, I recommend everyone to get this game if you like City Builders/Simulators.Long Version: The game is good but not without its flaws. There are a lot of basic features missing in the game as of 1.1.0. As someone who doesn't like to use mods for anything than aesthetic changes, with this game I felt the need of grabbing a bunch of mods as soon as I understood how the game worked. I hope that the game keeps evolving the way it is, so that eventually I wont have to search for mods to do basic stuff. Overall (Ill get killed for this), I had more fun with SimCity 2013 at the start than with this game, but SC2013 got boring pretty fast, and C:S has a lot of potencial and I see myself playing for much longer than I did SC2013....I hope we get natural disasters at some point, even if they dont occur naturally... It's fun to blow up your city after you're done playing that map. "

												This game is a lot better than Sim City... a LOT better. You can look at other reviews for why but here is why this game is awesome. Ive only played the game for 12 hours and I love it. Its not too much micro managing and not too sandbox. I fell in love when my city began to fall to ruin when my dumbass placed water towers in a heavily polluted industrial area. This quickly made everyone in the city ill and people began to die... rapidly. I went from making 20k+ a week to -10k a week. After I was in debt and lost over half of my city residents I realized what I had done. I fixed the problem and after destroying all of the abandoned houses and whatnot I was back on my feet. That moment when my cash flow was in the positives again was the most glorious moment in any city builder game I have experienced.			"

												One of the best city builders ive played. With the backing of some of the best user created content i have seen this game offers a varied and unique experience on scales that are much more believable than previous city building games yet it is easy to pick up. The size of the buildable area really gives you the flexibility to build your towns and cities how you want them to be rather than being forced into a style based purely on space limitations.For anyone considering buying it or who already owns it, there are a few essential steam workshop items to have:-Road protractor (tells you the angle in degrees and length of any road being built from another road),-Extended Transport UI (makes it much easier to manage your transport routes once they have been placed),-ARIS remove stuck vehicles (requires ARIS skylines overwatch first and gives you the option to click on and then remove  any vehicle in game, which is essential!!),-All areas purchasable (enables the purchase of every tile on each map. You still start with 1 tile and have to purchase the tiles as normal but can build in a 5x5 area which makes the scales feel much more realistic) and finally-Prop Remover (autonomously monitors and removes certain ugly repeating signs such as the donut squirrels and identical illuminous billboards, this also makes my game run a tad smoother, especially at night)			"

												This satisfies my need to lord over things, in a socially acceptable setting. The game has a lot of detail, ( much more than I expected when I picked it up) and the right type of frustration (I KNOW I can do better! START OVER!). No IAP, No  forced cooperation / socialization or external log-ins, No manipulative behaviour meant to induce you to keep playing, and an awesome collection of mod items that enhance the feel, such as an FP camera (ride along with your citizens!), Day/night cycle, and tons of user made aesthetic items. Polished feeling sim done right.			"

												Worth every penny and every GB of RAM on your computer, although I don't like how this game after getting Natural Disasters crashes and gives me the blue screen of death occasionally to this day (yes I reinstalled it, disabled all mods and assets, and make sure my drivers were up to date, I even reset my whole computer) yet it's still crashing, which is why I don't 100% agree with the engine they used to make this game. Although it looks beautiful and extremely realistic, it comes at the cost of lag and lots of crashes (especially if you have a mod and asset addiction like me) unless if you have an extremely good graphics card (I have a Nvidia 750 GTX TI and average 50-80 without mods and max graphics and 24 GB of RAM and with 1257 mods and assets it consumes 21 GB, but has a common chance of not being able to load at all and just crash). All in all, if you have a decent computer and a lot of time to spend, you really should get this game.			"

												This game is incredible. Note that some of the reviews from some well known game review establishments clearly did not play the game but used the infinite money mod and all items unlocked - and then built a megatropolis, and reviewed what the game did after that point, skipping the gameplay and challenge that it requires to even build a city that large. The time it would take to build a city as large as theirs would take upwards of a hundred hours of gameplay.			"

												This game is great, I've had many of sleepless nights building city after city. It take a little to get use to if you never played a city builder game (I've use to play Civ) Traffic takes some getting use to, and how to manage the flow. But after awhile you figure it out or you spend hours reading the guides. There are plenty of mods that will help with traffic to ""tho unless you also add the Achievement Mod you won't get em""The DLC's are decent, tho they are left little to really be mention. Your best bet on the DLC's is to wait for them to go on sale for about 50% off. The makers listen to what you have to say for the most part and it seems they are doing a fairly good job at keeping it intresting. I have yet to experance a CTD even using 26 mods. The more you play the more you figure out that its not as easy as it looks. I've clocked nearly 200 hours on the game and I've only had it little over a month. This game will suck you in and leave you dreaming of what to do next time in your city to make it a little bigger. UPDATE 3/16The new core content they added adds another level to playing, terain improvments and man made rivers, don't expect to get sleep now.......			"

												It has some flaws (like trains not working for s*** without a lot of gimmicks) but it's still the best city builder, period.The biggest con though, for me, is that it doesn't have an ""organig"" city growth and administration mechanic. Everything is more about ""city designing"" if you wish. You end up with cities that are always perfectly planned (the imperfections are only the ones you yourself put in). After you know how the mechanics work there will be little or even nothing to ""suprise"" you during game play. The game ends up being more about aestethics than it is about city management.I'd like so much for the cities to have a more realistic growth feeling.On the other hand, the pros are just way too long to list. It's good, it's beautiful, it's fun to design a city even if managing it is a bit lackluster. And the devs are pretty cool. The workshop and the modding community are phenomenal. Defo a worth buy.The DLCs, though... Not so much. They're ok, but mostly insanely overpriced for what you get.			"

												From loving games such as Sim City and Roller coaster Tycoon I have been looking for a good city management game for some time.  I can spend countless hours reworking roads to improve traffic flow and find laying water pips to be a peaceful experience. If that’s you, you might want to give this game a go. Unlike sim city, which it barrows heavily from there are no disasters. The biggest threat to your citizens will be fire. My few play throws the fire became a pain in how many burnt buildings I had to bulldoze. Though that was partly my fault I got rid of a street connecting the fire house. You could say the game was trying to bring my attention to this by burning the people of my city. City: Skylines is the definition of a city builder simulation game.  Its goal is to give you the tools to create a prosperous city the way you see fit. Through a wonderful mechanic called districts I could regulate an industry heavy district to provide farm goods. Personally I like my cities to be eco-friendly and concentrate on resident happiness instead of trying to make the most profitable city I can. From years of playing these types of games, the fun comes from living the fantasy of running your own city your way. City: Skylines seems to understand this. From their UI and overall look of the game people will compare it to Sim City 2013. Though I think as time goes on people will start to point out how this game sets it self apart. You can only see this through playing it.  It's a warm and welcoming feeling for people that want to dive into a city they can make into their own. This game also comes with a map and assets editor. From little I got to play with this feature I have to say its nice to create your own intersections to use in your maps. It keeps things uniform and saves you time from wasting cash and deleting unnecessary from roads that you have to replace, anyways. The developers have thought of steam workshop integrating from the get go. From seeing games of this type try to integrate other players into your game, like having a multiplayer function I much rather have this type of integration where players can add to each other's cities through making unique props, buildings and intersections. I would recommend this game to anyone that love city management games. It's one of the better ones. "

												The developers took what EA did with Simcity and did the exact opposite.It has modding support, it's an indepth city builder, you aren't limited to one small space (in fact, one segment of the purchasable map in Cities Skylines is about as big as what you get in Simcity - with mods you can purchase 25 or so).The only downside I have to this is the lack of futuristic cities like you get in Simcity. Hopefully it'll be a DLC one day.In short, it's an excellent city builder, and if you have an interest in the genre, it's definitely a 'must buy'.			"

												Once you have started playing this game, time will move in light speed, and suddenly it is another day.The city is so beautiful. Browsing it with different views make me feel like travelling to another city in real world.But some drawbacks:- No tutorial at all. It only has some help boxes. Youtube videos are way better than that.- Without unlimited money, it is a bit tough when starting a new game, mainly due to the lack of loan for the first level.- The minimum requirement is a lie. Even the 6GB Ram in recommended requirement is questionable. I have installed some assets and the game has already used up all of my 8GB Ram.- DLCssssssss. I understand they need money. But I'm really not a fan of this approach.			"

												I was curious how this game compares to older SimCity titles - especially Simcity 4 and 3000, which i played a lot. In term of game mechanics it is very similiar though I think it is superior to Maxis productions. After spending few hours ""ingame"" I think its far more worthy successor than Simcity5 and I would deffinitle recomend Cities: Skylines to anyone. I was impressed how city becomes more difficult to be governed during longer game - feels natural as more citizens mean far more problems.Pros: quite simple mechanics for begginers though... the game gets way more difficult as the city grows :) all the traffic and municipal problems seem very natural great workshop items and mods.Cons: none!

												Every other major critic has said it. this game is everything that sim city promised it would be. These game developers actually care and love their game. They go the extra mile while EA merely plots the demise of another of its ""aquired"" game stuidios. 30/10 guys. this is a game that is beyond what i expected and beyond what i hoped for. Keep going Keep to the spirit you guys put into this game and stay independant! With continued releases like this you can easily join the annals of game studios such as Rockstar Games, and Valve.-Your city can be as little or as big as you like it (with mod support you can have cities in the hundreds if not thousands of cubic km big)-Everything you do has its impact, traffic is a genuine thing to manage and consider, planning and thoughtfulness go into play when sculpting your dream city-Mod support makes the game unbelevably easy to change and freshen up, (theirs litteral modception going on in the workshop over this game) and much much much more. their is genuinely too much to put into a review so the best thing i can say is spend that cash, get the game. i promise you its going to be one of the more sound game options your going to get.
