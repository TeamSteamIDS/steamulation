												This game has been uninstalled on My PC since the first 143 seconds of opening it up. I'm not sure I would even call this a ""game"" as it is more like a powerpoint presentation. Windows notepad is more fun than this program. The menu is horrid, the grammar is horrid, player names are spelt incorrectly. I still see this in my game library at times and have even googled ""how to dis-own a steam game""  because it insults my library by just being there in the list.If I didn't already own this game, and Steam were forceably giving it to people with an option of paying $2 to NOT own it, then I would pay.That is how bad it is. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!			"

												This is a very nice game but I recommend it only to die hard ""Old School"" manager games fans. The rest better stay away from this.Also the steam version of the game is buggy. You must apply the following fix in order to play the matches:1. Disable temporarily windows UAC. (Here is how: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/turn-user-account-control-on-or-off )2. Download www.wbmgame.com/files/registerdx8.zipUnzip inside ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\world basketball manager 2010"" and double click. Note that if you are using Vista or Windows7 you must right click the file and select ""Run as administrator""This is from the official website FAQ & Tech Support: www.wbmgame.comThere is also a 2014 version there that is bug free.

												Steve Jones was in the zone. His managing skills had hit the apex of humanity's feeble, singleminded attempts at managing robotic basketball players on his computer. Staring intently at his Excel spreadsheet detailing down-to-the-decimal statistics about each player, he leaned down to nose level with his desk and snorted an expertly cut line of cocaine without ever taking his eyes off of the computer screen. He needed to manage this team and he needed to manage it faster than the entire world.""Honey?"" his wife said, poking her head into his management domain. She had broken the sacred vows of all basketball manager wives and invaded his spreadsheet galaxy. ""I heard screaming earlier. Are you alright?""Without hesitation, Steve Jones, spreadsheet king, whipped his arm around with a Colt Python in his hand and slaughtered Marla Jones, victim of another basketball management homicide, without looking away from the monitor.

												If anybody played football/soccer managers and the like then this is similar, although very primitive in form. I couldn't recommend it because its gameplay is bugged, I even created a ""superman"" team by editing the player's statistics and they had problems performing anyway. You also need to go to the producer's site to download other essential files, like the real names of the players and here's the worst part: if you bought it on Steam they want you to pay extra money for new updates. 1/10, although the concept is nice so 2/10 in its current form on steam.

												I've played a lot of fantasy basketball, but this program takes micromanagement to daunting levels. Not only do you have to micromanage a local professional team, you also have to micromanage the national team. The overwhelming number of options are frustratingly tedious plus the poorly implemented user inferface makes it painful to even want to learn how to use it. Add a dreadfully slow player database on top of an eyesore background color and this is nothing short of a disaster.I did find their database comical in the sense that they copied all real world player/team names and made one vowel changes to those names. It seems like NBA intellectual property infringement to me. Regardless, this program isn't worth any investment of time or energy. You are better served playing Yahoo! fantasy basketball or some other derivative.			"

												After playing for about one hour i feel like im in a position to review this game.The bad points, the game allows you to play as any team from around the world including the Baston Ciltics and european teams such as the Niwcastle Eegles. And thats where it ends, it claws back respect and rating with;The game cant spell team names correctly, it gives you no guidance as to how to play, it crashes and just freezes whenever you go to a match (when youve worked that out). The graphics are next-gen, beutiful, all the time people were walking past saying ""are you watching a game"" and then couldnt believe it when i said  ""no its world basketball manager"". The developers clearly spent a lot of time getting the player models right and everything else looking crisp.To conclude this is an amazing game which any Basketball fan around the world should purchase, and for under £1 why wouldnt you? The game is amazingly polished with NO BUGS AT ALL and can be run on anything. If anyone has been toying between this and one of the NBA games made by 2k i'd pick world basketball manager in an instant.10/10 a masterpiece			"

												Once upon a midnight dreary, while I played vidya weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of the steam store,While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of someone gently jamming, slamming at my bedroom door.`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `dribbling at my bedroom door -Only this, and nothing more.'And the faint echoes of earthen dribbling had come ascertainThrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating`'Tis my mother entreating entrance at my bedroom door -My dear mother entreating entrance at my bedroom door; -This it is, and nothing more,'Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,`Mum,' said I, `or father, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came slamming,And so faintly you came jamming, jamming at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -Darkness there, and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a slammin’ somewhat louder than before.`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;Let me see then, what thereat is, then return to games once more -Let my heart be still a moment and then to games once more; -'Tis my mum and nothing more!'Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a hop-step and flutter,In there stepped Charles Wade Barkley of the saintly days of yore.Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, over mien head and body, dunked above my bedroom door -Dunked upon a mini hoop just above my bedroom door -Dunked, then stood, and nothing more.Then this ebony man beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,`Yo, thy game be weak and lackin’, thou,' he said, `be thee slackin’.Playing these games that do not feature dunkin’ and 3 point scores – You shall play World Basketball Manager and nothing more!’Quoth the Barkley, `Nothing more.'Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,`Doubtless,' said I, `I have other options of the steam store,So many games  I have master and many yet thereafterTo play just one video game would surely begin to bore – Till the game had worn out oneself to become an eyesore’‘Nay’, I said, ‘I will play more.'But Barkley began jamming with his ball he was slamming,Slam dunked over my head which had sent me to my bedroom floor;Then, upon thoughts retrieving, I betook myself to seeingThe dunking would not cease if I not accept Barkley’s choreUpon which I would play just World Basketball, and nothing moreQuoth the Barkley, `Nothing more.'This I sat engaged in passing with each hour amassingBegan to wear and tear at me, shaking my soul’s very coreThis and more I sat playing, and my thoughts began fadingInto dribbling, passing, shooting, and increasing my team's score,The night began to cede day, thine eyes began to glossen o’er,Sleep I shall, ah, nevermore!Then, me thoughts finally gathered, finally awaken to this hazardFor a moment braver than the peril of a dunk once more.`CHARLES,' I cried, `by which God hath sent thee - by whichever name I do plea!Respite - respite that I may play this video game no more!There are a wondrous many games mein youth hath yet to explore!'Quoth the Barkley, `Nevermore.'`Barkley!' said I, `thing of evil! - mercy parts, if man or devil! -Thou cannot expect that I dunk in this game anymore,Part my freedom Round Mound, Sir Charles of the ReboundNo less than a ‘undred hours played as you have implore -Please, please I cannot hit more baskets, release me I implore!'Quoth the Barkley, `Nevermore.'`Barkley!' said I, `thing of evil! – curse thee balded devil!I am Canadian, it is hockey that I should adore -I need ice- not floors wooden, equip with skates- not Air Jordan’s.Why task me with hours of fade shots and layups to shoot for -By which sin, wickedness, or folly am I answering for?'Quoth the Barkley, `Nevermore.'`No more of this defensive guarding, dribbles, or dunks,' I shrieked upstarting -`Get thee back into the court and leave me to games once more!Leave me so my soul unbroken may have rest for yet a moment!I beg you Barkley, leave me and do not dunk upon my door!I wish to live free; to marry, grow old, and see the sun once more!'Quoth the Barkley, `Nevermore.'And the Barkley, never flitting, still is dribbling, still is dribblingOn the soft echoing boards laying still on my bedroom floor;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floorBasketball - and nothing more!

												After experiencing 0.2 hours of this masterpiece I am now able to close the game for a second and write this review. First of all the game does not work in full screen view, this is an amazing design feature as now people with low-end rigs will be able to play this game, maybe the devs copied Realm Of The Mad God a game that can only be played in windowed mode. Secondly the interface is also amazing the spinning basketball in the top left really creates next generation physics and graphics. Also the fact that there is no tutorial and I still have not played a game yet because I don't know how really shows the devs respect long time gamers of this franchise. The game also has very long load times that means you can do other things while it loads amazing work from the devs. The game also has no Licensing this mean the actual names of teams have been edited for a more emersive experiance, my local team is now called the 'Niwcastle Eegles'. In conclustion I would say this game is very much in contertion for GOTY and possibly even game of the decade if there is one, I am looking forward to World Basketball Manager 2011 and can't wait for future updates to make the game even better. £0.34 well spent.10.2/10			"

Really? you do? are you ♥♥♥♥in' psycho? nevermind, Well this is the game for you!As far as i can tell this is a ugly menu simulator with a vague basketball skin. 8/8 is gr8 no deb8			"

												From kid, to Kobe. Ever wanted to be a black man and not the feeble cracker you are, well i have. This game was quality, it made me slam dunk like i was up there with MJ himself, michael jordan not michael jackson, michael jackson touches kids balls not dunks them. But lets get back on topic. WBM10 is the game for any enthusiast of baseball!			"

												HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING MANAGER GAME I EVER SPENT 15 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO START THE GAME IN!Seriously. Windowed mode doesn't even display the ""PROCEED"" button at the bottom right of the interface. It took desperation full screen mode to figure that out. Top that off with a lack of any sort of instructions, much less a tutorial, and the slowest system I think I've yet seen amongst ""manger"" games, and... well, yeah. Progress bars online. Wait, that would be cooler than this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												So frustrated, basically unplayable.  I was hoping so badly for this just to be decent... that's all I wanted, a DECENT game here.  I wasn't expecting the stars, just to be able to be lost in Training and Acquiring Players and seeing my decisions impact the outcome on the Courts.Problem is... I can't get to the Courts.  Game stalls out every single time I try to play the first Game.  Every single time.  I've yet to see any of the 'Season', and I've tried for over 130 HOURS!!!			"

												I do not recommend this one. Bought because I thought I would enjoy a game with all the management aspects of basketball. It is not a good game, the UI is all over the place plus not it is very dated.			"
