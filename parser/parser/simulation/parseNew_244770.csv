								My first StarMade Experience: 1st-2nd hours:I get on the server (redshift). I am so damn overwhelmed by the cool spawn and spaceships docked there. I have no idea of what to do, so I request help from a fellow player. One thing leads to another, and I am now in this guy's faction. its just the guy, his friend, and me. He surprisingly has about six ships, 2 for mining, one with a jump drive, a few fighters, and some other huge ship with unknown purpose,also a space station orbiting a terraformed planet. Guy teaches me the basics, and then logs off. You can not blame me for wanting to try out the stuff. First I try building my own ship, a core, a power supply and a thruster, and I realize the ship is simple and fast. I land on the planet. I forget to press shift. ship flies off even with me getting out of it. I'm stranded in the planet. SHEEEEIIIIT. I start mining blocks, and build a pilar trying to reach the space station. I am successful, and get back on. 3rd Hour:I now am familiar with the basic controls of the game (I took a while to get used to the controls of this one). I am curious, so I decide to take the warpship for a spin. The jumpdrive jumps about 8 sectors per jump. I start charging and jumping all over the universe,the setting is relaxed, I'm listening to some slow trance,and I am actually having a lot of fun exploring. Suddenly I see another station. ""I should dock there"" I thought. As I arrive near the foreign station my systems begin to fail, and I start getting blasted. I mean BLASTED by lazers and projectiles of all sorts. The ship is dead. THE SHIP IS ♥♥♥♥ING DEAD!!! THE GUY IS GONNA KILL ME!!!!!! How would I look him in the eyes, the one person who helped me out, who took me under his wing, I was ashamed. I managed to find my way back to my faction's station, and about half hour later the faction leader who took me in logged on. oshitoshitoshitoshitosheeit. First thing he asks me: ""hey man, have you seen the jumpship, you know the one that looks kind of like a satellite?"" ""Y-yes I s-s-aw s-someone stealing it"". He looked at me, then he kicked me out of the faction, and blew me back to spawn.10/10 would steal a jumpship and lie about it again "

Early Access Review
								On my daily game browsing, I was looking for anything interesting. I came across this game. This is one of the coolest games I have ever played. Some people say this is a Space Engineers clone...it is not. And I am sure (Idk who or why) someone has called this a Minecraft clone...GOD no. (It's in space, come on now.) I will break this up into different sections, with a TL;DR at the end, as well as a section for those who read the whole thing! Thank you.ONE MORE THING: The demo unlocks the whole game for free. The developer said it will stay that way until it goes out of early access, and that buying it is mainly just to support development.Why it is awesome:1. Customization. You can build any kind of ship you want. A ship for transporting things, a ship for mining, a fighter, a massive battle ship, a mining ship with salvage beams (Those are beams that mine for you. SO you shoot at something, it being an ore, rock, or even parts of another ship or station) or any combination of all. (This is not all, of course)2. Fighting. The fighting is incredible and fun, and fast paced action. It is like a Star Wars battle. You can have your fleet of 20 ships versus another player's fleet of 20 ships or against Space Pirates, or in single player, you versus a bunch of pirates (Idk yet if you can have computer controlled fighting allies in singleplayer) The complex weapons systems are for a whole other part of the review.3. The complex weapons systems. There is the basic cannons, lasers, and missiles, and they are fun and damaging. You can make the cannons and any other weapon touch each other to make 1 very damaging weapon, or you can space them out to have many of that weapon firing at once. Here is where it gets complex. You can combine weapons. *SPOILER HERE* So you can combine the cannon and the missile to make a shotgun like weapon on your ship. *SPOILER END* Cool right? And there are over 80 combinations (so I have read). So lots of fun to be had with weapons. (And don't be afraid to stack them up a ton. If you have the weapons available, and the power available, make some crazy weapons systems.)4. NPCs. This is where Space Engineers is lacking so far, but will have them in the future. There are, like I said, Space Pirates. They have killed me many times. But if you have the power and the numbers, fight them back and steal from them and you shall be granted rich reward...so I assume. There are also NPCs at some shops.5. Shops. You can go to a shop and buy anything in the game. You need a lot of money for many things, but you can get a lot of money fairly easy with the right knowledge of what is really valuable, like ores and glass. (More fun with shops later in the review)6 Space Stations. You can do a lot of the same stuff with stations that you can do with ships. I am not sure what it has weapons wise, but I am sure there are good things with that. I know there are turrets. Automated turrets and controllable I think. Very customizable. To make a space station though, you need 1,000,000 credits. Which tbh, isn't that bad. I saw one guy get like 2 million credits from selling a bunch of salvaged (collected) glass. And with a faction you can claim a station as yours and make it invulnerable to damage and stealing. It also makes any docked ships invulnerable too. So griefers aren't a problem with this HAHA! 7. Factions. You can make a faction and build on faction points with players to join it (Idk if npcs can join or not), taking over sectors and systems, defeating enemies, and so on. With a faction you can claim a space station and make it invulnerable to damage and stealing. And you can claim a whole system as your territory. Again, there are 128 x 128 x 128 (I think) sectors in a system, so that is a TON of space as yours. With a faction, you can also make your own shops! You can price items how you want, decide what is on your market, and sell things to other players, and maybe even npcs. (You may not need a faction, you may only need a space station to make a shop. I can't remember) And with a faction you can keep growing your territory until you take over everything MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! (Not even kidding though)8. Build mode/Advanced build mode. Who doesn't love a good build mode for easy ship/station construction? With regular build mode you can do all the basic stuff like placing/deleting blocks, flying, sped up flying, connecting blocks and groups, and all that stuff. With advanced build mode, you can use symmetry (For precise building), copy/pasting/saving pieces of ships or stations as templates, mass building with placing up to 10 blocks in every axis at a time (So you can build a 10 x 10 x 10 cube with one click), rotating blocks, and a few other things. So very fun and easy to use. Makes for easy building of a massive ship.9. Jump drives/Warp gates. *SPOILER HERE* The jump drives and warp gates are a great way to get around fast, but you need alot of power. With a jump drive, you can ""jump"" up to 8 sectors away. With warp gates, (I think) you can warp up to 128 sectors away. So very convenient.10. Asteroids, planets, stars, stations. These are all procedurally generated. Very cool.Now, for the cons. However, some of these are personal opinions and may not matter to you.1. *PERSONAL OPINION* This game has blocks, not voxels. Sometimes I prefer voxels instead of blocks because realistic smooth surface terrain is cool, but it is not a big deal, this game is still great.2. Memory issues. I have noticed a lot of people having memory issues where it gets very laggy and a message pops up in game and says you are running low on memory, and to increase the max and min memory in the launcher, you can edit the memory settings like it says, but some people still get the issue. I have fixed it for the most part, but some people can't. Maybe the devs will fix this or optimize it.Other than these, that's all I got for the cons. Great right? lolNow, this section is WHY it is NOT a clone of Space Engineers.1. It is blocks, not voxels.2. It has planets, stars (Stars that you can actually go to and burn up and die, not just the background sun), sectors, systems, and galaxies.3. It ALREADY has NPCs, I know SE will have them, but this game already does.4. It has customizable weapons and complex combination systems.5. It has more than just 1 type of metal block. Just saying lol.6. Build mode/advanced build mode.7. More content with factions (SO FAR).*Don't get me wrong, I still love and play Space Engineers, but I wanted to clear this up for people who think this is a clone because it most certainly is not**ONE MORE THING BEFORE WE WRAP THIS UP* It is still early access (For those who don't know what that means), it is still being developed, it will change, get worse, get fixed, get better, and maybe even become something different.*TL;DR*Now, for the people who didn't feel like reading all of that, here is a basic summary:It is an incredibly fun game with many unique features, and very few bugs that I have noticed. Not many cons at all, and I suggest this to any person. STILL early access so things will change, get worse, get fixed, get better and maybe even become something different. NOT a clone of Space Engineers. (I covered that in the above section)*FOR THOSE WHO READ THE WHOLE THING* Thanks for taking the time to read and I hope you found this helpful. :)			"

								After creating ""La Scrubs"" faction with a friend, we built a ship with a hyper-drive to fly to a randomly generated quadrant of the galaxy, found and took over a space station then took apart our old ship, attatched the hyper-drive to the space station, and used the newly adapted space-ship-station to fly into a partially loaded planet. The planet, which had not loaded in properly, now had a gigantic space station sticking out of it! Unfortunately the planet's core is a stationary object, so we couldn't use the hyper-drive to fly the space-ship-station-planet into a moon. :(			"

								Once upon a time...no, wait, never mind.  I'm still bulding the U.S.S Defiant.StarMade is a block-buildy game In Space!  The best way to explain it to people is, to start by imagining MineCraft.  Now, take your awesome castle, and put thrusters and guns on it.  That's StarMade...only, it's not quite as engaging, even about seven months after my original review.  Some changes have happened, including a price hike to $14.99.  Thus, I'm taking the extra hours I've played in the intervening months into account, and doing a re-review.  Has it improved?  Well...you will see.What WorksFirst, the visuals have improved greatly from my prior review, and the game overall looks pretty nice.  You can build some neat ships and stations.  The Pentas/Tetras/Corners allow for somewhat blocky re-builds of your favorite Sci-Fi ships, or your own custom creations.  Some recent texture updates from the developers have made good ships look even better!Performance is also improved to the point where the game is at least playable on medium-grade machines.  This was a critical problem for me in my previous review, but the developers deserve credit for working to make the game behave more efficiently.  Good job there!The UI has improved a lot in seven months too.  There are some issues with resizing individual windows, but the game is easily understandable via the UI, and gives you most of the tools you need to build ships, which is the game's primary mechanic.  The secondary mechanic, shooting stuff with your ship, is also well-accounted for, with shield, structural HP, and armor HP being presented well.  There are some placeholders about, as this game is still in development, but progress is being made.  I'm sure seven months in the future, the UI will be a lot better than it already is, and I look forward to that.What Doesn't WorkBefore I get to anything heavy, I have to talk about the crafting system.  The crafting system is OK in a survival setting, and some much-needed tuning has happened...but ultimately, to make a decent ship, you need a lot of blocks, because in this game, bigger ship = better.  There's additional problems with that that we will get to, but the crafting system as it stands actually hampers the process of doing the main thing that you should be doing in a game about building starships: actually building starships.  To solve this, the crafting UI and system needs a pretty massive interface revamp, and some thought should be taken to all the 'wasted' blocks about, things like plantlife that could be leveraged to make more interesting builds.  It's as if the developers started off by copying MineCraft, then at some point decided, ""oh yeah, the point of this game is to make ships!""Next, there's a problem with how the shipbuilding mechanics in this game are balanced, specifically: any ship you make is a fighter.  You don't need crews to tend to large ships.  You just need your ship to be bigger than an enemy's, because a bigger ship fits more systems in it, and systems are what cause you to win fights, eat asteroids or planets, or whatever.  The recent Cargo system that was released yesterday will help prevent planet-eating miners from being quite as big of a problem as they were prior to this (good luck fitting a planet in your cargo holds), but those of you wondering whether or not to buy into this game should know that, especially in multiplayer, the shipbuilding mechanic is unfairly weighted towards building big ships; smaller ships are thus forced out of niches that are realistic, such as bombers/interceptors.As big of problems as those points are, there was one critical problem in my prior review, that there's nothing really to do, no reason to actually build a ship.  This one, big, critical, overarching problem persists to this day, and it makes the entire game, all the well-crafted bits, completely pointless.  There are some feeble attempts to remedy this - specifically a ""race gate"" minigame setup was added to the game in a more recent release.The reason I say, ""there is nothing to do in StarMade"", is tied more specifically to two things.In Single-Player, there's really nothing to explore.  StarMade randomly generates universes, but other than finding slightly different ores on planets, you may as well not bother.  There are randomly generated space stations too, but do they reward anything?  Not really, unless you salvage the station.  In StarMade, you'll soon discover one thing: due to how the Crafting system works (above), it's generally better to avoid conflict altogether, or your lovingly-crafted spaceship will cease to be, and you will have to grind out a new ship.In Multi-Player, it gets worse.  The Faction system in StarMade is...well, a faction system.  Ideally, players pool their resources to create fleets, stations, and stuff, thus providing a natural objective for PvP.  Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, due to not designing the Faction system to account for humanity's darker impulses, the only way to secure anything you own, is to create a one-man faction, and set a planet or space station as the home base...rendering the systems inoperable by non-guildmembers, and storage secure.  In this way, your stuff is safe from griefing, and as far as I can tell, it's the way the game is designed to be played.  That's well and good...except that's not really the point of a Faction, now is it?.The way I suggest for the developers to fix StarMade's pointlessness is two-fold.  First, there needs to be a meaningful progression that doesn't come out of your workbenches.  You should have to explore, and give exploration some meaning besides ""where are the ores?""  If you want to create a civilian ship, ask yourself: why create a civilian ship?  Trade, mining, and ferrying come to mind.  Those are some great candidates for randomized quests that can be rewarded with blocks, money, or useful ship blueprints.  For that matter - make the premade ships not suck so much!  Existing ships can serve a great purpose - teaching new players the nuances of StarMade's shipbuilding mechanics.  In this way, players build better, interesting ships, which forges a stronger community and makes PvP more reasonable as an implicit objective.Next, you have to fix factions.  Single-player factions destroy the fun of multiplayer in this game.  My suggestion is for players to have 'personal home' blocks that can be used to secure a personal space on a station or planet against anyone who's not them; all chests/cargo areas in that are similarly preserved.  Similarly, creating a faction should require a party of at least two people.  The home-base constraint can still apply, and should.   The game needs better in-faction control to help Factions defend against spies and ne'erdowells.  As long as players make single-person factions, your multiplayer is broken.  You're just putting single-player on a multi-player server.The TL;DRI have a love-hate relationship with this game.  On the one hand, I really do like building starships.  On the other, this game is less of a ""game"" in the ""you can win or lose"" sense, and more of a starship building simulator.  The price of the game was increased to $14.99 from $9.99...I see nothing that justifies this price hike.  As a result, I emphatically do not recommend purchasing StarMade.This game will be fun, possibly for weeks, until you begin to see the legion of flaws and the fact that this game is a simulator.  $14.99 is how much completed indie games cost on Steam; this game is neither completed, nor sufficiently fun enough to bear that price tag.

								I highly recommend this game to any and everybody that likes Sci-Fi Space themed action games and also has a knack for Minecraft. You'll find that you can literally do ANYTHING of your choosing in this game, and honestly of all the alpha games I have ever played, this feels almost like something beyond a complete game, with the exception of a few bugs. A warning to someone that just starts this game: You'll NEED to look up tutorials, and you'll NEED to use the wiki. (I recommend Starmadepedia). I'll summarize my expierience thus far.Started Playing GameDid TutorialBuilt a Crappy ShipCombines a post I saw on steam + Some new found knowledge and made a Mining ShipSpent upwards of 2 hours mining a small area of asteroidsSold the minerals to the local shopBought a faction module to find a place to settle and claimBought a Space StationClaimed a System after building a small stationMade a goal to be able to mine Asteroids in secondsDid more MiningMore MiningUpgraded Ship to the point it could easily eat an asteroid in a minute or lessRead a Post that said you could blow up planetsMade the ambitous goal to mine away entire planets and then blow them up (Or vice versa)More MiningSetup factories that were super efficient (You can increase factory outputs with Factory Enchancers)Built a whole bunch of parts to add on to my systemLearned about Cannon Computers to Salvage ComputersUpgraded my systemCould now mine entire planets, but not destroy themLearned about Nuke MissilesMade a system with a Pulse Module Slaved to a Missile Module for Nukes compiling a 2.3k block arrayLearned that my nuke used way to much powerDid a bunch of swearingTripled my power storage and reactor setup to accomadate my nuke setupMore swearing because it couldn't accomadate the setupDoubled the reactor and power setup again, along with adding Lasers and CannonsFinally was able to launch nukes Blew up a worldLagged out the ServerGot back on ServerStarted raiding a nearby Pirate StationSlowly built up ship till it could take out Pirate StationStarted helping newbies with newbie issuesBlew up another world and mined all its contents to impress said newbiesThis was about 2 days worth a play time total,  and I did not regret a single second of it :)			"

								THREE EDITS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE INITIAL WRITING OF THIS REVIEW, THEY ARE DOWN THE BOTTOM FOR YOUR CONVENIANCEThe simple observation that a lot of white knights/fanboys are roaming this games reviews and mass disliking any review that speaks bad of this game speaks volumes about the community of this game. As for the game itself:Pros: Easily the best building system in any voxel based game I have seen recentlyHaving now played Avorion I can no longer stand by this statement, the building system in Avorion is essentialy a better version of StarMade's building systemMore voxel shapes for you to chose from and the ability to change the dimensions of said shapes (in StarMade every shape is the same size and the only way to make a ""bigger wedge"" is to place multiple wedges) combined with the ability to disable the snap grid and completely freebuild is something that StarMade's building system cannot compare too.The possibilities presented by StarMades logic system are endlessCons:PvP is a mess, extreme weapon and combat system inbalance combined with the idea that bigger ships will always win make for unfun experience. The engine created by Schine cannot handle combat on any scale unless the server is running on top of the line hardware that most server owners do not have the budget to maintain, especialy considering there are not enough players left in the game to run a server off donations.PvE is practicaly nonexistant, the NPC update did take a step in the right direction but PvE is pretty much going to pirate stations and AFK farming them with logic activated missile+missile weaponsMining and industry is a massive bordem simulator and nobody is interested in buying from other players and prefer to make everything for themselves, playing as a merchant or an industry corperation/faction is simply not practical or fun unless you are on an enforced roleplay server. Worth noting that any servers that encourage/enforce roleplay are empty 99% of the timeThe developers and the a large amount of the players would rather reject and insult people who are critical of the game then take on these criticisms or make valid arguments as to why they are wrong.The games popularity and people actually playing the game are on a downward trend-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It should be noted that this review is based on 4 years of playing this game, having 500 hours in the steam client and thousands more in the standalone launcher, I have participated in almost every form of gameplay this game has to offer in addition to seeing many faces of this community come and go for reasons similar to my own, namely Mushroom Fleet and ToasterBorstEDIT: I should have probably mentioned that while this game is in alpha development stage (which is a common excuse used by the roaming white knights to justify the games problems) this game has been in this alpha stage for 6 years as of the time of this review, in my opinion that is ridiculousEDIT 2: A message to SchellBier, mappa. Look its cool that you want to harass me over steam via the profile commenting section, I really don't care and I am not going to heed to your demmands for me to delete my review because its ""non-construtive and not helping the game grow"" I have and I will continue to delete those comments, please keep them coming however, I would love to get a good quality screenshot before I delete them since you want to try and claim that you never harrassed me.EDIT 3: Seeing as some whiteknights are trying to say that I am ""campaigning against the game"" and I am ""known throughout the community as a troll"" I just wanted to quash those statements and state that if you had actualy read my review you would easily see that at the very top of the review I actualy wrote positive aspects about the game, even saying that one aspect of this game is the best in any game I have seen. All in all, saying that I am ""campainging against the game"" is extremely hypocritical, and by your own logic you are campainging against any and all negative criticism, going as far as attempting to misuse steams report function to try and get mine, ToasterBorst's and several other negative reviews censored/deleted.EDIT 4: One of the StarMade whitenights (mappa) has threatended civil action against me because I published proof of harrassment by mappa over of my review. The fact that its gotten to the point where they are willing to resort to using the legal system because of negative steam reviews against games that they whiteknight is just a futher testamony to the type of community this game has (especialy the whiteknights)			"

								VERY GREAT GAME**Before anyone says anything about ""You only have 19 hours and you're saying you played 7 days,"" I came on for a least a hour or two every each of these days, however when the war broke out; it lasted 4-6 hours.****EDIT 2**In regards to my prestine base, I actually just crashed my Ex-Starship, ""Interstellar X,"" into my planet causing everything to go kaboom. Server crashed, end of story. **EDIT 1**Summary 2: In my opinion guys, this is by far the most thrilling, most intriguing game you will EVER play on Steam. ***** Space Engineers, give StarMade a try! I gaurantee you, it's worth every penny. Day 30: The Void has now become the most largest fleet in the entire server (server is remaining hidden, if you find us, hehehe :P). The Void now controls over 90 Sectors in several galaxies and is the heart of the SOS Network. With over 78 fleet members, we are controlling to largest vessal known as the ""Void Battlecruiser Mk. XII."" With this strong vessal at hand, it holds a crew of 50 and cargo capacity of over 1 million blocks (Standard NDAs apply :3). Being the fleet's first commanding officer, I resign to other duties in another galaxy. Where I live a happy life in my prestine starbase (which saddly blew up because of a reactor meltdown :( )Day 1: Was a complete noob, downloaded several ships from the forums, just to see what it was like.Day 2: Joined a server, made new friends, and created a dream. Day 3: Mining starts, we set out to get several thousands of minerals.Day 4: Space Station bought, now heavy armor production begins; shield systems online, advanced anti-ship weaponry online.Day 5: Production of S.O.S. BattleShip, The Void, begins. More additions to Space Station.Day 6: War comes alive; multiple squads of highly suited pirates are approaching, we respond by sending 2 squadrons (of 4 ships each) to attack the hostile parties. While our fleet is attacking the pirates, I am aboard the Fleet Space Station, initiating Emergency Protocol Omega when I see Alpha Squad has been blown to bits. 4 more Squads of pirates come up on radar, the Station is now in red alert, warp gates are firing up for our last ditch effort. Shields are down to 75% and dropping fast, Bravo Squad is fleeing from the Station. Shields are now down to 69%, warp gates are at 85% charge, I quickly launch our Escape Pod Protocol, everybody aboard the Station is now aboard the only highly advanced pod we had. The warp gates are now ready to teleport, Escape Pod 1 is entering transit, all our advanced anti-ship weaponry are covering their taxi towards the gate. My fleet are shouting at me to come aboard quick, when I realize I am the only one keeping them from death. I am the last stand against the threat, Escape Pod 1 is now entering the warp gate, any time now they will be safe, sectors away from the threat. Shields are now at 27%, we just lost power as soon as Escape Pod 1 enters the warp gate. With power at criticly low levels, I initiate the emergency shielding systems, when ... another fleet arrives!? This can't be, our neighboring fleet has come to the rescue! With over 8 squadrons of advanced fighters, they broke out a very thrilling war. With Anti-Ship guns firing at the pirates and our neighboring fleet to the rescue, power is coming back online on the Station. The Void Space Station is now fully operational, with her crew at Echo Base. The pirates are fleeing from the battlefield, we've defeated them! Thanks to the help if our neighbors, our Space Station is forever safe. Day 7: We have completed the S.O.S. BattleShip TheVoid. Space Station Alpha has been upgraded extensively. Anti-Ship weaponry has been refitted with even more advanced weaponry. Summary: Oh, my, god.			"

								Don't be fooled by the number of hours played on Steam. I've been a longtime supporter of StarMade, and have played hundreds of hours before the Steam release.StarMade is a sci-fi voxel based sandbox game.If I had to pick a game that it feels similar to, I would say Minecraft. There is a comparable level of addictivness, as well as a somewhat greater level for truly amazing creations.Simply put, StarMade is really, really good. In it's current state, the schine team are working hard on bugfixes, rebalancing, and adding awesome new content. There will be builds that change the balance of ships, so you will need to redo some ship systems entirely.---------------+ building is simple and easy to master+ there is crafting, so you can start with nothing on the surface of a planet and work your way up+ in-depth faction system+ community makes some fantastic things+ logic system has unlimited potential (like redstone but better)+ visually stunning+ game is made for multiplayer, and handles it just as well as singleplayer+ constant optimization and bugfixes from devs---------------- Not a finished product- Still in development, there will be bugs, there will be changes you won't like immediately. You just need to deal with it and be patient.---------------FEATURES:> Practically infinite universe> Ship building, station building> Solar systems> Suns, Planets, Asteroids> Black holes and wormholes> Warp Gates and Jump Drives> Logic system> Factions > others I can't think of right nowPLANNED/UPCOMING FEATURES:> Creatures> Quests> Better Ai			"

								I've been playing this game for awhile before it hit steam so my hours might be a bit skewed.  I'm gonna list some features I like below, and as the game grows I will add onto this list, and other things.-Liked Features ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   -People don't move or skit around when on ships. This is a big one, and a lot of space building games have players glitching or even getting stuck in walls becuase they don't treat the ship as a anchor.    -Much like an open world game. If you see it you can probably go to it. This game blows my mind on how expansive it is. You see that red dot in the distance? Thats a star, you can go there. That yellow dot? Another star. Seriously this game is crazy with this stuff and it blows my mind.   -Populated servers. If you haven't played on a server yet do it. Great expierence.  -Movable Asteroids. Its just fun to push them around, or even use them for cover.  -Block Variety. This is another big one for me becuase its real nice to have a large list of blocks just to build nice looking ships with.   -Advanced & Basic building. You can go very advanced with building in this game to get the most efficiency out of ships, or you can go basic, and get a alright ship.   -Logic Systems. Probably one of the best things a building game can include, absolutely amazing!  -Planets. You can even orbit them, or mine them out! Seriously planets are amazing they even have there own axis of rotation.   -Wormholes. You can travel throughout the galaxy on wormholes.  -Pirates. While they variety is lacking in the base vanilla game, you can add in your own Custom Pirates into the game.  -PVP. Great expierence this one its fun watching two giant frigates battle it outside a planet.   -Weapon Combinations. Probably one of my favourite features. Being able to combine a Rocket with a Cannon to make a shotgun is just the best. -Breaching. It was done alright fun as all hell though.   -Shipyards. Absolutely amazing. Although I don't use it much its really fun to see a friend dock his        ship into our base.  - Great Tutorial. Gotta say helped me out a bunch! ~Developers + Support Team~ --------------------------------------------------------------------   - While I am not a developer my self I will say that they probably have one of the best support teams and dev's I have seen in early acess. I reported a bug about a wormhole spawning in my spawn when I first got the game and within a day it was on the bug tracker and my issue fixed! The developers also keep frequent updates, and are amazingly active on the forums.    - The demo is the full game. This is amazing for early access you are giving players a chance to play the game, and see if they want to support you! Great move on the creators.    - If you are gonna do early acess this is how you do it right!~Servers~ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   - My expierence with servers have been fun. If you are gonna play starmade you absolutely gotta do it in a server. The game normally feels empty in singleplayer but in multiplayer servers usually add there own custom pirates, and tons of players populate the game! Seriously give this a shot.~Community~    - Probably one of the friendliest communities I have ever met! Seriously they are a major help and I suggest you visit the forums here. "" http://starmadedock.net/forums/ ""~Some bad things~ -------------------------------------------------------------------------A review isn't a review without some bad things. The game is still early acess so I won't really put bug complaints here.(This list may grow)- Windows block out some things. Not sure if this is a bug or intended, but you cannot see the sun, planets cores, and missiles through certain pieces of glass. If this was intended maybe instead of blocking out all particles like that you can just dim them.*~~~~~~* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutly  epic,  the best way for me to review this for you is to guide you through my first few real life days in the game.  Day 1:  I started by myself built a ship core added thrusters, cannons and and mining beams mined asteroids for a few hours and with those resources built/bought shields for my ship. with my shields up and cannons ready I go to the nearest pirate station... After spending about 5 minutes with red beams flashing everywhere around my ship and me firing to no effect on the station I decide to close the range... cause i thought my cannons where out of range... I must say the shield hit effects were epic and they were the last things i saw before my ship imploded. that ended my first day. Day 2:  I play with my friend with a few of his mates and we build a small planetary hideout kitted out with basic factory and power generation capabilities along with a bit of a decorative sense. we decide to build a space station and begin work on ceaser station.  Day 3:  After an all nighter building our station it is finally completed We look upon our basic station with pride it had an internal medium hanger bay and a small exterior bay. little did we know that while we were building our lttle station the others had been amassing a fleet. Blissfully unaware we continue expanding our station. making a cool interior command room, hanger observation room, a working red alert system with logic blocks and a nice room to watch the planet we were orbiting from. Day 4:  My friend and I are discussing on skype what our plans are for the station today as we connect to the server. We decide to build another (larger) hanger bay and a med bay. While im working on setting up the docking zones for the large hanger my friend decides to go out in our mining ship to replenish our rapdily depleting supply of money and materials. While he is out I notice 4 new contacts appear on my screen all of a sudden, blissfully unaware I check my navigation bar to see what the new contacts are. Bunny Buster, Major Pain, Meals on Thrusters and 1701. I wondered if they wanted to trade with us (we had just set up our shop) so I asked them if they would like to dock... the response i got was not the one i hoped for... One ship fired what must of been over a hundred missiles all of which quickly turned to face the station and our fighter craft and begun to speed towards us. Realising we were under attack I screamed for reinforcements from my friend and ran for the fighter hoping to get into it and fly off to allow its shield to recharge. The first volley of missiles totaly obliterated that hope, I watched as the core (all that survived of my fighter) spun past overheating. And decided to do the last thing that I could, I ran for the control center deep in the center of our station hoping that the attackers would get bored before they shot through all the intervening rooms and armour blocks. Upon reaching the control room I played my last card... I activated the Red alert system we had spent half an hour setting up. Immediatly all the lights in our station turned off... and .5 seconds later red ones turned on to replace them. That done I activated the build block so I could watch them destory my work. The ship that fired all the missiles was now steaidly pouring barrages of missiles into the station which while not having much dammage lowered our shields slowly. A second ship oppened up with Ion beams (as i latter found out) which almost instantly stripped the remaining shields from our station. The remaining two ships then closed and each fired a single missile one they had coloured green the other red. I thought that my station could easily withstand two missiles I mean it had surrived hundreds so far... how wrong I was each missile detonated with all the fury of a nuclear weapon punching giant holes in our beutiful home (turns out they had mergered pulse and missile blocks to make these missiles). I watched on as they fired the seconds volley and counted the seconds till  my command centre exploded around me. and so ended my 4th day. Day 5:  I joined up with the  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  AWESOME GUYS who destroyed my station so i could learn their ways... and boy did I learn lots ;-)This Game lets you do SO MUCH, every weapon can be merged with other weapons to create different effects e.g cannon to cannon to create a rapid fire cannon (good for missile defence if mounted on a turret) Pulse to missile makes the lock on nukes. Missile to Missile make swarm missiles which independantly lock on to hostile targets. There are jump drives, cloaking devices (which I recently figured out how to use) Scanners, Radar jammers And more. This game is great and getting better10/10 strongly suggest you buy it! If you do and your interested in multiplayer please tell me.			"

								BUY THIS GAME.I'm writing this review at the end of 2014, and I must say that StarMade turned out to be a bit of a dark horse contender for my personal GOTY (and that's going up against amazing games like Shadow of Mordor, DA: I, and Endless Legend). I've had more fun with it than I ever had with Minecraft, despite the obvious similarities between the two games. I find myself thinking about StarMade when I'm at work, plotting out new ship designs and planning raids on other factions. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.So what's the appeal? Why is StarMade so great?For me, the answer is that it fulfills the promises of games like Space Engineers, Eve, STO, and even legendary franchises like the X series. It is one of the first sci-fi games I've ever played that strikes a perfect balance between space combat, ground combat, ship design, strategy, and a vibrant in-game economy. The game is still early-access, and this is somewhat obvious at times (particularly on planets, which currently do not spawn pregenerated structures or mobs), but there's just so damned much to DO - particularly if you're playing online - that you'll rarely care.One of the most appealing aspects of the game is ship and station design. You'll start off floating in the void of space, somewhere near the center of a proc-gen galaxy. You have 25, 000 credits and some basic building components, which can be used to make a large fighter, or, more likely, a small, all-purpose vessel. Whatever you decide, every single aspect of the design is up to you. Want a donut-shaped ship? Do it! Want to fly Moya, the Galactica, or the USS Enterprise? It'll be expensive, but it's totally doable. Want turbolifts between decks, drone racks, or a tractor beam? Build the right components and you can install them anywhere you want on your ship. Be careful though, because every block you place serves an important purpose - and every block can be destroyed. This means you can lose gravity partway through a fight, potentially jettisoning your friends into the void of space. Or perhaps the logic that controls your turbolifts will go down, trapping you on the command deck until repairs can be made. StarMade is, IMO, the most complex and well-executed science-fiction simulator available, with its infinite possibilities offering countless moments of drama, terror, and triumph.I could keep raving about how great this game is, but, well, I kinda want to play it instead. I HIGHLY recommend that anyone who's a fan of sci-fi or sandbox games give the game a whirl. Trust me, the $10 or so that they're asking for is an absolute steal.			"

								Don't let my paltry game play time fool you, I've played at least a hundred hours of this game prior to it coming to steam. It was great. Sure, it is technically in the development phase even now, but if you are curious of whether to purchase this game or not, I would have to say it is likely worth the buy considering the following:1. Final version will likely be much more expensive, so buy it now to support it's development and get it cheap!2. Despite the level of development, there is so much to do. Seriously, people are still posting versions of famous starships rebuilt for starmade while others create their own original ships.3. The community is fantastic! If you have the ability to, you should try setting up a server for you and your friends.Lastly, many of the complaints I have heard of this game are technical in nature and have been already fixed as of this review. There is only one complaint I have worth mentioning and that is the fact that the system requirements are probably a little higher than listed here. I have a good setup beyond what is required here, but I have to turn down the settings to play this game without issue. I do not believe this game to be as poorly optimised as minecraft, but it definitely can slow down or screw up if you do not alter the settings. Even so, this flaw can be ignored as this game is already becoming a nearly perfect addition to the indie game market.Definitely a must own for any creative mind.LET ME ADD MORE TO THIS REVIEW! as of 11/24/2016:I cheated on Starmade with Space Engineers for a while. I was foolish. Sure, Space Engineers may be prettier, but it is a shallow and hollow husk of what Starmade is. I began hanging out again with my main lady, Starmade recently. She didn't hold my terrible mistakes against me, and we have had plenty of fun since. Miss Starmade even had even been working out while I was gone, she's more attractive than ever, and even runs at a good bit faster of a pace than before. Starmade even has a few new tricks up her sleeve she learned while I was gone. Better yet, she's still learning and buffing up, so I know things between us will only get better.In the end, let me say that I respect Starmade for what she is, an expressive and fun individual with a quirky personality and plenty of love to share.

								This game looks like a Minecraft clone,  It isn't .This game looks like a Space Engineers clone,  It isn't .The devs are litterly offering this games current version on steam  for free  and care about their players.This game is constantly being updated for fixes and new contentWhile voxel based, this game is relativly beautiful, and runs fairly wellIt has really convinient building tools, modding support, and texture pack support.The game has some pretty awesome pre-generated things like asteroids, planets, pirate ship/stations, shops, and wormholes.Shops arnt cheesy, they have limited amount of blocks they can hold, and only have so much money.There are over 650 blocks in the game, not just hull and guns, and the game has AI blocks so you can have automated turrets and drone ships.

								So first thing I do when I get this game is jump onto multiplayer.Servers kinda quiet, so I make a tiny shuttle ship and head to the nearest planet.Planet bored me eventually so I mined it out and made a bigger ship.At this point random guy starts talking to me, one thing leads to another.I'm now flying his friend back to their home planet after he got stranded on a planet.More stuff happens, we make a faction.I start work on gigantic battleship thing with missile turrets the size of skyscrapers. (Ships can get really big in this game)Notice the pirate station nearby has been shooting down my friends and I engage with my battleship in an epic fight to destroy it.Pirate station blows up, but not before hitting my bridge with a missile while my shields were down, resulting in a spectacular explosion.Ship that took 1 day to build = gone.Me and friends log off the server to join some others and get into more space related mishap.10/10 Would blow my time on going down with an expensive battleship again			"

								Awesome game ! (Only have a few  playing on Steam but I have 100+ hours before it came out on Steam).So in this game, you can discover hundreds  of planets and gather resources on them to build your dream space ship or your dream space station.You can construct massive spaceships in this game (more than 1000 hundred block of length) with automated turrets and others systems (cloaking/gravity/bombs/etc...).There are also some AI in the game (essantialy pirates vessels and space station) but the game keeps evolving and being more and more complete (for example planets weres just  discs before but now they are like 15 faces dices).Also, the game is really different than any other games and feels really unique. The game ""map"" is a ""real"" scale galaxy, in game you have a galaxy map with hundreds (thousands?) of systems with planets in them (or not, some are just composed of a star).Don't be afraid about being too far from someone, recently teleportation and starships jumps have been integrated ! (also wormholes can help you a little bit).So if you love building space things, space battles and exploration, you can jump on the game ! (even at full price)			"

								Arms Race in SpaceIt’s been about two hours of furious clicking, and I still haven’t finished this battlecruiser. I am so focused on getting this done so that I can as soon as possible take it into outer space and blow the crap out of my rivalling faction’s outpost that lies 9 solar systems away. I must prove like many other factions in StarMade, that the “ACE Pirates” is a faction that are to be taken seriously and I am sure that when this battlecruiser is done, they will never even consider launching a missile at even the weakest of our mining ships.StarMade is all about building spaceships and continuously upgrading them as time flies by while having such a blast. Whenever one thought that one’s interstellar battlecruiser was too big, an hour or two later they will not think so anymore. StarMade creates this need, this addiction to keep on destroying, keep on mining and to keep on building that spaceship of yours that you will brag about to all the people on the server – until someone with some space dreadnought that is twice your size shoves a missile down your throat. When such things happen, StarMade emotionally attached you to that ship, and it emotionally attached you to making that ship beat someone else’s. StarMade makes you think of your spaceship as your children, you want the best out of them and you keep on encouraging them – or even force them to be better that others. That’s what happens when you get this thought; “how shall I build this weapon system to one-shot that guy?”.At first StarMade would seem very similar to Minecraft – which it is in both its aesthetics and fundamental gameplay. They are both games based on blocks and building. But apart from that it has what Minecraft lacked and made me stuck to the game ever since, namely to be able to build space ships. Not only are the textures so much sharper, and the building materials come in different shapes apart from cubes, but the scale of StarMade is just outstanding. Robin Promesberger spent a decade to code the engine for it and runs so well on even low end pcs. With this you soar the universe, explore millions of different planets, solar systems and galaxies. There is not one world, but hundreds to explore – all in one game!If you thought space was lonely and think that it’ll be like that in StarMade, I’m sorry but you thought wrong. StarMade’s multiplayer is a fantastic experience of interacting, trading, obliterating and befriending your fellow astronauts in this vast universe of space. Not only is it fun to mine and survive in space alongside them, but joining a faction by teaming up and creating a coalition can be just as exciting. A fully established faction will sometimes be forced to operate in such a way that is almost as complex as modern day politics! For example, a leader that divides certain members to either build, produce blocks, fight or mine. Mine where? When? How? With what? These are all fundamental questions that must be solved within the faction, forcing the players themselves to figure out what’s best for them and for the faction so that they can stand out as a better faction. This is StarMade’s multiplayer experience, which is both unique and enjoyable for the casual to hardcore gamer.  I mentioned continuously upgrading your spaceship and how this hooks you onto the game. To be able to continuously upgrade your ship by adding more modules, more shields, more guns, you have more or less no limits opposed to other scifi shooting games. Your ship depends all on how well you can plan, how well you choose to get resources, and of course how well you design your ship with all these resources you get. Much like the modpacks for Minecraft such as tekkit and feedthebeast, you can build huge factory complexes. In StarMade these are the essential and fundamental parts for wrecking space scrubs in the universe. It takes a long time to get a hang of it, and there is quite a steep learning curve, but you’ll eventually understand the game, and when you do you can do anything you ever wished to do in in space. The part of StarMade that I find most satisfying is when you explode someone’s ship with a missile whilst piloting the spacecraft made of all those resources which you collected and strived hard to turn into modules in your factory complex. It is very amusing to watch the guy’s dead ship drift away for you to take. Like more or less everything in this universe, there has to always be the downsides. StarMade unfortunately lacks many sounds for certain parts of the game and gives a less immersive feel. Currently the game has a very limited AI simulation, which means that playing the single player mode will feel very lonely. However this can be quickly solved by hopping on to the first multiplayer server in the conveniently placed server list that exists in the launcher. StarMade also lacks a proper third person view perspective, something I and probably many other people think is a natural view point in games. But for being in alpha, that is quite alright, and the gameplay itself is outstanding and addictive to say the least. StarMade is about building stuff, and sometime later blow stuff up with that stuff. The intense multiplayer creates the competitiveness to progress with designing your ships, and forces this competitiveness to go on. And in the process, forces you to blow up one another in this blocky arms race in space. The Good+ Infinite universe, + Smooth immersive multiplayer, + Well established ship building system+ Rewarding progressionThe Bad- Lack of AI simulation- No third person view- Few sounds.			"

								I played this game many hours, and I mean, I played it a lot. I'm more than a year active on some servers now, and I had a lot of fun.But like every song, the fun comes slowly to an end, and it starts to bore me. When I played this game for the first time, it was the incredible possibilities that kept me hooked. Spaceships, small and big, stations... and thanks to the rail function and logic, I was busy for a while..I met many players, and build a lot. And we showed off with what we had. But there is an interesting problem. Starmade isn't an RTS where you can spawn ships like cheap cannon fodder for war. You put almost your soul in these ships, which makes you more reserved to battle against friend or foe. Especially big ships... which takes a lot of time and resources to build them... It isn't far-fetched to see some  players raged-quit after losing their capital ship....The planets are... not really interesting. Sometimes you find even an 'artefact'  on these planets and  they are very rare. But not good enough to explore the galaxy. After a while you will see them nothing more than as something to mine, and a message that you killed a lot of people (which is in my opinion still a dead planet if there's nothing that moves on it than only yourself) if you blow them up, shrugs you off  like something not important....They're too small to be important and interesting, and still too big, because they can often lag your computer...The only interesting thing in the galaxy are the players and even that starts to bore you, because the action is rare between them. You have some guys that like to grieve you, but that looks almost like the pinnacle of the game, really....Battle between ships is a problem too. Forget the small ships. They are just fodder. A battle is almost based on 1:1  system. The ship with the most (shield and shield regen) blocks (almost) wins. When you fight with two Battleships against one Titan, you can count on it that one battleship will be heavy damaged, probably will be destroyed...You can simply forget the epic battle with many small ships (5000-15000 blocks) against a Capital ship of almost 4 million blocks with an heavy shield. Even if you came with 80 (that will probably lags the server),  you will lose them, just because they have not enough fire-power and  a weak shield.  (the 10 second punishment time after losing your shield is just deadly for small ships)But that is just about ships and battle.What I really miss in this game is the reward system.  Why would I explore the galaxy if there are no hidden treasure or secrets? Why would I battle if there are no special rewards?It would be a dream, If I found a blueprint of a special block on a planet  that would give me an upperhand in battles, like a stronger shield block or power block and weapon. Or special ores for these blocks. Just think about that.They are working on AI factions now.... They just put new players in the field, but without an interesting reward system, they will bore you fast enough....I don't think the programmers will read this review, but you get the idea.Still, is this game worth it? I say yes, it's a great game for your creative dreams. But I can only hope that they don't forget an really good reward system then a cloud of blocks from pirates..., otherwise it will only be a building game....			"

Early Access Review
								I started off loving Starmade...then we broke up. Now I spend time thinking about maybe giving it a another shot. I got into the game just after the big graphical re-boot having played Minecraft for years and checking out every voxel based, procedurally generated game I could find. I trolled Greenlight and found many wanna be contenders but Starmade impressed me with it's vision of what it wants to be. Like any relationship we fall in love with what could be, an ideal, sometimes a projection we place onto the other. I am love with what Starmade is trying to be, but has not yet become.   I lost interest for awhile when the docking update changed how turrets and ships dock. I was having a blast using the quirky old system to make a wide range of ships. The new system looks great and will solve many foibles and allow for a great variety of new designs. Just like with the Minecraft updates I got to enjoy a new game play each time Notch added something. Starmade is developing much the same way but because of it's own ambition each major update is quite disruptive. I have seen other early access wallow aimlessly, become abandoned or run off the rails in development. Starmade is doing none of these things. The danger, as I see it, is that Starmade may have trouble fulfilling it's grand ambitions.   Yes this game has a learning curve and I had fun riding that curve. This is the gold-standard for a complex game. If the learning is fun; success, if it is tedious; go play a game more suited to your short attention-span. A simple game is easy to learn and may become boring. A game with depth and possibilities is going take time to master but will remain engaging.   In it's current state (shipyards just released) Starmade is a very solid, playable early access game. There is a smattering of enemies to keep you improving your ship designs. There is no story arc yet but the ship-building is very polished. The Devs have built a proper foundation for an amazing game. It remains to be seen if they can build an engaging experience onto their ground-breaking mechanics while maintaining balance.   Look elsewhere for the hate, I'm going to tell you what I love.>Design matters. Where you put modules and how you protect your ship will really make a difference. Lots of room for tactics, countermeasures and cool systems. My first death in the game was a suicide. I designed anti-personnel pulsers in the airlock. Two passes and you are still ok, the third pass: you're dead. (You can come in, look around and leave safely or... linger and die.) I died testing the system and laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off.>If you can dream it up you can build it. The first major ship I built was a salvage craft. I designed it to rescue shipwrecks. It was big and turned like a pig but fast and survivable. (I used it for daring rescue of a huge ship that got cored by pirates. It was an epic mission that left massive chucks missing from the old Flat-top but both vessels made it home intact. WooHoo)   One of my favorites is the Tholian Enervater: a spider-themed hunter-killer. By design this craft can pursue a small fighter, slow it down using (web) multiple tractor beams (locking it in the crosshairs), rob it of power using (venom) an electro-mcGuffin ray and finally kill it. The theme of the spider worked both visually and tactically. Very Cool, good job Devs.   I decided to make a Whale-ship that could swallow a pirate-craft whole and then eat it. It worked just as I had hoped. (Unfortunately collisions are unavoidable)   I have stealth designs, a 'Tuttle-craft' for repairs, a surveyer/scout, a carrier/salvager, a mining ship with a huge beam.  = ]  Racing has just been introduced so now 'Tuning' will be a part of designing an efficient racer.> Hey, it's fun to fly too. Never mind the awesome build mode with simple and powerful symmetry & mirroring to reduce keystrokes... this is a very good space cockpit interface. Starmade features a huge number of elements introduced by previous space games but incorporates them well, often getting better results than its predecessors. It may not have the graphical grandeur of Klingon Academy but the systems controls are simple and easy to use in combat. After narrowly escaping from battle and badly damaged, I was able to reconfigure my systems and piece two non-functional weapons into one cobbled together mess of a gun (without going into build-mode). As I limped home I felt like Scotty, under an instrument panel with sparks flying, griping to the ham fisted captain who got us into this mess in the first place (oh, wait...that's me).    Dog fighting is still a bit slow and not very dynamic with the current AI. I hope for more variation in their tactics besides ""Send more guys"".  Multiplayer servers often have custom pirates so there is lots of room for variety.>Potential. There's that dirty word again. With human crews for opponents in a more populated (by NPCs) world this game could be epic on a level beyond the average tired space-shooter game. It already has nailed the galactic map, shop-economy, building, flight control, and optimization. Read the developer's blog (Bench) to get a look at what is to come. The game updates every couple of weeks with new features, bug fixes and optimizations.>Powerful logic-driven systems. Think wireless redstone only more stable. Weapons with aux effects, electronic countermeasures and transporters. Shipyards to generate virtual designs and a BluePrint for your builds to save, share, upload, download & modify, all seamlessly.>Friendliest PvP I have ever seen in a game.>This game is better and more polished in it's Alpha state than many 'finished' releases I have bought. >Going into 2016 there has been a cargo and thruster update offering realistic, mass based acceleration and more thruster dynamics with user customizable settings. Fleets are set to add another dimension to the Meta-game. Slabs are expanding build-potential.   For the earth bound crowd who complain that game is broken: try to find it in your imagination that this game is still in the chrysalis phase. The grub's body is utterly dissolved in the cocoon before it can be reborn into a butterfly.    Early access is just that... if you don't get that stop bothering the developers and go play something with Zombies.    For the Developers: Schine on.			"

								I may have one of the most hours played on Starmade... So I feel I can create a decent review...Starmade, is a must have game. There, there's my review.As of Aug. 11 2015 Have you ever eaten a pretty bad meal out for about 12 bucks? Afterwards you regret going there in ther first place because all you're doing now is sitting on the toilet and hating yourself? Well starmade isn't like that at all. It costs less than $12.00 currently, at $9.99. It also will make you not hate yourself! :D (Well, unless you spend 50 hours building a ship to have it blown up by pirates or other players on her first voyage.)As of Aug. 11 2015 Starmade-Procedurally generated world, it's never the same.-Takes imagination, or you can go download other player built ships.-When they say ""open world"" they mean, ""open universe"". Only limitations are your own imagination and creativity-Quite literally the universe is your sand box, build it, and they will come.-Save Yourself some time and learn how to use advaned build mode. (but first make sure you understnad how power works)-Oh yeah, there are ships and stuff... Did I meantion you can build whatever you want? (press ""m"" to spawn a station, press ""x"" to spawn a ship.)-Devs are super acive in the community, makes for easy vertical communication. Which is very refreshingThings to note:-Little bit of a learning curve.-Because code  for the game hasn't been streamlined perfectly yet there are some issues on multi-player servers due to lag when more than 15 players are on at one time. (this will effect game play severly)-The community, while for the most party very informed, is actually somewhat elitest (just something to note)-Pick the right server for your play style!! I can not stress this enough, it's very important that when playing for hundreds of hours on a server you at least like it a little bit.-Updates are rolling out all the time, as the game is in ""alpha"" (updates usually fix previous bugs but always bring with them their own new bugs, remember it's in ""alpha"")-I won't lie, it takes a very long time to get things done in starmade, however it is very rewarding creating your own empire.-If you want a perfectly polished game Starmade isn't quite there yet. But it still looks and feels awesome!Starmade is one of the best games I have ever played, a must have game.			"

								This game is for explorers and builders. Elements for killers are still in the works. StarMade is like Minecraft, but in space, and it's still developing major components. Alone in a galaxy unless you join a server, you'll find yourself floating in space, with few resources and some tutorials you'll build your first ship. It's not bad. Perhaps it resembles your favorite ship such as Serenity or maybe a TIE Fighter, maybe an F22, it's crude but it can move around, salvage resources and perhaps fire a decent volly of antimatter projectiles. What then? Like any game, you go out and collect resources. Asteroids, planets, abandoned stations, remains of empires remain in an eerie setting of dead space. Space where planets are 12 sidded dice that orbit a star and all is your playground.Then, you're attacked by NPC Pirates. Maybe one, perhaps a dozen, they come in and blast you and your ship into dust. Like Eve and other games, it's not the end. You research, learn about cloaking devices, radar jammers, you can build a fleet of NPC ships and have some mine while others patrol. Construct robotic arms, configure logic blocks that make Minecraft redstone a childs toy...Then, you realize there are NPC factions, shops trade with one another in a breathing economy, Pirates blantantly travel and leave a wake of destruction. Factions expand their territory to dominate the galaxy. Suddenly, it's not so lonely. Things you had to mod Minecraft for, you get here. So whether it's flying your custom designed Stardestroyer launching various TIE ships to attack, bomb or mine, or quietly watch the factions rise and fight one another in a Romulan war bird, or even a Firefly class transport to haul goods from one shop to another for trade, you'll find it here. The people working on this game, want crew commands, colonies, in depth NPC interactions, 4x style layered faction collaberation. They want to play in a living universe of simple complexity, and it's around the corner.So if...Space Engineers is overwelming due to it's complexity and the requirements for a large ship is insaneNo Man's Sky is lonelyEmpyrion is great but... you want more customization and options and lets face it, larger ships and fleetsPlanet Engineers needs to venture into space (But the colony building is fun)Minecraft needs more than a strange plane of exsistanceStar Trek Online needs ship interriorsYou want to command a fleet like Battle Star GalacticaLike Elite Dangerous but the ships feel too similar or staleThen check out Starmade. It's a great creative outlet where you can do more with less, it's easy to pick up and interesting to master and a good place to relax overall.			"

								Probably the best space voxel game you are going to see when it comes down to epic ships, large scale battles and planetary colonization.Still has some flaws left and right, but so far nothing gamebreaking.I also do advice to think twice when purchasing the game if you are using an old machine, rendering the planets need a pretty big amount of ram memory. (or you'll have to wait an eternity, or your game simply freezes)			"

Early Access Review
								Really fun game plagued by unjust reviews. People need to realize THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. This game comes with so much for an early access game, with enough detail to bring your dream ship to life. Sure, no one likes a game that crashes and has bugs... but... THIS IS EARLY ACCESS!!!!. I personally haven't had too many issues with it, aside from a crash here and there but that's expected from a game that is... EARLY ACCESS!!!!!!!!!! I built the Normandy from Mass Effect, a giant mother ship, a huge space station, a planetary base, I warped next to a pirate base and lost a ship, I made a bigger and badder ship that wiped out that space station and reclaimed the wreckage of my old ship and brought it back to life, I wiped out a whole planet with my own Death Star, I did all that through this early access game.I'm seeing people also complain saying it's a ""copy of Minecraft"". How in the hell is this a copy of Minecraft, IT TAKES PLACE IN SPACE!!! IT FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY!! By that logic Terraria is a copy of Minecraft and no one should ever play it, 7 Days to Die is also a copy and should never be played. That logic is rediculous!! ---I felt the need to submit a review, because I can't stand when games are plagued with bad reviews just because someone is too stupid to work around the bugs and also realize.. THAT THEIR GAME.. IS... EARLY.. ACCESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!			"

Early Access Review
								The game is still in alpha, let alone Early access, but I will put my experience to your service.Overview:This game is a voxel-based space sandbox with a bunch of original content.In this game, you can build ships, and fully customize it with the hundreds of blocks at your disposition.If you feel like taking a true challenge, you can go on and build a space station.The game includes factions, and faction battles. Factions have absolutely no player capacity limit. You can easily end up with five hundred factionmates with you.Now, let's talk about the pros and cons.PROS:- Infinite procedurally generated space universe, countless galaxies, special stars, derelict stations... so much content to explore.- Ships are fully customizable, and can get really accurate thanks to the advanced building mode at your disposition.- No size limit, feel like building a 400 megatons titan ship ? Feel free to do so, this game doesn't restrict you one bit.- Full multiplayer support.- Full controller support.- Developpement team pays huge regard to community opinion. You are the key to a better StarMade.- Totally functional logic systems, you can finally make your 50 meters squared chip in space.- Factories, automation.- AI-controlled turrets and probes.- Awesome active community on the StarMade forums, and the StarMade registry.- So much pros, I surely forgot something.CONS:- Glitchy, that's to be expected of an Alpha.- Can crash on multiplayer... hope your ship was full-stoped before you did.- Tough on low-performance CPUs- Hard learning curve, you'd be best watching some tutorials on the web before throwing yourself in the game.- Larger ships are incredible stronger than smaller ships due to buffs in shield systems and weapon systems depending on number of blocks, more on that later.Now this game might be for €9.99, but it sure is worth twice as much, if I had one gift to do to a bored gamer, it would be this game.It has been on developpement for about 4 years (More, already ?), but is still progressing at a sustained pace. The community can't wait to see further progress, and neither can I.Ships will become overpowered exponentially with their mass, if one dreadnought is 50 megatons in mass, it will still be much stronger than 200 corvettes of 500 kilotons. This is due to the exponential increase in stats the more blocks you have connected in one array. This is sad because that can inhibate epic space fleet battles. Fighters will never be able to breach through larger ships due to the former having weak weapons compared to larger ships, and the latter having too much shield recharge rate for the former.Schema and the developpement team plan on upgrading this though, to make smaller ships stronger and more of a threat, and larger ships more exposed to swarms of smaller ships.I guess I'll take my leave, before this review scares other people.

								Starmade is everything you want in an epic Sci-Fi space builder sim, minus the shiny graphics and story.  1. Have an actual avatar 1st and 3rd person view, not just the inside of a cockpit 2. Build your ship/station/home world/mech in Creative or Survival modes 3. Create your faction/empire/rebel fleet  4. Travel from space to planet surface and back without load screens 5. Massive Universe...planets/sectors/solar systems/multiple galaxies...you will die of old age before exploring it all 6. Single player or Join one of many Worldwide Multiplayer Servers PVE/PVP/RP 7. Simple or complex Builds, your choice. With indepth logic blocks and functions for the dedicated builder 8. Advanced build mode with adjustable quantity line/plane/cube function, multi axis symmetry build, rotation etc. 9. Blueprints for saving creations, allowing you to respawn, trade, download from or upload to the community site10. Pre-existing NPC enemies and  AI modules so you can create your own enemies/allies...There is so much to this game that you really just need to try it. The possibilities are almost endless for those with a healthy imagination.Starmade is often compared to Minecraft graphically, though it has a much greater selection of block types available. Of course cubes are a given, it is voxel based afterall, but with wedges, corners and their variants your builds can be very sleek. This is the game you should graduate to when you get bored of Minecrafts limitations.If you simply can not deal with anything less than cinematic style realistic graphics then this game is likely not for you. Try out Empyrion or Space Engineers, both great games, but the trade off is you sacrifice the scope of the game environment.Sorry fans of Mass Effect and Half Life, but if you are looking for a deep engaging story with fully realized characters and plot, this is not your game.  But if you want to let your imagination loose and create your own story, your own universe alone or with friends then Starmade might be your flavour.  You will spawn into a universe with some inventory to get you going and a limitless expanse of space stretching out before you. If your first reaction is to look for someone to tell you what to do next, go back to the Steam Store and keep hunting, this is not your game.But if you see that epic expanse, and excitement fills your heart with the desire to explore, build and test the limitations of your imagination....welcome to the family!Basically put. When you were a child, if you saw a cardboard box and had a million ideas of what you could do with it and not one of them included storage, you will love Starmade.			"

Early Access Review
								I'll begin by saying the amount of hours I have playing this game, according to steam, is in no way relevant, as the game was just moved to steam very recently. I've been playing starmade ALOT. I've seen this game constantly change every month with new updates, each one improving the overall experience dramatically. This is still an early release, and like any other early release, your experience is not a guarenteed satisfactory one. There will be bugs. You will get frustrated. But overall it is worth it. And like many others that have reviewed this game, I agree that Starmade is one of very few early access games that I'd be ok with calling a ""full"" game, even though it is still not officially released.  Despite the occasional crashing and glitches, it is a very enjoyable game. But it is also a sandbox game, which means it is whatever YOU want it to be.I would not call this a minecraft clone. Do not listen to anyone who says it is. I do believe one of the developers of the game mentioned they based it off of minecraft, but it is a totally different experience. Some people have tried comparing it to the minecraft mod galacticraft, but even that is totally inaccurate. Still, if I had to compare, I'd say starmade was a mix of Eve Online, Dayz, and yes, Minecraft. Building: The building mechanics in this game are EXTREMELY advanced, and surpass minecraft by a long shot. It has everything I wanted in minecraft and more. There is a symmetry mode when building a ship or space station, there is an ""advanced building mode"" (activated by holding down ctrl in build mode), and there is an option to build more than one block at a time, and choose how many blocks on each axis (x, y or z) you want to place at once. This is customizable in the config, though the default is a max of  10x10x10. On one server, you could build up to 50x50x50. Now if you use x, y and z symmetry (and you have enough blocks for it) you can build quite a large mass in one click (though I wouldn't recommend it due to the lag involved). There is also wedges, coming in I believe 4 different types, and a wide range of different colored blocks. Overall, the things you can do with build mode is just insane. Pvp: On many servers, they have an ""anything goes"" rule to pvp. Essentially, this feels alot like rust or dayz, or even EVE online.  People can easily betray you, destroy your ships and stations and then warp out of your star system before you even knew what happened. Due to a recent update, factions are now extremely important in controlling and maintaining multiple star systems in your galaxy. There is always a risk in forming an alliance with people you don't know, but it is usually worth it. I'd advise to keep some secrets, however. Don't go around the server bragging about your new ship, or how many credits you made in a recent raid on a pirate station. If you are in a faction with random people, try to keep a hidden storage box somewhere in a remote system with backup supplies in case the faction falls apart. As for the actual combat, it can get pretty chaotic. There's three really basic weapons, cannons, damage beams and missile blocks. Theres also effect modules and computers to modify your weapons. If you connect an explosive effect computer to a missile computer, it increases the missiles blast radius. Connecting an ion effect computer to a cannon computer decreases the enemy ship's power, useful for stopping the enemy from warping away from you or cloaking. Theres also blocks like the stop effect computer, which can stop a ship from moving completely.  The shield capacitor block gives your entire ship some shields that stop your actual blocks from recieving damage. The shield recharger will recharge your shields automatically (if you have enough power) after you take damage. The amount of customization means no two pvp battles are the same, everyone is constantly improving their ships and experimenting with different ratios to try and find the perfect balance between damage and manueverability, or power consumption and protection, etc. Mining and crafting: I can't say too much about this, as I haven't really experimented enough with the new crafting system. Mining was not very profitable before, it was too hard to find resources and the amount of work involved did not seem very worth it to me. Due to the new universe and faction update, as well as the new shop update, mining has become pretty much a neccessity if you're playing on a survival server. If you are in a system that your faction owns, you get a bonus amount of minerals when you mine a block. This does help quite a bit, and with enough people in your faction it shouldn't be too much of an issue. But if you're playing solo, don't expect to make a multi-million block ship anytime soon. The largest ship I've ever made was about 20 million blocks, though I mostly used credits to buy the blocks i needed in shops, as well as having a friend using the (very old) crafting system supply me with the rest.Also, NOTE: This game, for the time being, IS FREE TO PLAY! It has always been free to play. HOWEVER!!! Like when minecraft was in beta, this will only be temporary. When the game is finally released, the price will go up and you will no longer be able to play for free. Ignore the title ""demo version"", it is not a demo. You have full access to the game for free right now. But I highly suggest buying the game as soon as possible, as it is getting closer to release every day.YES, I do definately recommend this game. It is very fun, and somewhat easy to learn, but it can get pretty complicated and technical if you want it to be. I'm not really sure what else to say. More content is being added every month. It is unlike any other game I have ever played, in that you can really immerse yourself in the game and be that spaceship pilot you always wanted to be as a kid. There are an infinite number of planets to explore, asteroids to mine, stations to capture and/or blow up with missiles, pirates and bandits to kill, loot to grab, ships to build, alliances to form, enemy factions to destroy, and fun to have ^_^			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: I only play this game seriously in multiplayer.This game had me hooked from the moment I saw it released on steam. I had no prior knowledge to its existance, and I wish I had. The prospect of freely being able to build my own ship, and on top of that, exploring an almost infinite number of galaxies and systems, was one of the one things I have been searching for in a game.The good:The game runs like a dream, due to its blocky, basic style, yet looks great while doing so.Exploring the initial galaxy you spawn in is a blast, flitting between systems, mining for resources and credits, trying to work up enough money to repair that station you found, or to even build your own station from scratch, and exploring the mysterious wormholes that spawn in various locations in the galaxyShip combat is a blast, there ae multiple weapons systems, upgrades, and combinations to use to your advantage. Want a huge flagship that fire seeking rockets that move faster than any ship built? Sure thing! You want a tiny scout ship with the laser cannon capacity to rip apart said flagship with a few well placed shots? Doable! Warp drives take alot of the time out of flying at a constant speed of 75 kmph (max speed in my singleplayer games for some reason.)The plane setting ability allows for perfectly symmetrical building, perfect for making models of famous ships, like the sloppy Battlecruiser I spent hours on. Building in itself is also fun, as you get to explore what possibilities you have with weapons and defensive systems, along with the logic blocks they've added in. I'm still exploring the destructive capabilities of certain weapons themselves.The gray areas:Generating a planet takes ALOT of computing power, and my poor little Dell ♥♥♥♥♥ itself trying. ""Get a better PC"" yes, I'm aware. Money is limited, sir. And at the moment, I have none. Pirates steal blueprints from your catalouge, but when they start using a turret I designed for my flagship (a jumbled block of power generators, sheilds, and a seeker rocket array) to try and kill me and/or chase me down, (note: no thrusters are on said turret) it gets comical really fast.Stars, Pirate stations and Crabs often have MUCH to big of a range for their respective sizes. I was taking hits from a Prate station's turrets from 2 sectors away, hull damage from a star that was 3 sectors away, and a Crab found its way across an entire galaxy, flew into my space station, and buzzed of the little health I was rocking on, after I warp drived several times and used a wormhole to get away from the accursed station it was hiding in. The bad:Most Pirate turrets do RIDICULOUS ammounts of damage, especially to a new player only starting with 2.5k credits. Just asking that for new players' sake, tone it down a bit?Pirate stations have a nasty habit of generating in the sectors right beside the spawn shop, and even though it says you're protected, you can get endlessly spawnkilled.Money is a bit difficult to come by, especially when you need something the size of an aircraft carrier to be able to get away unscathed, and the factories require HUGE ammounts of resources to make shipbuilding materials. I know some servers have made it so that you start with large ammounts of money, but trying to play singleplayer can be downright infuriating at some points from the lack of knowledge new people might have, and lack of money/resources. A ""peaceful"" type of setting might be nice for this.On the rare occasion, I've had Crabs spawn inside my claimed and repaired station, and it gets to be very tedious patching holes in both my cruiser and my station.Other than the few issues I've seen, the game is amazing. I especially enjoy teaming up with other players in large battleships to take town a pirate base, and man, is that a blast. I hope the devs take even more interesting routes with this game, and make it even more fun!Cheers,UPDATE ADDITION:I can no longer play this game, because the laucher repeatedly crashes the game after loading the world i created. until i can successfully load up a world, i hate the game :>~Doge			"

								I've played for a ""few"" hours.  I've been a player, faction leader, and now I help run a server called Light vs Dark.Briefly:  The part about this game that I think separates it from similar games is that EVERYTHING is built block by block.  There is no ""turret"" block.  YOU build the turret.  Ever been playing MineCraft and wish you could build a spaceship and have massive battles in space?  Or maybe have a better build mode?  Well, StarMade might be for you then.  You can easily build massive structures and designs.  Battling can be fun, if you don't take it personally, and ALWAYS save a blueprint backup!Pros:  Building your own ships is fun.  If you like building aesthetically, you can.  Or if you want to roleplay, you can.  Combat with smaller ships can be a lot of fun with friends (and enemies).  If you want, build an empire and subjucate the universe to your power.  There are also *some* tools to do modding, like server wrappers, custom decorative blocks, and changing recipes.  AND best of all, you can try the full game for free and play for as long as you'd like.  Just download the demo or go to starmade.org and download it and create a free account.  If you want to support the game, definitely go buy it.  I got my money's worth for sure with thousands of hours played.Cons:  The playerbase has been going down lately, and a big part of what makes this game fun is playing with other people.   I run a server that used to have 30 people on it at a time, but now it's been quiet.  This is sad to see.  There are also bugs, since it's a rather small development team, but they do move at a surprising pace (if you compare it to how quickly MineCraft used to release updates).  Also, I should mention that this game isn't for everybody.  Many people will try it, die and fail, and quit.  Also, some players will create really intensely laggy ships and crash their games, so my suggestion is to build realistically sized ships or join a server with active admins who will help keep things running smoothly.When you play tips:  My suggestion to anybody is to team up with other new players when you try the game out.  Fly with friends and you'll have a much better time.  And do not take on powerful factions unless you want to get creamed.  But don't let the rating on steam discourage you from trying the game.  We could use the new players, and some of you will be like me, and enjoy the game for thousands of hours.  :)			"

								first off I want to say do not take my word for it - just play the demo on a server with some people watch some youtube (I would recommend ""Bench"" clear speaking right to the point) about some of the things you can come up with and hey the demo's free and its like 300MBs of download - why not try it?so without further commentsso allot of people looking at this game compare it to minecraft or a simpler version of space engineers doing so however is a major lack of understanding - so to help clear things up does it use blocks and a voxel based world like minecraft? yes - the block based worlds are easier to build in and allow for more customization then solid pieces or snap to functions but the depth of creation from the varied blocks allow for many more then just cube designs  is it minecraft in space? no - the customization from the game allows linking systems and custom designs that range from space stations to a colony on planets  to ships of any shape or sizeis this space engineers simpler cousin?no - while space engineers I agree has some better graphics and a few cool factors allot of it is premade blocks - want a anti missile or anti player turret just build one drop it - what a anti missile turret in starmade? decide on weapons dozens of choices of what to shoot down missiles with then how many barrels do you want - is a cloud of shrapnel more important? or is it a stream of minigun fire - its your choice the entire turret is custom made - like the turret save it for later - don't like it rebuild it whats the big difference between space engineers and starmade? well the simple version is - starmades a game space engineers is a simulation - sure I know what your thinking whats the difference? a game doesn't let reality hold it down its meant to sit back and have fun on not determine if some angry newton lover is gonna blow you up for not useing the right real life science (seriously look it up they have a entire griefer based society that attacks people in space engineers for not using real science in construction of ships!) where as the community of starmade is far nicer and relaxed - people duel in pvp rather then stomp some noob - and the community you draw says allot about your gameso starmade sure it looks like other games - sure its a early access game - but what does that mean you get for 10 dollars?  (or 4 copies for 30 dollars meaning you and 3 friends can enjoy this game for the cost of 1 of the other 2 games) in short just about unlimited space sandbox - want massive carriers or a simple fighter or anything in between - want to work on a multiplayer game as a trader or ship builder or even a pirate - do it - the people are friendly and mostly fun to work with - the new rail system was a game changer and people are not mad about it but over joyed about rebuilding starmade is a gem in the rough at the moment and while they have a ways to go they already have more stuff to do then allot of 30+ dollar games out there that are finished so give it a try and you will not regret it if you love sandbox games			"

								Starmade has been in development for a while, and it will be for a while longer. But updates are consistent, the core mechanics are solid, and the game already offers an ton of fun to those it caters to right now. But because it is still very much in development, a number of mechanics are still missing, meaning that for now it does cater to a more specific group. Namely the one that absolutely can't resist building creative things with a full suite of editing tools, blowing them up and strutting around in their creations in front of their fellow community members.The comparison to Minecraft is easily draw of course, and one should rightfully compare the two. However, even in mimicing some elements, the game always implements them in its own unique way, making it a breath of fresh air for some veteran MC players like me. That said, the implementation is usually more complex and intricate than its counterpart, so be prepared for a learning curve, thankfully often rewarded with the awesome result of your contraptions.For now, the worlds are pretty scarcely populated and static, meaning that if your desire is not to build and start exploring all sorts of wonderful places, you might be disappointed. A huge amount of content is planned, but it will take time, with the first of these updates hitting soon in the form of massively upgraded space stations. Interfaces and tutorials are also quite barebones for the time being. Very useful and functional once you get a hang of them, but harder to learn and slapped together in places. If learning isn't your sort of thing, move on for now.===================In short, the game already features a great amount of mechanics that can provide you with a lot of fun if you like building, warping & blowing stuff up in your own creations, but for now, lacks content and might seem intimidating to players just starting out.Good:- Full suite of building tools- Very optimised- Very scalable- Infinite universe- Procedural damage & debris- Innovative hexagonal planetsBad:- Improvised interface- Lack of explorable content- Steep learning curve- Unbalanced economyIf you have any sort of creative or adventurous spark to you, definately try it and start creating or join a world without limits!If not, maybe skip it and check back in another 6 months or so for the next batch of updates.

								Oh the possibilities....But god schine, you really are f@%#ing it up-Game needs to focus on optimization for servers, ive had several owners rage quit the game because of the bs they have to put up with. -The community is run by a shady domain squatter who cares little for the community, fire him and get someone else, or host your own website. There is no need for him really, he uses XenForo templates to create it.-Game has been in alpha for 4 years, you need to polish this♥♥♥♥♥♥and go to beta ASAPHowever on a more positive note... -Building ships requires great skill and time but is extremely satisfying-Warfare on certain servers (depending on faction config) can be fun, especially when played on a high levelDespite its problems the game can be fun when playing with a large group. I encourage new players to do so. This will also help you learn the game as it has a very steep learning curve.			"

								I'm going to keep this review short. I'm thinking wall of text reviews only appeal to certain types of people, not the majority here.Pros: VAST space, just like it should be.Even as of this writing worth the money the developer is asking. 30 hours played.. for free on a demo that is the full game, but free during alpha. Well worth the $10 asking price, even in its early access state.Fun with FriendsModableCons: A bit of a grind for resources, as you should expect when building huge ships.Sometimes so VAST it takes awhile to fly to your friends. While options exist for faster means of travel, they aren't so easy to attain when your just starting out.Takes time to design a ship, but with the blueprint system its design once, re-create many times, and on different servers (if that server allows it).

I've gone in an out of the tester staff and I can safely say this game is going in an excellent directionPros: Fully-Functional Faction systemSeveral weapon combinations in gameGreater amount of detail for constructionMassive galaxies for explorational funDev team that responds to criticism and input, and is personally involved with communityCons: Still an alpha product - a bit on the unstable sideStill needs a lot of optimization for serversThe community has a few bad apples that tend to be elitist as all hell, but this is relatively minor.I'd recommend getting the demo since it's the same thing as the full version. If you really like it, buy it. But if early-access games and alpha games frustrate you, or maybe if you are really young and do not understand computers, go ahead and just get the demo.			"

Do you want this game?I'll just go straight to the point.. Go download the demo, play it for free and decide for yourself, but don't forget to sleep.Cons:There are alot of typos in the game... Not that I should complain about typos...Some stuff still have missing explenations.I hear there are a few bugs.. Somewhere.I can't really play this game smoothly on my Intel HD family graphics card containing craptop.There are enough settings in the game/server launcher to overwhelm the average user.The learning curve...Could use more singleplayer content.Its Early Access, and that scares alot of people away.Pros:Minimum system requirements are low, but I think you can still put your super powered gaming mega tower to the test with it if you want to.The game has a lot of fancy features that results in even more fancy player made contentYour creativity is your limit.Epic PVP system.Epic building and crafting system.Epic logic system.Epic!You can host a dedicated server, join a small server with friends, or join a larger server online. The multiplayer is win.The dev team seems to value user input highly. The community has a say!Its still in alpha, so most of the cons will disappear over time while the ammount of fancy features will grow.I recommend this game to:Sandbox enthusiastsSpace shooter enthusiastsCreative soulsAnyone who likes minecraft or EVE-OnlineGamers in generalYou "

								I've played this game since it's very earliest days, since the days.  I love this game and most of my best friends I have met because of this game, but I cannot for the life of me actually recommend it to anyone, but I can't really say I discourage people from playing it either. and don't let my steam Record fool you, I have a LOT more hours in this game than it lets on. as I have been playing before this game came to steam.The game feels like it's in development hell.  they keep shoveling out broken updates, which sometimes breaks old stuff.  fix it with duct tape. sends it back out rinse and repeat.  there are some problems from years ago they still have yet to fix.and they only seem to fix it when it is so broken that they are forced to fix it. lest there are riots in the streets.it is actually smarter to keep your server outdated for a few days when a new update drops than gamble with it and risking everyone who plays on your server being royally angry. ESPECIALLY if it may do weird things to the universe.The player base is dying.  people are leaving, people are losing interest. a new broken update hits, players spike for a little bit, but when that's all said and done, it starts dropping again.  servers like the one I play on are getting less and less players joining, and as a result are dead, or dying.personally I can't play it anymore.  I had a good run, and I got my 14.99 out of it x1000 times over.If you think you can still have fun with it despite the warnings I've given you, power to you.  Give it a shot, you might love it as well.  if you got friends to play with you fantastic!  I hope your times playing this game are great.			"

								I have hundreds of hours in this game and yet I had to sit here for a few minutes to just decide what I was going to say about StarMade. In short, it is completely overwhelming. I spawned into my server and did the tutorial..... twice. I then realized how poorly made the tutorial is and proceeded to go find youtube videos on how to get started. This helped tremendously and I returned to the game ready to become a space exploring master. I quickly built my first little ship and flew to a shop to buy some more parts with my starting credits. I had my first mining ship ready to go in a little over an hour and from that point the game has only gotten more awesome. I soon lost my first ship to a wave of rogue pirates and had to start over. I was upset but it taught me the simple truth that space is not a friendly utopia. My next ship was still a mining ship but I equipped weapons, light armor, and some shields to ensure my long worked for investment would not be lost again. I now have some friends on the server with me and we have all started building capitol ships, cruisers, and stations. The game's building system is the most wonderful thing I have experienced in a ""voxel"" style game. The ability to mirror on all 3 axes, bulk block place, free rotation camera, copy/paste options, undo/redo buttons, and template saving/loading are just a few of the functions this game offers IN ALPHA. You can even save/upload ship templates from the registry or your computer into the game server for purchase and building! I could not ask for a more appropriately envisioned building system. If you see the reviews stating the game has a steep learning curve, they would be right. But don't let that dissuade you from grabbing a copy for free while in alpha! Its free, what do you have to lose other than some time? It is definitely worth a look at least.The controls are a bit clunky but that is because the range of motion and movement directions and ship menus are so plentiful they had to map nearly every key on the keyboard to a button. It takes some getting used to especially the getting around in 0G part. The game is buggy and occasionally runs out of memory or has a java fatal exception. Its an EARLY ACCESS title and to expect perfection is just not realistic. It isn't even that common of an event honestly.  Even with the few negatives I've mentioned above this game is still unreal. The scope and size is just absurd. I looked at my first galaxy where I spawned in and realize it would take months to explore all of those stars. Then I found several neighboring galaxies and the realization dawned..... YOU ARE SO TINY AND INSIGNIFICANT. You are a speck of dirt in one solar system, in a galactic neighborhood with thousands of other solar systems, in a galactic cluster containing thousands of galaxies, in a universe containing thousands of galactic clusters..... It blew my mind to see the scale on the map. Sure it sounds ""big"" when its written out in text or as you see the stars from in the game. But opening that galactic map.... it is so overwhelming. TL;DRIf you want an overwhelming space experience, like building spaceships, want something different from many other games on the market, and are willing to accept and understand what EARLY ACCESS means, then please download the demo and get started. I chose to purchase a 4 pack of this for myself and some friends not long after getting the demo version. It is that good.  I don't do this often, but if you would like, add me and I would be happy to help walk you through some of the basics. I have several private servers up and running on US East Coast including one to provide a slightly safer ""new player"" friendly environment.			"

								TL;DR at the end.So I have been playing Starmade for quite some time, clearly. With this review I will attempt to tell yall why I have nearly 1000hrs in this game.I love it. I hate it. Never have I come across a game that can enrage me as much as this yet I still play it. I could not tell you how many times I stopped myself from punching my screen and snapping my keyboard in half just because I knew that if I did, I would not be able to play anymore. Minecraft never got my attention any more than ""oh, that looks neat"". The idea of building a house and then what? Oooooo I have a house or a village or a Grand Castle! Good for you! Now what does it do? What do you do with it? That does not capture my intrest. You know what does? I can build a Grand Castle, pack it full of power generators, shields, engines and 'frikkin laser beams to go blow up anything I come across in the Galaxy.Not all is fun and games in the 'verse though. There are issues. Glitches and bugs and bad coding, Oh My! Sometimes your turrets will teleport themselves halfway across the sector. Sometimes your ship wont fully load and it looks like you are missing half of it. Weapons 99% of the time work great, 1% of the time, they work about as good as a screen door on an airlock. Yes, the Devs are very active. They do listen to the players. Updates rather often. Unfortunatly, the updates do kinda break the game sometimes. But, they get patched, things are a little wonky for a few days, then its back. All is good.I couldnt tell you how many new people Ive seen pop in on a server and start screaming ""sum 1 halp me! I haz the dumb n dnt knw what 2 do!!!!!"" And when nobody responds because we are all too buisy with our brain cells commiting seppuku, they get butt hurt and leave without ever playing the game. Look, play the Tutorial, watch YouTube vids, get yourself into a good Faction. For the love of (insert desired religious icon here) dont type in general chat with ""L337 speak"" or ""Millennial texting shorthand""! Take your time, learn the game, I can almost promise you that you will enjoy it.TL;DR----You like Space Engineers? Good for you, this is better. You like Minecraft? You need to upgrade.You like Eve? Cool, so did I. Get this instead. "

								In case you missed it: DEMO IS FULL GAME. DOWNLOAD DEMO = FREE FULL GAME (currently)If you want to make startrek/wars/whatever replicas this game is incredible. It has hands down the best tools for building in any voxel game i've seen; copy/pasting sections, placing large lines/circles/boxes/cylinders with ease, saving and loading ships/turrets/drones is quick once you know how, and building basic ships is extremely easy; only more advanced design aspects like weapon slaving, logic and moving components really require looking up information online. There are also tools for importing and exporting ships as 3D models. In addition the engine's performance is quite solid, i'm on a 5 year old machine and it can still handle 500m ships duking it out, 100s of drones or mining ships eating entire asteroids in one go. It has problems in some cases, like thousands of homing missiles, but it's generally well optimized with a few hiccups still in the game.So why, with all these great things and 2000 hours ingame am i not recommending this?Every single mechanic in the game is a broken mess. All the weapons are imballanced, to the point where of the 300+ weapon combinations only about 5 are actually useful. As far as survival/progression goes the game has nothing to do. You can create any item in the game in a few minutes at most from starting out, and once you get larger miners going resource collecting is utterly trivial. All the factories in the game are made from generic materials or bought for 1% of your starting money so forget about making any kind of intricate factories. And it's been like this for 2 years now.The game is early alpha and these things would normally be expected to be fixed later, but the developers seem to have no idea where they're going with the game, focusing on large procedurally generated universes (where did we see this before...) and pointless ship cosmetics instead of actual gameplay.If you just want to build stuff, it's a great game.If you want to do anything with the stuff you build, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.

								I recently Picked this up.I thought to myself that this would be a quaint little game.As a matter of fact.. I didn't even install it for a week or two.. and barely took interest of it.Then I decided to give it a shot.  Now I find myself losing sleep trying to construct large vessels that can destroy my enemies with as few shots as possible.   Now I have become power mad and began to exterminate pirates in my chosen sector just so I can rule over it (by myself.. but It's all good).  I been playing Minecraft for years and I have always wanted to be able to do this.  The game still feels a bit empty, but for now, that actually feels good to me.  Space feels lonely and cold and I enjoy warping through it with a giant battlecruiser I spent 7 days building.  Pirates can be derpy at times, it gives me a giggle when they suddenly stop moving and you can just tear them apart.The tutorials in game are ok but not always sufficient, I really would of liked a more in-depth ship building tutorial.  I didn't fully understand how to make stronger weapons untill i decided to fight a pirate ship.  Nevertheless, It's a fantastic game to play and if you got it, play it!  If you don't got it, get it!			"

								*DEMO VERSION = FULL GAME = FREE = YOU SOLD ME ON THIS GAME = HAPPY!*First: A Review about the Price / Demo / Free Thing:Other game companies vying for attention in the ""Early Access"" Arena (huge competition there) should take note of what StarMade has done with their business model. They are offering the full version of the game as a ""Demo"" for Free. Yes Free. You can play it as much as you want now, during Alpha - and then decide to buy. I don't know of many other Early Access games that are doing this ... in fact many of them are asking 25 to 40 bucks or more just to play a buggy Alpha version of their game with no guarantee they're going to keep developing or finish the game. I don't really like those odds and I have thrown money into Early Access games that are now collecting dust in my Library because the devs just stopped working on it.  StarMade is asking a very low price of 10 bucks right now ... that's less than you probably pay to go see a movie! DO IT. This price won't last. When the game grows in popularity and is more developed, that price will go up. This is smart marketing. Rather than asking a big up-front price for the Alpha and then slowly lowering that price via sales on Steam over time, these guys are smart. Ask NOTHING up front (Free Full Version / Demo) and a very small buy-in price. I'm impressed! Steam 'works' because players read reviews, players look at what's popular and selling fast in Early Access ... so asking a low up front price or even better, letting us play it FREE will get this game a lot of attention and fast. Now - The Game Review - Worth It?YES - YES - YES.This game is really solid for an early access game and has a lot more functionality and items than I was first expecting. I did not think it would have so many building parts and that exploring would be limited or simplistic in looks but WOW was I wrong.This is Minecraft-In-Space! Graphics - The textures, colors and graphics are awesome - better than most minecraft texture mods.Crafting - Gathering resources is easy and fun -- no blocks dropping off into space or down holes ... just ZAP and it's in your inventory. Putting bits together is easy and though the GUI for the crafting screen is still pretty rudimentary, it's intuitive enough you can get it easily.*EDIT* (Dec 11th) - After playing this a lot more over the past 4 days, I have come to realize the crafting system in StarMade is actually very complex (deceptively simple looking at first) and takes some learning to get the hang of (videos by other players helped) - so don't be fooled by the simple Minecraft look - it's a lot more indepth. There are factories of varying levels and power supplies must be maintained, and parts for your ships must be manufactured and assembled in a more complex way than I first realized. Again, I am very surprised at how much complexity they've already put into such an early Alpha game. StarMade's been in the works for quite a few years and it shows with how polished the crafting system is. If you were afraid it would be too 'simple' then let me reassure you this crafting system will challenge even the most detail-oriented game crafters.Tutorial - The Tutorial is very indepth and helpful (needs a little grammar / typo work - hey I'm for hire!) ;). I would advise doing the tutorial and then watching some player guides on youtube before you really start building your ship because it's somewhat tricky at first to get all the blocks in the right arrangement for a power efficient and secure ship while at the same time making it look good.Ships - Building your ship is pretty simple once you get the hang of the control blocks and such. Again, do the tutorial! I've looked at some of the amazing creations others have made online (videos and screeshots) and am very impressed at the unique and endless possibilities for your ship creations. Imagine if some of the insane things you've seen built in Minecraft could lift off and fly through space!Combat - I have done only a little of this so far being a newbie - but it seems solid and the options to upgrade and customize your ship's weapons is indepth and varied ... the crafting nuts who love space games (EVE Online?) will love this! There are shields and jammers and turrets and all the usual spacecraft type combat arsenals.Exploration - Flying around is a joy and the controls are so simple even my 5 year old can do it and loves it. Radomly picking a direction and heading off into the great unknown of space for some far off sector of the galaxy is really fun and relaxing too. There's some good 'Explorer-zen' in this game.Vast Universe - The Galaxy Map is pretty amazing too. I'm still trying to sort out navigating it but having a great time buzzing about the starter galaxy to get the hang of it. Scrolling out to see the sheer immense (infinite) size of the Universe was pretty mind boggling the first time!Planets! - Last but certainly not least - The PLANETS.  O-M-G. I was absolutely stunned the first time I entered the atmosphere of my first planet and took a look at the amazing creation before me. The physics are well done and the geometric shape of the planet is fun and so very minecraft-esque! *Edit* Planets are ""Dodecahedrons"" technically! The planets actually slowly rotate and it's such a fun feeling to bounce around on them, explore and gather minerals and such. Definitely my favorite part so far.Summary (TLDR): THIS IS MINECRAFT-IN-SPACE ... DO IT!! "

								<[PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS GAME'S FULL VERSION IS FREE THROUGH THE DEMO UNTIL APLPHA IS OVER]>Now that that small fact that most people miss ENTIRELY is over, let's get down to the review. My hours spent are fairly low in comparison to most of my other games, but I also spend quite a bit of time on the standalone version. Yes, you can download the standalone through the Starmade.org website. If you buy it here, you can link accounts and have full version there, aswell. Actual features time.+ The vistas you see in space are absolutley breathtaking.+ Massive ships are made far easier to build using the Advanced Build Mode tools. Size sliders, anyone?+ The community so far has been great. The skin system was fully released and fixed recently, so now you can make your astronaut look however you like.+ Best weapons customisation I have seen in block cannons by far. You can slave systems to other systems to create combo weapons, such as seeker missiles or rapid fire cannons.+ Great factions system, and while teh new chat took some getting used to, it's quite a bit better than the last one. (Messages scroll in the proper direction now)+/- You can make amazingly huge ships, all it takes is time and dedication. However, these large ships can be laggy.- Coded in Java, some users will experience issues.- Still has some major bugs, but I havn't encountered any that have truley broken my game.And that's about it on what I have to say. I would LOVE to see more texture packs from the community, and rotating blocks and joints would be amazing aswell. All in all, it's a good space battle and space ship building game.[EDIT]: Just updated a few days ago, and the game is probably 50% better than it was before because of the new Rail system. Easy docking, the ability to move ships on rails... it's a beautiful thing. No more annoying docking boxes!			"

								WARNING: IF YOU HAVE AN INTEL DRIVER ON YOUR COMPUTER, THIS WILL NOT START WITHOUT SOME FIDDLING AROUND.If you're like me, you have an Intel card and a Nvidia card. To get this to launch correctly, you must open your Nvidia control panel and go to ""manage 3D settings"". Once there, click on the program settings tab, and find Starmade in the drop first drop down. Then click on the second drop down and find  the High-Preformance NVIDIA proccessor option. Then click apply, exit, and run Starmade!As for other ghraphic cards, I have no idea. I've only ever used NVIDIA so I wouldn't know :/As for the game itself, lots of fun! Its kinda like Starbound 3D. You build awesome space ships, fight pirates, gather resources, and even land on 3D planets with their own gravity!All in all, if this game starts it is alot of fun. :D			"

								I've played the game long before it came to steam and it's only become more and more increasingly fun. The creativity is endless, the features just keep flowing with imagination. Even the simple things like dismembering a ship is fun. A few things I'd recommend to the devs for the future, more frequent pirate spawns in unprotected sectors, civilian sectors and towns with escorts and freighters. Fleet commanding to have multiple ships in single player by your side, and more features to the NPC's like piloting or certain room control (IE: Engineers or gunenrs)All in all the game is beautifully made and well worth the 9.99$ investment			"

								I first started playing this years ago, when it was just starting out and was far rougher than it is now. What I had when I first started playing:- Hull blocks (I don't think I even had wedges, now they have corners, tetras, and others)- Blocks make power.- Cannons go pew pew and damage stuff.- Missiles go boom boom and blow stuff up.- Some other really basic things like shields.- Random stations here and there (all the same, some had pirates)- No main menu, just a launcherWhat we have now:- 3 different types of hull (hull, armor, advanced armor) with different shapes of blocks.- A bunch of new weapon systems.- All weapons systems can have effects added to them, like punch-through and explosive effect.- CHEWIE GET US OUTTA HERE! (Jump drives)- CHEVRON 1 LOCKED (Warp gates)- Plenty of random spawn stations- A GUI that doesn't make me want to rip my eyes out.- An actual main menu that works pretty well.Along with so many other things I won't fill up this post with. You get the idea, this thing may as well be a new game from when I first started. We're still getting updates (Last one as of this post was 9/9/16, before that was 8/28/16), and the developers actually seem to listen to the players. (Check the most recent update notes). Don't forget it's FREE in alpha, so you have nothing to lose! TRY IT!			"

								WARNING: If you want to build cool♥♥♥♥♥♥& venture across the universe w/ buddies this game IS NOT FOR YOU.To issue this game a bad review is no easy task for me, it was a favorite for a very long time and I clung onto the hope that things would be developed in a direction that continued to interest me--unfortunately this is not the case.PROS:- Build system is better than Minecraft or ANY other block based sandbox in EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING WAY. (This absolutely 100% includes jokes like Space Engineers and Empyrion). NOTE: Having now played Avorion, I can no longer stand by this comment. StarMade's srongest point is building and it does a great job, but it is outclassed by the ability to scale and skew blocks in Avorion.- If you love redstone in Minecraft, StarMade's logic system will blow your mind.- ITS IN SPACE!CONS:- Insanely long ""alpha"" cycle. 6 years?- Development direction appears geared toward singleplayer and RTS [elements], very unfortunate.- There is still very little content to actually enjoy or play.- Remaining community would rather reject you than hear criticism. #fanboy- Developer neopotism. Don't ask about that Tomino guy.- Developer response to criticisms from community, ""♥♥♥♥ off and make your own game.""- Buggy as ♥♥♥♥, as in while rare its possible to loose ALL of your work if you don't quadruple backup everything up always. ..and that's just the tip of the ice berg.- Complicated systems: Many of the systems in the game are overly complicated to new players; from power efficiency to display tech, there is much here to overwhelm and send them running.- Engine cannot handle its own damage calculations for multiplayer combat, too many missles crashes servers.- Engine forever locked into java because lead dev made it himself--really amazing, but sucks at the same time: In example, distribution of damage calculations leading to client instability in a multiplayer setting.- Added RTS elements, such as: fleets, micromanaging fleet control, NPC factions, NPC fleets, NPC fleets controlling territory. More planned and publicly acknowledged micromanagement elements such as crews. These elements may be appealing to some, not me. It is also my opinion that they are the wrong direction given some of the aforementioned areas the engine falls short.- Dwindling playerbase.RIP StarMade. Loved you long time.You had more potential than all the unity survival clones combined and it has been squandered.These statements constitute my opinions and experiences based on years of playing this game, becoming one of the more established twitch streamers of this game, becoming one of the more established builders in the greater community of this game and finally being elected by the community twice to serve on a community council to work with the developers of this game. I resigned my second term over qualms about council activity (foremost amongst other things like these criticisms), leading to other resignations, a reformation of the council and eventually the temporary disbanding of that organization. I backed away from the community and game for many reasons, however, to date I am unable to elaborate on all of the reasons behind this because of NDA. The visibility of this review has been toggled off and on due to harassment and I will continue to remove comments inciting or participating in flame war as well as those making baseless and uninformed accusations or insults against me; such as stating that I never was on the council long enough to even be under NDA and thusly am full of♥♥♥♥♥♥or that my opinion that development feels decidedly inclined toward RTS and SP is some grand conspiracy to make the developers look bad. While the lead developer has stated the game is not going to be an RTS, I have criticized its RTS elements here and my intent has never been to convince people it is something it is not, an RTS--something the developer's and fanbase should try for a change. The spam posting and harassment speak volumes of some of my criticisms about what has gone wrong with this title. ..and now, this: https://xkcd.com/1357/ "

								The most accessible space building game yet.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the theme of space. I've spent a few hours on this game with a friend of mine, she and I trecked through space in what could only be described as a ""Miner's Life"". Due to the game being far from complete, it is without question that methods of income are highly limited. The game begins you off with only a few blocks, the essentials for a hopeful star-merchant or space-hero, the basic thrusters, some cannons, a core for your ship, power supply blocks and some armors. Being a new-found space explorer, it is without question that chasing down pirates it THE stupidest thing you can attempt. ( Although it may be possible to successfully bring down a pirate at the start. )Each system is a bit complex but it doesn't mean they are impossible for beginners to learn.Power System suggestion: DO NOT CLUMP YOUR POWER SUPPLIES! It's ineffective.The way the power supply works, I found it highly effective to line your system up in two 1 x X (X being any number you can afford ) lines that are spaced by one block each. So your systems would look like this:--------------------------------------------------   Each dash being power blocks.I'm not adept enough to figure out how the weapons systems work but from my research they're highly ineffective when clumped. I've seen a lot of suggestions stating that thirty cannon block separate and independent of each other are far more effective than all of them combined. Making bigger cannons practically useless.Also included in this game is a crafting system which I have not personally tested, it allows for the mined raw materials to be crafted into processed variants.Also worth noting: Each star CAN be approached. It's a matter of designing a ship that won't be obliterated by the time you reach it. Planets can be approached as well and even be built on to house a base or landing dock for the miners and would-be pirates.There are still a lot of systems that are implemented that I haven't even touched. A lot being complex or lacking an updated guide. For example: Turret systems, boarding systems, in depth power supplies, and as I've said before, weapons sytems.It is a game worth checking out and I highly suggest trying it with a friend.			"

								As a man who plays many survival type games. I can say that I fell in love with this game. It's not so much survival, as it is more like Minecraft than it is Rust, but space pirates!Mind you, I hate Minecraft. I put a lot of hours into it while I was away from home with no internet, but that game is boring, but it was the only limitless, unbeatablish, game I could play at the time. I also ran out of storylines on other console games.I've gotten lost in the game and lost track of time. I'm a military guy. I go to sleep at 2200, wake up at 0530 and go to work. The past couple nights, I've stayed up till 0100 and woke up at 0530. The space exploration is fun. Finding planets and trying to build an epic ship. Pure Awesome. Accept the space pirates.. They like to blow up your ship and send you back into the void crying.Totally worth the money. It's still in alpha (I'm pretty sure), and being so, starting the game for the first time took some googling, you have to dedicate ram to it yourself. To put it in fullscreen took googling, you have to go into the javascript and actually change part of the code *hint hint* You also have to go onto their site to register that you bought it through steam, which is simple. They are working on making it automatic, and seem like a great group of Devs.I would give this game a 4/5			"

								There are many block building games and clones, and from the screenshots and videos of Starmade you may feel that this is just another one. I caution you to not fall into this line of thinking and give Starmade a chance. As of this writing, the game is completely free to play and downloadable from the developers website during it's alpha period.Is it Minecraft in space? No. It's a starship game with a block building motif.Like many people cutting their teeth with block building games, I felt restricted. Even with mods and redstone advancement I felt my creations were static and dead. I felt any attempts to construct creations of grandeur were less not a matter of creativity but more overcoming the limitations that the game enforced. Resource management and collection was more of a hinderance than anything, and I spent more time micromanaging furnaces than playing the actual game.With Starmade I felt free to explore and expand in any way I chose. Even in survival mode the pursuit of expansion seemed more rewarding and the progression of my ships was smooth. The game developers provided basic tools (admittedly with a bit of a learning curve) throughout to make sure that you are able to build and play the game fast. You spend less time flying around collecting materials as asteroids with resources are plentiful and respawn throughout the galaxies. Automation, factories, logic, and filtering sort your materials the way YOU choose. Building tools that mirror and place blocks in bulk, with in-game guides make it fast and easy to lay down your ship designs. Blueprints and shipyards make saving your designs and testing out new things a breeze.Any aspect of the game of interest to you? Focus on it! You can go as big or small as you want. Build planet-sized mining rigs, or quick-rapid fire fighter craft... or make small stealth ships to just explore the universe. Best of all, the developers and community are in constant communications... sharing ideas and opinions, fixing bugs and adding enhancements to the game constantly. The list of upcoming features is fantastic and after watching it's development for years I have yet to see them cancel or reject a truly anticipated feature.Starmade is one of the few games that I allowed myself to fall into because I felt there were no limits.I played for three years, primarily before it was Greenlit. Starmade was the one game I could always come home to. It became my favorite game to play anytime I had free moment. Sadly, I am writing this review now only as I am parting ways with it.Space, by it very nature, is empty. When you are lacking content you have to make your own fun, and it's hard playing multi-player games alone. It is true there are quite a few Starmade servers with players on 24/7, but the current state of the game does not encourage teaming up with those who may be untrustworthy. Factions are available though somewhat limited at the time of this writing, and there are no 'personal' access blocks. That being said, I can't get a single one of my gamer friends interested in playing Starmade.I am not a game developer and will not attempt to act as if I know the solution, but when I demo Starmade to my friends from the ground up all they see is the void of space and not much else. In most survival games the start is a mad rush to get yourself equipped and protected as soon as possible. Your first dirt hut is an amazing achievement. In Starmade, you may as well never even leave the starting shop if you so choose. There is no call to action, no shove out the door, no impending doom, nothing making a new user wish to 'do' anything.I believe in Schine (the developers of Starmade).  I have no doubt that with their efforts and the support of the existing fan base they will absolutely polish and shine Starmade into a diamond. I just don't know how long that it will take. With that in mind, it's time for me to dock my ship for now, shut down the reactors, mothball the factories, and close up shop.So long, and thanks for all the fish.Edit: Note - As of Jan 16th, 0.19549 personal blocks have been added. I will update my review further when I come back to the game.			"

								Ah StarMade.First off this is a fantastic game... don't get me wrong, so much potential, such a wonderful concept being brought to life! BUT and yes that is a big, big but.There are some very serious issues with performance when it comes to loading planets.... like game dropping out issues, even when everything is turned to low it still does not help.I honestly cannot get near most of them because they are too big and it causes a critical error. And no it isn’t my pc as I am running decent hardware.Being Alpha I understand we are bug testing. So I am not angry as such, more disappointed at something that shouldn’t have even been an issue in the first place, the description says this game is built to run on older PC's and I am telling to right at this very moment this would not run on an older PC if my rig cannot handle it.I recommend this game to those who are interested but I warn any who purchase that there will be that optimization issue that stops players from exploring some planets.So devs:1. Fix optimization issue2. actually start us out on a planet and not right next to a space traging post where we can basically build a ship straight away.3. fix descriptions as some of them don't even exist yet also there are spelling mistakes in a few of them.Thats pretty much all I can think at this point in time, I will be sure to update you on gameplay and any other issues that in find :) Keep up the good work!**EDIT**Okay so for those who are also experiencing any issues with planets loading, I have found that if you get to the point where the planet just starts to load, press esc, alt+tab and do something else for 5 mintues while it loads.Helped me get to a planet that actually crashed my game several times :)**EDIT UPDATE**So after another hour or 2 I have managed to get a fair amount of materials, storage and am starting to build a large enough ship to hopefully raid a pirate station (hopefully), I have a homebase with its own spawn point and am slowly but surly working towards my own station!Gameplay and performance seem to get better as you get further through the game, maybe that's just y patience improving.... I don't know haha.Overall this game really has me wanting to play more and more with every second I play it. SO with that being said I give it a 10/10 rating (y)			"

								This is the game i have been searching for for nearly my entire life. I like a few things in specific: Strategy, Sandbox, sci-fi, Factions, and community. I tried Eve Online, but the subscription♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I tried Minecraft, but it was too basic. I tried Starbound, but it's only 2d and doesn't have depth. THIS fits all the rules. You start as a character with essential supplies and you just need to survive. Single Player can be boring, but the multiplayer servers make this game live up to its potential. Make alliances, kill space pirates, build ships, watch them get wrecked, build better ships, wreck the ships that wrecked yours, and explore in an almost (if not) infinite universe. And about worrying about people taking your precious supplies or looting your corpse? Don't worry, When you die you keep your inventory, and in a faction you can choose one planet/space station where NOBODY can steal your stuff. Join this ever-expanding community today and learn the arts of the explorer, the empire builder, the captain, and the Warrior. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes the genres i previously stated.			"

								Starmade, to be overly reductive, is Minecraft in space.Starmade is a voxel-based space game that takes place in a procedurally generated universe.Players have complete freedom over what to build and do.PROS:1.)When I say you can build anything, I mean anything. The various block shapes allow for more diverse shapes than a fully cubic world would allow. Functional blocks also make your designs have a purpose that extends beyond the aesthetic.2.)The developers stream Tuesday and Thursdays 4-6 EST, and communicate with the community heavily. The fact that you can play the game for free is testament to the fact that the dev team actually values creating a great game (not to mention how long its been in alpha!).3.)There are a whole host of multiplayer servers, and customizing the servers to suit a group's playstyle is easy. Sector length, mining yield, what ships pirates use, and so on are all completely customizable in server configs. 4.)Being able to actually build functional ships brings a sense of purpose to any construction project. Your ship isn't just a centerpiece, it's a colossal avatar of destruction/stealthy perma-cloaked spy/kingpin of the mining industry. Each block has its own contribution to the whole.CONS:1.) When playing multiplayer, lag and latency are issues, particularly for people with lower-end CPUs. Large collisions, overlapping spawns, or interacting with planets really at all will lag servers enormously. However, the devs do work to solve performance issues, just recently releasing a patch that nearly eliminated online lag with large amounts of missiles on screen.2.) Any story is self-made. To the credit of the devs, space is a busy place, with various factions fighting it out and trading with the player. It's unfortunate that interactions with factions does not go beyond that. Randomly generated quests, or even some preset ones in combination with some simple lore would do a great deal to flesh out the single-player experience. However, this game/genre isn't really supposed to have an engaging story-line. Those looking to be immersed in a single-player story should look elsewhere.3.) Arguably, there are some balancing issues (no reason to use pulse weapons; what is a warhead). However, the game is still in alpha and the devs do change the balance in the game frequently in order to find the right mix. 4.) Though the complex nature of the building system keeps the game interesting and adds an element of skill through optimization of ships, the lack of any real, advanced guides in game hold back new players from learning much. Also, due to the rapidly changing nature of the game, youtube tutorials often can be quickly outdated (docked power, weapon rebalancing, how shields and turrets work).If you are a fan of creative construction, then the pros clearly outweigh the cons. For those looking to recreate their favorite ships, fly them around the galaxy, and terrorize pirates, this is your game. The Mulitplayer community is mostly friendly, or at least active and passionate about the game, and playing online in a faction is a lot of fun. Once this game is fully balanced, optimized, and released, I completely expect it to be a wonderful experience online. For now, I would rate Starmade a 7/10. It has all the right tools to be a paragon of the creative genre, but is held back by low popularity and performance issues. Once more people can and are playing Starmade, I would rate it 9/10 for people who enjoy these types of games. Definitely a great game, and I encourage anyone who can to contribute to its development process. Those who simply want to try it out always have the option of playing the entirety of the game for FREE as well.			"

								This is to address the people having performance issues. I'm running on an older i7 2600, with 8gb of ram. I have no FPS or lag problems whatsoever, unless some asshat in a 2km ship is trying to breed with a planet.First, make sure you know your computer specs, I recommend having at least:6gb of system memoryi5 3450. GTX550 or equivilant	If you use intel graphics, dont. Save yourself the pain.1: 1 GB of ram allocated is NOT enough for this game, get 64bit java and increase it immediately in the launcher (options > memory settings) - I use 6gb normally, but you should be okay allocating 3-4.2: Disable shadows to greatly increase your FPS, it is highly inefficient currently, and unless you mod the game, the draw distance sucks.3: There are lots of options available, only mess with the ones you know, if you want to find out what something does, go here https://starmadedock.net/chat/ log in and ask the community - we're mostly helpful.4: If the tutorial hates you, and you can't complete it, again go to the above link and ask the community! We will be happy to help.As for the game itself, it's incredible fun, if you like building ships, the largest ship you can build without rendering going wonky is about 4072m long/high/wide, with the core being placed in the center.

								Oh starmade... This game is quite addicting.So looking at this you might think, hmm a minecraft clone, but in space... But that's not fair to Starmade. About the only similarities with Minecraft are that it is block based, Java and is focused on building.Starmade is all about building. Building factory setups, building ships, making stuff bigger and better. It has a lot of tools to help you do this with symmetry planes, a slider to select a number of blocks to place at once, advanced filtered block removal/replacing and so on.A big part of Starmade is putting systems together. Whether the be their excellent logic system, the power system, or weapon systems. They are all quite interesting and give a lot of different interactions.My only real complaint with the game is that it is rough around the edges. There is a lot of depth of building and blocks and system interactions, but the NPC system is practically non-existent. There is little reason to explore and the Pirate ships are incredibly outdated with many models that simply don't work.However, these are EA complaints. I expect it to be a bit rough. They've made great strides in the last year and I'm hoping this next development leg starts to fill out the content gap. "

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥At first it's a little confusing to understand and a bit challenging to get started. Who doesn't like a good challenge though? But after using a few of the community guides and experimenting with things it ends up being an amazing game. This is basically a space sim. You build a small ship. Then build a bigger ship. then maybe build a space station for all your ships. Definitley better with friends, but is fun in singleplayer as well.Of course this is still in alpha and it does have tons of bugs and crashes sometimes. I'm looking forward to watching this game grow and seeing the final project.If you get fustrated easily with bugs and things like that don't buy this game. Yet. Wait until it's finished or something. Still a great game so far. There's already so much♥♥♥♥♥♥to do.			"

								OOOOOOH BOY! Are you looking for a simplified Space Engineers, that can get increasingly more complicated as it goes?Are you looking to take your minecraft game to the NEXT LEVEL!?Are you ready to make your own ship, and fly it around the cosmos with your buddies?WHAT ABOUT A VOXEL VERSION OF STARTREK?! BOY DO I HAVE THE GAME FOR YOU STARMADEThis game is FUNIt's ENGAGINGIt's MINECRAFT IN SPACESeriously, I don't know what you jokers are even doing still reading this. BUY THIS. It's complete, and getting new patches on the REG. I mean.. It's got custom star ships, player made events, jump point, hyper drive, HUGE TURRETS. I don't know what else you need. JUST IN CASE THAT DOESNT QUENCH YOUR EVERLASTING THIRST FOR A DAMN GOOD GAME.It's got PLANETS, You can LAND on them (just don't take your damn mothership thats bigger than the planet (YES THATS POSSIBLE) down to the surface, you dufus)You can MINE materials with your own mining ship, using lasers. LASERS.All of this in your own custom built ship, or your custom built station, OR YOUR OWN CUSTOM BUILT DEATH STAR.Fight for territory online, blow those dudes away from the safety of your ship, watch as they cry for their God as your burning their homes. You monster.In all seriousness, the ONLY things this game doesn't have going for it is:The planets aren't as big as you're thinking. They aren't minecraft worlds, they're just rather large asteroids (WHICH I HEAR YOU CAN CHANGE, IDK)You have to wait a whole week before the ladies start macking on you for having StarMade (News travels a lot slower in space)Seriously. If you like minecraft. if you like space engineers. If you like space as much as I do. Buy this.I can't reccomend it enough.			"

								If Space Engineers and the X series had a baby that was raised by Minecraft, StarMade would be the name. Pretty hard to learn how the game works (YouTube tutorials pretty much neccessary), but once you master it's systems you will be building your Planet Persecutors and Asteroid Annihilators and Star 'Sploders and Fleet Fiolators (yes, I like to take liberties with the english language when it comes to terrible puns). Just play the demo and see for yourself.Recommended: Do black holes suck at making time go slower for you (or the other way around, I am not sure)?			"

								This is a great game and unlike some of the nay sayers, I've put in the time to be able to give an educated review. If I were to give you description of what the multiplayer side of this game is, I would have to say it's shapping up to be a cross between Mincraft and EVE. So far the game is Minecraft in space with a touch of EVE, but with the direction they are going it will end up like I stated. As for single player, it's completly Minecraft in space. The things you can build in this game are only limited by how far you're willing to go! You can build simple stuff or go bat sh*t crazy and build a fully 1:1 working space station. If you want the ship to rise from the ground out of a hidden hanger, you can build it. Like I said, the game wont limit you as to what you can build.I highly recomend this game! If you like Mincraft and space games Starmade is all that and more and keep in mind this is still in alpha, so much more is comming!			"

								The developers are awesome. They don't even seem to care about the money, I have noticed they care about their game, and community. A comparison to space engineers, as it is similar in many ways:Pros of this game:- This game has less physics and graphics to be rendered, therefore it is better for people who have a low-end computer. I get around 500 fps on this game, right in a new world, space engineers only around 50-60- As the point above, it also goes well for being able to handle many players and big ships on a server without issue.Pros of Space engineers compared to this game- SE has more modding support, with many mods that add new decoration and weapons.- Better physics, with voxel damage. even though this is a big factor in lag.Both games- Both have practically infinite worlds, at least ones we'll never need any bigger of.- Both can be really good for custom ship space battles.

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  StarMade v.0194  Overview'Starmade is a new take-on to the genre of Space exploration and building. I love both of those things, I believe that many people can agree with me too. It has many, many, many different items for buildings well, basically anything you want. A Battleship/Starship Destroyer? Why not. A space-station? Sure. Basically a ship which is OP (loads of energy storage, very fast regeneration of energy, tons of shields and shield regen ect)? Go ahead. This game is saying ""go ahead, build anything, even the most complicated, most awesome looking ship, with a station on a planet, which is icy and next to a giant handmade tree"" and does it very well with its limitations (you can make a lot of things, when I say a lot, I mean more than [insert large number here]. GraphicsThe graphics are very impressive, especially for Early access. There's lens flares, realistic lighting, tons of graphical settings (such a very high FoV of 30-110!) There are resolutions higher than 1920x1090, which I have not seen a lot of in games. The maxinum View distance is very amazing, even on the '10000'  of '20000' setting, I can see way further than I would even need too. I have a load of fps even on the higher settings, which I would not have of though since the game is this beautiful. Heck, you can even choose between pixely or realistic looks! So tihs is highly rated for this catergory, and it's well earned. What StarMade has to offer Explore, build, trade with others, buy from others, colonize planets, make factions, play with others, command a fleet, become a god, create a money factory, mine asteroids, blow up planets, and so much more. Pros and Cons Pros:Advanced in graphicsExcellent use of engine featuresSo many possibilitesTons of optionsMultiplayerCheap enoughCons:Mirror mode options are confusing Recommendation? Well, I guess it's a hard game to get the grips of, but it's for most age groups. Starmade is educational and actually very  fun. It helps teaching about space, basic star-ship building and much, much more. This is a mini Space Engineers if you will. It's a quickly developing game that has yet to see its true light of day in the Steam Store since it's one of the most hidden gems on the Store. Maybe it's due to lack of sales for Starmade, or because the developers don't want to make a game with little-to-no bugs in itself available to the whole of Steam. Anyway, Space Engineers is a very similar game with just a bit more depth. Both games are great and I will soon review SE. Final Rating A clean 8.5/10 - Worth for everyone  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my reviews about games like this possible.   "

								I've been playing Starmade for about two* years now, on and off. It started out as this small block-based building game with a few unrefined ideas, and has since grown into something much better.The Devs are very active and work with the community. They take lots of community input, and even have representatives from the community to help them understand what the community wants. Starmade is continuously being updated, and appears that it is just going to get better from here on out.The game revolves around building ships and flying around in them, and the tools that the developers have given us are fairly simple, but have plenty of depth.Systems for ship building have been largely implemented, and work beautifully together, from the docking system to the armor system, the logic system to the weapon system. A single block might give a defensive or offensive bonus, and what is in the game now is plenty to offer many possibilities not just for exterior design, but for function as well.There are systems to build a faction, and to build and command fleets around the galaxy. Pirates spawn throughout the galaxy to fight, and while NPCs are not quite in the game yet, the devs are working furiously to implement them in finer detail.Bugs do arise here and there, as it is early access, but for the most part they're being ironed out as soon as they appear.Overall, Starmade is a solid block-based building game (set in space), with an active staff, and an exciting future.

								I would like to start right off by saying I highly recommend this game.The main reason I recommend this game is the devs. The devs seem to be interested with what the community wants and they keep you up to date on what they are working on. Devs like this are what make Early Access games worth it.Another reason is the community. I yet to find one person that is a complete jerk. Also, people seem to make some amazing creations. I find it so entertaining when you finish building a ship that you think is so brilliant and you decide to join a server to show it off to find out someone has made a ship 50x stronger. It's just great to see all of the different ships.These two reasons are what make me love this game better than any game in my Library. But, there are of course problems with it.The biggest problem is the amount of players in servers. A game like this with trillions of galaxies should definately have at least 100 players a server. The problem is you're lucky to see 10 players at a time on a server. This could of course easily be fixed by people getting the game, which I really hope happens.The idea of this game getting popular makes me overjoyed. I would love to see big faction wars between 2 major factions and a bunch of miniature allied factions assisting them. Also, a few huge mother ships sending out a bunch of fighter jets, which can actually happen. This stuff is implemented into the game, the problem is there is no people to join those factions.I would love to see this game get players. It has outstanding potential as long as these devs are able to keep working on it. But, that won't happen if the game gets thrown aside and in my eyes, that would be a tragedy.			"

								I was really excited when this came out, and still am in some way. Finally a game where you can control your own designed ship from inside, walking through them, ""living"" in them like you would in a static base in other survivals.In theory there is nothing stopping you from building huge ships with fully decorated interiors, there simply is no point to it from a gameplay perspective. In fact, there is no gameplay really.Update after update they add things like prettier lighting, new logic blocks, new functionality blocks but they still to this day didnt bother about fundamental things that actually make the game a game.Ship interiors are pretty much useless since you can control all systems from the ""core"" block. Placement of thrusters or even weapons can be pretty much random since own projectiles can pass through your ship so you can effectively place them inside. Center of mass and center of thrust can be disregarded alltogether. In the end you see a lot of cubes flying around that consist of randomly mashed together system blocks since there seems to be no real benefit from carefully planning a nice looking ship design. Sound, as you may think of as a given, does not really work. Homebases and everything docked to them are invulnerable and since there is not much need for more than your homebase, you cant even raid other people. Basically all the game offers right now is mining blocks to build a bigger miner to then mine more blocks.It may be early access and the devs surely were not sleeping but I have to say they are investing their time and effort into the wrong direction. Until that changes we are stuck with a voxel ship designer tool ( thats right, not a game ). The fact that most MP servers are empty - if you can find a populated one with good ping in the first place that is - suggests that I am not the only one who finds the current state of the game disappointing.I really want to like it and wish them well but right now, nuh uh. Cant recommend it.			"

								Ever seen this really cool spaceship in a movie or another video game and said, ""I wish I could fly that""?Ever wanted to cruise the stars in a gigantic space whale?Get on board my miniature B2 bomber, bro.  In. Space.  Starmade lets you do all this.  It lets you do anything.  The limit is up to your computer's processing power, your imagination, and (as always) patience.  It's a survival game, inside a sandbox, wrapped inside a space shooter, topped with jump drives and Stargates.  I've been playing this game for a year now, off and on, but it always, ALWAYS pulls me back for more.  Now that the updates are flying thick and fast, I'm confident you'll be entertained and enthralled just like the rest of us sci-fi junkies.Don't be intimidated by the initial learning curve.  Head to StarmadeDock.net, hit the forums, look into the Community Content section.  The game is way more fun with other players, even when building in single-player.Think Space Engineers is better?Does Space Engineers have a 700 meter Executor-class Super Star Destroyer? What about all those 1000m cap ships that I see flying around on some of Starmade's MP servers?  Starmade trades the realism and feel of Space Engineers for more and bigger ships.  It's a trade that puts it light-years beyond SE, in my opinion.Did I mention we have Stargates?--Ender			"

This, having been described as minecraft in space, absolutely blew me away. Small ships are ugly blocky things, but anything worth using is absolutely gorgeously rendered, the online play is dangerous and fulfilling and content is constantly and easily added to the game by other players; create a space station or ship, upload it and other players can use them in their game! One of the most addictive, replayable games I've come across in years.... and it's not even finished.			"

								Rather than see this as a game. I tend to see this more as a brush and canvas, a tool to craft. While the whole survival experience is nice and all. The part about this game that shines is its building. I love constucting stations and ships, pouring effort into getting them just right and getting something awesome out of it. The logic and rail updates only adds more to this, being able to add a bit of life to them.The main problem I feel, however is just how lonely it feels in survival. NPCs should definately be added later on. And the game feels empty. Like there isn't much to it besides what you make. Overall, I definately recommend this game to those with the talent and paitence to build the extraordinary.			"

This is NOT minecraft PLUS space. This is minecraft IN space. Don't expect the typical tools you would find in minecraft. The whole idea for this game is to build spaceships and live in space. Currently living on the ground is quite rudamentary. I'm pretty sure that there are plans to improve the ground aspect, but at the time of this review these features are quite non existent.Yes there are warp gatesYes there are space stationsYes there are warp drivesYes you can have multiple people command one shipThis game is really fanstastic.

								I've played this game when it was for around 3 dollars. Now its on the Steam, damn a lot of progress has been made and I'm glad I supported this game for so long.If you look for a singleplayer experience with a rich story you will be dissapointed becouse there is no story, you need to shape the story by yourself ( aka roleplaying ). Especially with a friends its a lot of fun but real funs begins on the servers ,here is when this game shines *for now*. You can attend in the amazing community events and space battles.I'm not sure what else to write about this game. Yeah its a early acess game but you can feel safe becouse Schema (developer ) is a really cool guy. You won't get your money *stolen*.For me best part of this game is a ship building , you can build a small jet or colossal capital ship or a ship carrier. You can build space stations too and even colonize planets for yourself or your faction or if you like you can planet-crack them for a valuable resources if harvesting asteroids is not enough for you.If you preffer PvP its not a problem, this game has a really extended weapon system. Combat system might be a little bit unbalaced but hey its still beta testing.Thats all, worth a buy if you like to socialize or roleplay with the people. Or like me you like to build stuff.Engange~			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, after playing this for 116 hours I thought I'd share my view of this game. So first, yes I know this is an early access title, but the tutorial kinda' sucks to me. I was still clueless on what to do afterwards, but perhaps maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, idk. The game feels a bit empty with nothing to do, but I wasn't expecting much considering it's an early access title. The reason I've been playing so long was simply out of sheer excitement to keep building onto my ship, and even try to make a little mech or something haha (it's extremely time consuming). It's strangely addicting. It's a sandbox space sim where you start off with nothing but a few things in your inventory. You have a ship core, you hit the X key to create a new ship, name it, and then you build onto it with parts, etc. To make stuff you need to mine of course, so you go out in space and find asteroids or planets and mine them. After you mine and get resources, you need to make factories in order to make stuff with what you mined. Pretty simple, like most crafting games. You can build ships, bases, create factions, you can claim solar systems and make them your faction territory, you can go and fight pirates and destroy their bases. But thats really all there is to it (or at least from what I've seen). With that being said, I think this game was aimed more at multiplayer. It's not a bad game, just wish it didn't take me 100 years to figure out what to do when I first started playing. And also, the pirate stations seem to be there to troll you, as you cannot mine them after you take them out, instead you have to pay an exorbitant amount of money to repair them (15mil), which is really silly to me and kinda defeats the purpose. Idk why the devs did that. Without the help of guides and YouTube videos, i'd be lost and wouldn't have played as long as I did. I do recommend this though, I can't sit here and act like it wasn't fun. Just understand that it's early access, it has bugs, and still needs a lot of work.			"

								Finally this amazing game has made it to Steam!This game is amazing to play with some friends and not only create fleets of handbuilt ships (that you create block by block, system by system) but planetary headquaters, massive space stations, and deep space mining platforms.There are plenty of ways to play this game, with the amount of freedom given to the players. Massive PvP battles, solo merchant trade route stuff, pirate hunter, miner, ship builder, etc. Hell, even just exploring the massive galaxy is fun. It's full of planets, asteroids, and other neat things like pirate bases and space stations.I've been playing Starmade for a very long time and the developer never ceases to amaze me. He practically single handedly has created the best space sandbox to date and continually improves it more and more. I've never seen any game receive as much love as this one.As long as you're not turned off by the voxel based engine there is just so much to love here. Even it's weakest elements are usually better fleshed out than comparable games. Just give it a try and if you like it support this awesome developers!			"

However in StarMade things never get boring you can attack pirate stations and they will attack you back want to live on a planet you can! Find the pirates boring? Well make them a Ship to use and they will but be warned sometimes you can forget to save your Super star destroyer to your own blueprints and end up fighting your own ship design.I've made that mistake once or twice or a few more times...........

								Adore this game. Despite all its flaws, there's something about this game that keeps me playing. The ability to build ships and stations in all shapes and sizes with advanced building mechanics, and the ability to put them to good use on and off the battlefield is the icing on the cake, whether it's singleplayer or multiplayer. There's a seemingly infinite universe to explore, no loading screens to hinder me and there's plenty of updates on the way that will make this game feel more alive than it already is, which is quite alive.From icy worlds to the depths of intergalactic space, I could do anything. Be anything. God forbid anyone mentioning Minecraft after playing this, because this is so much better. Unstable, broken, but better in every regard.While only fifteen quid, this game delivers more than it is worth. I'm glad I paid every penny for this game, and I am willing to pay more just to see it flourish.			"

								I have a Dell XPS Laptop which has two video processors, one is the onboard Intel video that it uses when it is on battery power (low power) and the other is an nVidia GT540M (for full AC adapter power). I have configured StarMade (and Java) to run on the nVidia card (just like I do with all my other games including Minecraft) using the nVidia Control Panel. The nVidia card has the latest drivers. I also have the latest version of Java 8.25 64 bit. OS is Windows 7. To be perfectly honest I never use the Intel onboard video unless I am using MS Office or something simple like that because it is just plain aweful with 3d games. Nonetheless, my onboard Intel video has the latest driver available from Dell for my specific laptop.The game does not cooperate with my nVidia control panel, and so the only way I could get it to run was to make my nVidia card as primary video on my laptop always, thus by-passing the nVidia Optimus controls.Changing review to ""Tentatively Recommend""			"

								Yeah ignore the hours, long time user here. I have been keeping track of starmade for some time now. Originally I looked at it as another minecraft rip off (given the time it came out, you can't blame me). But then I realised it was something special. Building immense ships that can cross the galaxy, fight pirates, build factions, colonise planets and lets face it, after I built a borg cube i was sold. But what had me moving onto steam was the fact that this game was still developing. Even now it could sell as a full game but they want to continue developing it and I am thrilled. BUY THIS GAME.So much potential now with the logic system, and if it keeps up that way who knows how far this will go. PS don't compare to space engineers, believe it or not, they are totally different games. 10/10			"

								Nice in depth game with a lot of content to experience in the form of the infinite procedurally generated planets, stations, stars, black holes, and whole galaxies. Combat isn't fun or easy (at least it's not my cup of tea) but can be avoided if you want by keeping your distance from enemies (mainly pirates but on multiplayer there can be faction wars). Not a game I play a whole lot because moneymaking (aka mining) is pretty uninteresting. But building cool ships using the money you made from mining makes it way worth it (if you like that- again this is my opinion).			"

								As I am the Trashman I do enjoy myself some trash, but I am so very dissapointed, it is a wonderful game with very solid mechanics and although that the game has its moments, e.g. lag around planets, asteroids in multiplayer becoming the gods of the realm and a few other things that aren't notable.One issue I have found myself is that when a construct is damaged, it will never be repairable unless you go ahead and do it yourself, now as an avid fan of From The Depths and how it plays, I really see how starmade could benefit from this, even if it requires you to have a shipyard to repair it from, it would become alot more enjoyable and easier to manage large fleets.If you are looking to play this game and you enjoy the ""Build your own destiny"" kind of things, this will be the game for you, and if you have played EVE online you will find that it is quite similar, set galaxy sizes, your own shops and limited rescoures, warp gates and exploration. Now this may not seem EVE like but when you get to playing it and getting closer to the end game, you will find yourself managing larger and larger scale things, fleets, planets and even wars against others.I have played this for years now and have seen it go through many changes, and it just keeps getting better, and good luck Schema with the development!

								""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is huge!"" ~You when you first play this game I Really wanted to say this is a space-y Minecraft Clone, but I really think that would be an insult to this game, while this game does borrow the look and feel of Minecraft, that's about where the simalarities end, Star Made is a First-person blockish Sandbox game IN SPACE, and being a giant space nerd, I was pretty damn amazed by the sheer size of this little game, the in game universe is as big as the actual universe, which is pretty impressive if you ask me, so as soon as you start up the game you'll spawn floating in space in front of a giant space station/shop, how you don't explode as soon as you spawn is beyond me (the vacum of space does some pretty nasty things to the human body) so given no real direction as to what to do and how to play, you have one of two options, Play the Tutorial, or go find a bunch of videos on youtube, the latter probably being the more helpful of the two, as there are some things that the tutorial doesn't quite explain, (like optimizing your power supply) but what can you expect for an early access game?

I later when I could get the steam version for free, because I had bought it in pre-release, I saw that it had a lot more content than in the past. The community is great, and there are a lot of people who do ""Let's Play Videos"", if your into that sort of thing.Renember that this is an Early Access Game so it will be a bit buggy, but it has been less buggy than the past when it wasn't on steam.I hope you enjoy!!! :D			"

								Holy sh*t 29 hours already? I swear I just got this...I've been following Starmade since early early times and have much more playtime from a previous version (before steam) and then life happened and I stopped playing it for awhile.The more ""recent"" updates wrecked most of my previous knowledge of this game and I had to start learning anew, thank goodness this game is really great so I don't mind at all. Yes, this game is early access so alot of what you see is going to change and is changing with every update. BUT.. the devs are like the coolest people ever. Why? Well, they don't believe you should be paying for an early access game while bugs are still being worked out and the whole game itself is changing. They realize this is an unfinished product and being so have put the game up for $11, ONLY if you want to support them and what they're doing. This is totally optional because they've put the exact version as a demo for free so you can play it first and see if they are worth supporting. ~I do support the devs and what they are doing so I did buy it. Even though it is early access its great~+ Multiplayer Servers+ Paid players and demo players CAN play together on MP servers+ ALOT of content, like I can't even start to say how complex this game can get...+ I think I'm addicted to it... I put 5 hours on it last night alone...+ The devs are realistic people, not trying to steal your organs for an unfinished game.+ If you hate people you can single player this bad boy and even admin command yourself to creative play!-/+ Alot is changing and going to change, what you see now will probably not be the same(similiar in the next update) therefore your knowledge and playtime can become obsolete, but hey! More content ^_^-/+ Making money only takes forever until you can spend a few million to build a proper salvager. On the other hand this is stopping new players from building capital ships in an hour. Pretty balanced (sort of) economy- Pirates are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- Trading Guild sucks at restocking shops- I think I'm addicted to it...I think thats it, at least for this current update. I know this game is going to change alot in future updates so I will try and redo this when it happens and I get some more playtime out of that!9/10 (Currently 2/17/15).			"

Early Access Review
								So, personally, i like this game, and i defenitly recomend it, but i am growing increasingly frustrated with the numerous problems to getting enjoyment out of the game. The problems that stuck out to me the most are- Setting *no enemys spawn* does not prevent enemies from spawning. Pirates will spawn no matter WHAT this setting is. This removes some of the fun from building stations, diging out a base in an asteroid and mining as you get no warning before you are attacked, and by time you can respond, you are already dead. which wouldnt be as much of a problem if the next problem wasnt there - There is no tool to restore your ship *completely*. You can go to a shop and pay for a repair, but this doesnt replace blocks you already lost. You should be able to point the repair shop at your ship, and the shop *should* detect what blocks were there before you entered combat. - Lack of AI factions: Currently there is only Traders (who you only see in shops and very rarely see their ships) and pirates (who ROFL stomp you before you have time to create a decent vessel or get your base established.) It would be nice if there was a police faction, and maybe two default AI factions that interact with the traders, the pirates, and each other. The universe seems dead otherwise. if you like multiplayer, this isnt as much of a problem, but if you want to try things out in single player you will get wiped out before you can get a decent footing. The enemys SHOULD be dangerous, but they shouldnt swarm you with 5 ships at once when you have the star ship equivelent of a dinghy.- sometimes removing blocks while on EVA is glitchy and you will remove blocks behind or under your charicter.However, the vastness of the universe is awsome and its invigorating to be able to construct a base wherever the hell you want. this game has a ton of potential and needs more features, In its current state its a mediocre time waster, but there is massive potential.

Anyone can play this game. It takes a lot of time to get good. There are always new ways to create something.You can create so many things in this game. Spaceships, Space Stations, Planets, Shipyards, Warp Gates, and more. That is without counting logic. The logic system in this game is second to none. If you can think of a way of using logic gates to create something you can make it in this game.I have seen people make entire logic systems to store Spaceships, that may not sound like a lot in reality that takes incredible skill and intelligence.If you like this kind of game you will never be bored.

								I cannot recommend this game highly enough.With the obvious provisio that it is not for everyone, much as with any such sandbox or sci fi offering; I can reliably state that Starmade is fast moving to be the premier creative space experience. Do not let poor imitations ensnare you with false promise.There is so much to be found within the expansive community here : There are awesome builds, Roleplay, Politics and a game that is marching inexorably toward greatness. The graphics may seem simplistic compared to some other competitors, but that simply means that the canvas of your own creativity and scope can be all the more immense ; and it's still being developed with promises of more optional fidelity.Starmade has been a large part of my life for near on four years now, and my enjoyment has not diminished, only grown.

								Saw a wormhole across multiple sectors thinking it was a space stationWent on an expedition with a friend to ""Space Station""Got too close, realizing it was pulling us Tried to get out and add thrusters for escaping my doomBody gets sucked inFriend and I die to the voids of space10/10 Would wormhole again Real Talk Though But really, Starmade is something else. I went in believing it would be some kind of Minecraft clone or waste of 10$, I almost even wanted a refund at first. Yes it IS IN ALPHA, it IS UNFINISHED but god damn, 6 hours in and there's just... So much content already.This current version of Alpha is not worth 10$, it's worth 25$ at the  least  so much to do from making buildings and factories on planets to colonizing them or stripping them bare for resources. Pirates and robbers keep it new and the game continues to amaze me. For once I can make a ship, simply put down a gravity generator and have my friend walk around and do maintenance/man the guns/repair or stargaze as I fly around. He doesn't fall out and it's not laggy. You play Space Engineers and hope for smooth riding in your friends ship as he flies but in Starmade  you can do just that  Beautiful game, amazing graphics whether you want them simple or HD and all around something I will be playing for quite awhile Gameplay 8/10  It is still in Alpha but a lot is already on the table, I could see space fights becoming more engaging other than that basic mechanics on and off planets is great. Sound 6.7/10  Not any background music yet, it leaves a lot of atmosphere out but setting up a simple Chillstep playlist on YouTube makes it fantastic as you play. Graphics 20/10 ] If you don't like voxel based games, then you would obviously dislike the graphics here. If you  do  like blocks and cubes and such, you should love it. I play on high settings with ultra shadows and the realistic texture pack. On top of that my favorite feature is the procedural background image of the galaxy on the 4k resolution. Absolutely stunning. I can't express how amazing it is to be on a planet and seeing both sunset and the galaxy mesh together in one. Creative Level and Difficulty  This game does have a learning curve to get ahead of. At first you have no idea what the hell you are doing, it's very discouraging and hard to get through but once you have the basics, the rest will eventually catch up. The logic system (similar to Minecraft's redstone system) is very simple as with the ship building in general. You don't have to wire every bit and piece together, all you have to do is select what mother block you want your other blocks to be connected to and place them. Easy peasy. Once you get past the beginner phase a universe of oppurtunity arises at your feet.[h2] Overall in its Current State 8/10 [/h2] It's in Alpha. So much done right in such a little time span and release version. This game has the potential to uplift the ""Minecraft Genre"" and be a real successor in its own dominant space setting. 100% worth your 10$ if you enjoy space crafting, exploration, blocks and planet colonization. It's a really good game.Just get it.			"

								Amazing sandbox game that lets you build the spaceship of your dreams. You can play the game as a astronaut in a nearly endless universe, salvage asteroids, ships, stations and planets and use the resources you get to make blocks with factories (kinda like crafting in minecraft but more automatic once you have everything set up correctly). You can either use these blocks to build ships or sell them to others for credits or other blocks through your personal store that you can put on your base. Or play in a creative mode where you use admin commands to get the blocks needed and make the most amazing ships.Its worth getting because:1. You don't need the greatest pc to play it.2. With enough skill you can make any ship you want. (check out other people's work and you will know what I mean)3. There are lots of modules that you can put on your ship. Making it possible to make almost any kind of ship you want with multiple functions.4. The game has almost everything you need for a space sandbox. (FTL!!!)5. A nearly infinite universe, so there is always room to build more and expand your faction territory!***Updated***6. Logic and rails: Make doors and entire compartments of your ship move and change with the press of a single button. (It might seem complicated at first but personally way easier to understand compared to redstone in minecraft which isn't too hard either)7. The game already has mod support and many content creator already made tons of texture packs and small mods to change the look and feel of the game.8 (Not implemented but will be out in the next update) AI factions are coming which will finally bring some more life in the universe of StarMade. Check out the StarMade youtube channel for a bigger explenation of all the upcoming features.All this is already available in the Alpha version of the game.With that said a fair warning to all who want to play:THIS GAME IS IN AN ALPHA STATE. Expect things to not works correctly and servers to crash often when playing multiplayer. Also download the demo on Steam if you are not sure about buying the game yet. The demo is currently the same as the full version but free. However the devs said the price of the game will go up the closer they get to release so you might wanna buy it now while it's still a low price.			"

								Dont let my hours played fool you - when i first got this game (2015 some time i think) i couldnt launch it from steam, so i ran it from the command line (yup, i'm on linux). i probably have > 100 hoursThis is a realy cool game.  I havent played it for some time, but i keep coming back and poking around to see whats changed.  And its always changing.Also have a look at some of the negative reviews - many of those peeps have hundreds of hours!!!  what? you played a game for 250 hours and then gave it a thumbs down? I can understand being  frustrated with a game (see my ARK review) but still seems like those peeps got some serious bang for their bucks.Anyway now for the good and bad:The Good:* unlimited potential for building the space fleet of your dreams.  If you like space and building - just buy it.* constantly being updated - devs seem to care about this one* back to building - building a giant mining ship that could vaporise an asteroid in seconds was pretty cool* THE BUILD SYSTEM.  Yes its a little hard to understand at first, but wow, you can do a lot with it.  I havent seen such a build system in any other gameThe Bad:* yeah, the build system - it takes a while to master it. but like i said above, its amazing once you know what you are doing* updates break things. Yup. dont buy EA games if you dont like this.  hell dont buy any software at all for that matter. Or operating systems, in fact just turn your computer off and go outside :PI keep firing up this game every now and then just to see whats new, When enough has changed i'll prolly drop another few hundered hours on it. Havent really got into the factions thing at all yet. I check back on this more than any of my other EA titles. Personally i think the devs made a mistake making it free. its all ready worth the price			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS Introductory Review:StarMade is a voxel-based sandbox that gives you the infinite expanses of outer space to build, craft, and venture. Yes, there’s no way around it, this is essentially Minecraft in space.It’s not long been released on Steam Early Access where you can purchase it for $9.99 on Windows, Mac, and Linux. But it has been playable in its early stages before Early Access for quite a while. It’s actually been in the making since 2010.In StarMade, you can build your own spaceship block-by-block, customizing it with weapons fit to take on space pirates – you’ll need them. Once satisfied, you can then get into your spaceship in order to explore distant stars and galaxies.You’ll come across more than pirates too, as there are abandoned space stations to pick from, and the treasures you find inside can be traded to make a fortune. Or, you can use the materials to make your own space station, or a factory, all in order to make huge quantities of sellable items for a profit.In multiplayer you’ll be able to find other factions, which you can join or fight against, and I’m sure you’ll be glad to hear that StarMade has dedicated servers.The idea behind StarMade is to provide you an infinite space to make your own way within. As in Minecraft, you do as you please, exploring the various possibilities of the game’s intricate sandbox design.Abstract:??/?? (Awaiting Full-Release)Recommended for it's current state at $9.99, there is enough content to keep you occupied for hours. I played this game before I purchased it on Steam, so I knew what I was getting into.			"

Are you someone who doesn't need their hand held? Then this game is for you.-ProsFULL GAME IS FREE IN DEMO (Until it leaves development)Devs update the game oftenDevs have a roadmapDevs are active on forumsYou're only limited by your own imaginationEndless space-ConsFeels like there is no sound. (Feels like =/= there isn't)Not enough AI interaction to keep someone busy in      single player if they aren't focused on building alone.Will eat RAM (Seriously, don't be messing around with only 2g of RAM)Conclusion: If you don't need your hand held and you can entertain yourself, buy the game. If you're not sure, get the demo. The demo is the full game.

								Starmade is usually described as ""minecraft in spaaaaace."" With each update, that gets less true... It's becoming a fully fledged 4X space exploration and empire building game... where you can build pretty much anything with blocks, minecraft style. It's amazing. It's becoming literally everything I've ever wanted in a space game, and then some. Having said that, it is still very much in development, and it's hard to say anything about the game in the certainty that it will stay that way. All I can say is, it's awesome, and with frequent updates by the developers, I feel certain that it will continue to get MORE awesome as time goes by.			"

								I have played this for a fair while now, long before it was released on steam. The now familiar sight of block-based building from minecraft and the games that followed has been augmented with use of wedges, tetras, etc. The weapons and space combat work well enough, the exploration is fun, and the mining/crafting process is quick and understandable.The one thing I will say is watch your head if you go near the official forum for the game. There's a strong community of aggressive behavior to differing perspectives if you post thought-out suggestions and you're often responded to in an unhelpful manner if you have questions they believe they're too good for. God forbid you query what happened with this council drama we're hearing about, you'll be banned from there before you can say ""spaaaaace"".			"

Early Access Review
								(written after the custom shapes update)[Intro]Firstly, before the content, many people may have seen outdated reviews and I would like to clear up some things. They have creative mode. They have slabs like in minecraft. They have teleporters. Missiles aren't the most powerful weapon in the game.This is one of my favorite games, not just because of its current state, but the timeline looks amazing. There are some bugs that appear every once and a while, but the devs are the best and always listen to what the community is saying.If none of the stuff below sounds appealing, remember that the demo is the same thing as the full version! You can even play on servers and stuff, however in the future they will limit the demo.[Description (longer)]You can do a lot in this game. It comes with lots of colors (teal and pink are somewhat new), weapons and details. And pirates to blow up.To start off, the controls take some time to get used too, and you can change them if you must. A lot of people gave this negative reviews just because of the controls, so ignore them. I prefer the default controls.In terms of building, it is the opposite of minecraft. (left click to build) They have all sorts of hull colors and decorations you can use to make your ships look realistic. With the new addition of slabs and ""custom shapes"" - which means models / 3D indented stuff - ships have gotten to look way cooler.Real quick, I also want to mention that the textures at their current state tend to look a LOT better and more polished than in outdated videos. The lighting is amazing right now too.In terms of weapons, they have a lot too. What's so special is that you can combine up to 3 weapons to make one weapon better. For example, cannons make things shoot a lot faster, but reduce the damage a little. Missile computers hooked up with beams make homing missiles. They even have modules specifically for modifying weapons like push and pull effects.In terms of factions, the player created ones work pretty well, however the devs are still working on the AI. It may take a while, however I am excited to see how they turn out based off of their posts. (https://starmadedock.net/threads/starmade-active-development-timeline.25541/)Crew really can't do anything right now, so don't expect the option to ""hire crew"" to do much. Like I said the developers have large plans and continue to update it every two weeks, so to me it sounds very promising.[Similar games]I have seen some similar games like this. First off, space engineers is aimed to be more of a survival and realistic game, FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN. (it doesn't work on my laptop or my pc :p) So I wouldn't compare it. Blockade runner seems very similar too, however I don't know much about it. The pictures online tell be that starmade is a MUCH more polished game, however starmade has been in development a lot longer to my knowledge.[Short Description (for people like me)]A block-based building game where you can build the ultimate space ship that actually functions and blast pirates & things with it. This includes hangers for drones or friends and warp drives to get around. Stations are an option too; you can process ores from planets and keep your ships safe there. Multiplayer? Team up with friends for fun or fight to the death in a battle of empires.[Conclusion]So that is really all I have to say. Don't underestimate what this game is aimed to be; just look at the dev. plans. Don't base your opinion off of old reviews, especially ones that say it just crashes. (unless you have a bad computer. Read the reccomended system first) I hope you think this is good if you buy it. Schine is really serious about its quality and brings constant updates. (if 2 every weeks is constant for you)[Last note]I haven't actually played the custom shapes update yet; just came out like an hour ago. Also, try out the demo if you aren't quite sure yet.[Rating]10/10 you can build MLG mems (memes... get it?... no... ok...)			"

Early Access Review
								First of all I would like to say... WOW!Ok this is a space Minecraft style sandbox game but for a fresh release on early access on Steam... it's amazing !THE LAYOUT:After a quick tutorial (some aspects of the game are still missing...), you start near a ""cotton bud"" looking space station.You are an astronaut and with few credits and items you are left in a huge universe.First you have few blocks to build a basic spaceship. If you are smart enough, you will be able to go anywhere and enjoy the huge number of planets, asteroids and stations you can find (nearly infinite).THE GAMEPLAY:Ship and stations designs are easy. By pressing Space after entering a Ship core, you can launch building mode.The Ship core it some kind of box where the player can enter and control the ship. It's a strange way to use vehicles but the designer is enough well made to compensate this strange design.Like in Minecraft you use blocks, you place them with left click and delete with right click (you have tons of other contols by pressing left ctrl). For every ships, you have to plan it's energy usage and mass. The bigger the more expensive it will be for you: like the cloak wich needs more energy depending of the size  of the ship. The interresting aspect of this mode is the way you use weapons and tools.Every items needs a computer to be used. You put an appropriate computer and the weapon or tool block related, and you conect them. The funny thing is that you can mix weapons and some upgrade blocks to change their effects, like EMP or Shield Drain, ect... You can even place turret docking blocks with AI blocks to create an automated sentry capable to fire anything you want from missiles to beams.For tools you have less possibilities but you can put more blocks and computers to create massive Salvage beams (some kind of mining laser) or even create you own Antenna relay to scan your sector and spot anything that moves.You can even hold personnal weapons or tools (you have a basic mining laser) but you can't upgrade it much, like for the ships.You can also place a building block on a planet or a location you own ( with a faction block), to customize it.From the plants to the soils, being able to change a planet so quickly is excellent and gives you plenty ways to create.But you can't harvest materials by this way, you have to clear a path with the editor and go mining yourself.About crafting, it's not a good aspect of the game. Because you have too much materials and it becomes quickly too complicate to build nice recipes (bad crafting menus when you use crafting stations). In fact you will spare tons of time by harvesting raw materials and selling them to the Galatic Traders. These guys are the owners of the ""space cotton buds"" They are neutral npc that sells all blocks you can imagine and they buy everything you can bring !When you got the way to gather quickly, you get quite a lot of credits (the actual currency in the game).But space is a dangerous place...Players can be hostiles, you will notice that with a nice Faction system. By yourself you can create a faction, claim locations in its name and even conquer other players properties. Before doing that you need faction points with the help of other faction members and enough fights against enemy factions. This system is really good and surprises by it's quality for an early acess game.But your not alone because some pirates are roaming...They hide in somes big space stations with heavy turrets that does quite a lot of damage.But if you can manage to enter them... you will get tons of items !Be ware pirates are fliying in fast ships and dying is quite normal when you begin.Don't forget to buy enough stuff to build few basic ships when you first spawn.And find a nice planet to land.At this moment you will have time to study the blocks, the ways you have to earn money and CONQUER THE UNIVERS !TO CONCLUDE:Starmade is a real surprise. Quite impressive and cheap (the price will change), the gameplay it offers is amazing for an early acess.Ok i have to admit the game is rough around the edges: need some balance about the trade and crafting system. The tutorial wich is empty especially in front of game mechanics such as Factions or Logics. The physic for ship flights needs to be better because it's like driving in a ""soapbox"" or the punch of weapons wich are a bit weak especially on foot. Physic on blocks would be cool, like on some planets where lava ""floats"" in the airs.But the overall quality is really good for this kind of game, the developpers are even planing to add creatures (actually there is one alien spider you can see in the tutorial). And seriously, being able to build so much crazy things with turrets, landing zones, weapons, antenna and even warp gates...it's amazing !N.B: The game is quite stable, even if i had to play it on an old computer.You can also play alone on a dedicated server and set the difficulty of the AI. Life in space has never been so easy !			"

								I played this game before the rails, logic, and weapons update and it was good. Now it's awesome. Buggy sometimes, but awesome nevertheless. Unlike most dev teams who seem to forget they were even working on a sandbox survival game, this dev team actually works on their game, works closely with the community, and has a solid roadmap for their vision of the game going into the future. Think From The Depths meets No Man's Sky set in Minecraft in space.The demo is still free, so go download it and build an awesome base, mine some asteroids (or planets), and conquer your chunk of the universe! The learning curve isn't even as steep as Minecraft, really.			"

Early Access Review
								This is sadly unplayable until they fix AI ship spawning (oh god especially the trader ships). I WOULD recommend this game, as I’ve been playing it since it first came out (before steam), but the frustration of constantly being rammed into by trader ships, which spontaneously acquire some sad case of severely impulsive autism when flying towards a shop, followed by the insane lag caused when they kamikaze into the trader posts (which probably contributes to their lack of any brain cells) makes this game heartbreakingly difficult to play. Not to mention, when they start overheating from the damage, the player can easily just strip parts from the unconscious ship, leaving an infinite supply of free stuff. But that aside, it's unbelievably frustrating to build a starter ship because in order to build anything without getting caught in the trader ships’ suicide missions, I have to entirely leave the shop sector. And if I run out of supplies, I have to fly all the way back to the shop, which is quite risky considering the obvious. But wait, there’s more! I don’t NEED to buy anything because I can probably just steal what I need from those mangled trader ships! See the problem? I realize that I can simply turn off collision damage, but that won’t stop the knockback effect. So if I’m out of my ship and it gets hit, it’s GOING to disappear forever. I also realize that I could turn inertia back on, but that would make flying long distances very frustrating because I would either have to 1, hold down the forward button for at least half an hour, or 2, sit here charging warp drives until I’m 99 and hooked up to an IV. I would much prefer to set the engines to max and let inertia take care of the rest while I leave to go get some work done for a couple hours.It seems to me that they rushed this update out the door way to quickly. If you're going to release a major update, at least take the time to stabilize it first. Making a game unplayable, even if only for a short while, is only going to deter incoming customers and upset those that already own the game. Rushing things out the door is literally what EA does.But other than that, excellent game! I will change my vote once this problem has been dealt with.Oh and also, I’m autistic myself. So don't think I'm attacking the disabled, 'cause I'm not. :P			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, I'll be straightforward: I almost gave this game up within 5 minutes. My first impression was horrible. But I'm glad I persevered.As for the long text review: there's a summary in the end.Also if you don't like text and prefer a video over text, have a glance at how powerful the game is and just how much cool stuff and creativity you can have with it in this example. IntroI got it as part of a bundle some time ago and decided to give it a try. The launcher was not the best experience. When I finally got in-game, the tutorial was broken. As if this was not annoying enough, without a tutorial I was *completely* lost and had no idea what to do. Oh, and the sound was bugged. It took me quite a while to find how to fix it. Then the performance was horrible and again it took me a while to find how to fix it (increase allocated memory, get Java 64x). So I ditched Starmade and was glad I did.By the way: The tutorial was quickly fixed, and a new launcher is underway. This sums up quite nicely one of the positives of this game: The devs. They're active, they're quick, they're good. But most of all, they are just part of the community. I started watching a few tutorial videos and whatnot on youtube and only after I had watched quite a few I realized at least two of the youtubers were actually devs. They're so helpful and chill it's unbelievable.After watching online some of the stuff people were doing with the game and how so many love it I decided to give it another go -- now with the knowledge of where to find solutions to the problems I'd certainly encounter: Youtube, and to some extent the forums. Oh and I'm so glad I didn't give up. MainThen onto something that might be a pro or a con, depending what you're looking for: This game is whatever you make of it. So if you're looking to hop into space and find everything done and ready... keep looking. Here you start with pretty much nothing, in the middle of the vast space and next to a shop. Go from there, good luck. It's up to you what you want to build or do. Where you want to go. With whom you want to ally and play. And so on. The big pro is that the limit is just your creativity. The possibilities are vast. If you like being creative, inventive, ingenious, and if you like to build not only your own game but a whole universe (ok, a whole ""stronghold"" in universe) -- then this is for you.The cons stay pretty much on the realm of the interface. The interface can be pretty powerful but many many aspects are really non-intuitive. Also the launcher is really barebones (thankfully a new one coming). The tutorial is also quite lackluster, so there's no other way: To learn tricks and all the power the interface has you have to dedicate some time to watch tutorials and whatnot. Thankfully there's plenty of good ones so no excuses there.Bugs exist, as well as some balance issues and whatnot. But it's a game in alpha so they are quite ok. And I know nowadays it's a bit old to put a half-arsed game out there and call it alpha as an excuse to have produced a crap game. But this is not the case with these guys: They're hard at work, and updates and content are being churned out quickly. All that with lots of transparency and community input. Just a couple of days ago I was in a Q&A session with them (and I'm a nobody!) that lasted some 3 hours, in which the replied to a ton of questions and played/had fun with the community. Thumbs up! So to sum it upPros:   Vast, both in terms of ""map size"" (pretty much infinite) and in terms of possibility;  Be creative, build your own world, your own ships, and do it your own way;  Very active, supportive, friendly and helpful devs;  An active community with lots of tutorials, general help, and content to download (like ships, stations, skins, etc.).Cons (bit hard to think of that many but I'll try so don't blame me for being a bit unfair):   Interface is powerful but somewhat bareboned and rather un-intuitive at times;  That includes the launcher and many ""hidden"" options that will give you a better experience;  Bugs. Yeah it's alpha, yeah they're to be expected, but they're there;  Among them I'm mostly bothered by the sound. Or lack thereof. It often bugs out and goes nearly silent;  The mp can be a bit spread thin, with many servers having just but a few people logged in each;  Balance can be a problem, and more veteran players have a huge upper hand upon novices;  You can bypass the last one by playing single player for a while, or by playing on a strictly PvE server. But doesn't that spoil the whole point of the game? Maybe. It's your choice.  There's not all that much ""environment"" as of yet (although devs say much will be added). So at this point the universe feels a bit empty and plain until people (and mostly you) start to actually build stuff. ConclusionIt's hard to give a note. On the one hand if you're expecting a somewhat ""polished"", ""arrive-and-play"" type of experience, you'll be greatly disappointed. On the other hand, if you're into being creative and being responsive for the creation of your own experience, then this can easily be an 8/10 -- with the potential to go at least up to a 9 once a few things like the sounds are sorted.I highly recommend it, if it's the kind of experience you're looking for and you are prepared to what's involved in grabbing it yourself.ps: And as time passes the game only gets better with frequent updates. The ideas the devs still have ""in the oven"" make me very excited for the future of this title.			"

								I don't know where all the negatives complaining about crashes came from -- I've been playing this game since before it was on steam, not once has it ever crashed on me. Even through switching computers, changing Java versions, and using different servers it has not crashed, This game is fantastic, if you really want to build a massive ship then you can. Place turrets, hire crew, make a giant space lazer -- akin to the death star -- and blow up planets. Creating ships in this game takes time, but once you've finished it all seems worth it.Great game, would recommend "

MinecraftYes, you might think that looking at the very familiar block style voxel building, but DONT.  You might think that again the first time you land on a planet and see trees and grass and hills, but DONT.THIS IS NOT MINECRAFTThis is StarMade, you are in space, you mine your resources with a laser, and you build your own ships.  You will not find another space game with this much freedom and this much beauty.  You might think it's a little complex at first, but the concepts are simple, and you will pick them up easily with a little research.			"

								Not sure what to make of this game.I bought it just to see how it would all blend together, the building, exploring, fighting and probably above all, the maintaining it.The last is basicly my main concern. You can spend ages on gathering resources and building things. Then what?Fight using it? I advice you not to, since maintenance on your spacecraft is going to leave you wondering if it wouldnt be just as much work just rebuilding it from a blueprint.In that regard if a mode would be included that would be a bit more focussed on PvE instead of just gathering and building, this game might just be the first of some to finally bridge that particular gap. And I for one would love this game  in a mode where a team rushes to build a fleet to wage war on the AI and than tries to maintain that empire, not its ships.			"

								Edit: This game was once really, really cool. And now it's just dead. Servers are barely populated, and there isn't enough room for modding. All the fun got sucked right out of it. It's a game about being a space trucker, Elite Dangerous lite. I miss the good old days of this game.A game with huge potential that has kinda just...sat there. Updates come consistently but very little has actually been added to enhance the fun of the game. I would say that fun mostly lies within PVE and PVP, as accumulation of wealth means basically nothing as of right now, since stores are frequently our of stock with even the most basic items on nearly every server. The blueprint system is also tedious, requiring you to add every single material one by one. The ""buy-to-spawn"" mechanic is now gone on any public server I can find, requiring the construction  of ships block by block or with the annoying blueprint system. I like the creativity the game allows, but sinking hours into a ship only for it to be destroyed in the first fight sucks and the blueprint system is godawful (Edit: Still godawful. Can't check blueprint list while you have the store open at the same time. Always minimizes. This problem has been consistent throughout development and makes buying necessary items for Blueprints a ♥♥♥♥ing chore)			"

								So I read several reviews saying that this game is not reccomended because the player base is dying..that may be right, but however with the new adding of NPC factions, and soon to be life on planets there is plenty to do with just you, or with friends. You no longer need severs full of close to a hundred people to have a good time, and that is basically what they were going after in this game.anyways on to more pressing matters, I think staramde cold really use a new trailer. In no way does this trailer truly show you the actual fun this game has to offer. Now although this game can be extremly complicated at times, once you learn everything there is to do, then you will have a blast, and one last thing...I want cake....But the cake is a lie....			"

For an EA i think its amazing, can't wait for what the actual game will be like.Update: If you see this, Thank you Napther and Buugar- Story-Guy asks if he can get a lift about two jump drives away, me egar to help someone opt in and say yes. I feel good about to help with guy. As soon as we jump on the second go BOOM hard wave pirates , few shots and kaboom dead. Im just like whhat , i look back on chat and forgot to see watch out theres pirates there. I thought it was an easy transport mission. So there we are two guys with both ships ages away. Then this guy is just like, i told you, you should ride with me, i look over to see the title of the ship -RESCUE SHIP LOL-. Soon enough we got back and this guys cannons obliterated that pirate. We got a ton of loot and i ended up hitching a ride in a ship as my jump drive was blown up. Best adventure been on for a while.			"

Being able to play the game now, it could be a bit confusing at first, but the tutorial will tell you anything and everything you need to know. The game is addicting, once you start playing it you really just don't want to stop, and the world is huge so you're never going to explore it all.

								This game is everything one could hope it to be, and more, besides the obvious bocky rendering. I can already see many people comparing this game to No Man's Sky, and calling it a ""No Man's Sky wannabe"", and a ""Pretender"", but I feel obliged to point out that this game was around and being developed first. AS FOR THE PRODUCT, THIS GAME IS GREAT, IF ONE WOULD SPEND TIME FIGURING THINGS OUT. I say this, because I find a lot of people will get into something like this game, find the controls vast, and the very small amount of tutorial help given, and mostly give up right then and there, or else have some kind of computer problem running this game, blame it all of the game, and say it sucks. The reality is that this game takes some getting used too, even today I found something new, and this game never ceses to amaze me. The multiplayer servers too, are a balance that takes some getting used too. Many of them are very buggy, because all servers are run by players, however there are more than enough servers that run flawlessly. The simple truth is that this game is just as good, perhaps better than the current and near future competition (Space Engineers and No Man's Sky), however the majority of the quality is hidden just beneath the surface of the game, and just needs a little exploration to uncover.

								Note- I only play in creative and build. If you love minecraft but want your creations to come alive this is the game.Bad-Simply put it's still buggy. I've lost hours of work before because of a bug but It has only happened once and I always export my saves to a seperate folder now.graphics- pretty good and easier on older computers.Large ships can be skippy to build if you have an older computer.Controls- Like all games you learn the controls as you play but they are simple and easy to use and easily changed.Glitches- If you're not carefull two entities can imbed in each other (due to poor docking two entities planning by the player) and will become extremly laggy until you push them apart but that is the only one I have seen.Originality- Yes it's based on minecraft in the fact that it's a voxel game. Other than that it's very original.Playtime- Like any building game as long as you have something to build and want to build it and see it work then you can get hundreds of hours.It's an amazing game currently, but still some work.

However, you would be blind to admit its without flaws.At the moment to even almost barely scratch the paint of any player made ship that isnt a pirte ship and isnt made to be an OP pirate ship you need weapons of a certain minimum capabilities, now its like this with mostsimilar games, but in Starmade, the minimum is practicly the Death Star superlaser.Now this is an issue, but it dousnt effect most of the gameplay, as the game is mostly mining and building. Im sure these issues will be adressed soon, or atleast eventuly, and even with the issues Starmade is still a great game.			"

								While this game can be hard to get used to, once you get past the clunky controls, and unorthodox UI design you'll realize this is a game with amazing potential and amazing features. The developers have done something that hasn't been done for a long time - actually let players try the game without hassles or schemes. Becuase of this, i was able to discover that StarMade is what i've been looking for in a space game for a long long time. I highly reccomended that anyone who loves Space Engineers or Minecraft give this a try, becuase this really is a great game. It's not the same, but it has some similiarities. In this game, problems are solved with blocks, and i think thats something to appreciate.This game is best played in a Multipalyer setting, however i DO reccomended that you play single player for your first 20 hours to make sure youre ready for a PvP setting. There are lots of little things that i had to discover the hard way, and while it was fun, some might not be as interested in tough love as i am. I really hope this game takes off. I haven't felt so much love for a game since i first tried minecraft.EDIT: Rail systems are a blast. I've already made an auto ship dispenser for my ship's hanger. I love this game!			"

								Been playing since before the steam addition with a buddy of mine.  Back in the day, he would be mining an asteroid while I would fly out to a pirate station, in hopes of getting close enough to take apart the turret systems without dying so we could salvage the blocks.  It took many tries, and I lost a lot of ship cores, but when I finally managed to get to the station and take apart the station block, we were set to fly out to coordinates of 100+, 100-, 100+ so we could build a giant cube of death lazers and homing missiles to wreak havoc upon any fools that would make their way out to us.  It was the size of 2 pirate stations, with 16 AI turrets attached, ready to destroy anyone we deemed hostile (actually just everyone since the AI wasn't that bright at the time, including myself). Becase of the physics involved in the game, turning was a hassle, so we just added more guns and literally shot holes through planets to get through them. TL;DRMy buddy was chilling, while I was dying and crying, trying to take over a heavily AI guarded space station.  I still do the same thing to this day, except I die a lot more.  It's a good game, please support :)			"

								This game has improved quiate a lot since my inital review a year ago. I can now recommend it. You can call this minecraft in space, bit it's now a lot more than that. It can be a MMO, but with built-in anti-greifing  to some extent (only your faction home is protected). Faction permissions have improved quite a bit to prevent bad faction members from stealing resrouces and ships.Also it's a lot of fun. Build whatever you want, build elevators, huge hanger doors, tiny ships, huge ships. The universe is big enough that you can find your own litte corner of the galaxy not to be bugged, or, fly off to a far off galaxy if you want.You can now have your own fleet of ships that will fight to defend you, mine, or fly off to whever you command them (in fact, fleet orders can be used as a kind of slow auto-pilot).  The role of NPCs are being expanded. If you're running your own sever, you can write your own NPC scripts and load them for custom game experience. When you first play this game, keep in mind that block placement matters for many system blocks (esp. power and weapons). Usually due to the coplexity of the game, young children don't play it as much, so it's generally a more mature community. If you've grown out of Minecraft, this is for you.  Also, you can play the game for free as of now, and can lauch it direclty wihout using steam (which is how I normally play). The only thing is, most servers WON'T allow you to connect unless you've bought the game-- so go buy it.			"

								I've been playing this game for over a year now (it only just recently went onto steam early release)it is probably the most full-featured early access creative voxel-construction/adventure/space/multiplayer-able game right now and handles well. it doesn't play too well on intel graphics but it does play nice with nVidia and AMD Radeon video cards, which if you do game, tend to be a norm.it handles very large ships much better than space engineers will, and navigation is organized and thoughtful.keep in mind that it is still an alpha, so there are bugs that are still going to be fixed, and balance changes made, and features yet to implement, and features already implemented that are to be polished, etc.			"

								My actual playtime is longer than what steam says as I play in offline mode alot.This game is redicoulus, It's not a Minecraft clone in space, and it also isn't a Space Engineers clone. As a matter of fact I have played this game for about a week and I still can't nail down exactly what it is. But it is fun, really really fun. It's complicated to begin with so be sure to play the tutorial, but after that open the map and you'll see that the map is gigantic. The typical space game usually encompases A galaxy or a part of a galaxy, but this game contains at least 27 full sized galaxies and also it's still in alpha. I could go on, but i'll just say that everything that is in the trailer, is in the actual game as of now, AND IT'S STILL IN EARLY ALPHA so this game could get even better, if that's possible.			"

								While this game offers quite a lot to do, it will easily overwhelm a new player, almost to the point where they might lose interest. I also feel that besides the lowly pirate race, the universe itself feels rather empty and doesnt engage the player much besides the goal to build a bigger and better ship. I understand this is an ""Early Acess"" game and far more will come in the future. Besides all of that, I do personally really enjoy this game and what it has to offer currently. I found myself learning how to build a nice space elevator in a couple hours, as well as other things. I am far from being able to build a monster ship, but the game is enjoyable indeed.			"

								There has been a lot of work put into this game and for being in early access there is a ton of stuff to do! Basically think Eve Online/Star Citizen meets Minecraft/Space Engineers. You could literally recreate the entire Eve Universe with warp gates an all... setup stations etc the only difference? You could then walk around on the stations/planets/ships! (hence the star citizen reference) and this is all early stages! There is a ton of potential here I think the biggest problem they face is a learning curve and of course the art style. While it does share that block look it's no minecraft clone that's for sure.			"

								I've only just scratched the surface to this game and from the initial concept I can see what it's trying to achieve. It's essentially minecraft in space with a good dose of space sim play like that in Elite and Eve online. It does have however it's caveats; The tutorials are clunky to the extent it's easy to miss key components, and the ship management needs to be drastically simplified. Such as connecting weapons to computers should for the novice user, be automatic and not manually mapped and so forth. It has a ton of bugs, yes I know it's early access I get that. But I understand this games been around for awhile prior to being released here on Steam. So you would think something as simple as sound would be a priority. I've ran this on two systems with it either silent or randomly loud repetitive fx's.If you build a ship, fly off then start the tutorial, forget about your ship. On return spawn you are back at the beginning with your ship lost in space. And without a core to build another ship your essentially screwed and have to wipe the universe and start again.Hopefully the above bugs get sorted out in further builds.You would think with the bugs and clunky ship building I wouldn't recommend this game. For early adopters who want to see this game develop, bugs and all, I would say go for it. And I'm keen to see where this goes. For those who expect the concept being sold here is what you'll get, taking into consideration that yes this is an early access game, then I ask you save your coin and come back later.			"

								In short, it is an amazing building game with lots of potentialNow the long one. I was scrolling through games and stumbled across this game. Quite frankly i thought that this was just going to be another of the thousands of over-glorified Minecraft clone set in the future blah blah blah. But i got it anyways because some of the clones are pretty good... and it was only $10I am glad i did. You will start out on a small space station ""shop"" with some basic components that will allow you to build a tiny, but functional, ship (and yes, you CAN build your own spaceships block-by-block) as well as a weak gun and enough money to get you places. At this point you can start heading to smaller asteroids and even planets (Planets are VERY laggy) and start mining new materials to ether refine, use raw, or sell for cash for better parts. But it is not all easy, you will be attacked at times and you will need to defend your turf.Now for some cons:The MAIN issue i have with the game is LAG! LLAAGG! for the most part the game runs smother then a hot-sword-through-butter, even on some not so good computers. But when you enter planets, or even some space stations, you can encounter MASSIVE lag spikes, some even freezing the game. I HAVE been able to solve this by editing the ""server settings"" to make the planets smaller and that solved most issues. but it is defiantly an issue that must be resolved before it goes into finalIn the end:I give it a 9/10. it has great game dynamics, a good building system, and overall fun gameplay, with the only major issue that need attention being the ""Planetary Lag"", but the game is worth every penny			"

								I paid something like $20 for this game... after they added in enough features, my computer was no longer able to handle it. (problems on my end, since my laptop is a serious junker), but even considering _that_, I definitley think that what I was able to do during the time I was able to play was absolutely worth the price tag. And I plan on playing again when I get a better computer.the only problem I ever had with this game was how monotonous mining for resources could be. But it's been awhile since I've played, so they might have fixed it since then, and even if not, I just played on creative mode and had unlimited resources to play with.(And the Dev's aren't lying when they say they pay attention to the community. They're pretty on the ball with response times.)			"

								Starmade is by far one of the best sandbox games I have played, at its current stage of development it has far more features than I would expect.To just name a few, a fantastic and fleshed out system for building bases and ships, space pirates and derelict (ghost) ships, and a really cool system for combining the weapons systems to make different weapons (ie a shotgun by slaving a missile computer to a cannon computer). However this game can be very overwhelming and complex at the start it has a steep learning curve, but rewards you greatly when you start to understand how things work. And best of all while the game is in early access you can play everything the devs have to offer for free by playing the demo, so there is no reason not to take a little bit of time to just learn how the game works. (Though of course if you like the game why not give them your money to support further devolpment) GoodOne of a kind building mode that makes it easy to create even the largest of shipsAwesome combinations of weapon systemsDerelict ships and space pirate dronesPlanetsWide variety of ores and craftable blocksNeat factory blocks that can be grouped together to increase effeicency and speedEnemy space stations Space marketplaceThe blueprint system in the game is greatActive devsBadThe game can be difficult to learn due to various complexties (mainly the power system which once learned is actaully very cool)Java is pretty resource heavy and can cause slowdowns (they have been working to mitigate this)Planets have a lot of useless blocksColored blocks have to be crafted would like to see either some kind of paint gun or better yet the ability to select block color in advanced buildmodeI dislike having to craft the different block shapes as it becomes very tedious, would be awesome to see this added into advanced build mode (wedges, tetras, corners, heptas)			"

You can design on your own structures or play on a server and get into some pretty epic scenarios.  There have been huge changes in the year I've been playing and no reason not to expect even more improvements, the development team is committed and updates with an almost alarming regularity and darn near never a 'game breaker' even in this early version.  It's a sandbox, but filled with stardust.			"

								Bought this game back when it was $3 on the website (maybe 1.5 years ago?) And I was in-love with it, you could build anything you wanted in space. Be an asteroid miner, be a fighter, cruiser, dreadnaught, anything. And with multiplayer, the RP scene is pretty big. I recommend this game for anyone who likes games like space engineers (It's like that but not as complicated or taxing on your pc), or people who enjoy minecraft, and anyone who likes space.The planets: When I bought the game they used to be flat round discs, now they're multi-sided (3d-octogonal?) You can land on them, get out of your ship, and explore them.The pirates: There are npc pirates in this game. They're fairly difficult at first, but once you get a semi-decent ship they're easy. You can set them to use your own ship designs if they become waay too easy.Stations: There are two types of stations in the game. Pirate stations, and Abandoned stations. The pirate stations have turrets and spawn pirates, these have loot that can earn you a LOT of money (Very dangerous with custom ships). Abandoned stations, they're just abandoned, they used to be completely empty, but now they spawn npc drones that attack you (Like a defense system). Mine the plexglass on the top to make lots of money too.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully I helped you with purchasing this game. "

								Update: With all of the new bug fixes and updates, I'll be playing the game soon, and then revising this review as needed.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Currently the ONLY reason to buy this is to support the developer, which I have no problem doing, but based on the history of early access games on Steam - most buy an EA game, and then are upset at the lack of features, even though the EA concept is clear.  So, if you are one of those people - pass on this for now.For others, I'll state that while you can build some ships and travel through space, flying through space is very slow and as others have noted, there isn't really much to do - you can mine stuff and you can salvage stuff - oh, and you can sell stuff to the shop in order to buy stuff.  There's stuff, stuff and pirate stations...Despite the lack of other stuff, the game shows potential.  I really like the build aspect for the spaceships as it allows for lots of customization, but flying the ship isn't that great because of the overall control scheme - switching between flying and building shouldn't be so easy that you do it by accident and end up exiting and losing the ship in deep space.I didn't play this game before it came to Steam, so don't know how the planets were before, but the current design is...interesting.  They have a good size to them and I actually like the multi-faceted appearance, but travelling from one face of the planet to another is kind of weird (in both a good and bad way).  One thing I don't like so far is that there doesn't appear to be liquids - lava is simply a glowing non-flowing block - dig one out from under another and the hole remains with the other lava block just ""floating"" over it.Another thing I feel needs to be improved - space stations.  I know they pushed an update that changed the mix of abandoned versus pirate stations, but considering how long it takes to fly anywhere, it is still a pain to travel a long distance only to see you're being shot at by a pirate station or that the station is degraded, thus only good for scrap - and you'll need more than scrap if you want to upgrade your engines in order to fly faster.To summarize - unless you simply wish to support the dev and/or really like space games/sims, I'd wait until more of the features are added to the game.  At that time I'll revisit this review and hopefully change that ""no"" to a ""yes!""			"

								     This game is really good, even at its early alpha stage. For the features that are in they are fairly well implemented as well as a whole, there are more features in so far then some games have at full release. Gameplay and look is similar to how games like Minecraft and similar 3d open world sandbox games where you make your own story. It is obviously in space, even though you can go onto planets.      The game at this moment is capable to being modded, with its Block Editor(which allows you to make/modify new or existing blocks). The server config which is also the configs for single player is fairly customizable, with the ability to toggle/change settings that are normally reserved for mods in other games.      Ships are dynamic in that they are all different based on what you built them with and what types of moduals you placed in them. Also the fact that you can mix and match compatible moduals together to create a new type of weapon or utility tool. The most common example is that by default a salvage(aka mining) modual will just do a burst beam, but if you connect the salvage computer to a cannon computer with just the right ratio of moduals you can get a constant steady beam for the salvage modual and mine/eat things to your heart's content.      Building is fairly straight forward for its most used functions, as well as for those who want more tools, there are more precise tools and options. Gameplay is very much like other games of it's genres. As a side effect though, with this game's many options and complexity, there will obviously be a learning curve. Where the player will need to learn how to setup the blocks and moduals, as some have their own placement rules. Thankfully there are many tutorials and Lets Play videos out there so learning will not be too difficult.     In all I recommend this game to anyone who likes; space games + open world sandbox games + lots of options, for its $9.99 USD price at this moment. As well as the developers currently have the full game for free as long as it's in early access. I bought it though, because it's pure awesome in my opinion, and I'll gladly pay the $10 for the game as well as the fact that buying the game helps to continue it's developement.			"

								When I first seen this game I thought ahh Minecraft in space with some EVE undertones and that is what it is. I totally give the Devs a salute for their love for this game. They are a small team so at times when personal stuff comes up you do notice a slow down but the care and love is there, If you are like me and tired of developers that just want your money and you wonder if one day the game will just be dead then have no worries about the Schine team. As far as gameplay goes It's kind of boring playing by yourself but so is Minecraft. The build tools are amazing and make up for that plenty as you can see from my hours played. You have 5 basic shapes of blocks which I think does make for a more Minecraft feel even though they could do more variety with the second gen voxel system the game uses. I'd like to see more but i can respect if it is to keep the blocky feel of the game. They do alot on making multiplayer very viable and there has been a lot of focus there.  It's private servers like Minecraft but there are public websites and people who run them that let anyone in like minecraft if you want a bigger server to play on. Google it and you will get a good list. So I say give this game a try if you want Minecraft in space and to take what you build into battle. The Schine team has accomplished a lot since I bought this as far as adding quailty into the game and it's gameplay. Plus they are always working on something so you can expect more from these guys.  This game is worth the price and you will not regret it in my opinion.			"

								This is one of those games that requires your attention as a Science Fiction game.This is not a game that tells a story, or has quests of any kind in fact. What it does instead is offer you the ability to create anything you can imagine.Yes, other games, like Minecraft, have done this before, but this game is exceptional in how it handles Starship building. Take a quick tour through any Ship Review on YouTube and you will see things that are not possible in any game. A 1:1 replica of the UNSC Spirit of Fire? Yup. A 1:1 replica of the Enterprise (several versions of it, in fact)? Yup. A scale replica of the Death Star? Yup.You can build anything in this game. Starships from your favorite franchise, Starships of your own design, space stations, ground vehicles, bases, cities, factions... everything.You can save everything you build as a blueprint (which also allows you to download other people's ships) and then take them with you to other servers, where you can join Player-Run factions and engage in PvP content in ships, or in capturing ships and bases. Or, you could just build a simple mining ship and sell your resources to players who need them more than you. And you can do all of this while exploring a randomly generated galaxy.The developers are very active and the game has received numerous updates adding new functionality, like FTL drives, NPC factions, and others.However, this is absolutely a game that requires you to make your own fun. The amount of content here is mind-boggling, but, like other games in its genre, it typically involves you building it.If you are a fan of starships, play this game. If you are have always wanted to build your starship/station/moon-like object, play this game. And finally, if you've wanted a game that actually captures the feeling of exploring the galaxy, play this game.As a final note, this game is 100% free to try. The demo listed on Steam is actually the full game, and will continue to be the full game until Starmade comes out of Alpha. You will not need to pay money for the game until it comes out in Beta or later.			"

								I thought that Minecraft was the ultimate sandbox/openworld building stuff game.Then I found StarMade. I haven't been playing for very long (just a little over 10 hours according to my library), but I've already scoured the net (Google really) for tutorials, and other helpful things. I did encounter a bug (I read about how to fix it via a number of forums, hasn't solved itself yet though...vanishing/flashing blocks, but that's not that big of a problem). The only real problem I have isn't with the game itself, but with my own computer's specs.Meet the recommended requirements and you're set to boldy go where no one has ever gone before and build stuff that no one else has too (if you're so inclined).

								This Review is more of a first hands on impression from the few hours i played:StarMade in my opinion looks to be a very promising game. The  environments are huge i can tell by when i first played the tutorials to when i first made my ship into space and  far away from home feel wheni had to keep my guard on cause they have pirates on this game not just space stations and planets. The moment i thought about how this game reminds me of minecraft meets star trek, but the game is more complex then it looks , I figure by the time your done reading my first impression you might wanna try the game. I think it's worth the purchase considering how much explore and adventuring there is to do, and that if this is just early acess well i hope devs keep up the great work cause they really impressed me i gotta say. :)			"

								This game is really an awesome game. I waited quite a while to write this review. From the outside it might look like minecraft in space, but it is not. Starmade is a randomly generated huge universe, multiplayer or singleplayer, PVP, PVE, space simulation, sandbox game. That statement may seem like too much, but it does not do the game justice. I've been playing starmade for years. For a long time I played free via their website, but finally decided to buy it and support them. The game has gradually been changing, and is constantly being worked on. They are always listening to their forums for ideas in developing the game to better suit the players, but still keeping their core elements of the game alive.The most impressive aspect of the game to me is its builder or build mode. The build mode in starmade allows for players to do much more than just place blocks. It gives you shape outlines to use, you can set planes to create symmetry on structures, you can place blocks in many ways, and replace certain types with other types. The complexity may seem like a lot to get used to, but it is not you can hop right in, and the tutorials give you enough information to be building your own ship in minutes.The game also is constantly changing with great plans in place for future gameplay. Currently there are areas of the game that are lacking, but those areas are already being filled in. Even in the current state of the game, I find myself wasting many hours on it. It's definitely worth looking into if you like space exploration, combat, or even rpg elements. This game will have them all. Currently it's most lacking in rp elements, but there are plans to have quests and many other rp elements added in later. The game operates on a small server platform, so you can play online with friends or do local play to play by yourself. My Pros:Infinite Open Universe SimulationSandboxCompletely customizableBuild Ships, Spacestations, and Planet BasesBeautiful graphicsBlueprints to save created structuresMultiplayer or SingleplayerCreative or SurvivalInteresting Building MechanicsGreat combat with playersCons: AI is hilariously glitchy at timesCurrently in developmentSometimes can lag due to needed server optimizationPirates sometimes kill you before you can get established "

								I tried the game around a year ago and I was not impressed. I saw there had been considerable updates and I have to say it's like a different game. The developers have really pulled this game together and it is a lot of fun. With the logic circuits you can build fancy triggered events and make hangars with docks that raise and lower ships; it's pretty impressive. The limits of construction are basically only your imagination. This is an alpha, and as such there are still some bugs but overall I highly recommend the game, especially since the full game is free at the moment.			"

								When I first heard of StarMade, I was excited, yet weary.  I have often let my emotions run amuck when I encounter a feature list as enormous and tantalizing as the one I read before I began to play this game for free.  To whet your appetite, here's a small portion of features already included in the alpha release. Build voxel spaceships/stations/settlements of all conceivable shapes or sizes using an absolutely enormous number of blocks.Easy-to-use interface and building mechanics which make construction an enjoyable experience.Full multiplayer functionality including factions, player-created economies, and servers which can be customized and modded to create a unique experience on a server by server basis.A nearly endless universe containing entire galaxies and solar systems all laced with an unchartable amount of planets, asteroids, space stations, pirates, wormholes, and intrigue.PVP and PVE combat, fight from the helm of your capital ship, cockpit of a fighter, or on foot using a huge and customizable selection of weapon systems against an enemy faction, space pirates, and crabsModding support.Immensely detailed crafting system.A full set of explorable, player created content and a community which constantly puts out a huge number of original masterpieces and recreations, from TIE Fighters to the UNSC Infinity.A development team which truly listens to the community and implements player ideas and creations into the gameA roadmap which includes programmable AI, AI creature support, a player-driven quest system, and so much more.You can build whatever you want, you can fly what you build through a truly endless world, you can do so with large amounts of people.I can't think of another game that claims to do this much and actually delivers.  Best of all devs consistently release new features and quality of life patches that constantly reinvigorate my interest in this game.If building your own spaceship and conquering the galaxy sounds at all appealing to you, I recommended you try this FREE alpha version of a fantastic game which is not even near completion yet.  You will not be disappointed.			"

								Starmade is amazing and almost limitless, while I will cover the current cons of this game I will tell you about how amazing and positive it truly is. So to start off the cons, sound. Sound is something that has been neglected for years with this game, although they are working on it, its put behind every other game mechanic. I understand why they did this but immersion is really key and would boost Starmade tenfolds. Second is NPC/ AI's another thing they are working on and are closer to completing but currently there are no AI's aside from silly pirates. When an update drops for NPC missions and AI's this will bring a whole new experience to the game.Onto some pros. The game is VERY addictive, I have been playing it for years now. I have to admit at times it can get dull, but when your friends are playing and you hop on its truly a blast. Creating anything you want is possible, the amazing work from Hull design and blocks to the sheer crazy logic work that people put into their build makes it amazing. You can download and upload ships/stations/logic from StarmadeDock easy to check out others work. Starmade has a great community from YouTubers/Streamers to every player giving advice. Lastly for now, Schine, these guys have worked their butt off on this game and it proves it with the sheer love they get in return. They listen to their players and deem what can and will be added, they love seeing the community post about ideas no matter what they are. I can only thank them for hours of fun.So I'd reccommend this truly, grab some friends, be creative and do whatever you please!			"

								Don't let my play time on steam fool you.I've been playing this game on and off since it was just a rough idea in 2012 and only shortly have bought it via steam.Things improved a lot over the years and are getting better and better.After a long way this game is for the type of people loving to be creative and invest some serious time in a game.There is not too much grinding but be aware, you'll need to mine and craft :)The game is voxel based, so everythig can be changed.Technical issues:Well there are some minor things but it does not keep you from playing and enjoying the game.The only thing, which is not mentionned too clearly is that this game uses java.For the people that are having issues with the game, be sure to install the adequate java version!64bit windows goes with 64bit Java!!! After installing the 64bit Java, change the memory allocation in the starting client to a higher value.For the people still running a 32bit OS I'll say that they should not expect too much and the game will not run too smoothly as it really needs some horsepower :)For me most issues like crashes and freezes or stuttering vanished after installing the right version of Java.********Graphics:Here we stick with nice clean graphics, not too fancy but it gets the job well done.*********Sound:Sound is OK, but I guess it will be better in a while.********Gameplay:The gameplay is really good and once you understand how to control things everything falls into place and you get accustomed very fast to the controls.********If you like building, crafting, being creative and many other things, this game really could be for you.There is no recipe mechanic, everythig is build via different constructors, so no need to wiki for this :)Yes there are logic blocks and yes there are a lot of other good ideas :)And btw, don't get overwhelmed by the shear scope of the game, start small, try some stuff and progress slowly.You can try the demo version at first to get a feel for the game and after you spend a lot of hours you'll probably, like me, buy the game ;)Run your own server and play with your friends, you'll see, the world is a big place and you don't have to be alone.

								Very cool sandbox spaceship building game.I have both this and Space Engineers(SE), and what Starmade lacks in Physics and Graphics it most certainly makes up for in game play depth.By this I mean, Logic Controllers, the PvE AI, the HUGE Galaxy, the ability to support HUGE ships pretty well but in SE's defense Starmade has less to calculate with relations to Newtonian Physics which SE has.Putting them side by side, each is better at one thing than the other and they both cater for different crowds.This game is awesome in that as someone who does not really play on hugely populated servers there is something to do other than chase down 'drifting' abandoned ships with auto turrets that shoot you.Some features in this game I think are cool:- PvE AI that are both friend and foe.- Huge area of space to explore.- Land / Build on planets.- Shield generators!- Decently detailed component system(Reactors, Capacitors, Generators etc)- Logic ControlAll in all for the price tag, if you like Space & Sandbox builders this is an awesome game and would highly recommend it!

								This is a wonderful game with great potential.The systems that are present are complex enough, and with the latest updates of jump drives, rails, and shipyards, it's pretty much a space ship enthusiast's dream come true. There are plenty of customization options. The weapons system is probably one of the most interesting that I have seen as well as the power systems.The best part is that everything is MASSIVE. There is no end to it. There are pirates with suitable rewards for pve, entire planets to mine away, stars that will burn you if you get too close and traders who will sell just about anything. There is a strange mix of realism with fake rules that works really well with one another.The building system is easy to pick up, with more depth the deeper you go. The crafting systems could use some work, but the anaysis of systems is beautifully done. With regular updates and great support, I can see this game going VERY far.Also, do not call this Minecraft in space. The two games are similar on the surface, But they are in no ways alike.			"

								First off let me say space is awesome.  What a great setting to host this style of game. Inspired by Minecraft I believe Starmade is truly a new unique procedural sandbox experience.  The universe is huge, seriously...huge.  They way the game is developed is perfect for exploring star systems mining the planets exploring building factorys etc then moving into new star systems later.  I have 40+ hrs in so far and I am still learning new things. There are so many functional blocks in this game that do incredible things.  Its your imagination truly that limits you in this game as to what you can build.Building ships is the main focus, building with efficiency at first is very tough to do without doing some sort of research.  Power reactor design is vital, you can build a solid block for a power reactor but building it in different ways grants you more efficiency and more power. ;) I strongly recommend reading up on the game via wiki or other sources before playing, and play the tutorials.  Lots of you tube videos as well, this is a very large environment with lots going on.  It is amazing the things you can build and achieve in this game.  Just takes time to learn everything and patience.EDIT: always save your blueprints after or while building.			"

The community is one of the best ones i've seen to as everyone helped me by answering my questions and letting me tag along with them, with one guy even buying me a ship.The only con would be the small community with the highest pop. server having around 25 people normally. Which is small compared to the UNIVERSE you can explore.

Now before you say ""screw this then ill go play space engineers"" this game has more elements of Minecraft, and has far better multiplayer(as of right now, simply because building stations with friends is fun in any game). In my opinon, i'd get both space engineers and starmade. Space engineers when you feel like being realistic and build. Starmade for when you want to build and not worry about cutting open an asteroid for 2 days.If you got the money, i'd get it.			"

								Wonderful sense of adventure playing this game. Fun to build your own ships, relatively easy to aquire more credits and build bigger ships, and overall visually pleasing. Easily worth the price tag.However, the MASSIVE universe of starmade is lacking in the sense that there are not enough people in-game yet to actually feel like a bustling space opera. This game will be INSANE when more players are involved, and I can see the potential for massive battles and wild group builds. For now, however, it is lacking in people currently in game.The majority of the experience hinges off the social aspect, at this point in development, so convince your friends to buy it!			"

I played it long before it appeared on steam.The only problem i've encountered is the constant updates. I love the fact the dev's arent giving up, but it does get irritating updating your ship with the latest stuff. Especially when it first came out, mostly the reason i dont play anymore, dont feel like learning new stuff...Recommended 8/10. Also get some friends with this one, you'll end up bored after some time, I'd say after 100hrs... :D			"

								I know a lot of people are hesistant to throw their support behind any early access project since it seems many of them never even make it to beta.  trust me, I bought Godus so I know exactly how that feels.  However, Starmade is definitely something I'd reccomend getting.  Right now the game is still in alpha but for the most part the fundamentals are there and they are solid.  There are occasional bugs and after a while the game does start to get a little old.  But the developer has stated multiple times that he wants to make sure the fundamentals of the game are in place and are stable before he starts to expand the game.  Even so there is already a growing community of builders on Reddit and YouTube who have built some incredible things and I would highly reccomend checking them out before purchasing the game.  I genuinely believe that this game has the potential to become something amazing and I also believe that with enough support the developer will make sure it gets there.			"

								Update: I stand by everything I said.This is the best game I have ever played. Its more like EvE then minecraft. Better crafting the Minecraft. I can not stress how cheap this is for $10 bucks. Still in alpha and is already better then EvE Online. Let me say that again........ ITS BETTER THEN EvE Online! Let that sink in.The crafting system allows you to create anything you can imagine and its very well balanced. For instance you can make any ship currently in EvE, and if you don't like there design you can tweak it to your hearts content. The primary gameplay focuses on taking and hoding sectors of space. Your faction claims them and then gains faction points based on how much they currently control. You can make turrets, drones, titans, all with AI control so you can gurad your systems while offline.You can create space stations, and colonize planets. You can board and hijack ships and stations. The game is simple to understand and learn, but would take a lifetime to master every intricicy. Bigger is not better in all cases. A small covert ops ship can decimate and unpreppared titan. I could literally talk about htis game and compare it to EvE and Minecraft for weeks. But I would rather play it and leave others to make there own choice. I still have an EvE account and activlely play, but there has been more station spinning and Que rolling since this game come out on steam. Its free to try, demo is the full game and you can join a server to see what its like. Its hard in the begining but some basic understanding of EvE will help you adapt quickly. It is more of an RTS then anything else, gameplay wise.-The best way to play is online with other people. There is no feeling like flying around exploring.-Finding a huge base, some sick player created ships, and then realizing none of them have faction modules.... So its all yours for the taking. -Creating turrets to protect your bases and watching someone warp in on top of it and immediatly exploding.-Creating a large troop of Drones, and releasing them a couple of sectors away from someones base.-Blowing up someones planet as they beg you to stop.-Camping someones homebase while offline... with your turret monster.It just Keeps getting better as I play. At first you are trying to figure otu the mechanics of all the blcoks and how to accomplish what you want to to do. But as I go along I am coming up with really complex ideas and then, overtime testing them. Magnetic mines, Shotgun turrets and stop effect Lasers, oh my.You are sleeping on the next great game. All space games will be compared to this in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a tough one for me, I'd not recommend it to casual gamers yet, but do so for those who are more technically inclined and enjoy being part of a games development cycle.Buy this game if you like arcadey SpaceSims and building ships and are prepared to deal with lots of bugs and a long and slow development cycle.Despite it's Minecraft like roots this is not Minecraft, do not expect ""Minecraft in Space"" or that if you can run Minecraft you can run this game, it is pretty resource hungry and begs for a decent gaming PC.Do buy if you like tweaking things and have a good understanding of PC's. You'll need it to get the most out of the game.This game is the very definition of Early Access despit it's 3+ years of development. You are buying to play test it and report bugs, to help the development. If you are expecting a complete and optimised game look elsewhere.Do not buy this game if you own a Intel HD GPU, have low memory or just a basic desktop or laptop. You'll just end up playing at 5fps and crashing everytime you see a 1km long ship. Also avoid if you expect a fully functioning game anytime in the forseeable future and are easily frustrated and have little to no technical knowledge with computers and are not willing to learnPros:Massive Universe. Too many galaxies than you'll ever hope to explore.Decent and customisable Mechanics. Want newtonian physics? Turn them on. Don't like them? Turn them off. Most of the game can be customised via config files. Planet sizes, sector distances, ships speed, and more can be set to your liking.You can build virtually anything you can think of. From a tiny X-Wing fighter to a 1:1 scale 1.7km Battlestar. Despite it's blocky voxel nature you can create some really detailed ships and stations only limited by your imagination and PC's hardware specs.Fun PVP. Active servers and community, you can always find a server with people on it. Player battles can be fun and (now) drawn out affairs when ships are evenly matched,Great for Roleplayers.Great deal of content to work with and weapon/system variety. You'll always be finding new things to experiment with.Can that weapon maybe be used as an engine? Players are always coming up with new ways to use items.Persistant Universe done right. Dock your ship at your home station and log off. It's safe, unattackable and will be there in the morning unlike other games even though other players can still visit it. No frustration of days, weeks or months of work going down the toilet in 5 minutes to some a-hole griefer like you experience in games like Rust and ARK.Still while invulnerable there is a mechanic of faction points, allow your points to get too low and you eventually can be attacked at your home base.Makes you become part of the PC Master Race for real. No seriously, you will need to make your PC beast and up your PC gaming hardware and techical knowledge. No more 'I haz PC, so I iz Master Race' because you own a 13 inch Intel HD notebook with Windows, You are really gonna need to be Master Race material. XDCan for now play the full game free. But hey it's $10, don't be a tight♥♥♥♥♥and support the devs. If you try it for free and like it, BUY IT.And no doubt a bunch of other stuff I cannot think of right now.Now sadly onto the.....Cons:Uses Java.Game is Alpha, bugs and stability issues a plenty.Beefy system requirements. Forget where it says this game is scalable and designed to run on older computers. You'll be wanting powerful modern hardware to run a server or even play single player with a decent frame rate. 4GB of memory, 1 GB dedicated GPU or better a must. 64 Bit OS and Java, 8GB memory recommended. Even then large ships, stations and planets all at once will make your computer and probably you cry.Requires know how. The game defaults to very low memory, you'll need to know how to increase it, you'll need to know how to force your Java on your laptop to use it's AMD or nVidia GPU instead of the Intel HD crap it defaults to.You'll need to know how to tweak game settings. If gaming for you is turning on a box, inserting a game and little else, you're gonna have a bad time.Confusing interface. Options on the two different launch screens and options in game. They can all differ. What is available in game may not be available on the launch screen and vice versa. Some features may not make sense to you or may be ones you've not encountered before. e.g draw distance here works different to most games.Great for Rolepay. yeah, because there is no gameplay as such outside of building and mining. You have to make your own fun. Don't expect quests or epic battles with AI. AI pirates and trade guild are fixed one patch and broken the next.Speaking of which, patches, often they fix one thing while breaking another 2 or 3 things, and often you'll have to wait for the next patch (often months) for the issue to be fixed, just to find out it is actually broken more. No idea what the play testers on the test server are doing. It's clearly not play testing when things like the broken AI gets through to a release after just being fixed the previous patch. Hot fixes for such game breaking problems are extremely rare.Massive Universe, which will often feel more dead than alive due to lack of anything to do other than build and mine. Only life is the odd station with respawning space spiders.PVP: If you hate PVP and prefer PVE, you might hate this game, with nothing to really fight or kill at the moment other players will come looking for fun. Which will be seeing how fast they can blow up and loot your ship.Single player spam and lag: Be prepared to see a ""Server is under heavy load contact a server admin"" message in a big red box every 2 seconds even if your game is running fine. Experience random lag for no obvious reason even on a decent machine.Discriminates and punishes Left Handers. Yep that is right, if you're left handed like myself and rebind the WASD setup common to games these days to the Numpad as many of us lefties do, you'll find your controls conflict with building debug keys that are also bound to the Numpad and cannot be changed right now. Go into build mode on a entity with no systems press 8 (e.g forward) and POW your game crashes. Left handers be warned. :p (only affects build mode, regular play is fine.) Devs have no intention of fixing this yet.Stupid and uneccesary updates: Pirates broken? It's okay here's a patch that changes a perfectly fine block texture or renames an ore.........Who cares about the gameplay, we need to give the 2D artist something to do....... O_oUsual game forums based bad decisions. Space whales? let's add them to the game, because some forum junkies like the idea, forget the other million people actually playing the game who have no idea space whales are actually a thing being considered and feel they're completely stupid. Schine ignores the majority of players actually playing just like a real AAA studio. :pSeriously how about updates on the launcher or voting option so all are aware of what is happening? If we can have a ""email bug to devs button"" surely a ""vote on stupid decisions button"" would not be hard?And no doubt a bunch of other stuff I cannot think of right now.Summary:StarMade is a great game with a lot of potential and fun to play with friends if you're willing to make your own fun. Sadly though it often goes 1 step back for every step forward it makes.If you're patient and a space game fan who knows what is inside his/her PC and how tech works, and have a full understanding of what Early Access is and how it works I recommend you try and buy itt.If you're 12, love minecraft, think a 500 ping is great, love space whales, have no idea what a CPU or a GPU is, and expect Early Access games to be complete within a month of release, then please go away and stick to Wii U or Xbox.

								This game is good and has huge potential of expansion. If you like to be creative and building, you will get loads of enjoyable hours out of this game and even if you don't like these kinda things, you can surely get a few good hours of fun gameplay. Not even mentioning the multiplayer, it is REALLY GOOD, i mean you can reenact flippin' starwars and stuff! Go fight pirates with your friends, or even do PVP.Overall rating for this game would be 8.5/10. But has loads of room for improvement.			"

								It is like Minecraft in space! With a larger scale, procedurally generated universe to explore. You can build small starships to explore the galaxy, or the largest planetary destroyer you can imagine. Mine to your hearts content, or simply build a small settlement on one of the many worlds available to explore. If you like voxel based sandbox type games you will likely like Starmade as well.			"

Early Access Review
								First Impressions:A bit overwhelming at first but I'm slowly getting the hang of the interface and constructing ships.  I love the idea of being able to build a ship and travel to other planetary bodies.  The idea of building around your ""core"" block is an interesting one as you'll need to come up with designs that protect it from enemy fire.  There's a lot here for ten bucks (though the price will increase later on as development continues) and is an easy recommend to those who enjoy open world sandboxes.Edit: After some more testing, I am getting some really nasty lag.  My guess is that the single player mode still connects to an online server of some sort.  If this is the case, I'd really like the ability to play offline to eliminate the lag.  Hopefully the devs will address this and the server issues in a future patch.

								I'll start this review off by pointing out that i have played this game on and off for over a year now. This is one of those rare gems of a game that keeps you coming back for more forever as it is constantly improving through its passionate and dedicated dev team and community. But more then that. This is a game that has a nearly infinite depth in its mechanics and advanced build modes, logic systems, weapons systems..etc..etc which leaves you with nearly limitless possibilites in which to build whatever ship, base, station you can imagine. The mulyiplayer aspect is often quite engaging as well with its caring community, factions and moderators that always have interesting events planned and fun things to do, ranging from huge PvP tournements like Blood and Steel where you bring the deadliest machine you can build to wage war against other teams. Along with server bosses or christmas events..etc..etcOr even something as simple as taking a noob out to fight the pirates for the first time to hear them get excited when they get there first kill in their newly built fighter ship. Or even having to save that same noob later because he jump driven his ship into a star because thay havent learned that they should chart there course a little more carfully when traversing the cosmos.All of these things add up to a game that is absolutley satisfying , so long as you can muster the patience to overcome the admittedly steep learning curve required to understand the workings of this game competently.I certainly recommend this game to all who love space, sci fi, sandbox and voxel building games. But must say that it isnt for the faint of heart or those without much patience. But is for those who want to build the baddest mutha of a ship this side of the galaxy has seen			"

								After a few false starts, I finally got this game to run and, I have to be honest, I AM ADDICTED.It is that simple.  I love sandbox games and while I will acknowledge that this game is not for everyone (since it does not have much in the way of prepackaged plotline or specific goals for players to accomplish), this game does a superlative job of providing an immersive, open-ended, do-what-you-want-within-the-constraints-of-the-game-engine type of experience.Want to start a faction?  Do it.  Want to design starships?  Do it... and then build them.Want to take on the pirates that just started attacking your Factions bases and are trying to muscle in on your territory?  Make that happen.All of these options and more are ripe for the enjoying.Go forth!  Create your own adventure and take control of your destiny!In StarMade, the Universe is ripe with potential experience and you are in the pilot's seat, so now it's time select a destination, chart a course for the Stars you have chosen and MAKE YOUR OWN STORY instead of relying on someone else to tell their story to you.

								As a casual game building space ships that have complicated wepons systems, its a ton of fun!  Untill you actually try to use it on a pirate station.  Then the whole sector fills with little AI ships and the whole server bogs way down and you get no FPS.  Sometimes the lag is so bad you can't maneuver and by the time the FPS comes back up enough to see whats going on your dead, and your ship is destroyed.  Hope you have time to harvest more materials for another ship....    I understand that game balancing is a major issue and getting it right is important.  But as it sits a ship needs to be so large to have the power/shields/thrusters/and various weapon and tool modules, then the problem of the ship being too big to move comes into play.  Just adding more thrusters wont do the job as each block adds to the total mass of the ship thus creating a larger power and thrust issue.This game NEEDS:                              > A bigger game engine                              > Less restrictions on Power Generation                              > Smoother Networking                              > Fleets that actually do what they are meant to do                                                 ie. Salvage drones that salvage rather than sit next to an asteroid or planet segment doing nothing.A few suggestions for Content:                              > Upgradable blocks                                     -Such as using blocks already made to improve their performance or permanently upgrading Factories to produce modified or ""higher tier"" blocks such as                                                           *Power Reactor MKII/MKIII/MKIV ect...                                             *Thruster/Turbine/Ion Induction                                             *Weapon systems and shields                              > Lawful/Un-Lawful/Mercenary qualities for player Factions                                             *Changes how Pirates/Traders associate with Players and what prices they charge for blocks                              > The ability to salvage non-scrap from darelects either with upgraded salvage Computers/Beams or a Faction prestiege honor that allows it.                               > Collectable ""Relics""  that passivly improve what they are connected to on a ship or station.                                             *A weapon relic would need to be linked to a weapon computer for example.                              > More discoverables like crash landed ships (salvageable or usable)     That being said I would RECOMMEND Starmade to anyone who likes to build and be creative        Those of us who want a little more out of the experience will need to wait for an improved server/game engine to enjoy the PVP or even PVE aspect as the lag gets to be too extreme when more than 10 entities are moving near each other.

Early Access Review
  This game was gifted to me by a friend who purchased a 4 pack.  Game is still in active development.Minecraft meets Space meets Eve Online (sorta)It's a space voxel game with, currently, some faction elements, soon to have many faction elements. The game can be difficult and intimidating starting out. Lots of little things that aren't always made clear without some trial and error and some reading/watching online. But the event horizon is the limit when it comes to what you can build. Build your space ship or station out of blocks, and fly around space or set up a fancy docking ring. Mine astroids or planets, fight pirates or trade with others.Some of the features currently include (not all just some highlights):*Shipyards - Build a station and make a shipyard that will pull resources from containers to assemble ships from blueprints or your own creation.*Logic Systems - Ever play with redstone in minecraft? Than do we have a logic system for you! Build password protected doors, initiate launch codes for nukes or go to red alert!*Seamless Universe - See that galaxy over there? You can fly to it, or warp if it's in range. Wanna fly into a systems star? You can do that!  (Caution not recommend for health reasons) *Active Multiplayer - There's a fairly large array of populated servers with varing rule sets, but if that's not your thing there is singleplayer. There are player ran servers and some Dev servers.*Player Factions - With the current faction system you can join up with your friends and share with them or don't. Customizable rank system and faction alliance or war declare war.*Spaceship Fleets - Want to make big @$$ mother ships and have X-wing fighters escorting it? You can do that too.There's a lot of difference aspects of the game that I can't list all and the ways you can use them. If you've played it before long ago I'd recommend checking it out again, many new features have been added in the last year alone. If you're on the fence, know that Demo is currently the full game and FREE (until the end of alpha and/or beta/the game goes live). I'm considering purchasing a 4 pack to share with some other friends as well.			"

								Admittedly I will be a bit biased in this response as I am helping in the development for this game. However I will give the most honest answer I can.It's been far too long since I should have made this post. I have been playing StarMade consistently for over a year and discovered it far before that. (There is a good chance I have hundreds of hours but I don't use steam to launch the game so that is surely incorrect in my hours played) Since then it has undergone massive changes and very much so in a positive direction. Visually and gameplay wise it continues to become an amazing game. This review will be from the perspective of an experienced player around December 2015Graphics: This isn't any Star citizen, nor is it Space Engineers (a game it is often compared to) when it comes to graphics. The universe is cubed. It follows the trend set fourth by Minecraft (despite being planned long before MC made it's debut). I must say however, I never had such faith in the graphics of a voxel game. Even with shaders installed and a great texture pack, Minecraft can hardly come close to the visuals of StarMade. This is due to the use of built in normal, emission and specular maps. Additionally it has some very decent shadows as well. Like much of the rest of the game, a lot of this is configurable.Scale: The universe is massive. Often times I will hear new players remark on how large a ship is. To me the same ship may be small. The feeling of walking around a kilometer long spaceship is awesome and getting to that point in the game is worth the money alone. Space itself is split up neatly into grids, which allow this universe to exist at this scale. From sectors to systems to galaxies, you could spend your entire time flying and never see the same stars again. The only area where scale is lacking is planets. These objects often sit under a kilometer in radius. That said, I know it is intended to bump up the scale where possible. Despite pushing a java game beyond what is possible, we will eventually reach it's limit's. At least for now those limits have yet to be reached.Setting: The game is purely science fiction based. You can if you want turn on options for a more realistic experience, however the idea is that creativity should flourish and it should be fun to play. The universe is a bit empty right now, however rest assured. I myself am personally working on various assets that will be in the game and additionally we will see mechanics introduced that turn this into a bustling dynamic universe. Aliens, flora, space derelicts, cosmic anomalies. All of this is planned. Some of it is already in the game!Building: Building has never been simpler. All blocks and materials are 1 cubic meter. I think this is the advantage this game has over similar titles. There is no need to build a large chunky machine that serves a specific purpose. Or to place it in a way on your build so that it actually functions. You can have a ship that makes just about no sense, but it will still work. If you like it, why should the game punish you for that? Additionally there are crazy awesome build tools. Templates for shapes, copy/paste, undo/redo, and symmetry planes just to name a few. All of this easily accessible from your ship.Crafting: Crafting is simple and complex at the same time. There are 24~ resources that produce just about every block in the game, most of which you will eventually find a place for on your ship. These resources are fed into factories and can be automated and made more efficient.Combat/gameplay: There is a lot to learn here and it will likely be where a new player will get stuck. Combat can be exciting, however I expect balancing as well as new features to be added till release. There are multiple approaches though; shield tanking, armor tanking, dps based. You can use missiles, lasers, cannons, or turrets or combinations of all of this. You can install jump drives to escape, you can install jump inhibitors to prevent escape! No idea is too crazy for StarMade and a lot of science fiction based features have made their way into the game simply because they are awesome. I imagine learning how to play the game will be the hardest part for any new players. Learning to play is worth it however. The game's demo is free but will not be updated beyond beta or public release. As the game approaches full release the price will increase so now is the time! Take the time to learn and see what is possible and you will be getting your money's worth!TLDR; Easy building with great tools. Simply yet deep crafting system that makes sense. Massive universe and massive scale. Anything in the realm of science fiction is a reality and may become a part of the game as it develops!			"

								Minecrarft but in space!If you enjoyed playing Minecraft then i can gurentee that you will enjoy playing StarMade.StarMade server universe are very large meaning theres room for everyone to have there own faction and fun. I found it a bit hard to play some servers when you first start off as most of the resources in the start areas have already been purchased by other users. How ever once you are far enough away from the spawn the game starts to become very fun.This game is much more enjoyable when playing with some friends as you can communicate with them to go raid/destroy some other player ships.The weapon systems in StarMade are very well designed and some of the weapons you can create using some cool combos is pretty insane. From a cannon that shoots once every half a second to a nuke that can just demolish everything.If you enjoy space games this is a must for your libary.			"

								Keeps getting better and better.Not minecraft in space, more like a mix of X, spaceengineers, and its own breed of creative builder.  There are deceptively detailed layers of mechanics/detail that the 'simple' bocks can distract from, and endless posibility of creativity from making your own planet killing super weapons, gigantic turrets you design yourself, self-sorting rail system to dock and launch fighters, a fully fleged and very useful logic-gate system, huge array of resources to mine/refine/build with, and is consntantly being tweaked and improved overall.

								Definitely the highest quality voxel space game out there. Space engineers has the graphics crown, however starmade has far and away a better gameplay. The learning curve is worth it and Schema has been a very active developer for years. This gives me faith he won't disappear, barring a disaster. For me, this was well worth the $10. Especially considering you can still play it for free if you like (Demo) before buying. The demo is not feature-locked at all.Want to take over a planet and build a galactic empire? this is the only game you in the world letting you do this, build this, create this, yourself. Everything else similar is far more limited in scope.			"

								I have mixed feelings for this game so don't bash me for the negative review when I write things I enjoy about this game, thank you.Overall the game is well built, however I have seen some people having crash issues and I think that is caused by Java having a lack of memory,or something else but I won't discuss that here. ANYWAYS the game is quite big, on some older servers I've joined to♥♥♥♥♥♥around on, I've seen serveral galaxies explored and on top of that the galaxies themselves are quite large, solar systems (even with a fast ship) can take roughly 20-30 minutes to traverse, longer if pirate infested (which in my opinion there needs to be less pirate stations due to the fact that heat seeking missles dessimate anything that touches them and the pirates and their stations have cannons for days).With that in mind if you have a well built ship which will take ages due to the credit and resource cost if you're crafting (more on that later) getting a ship that can not only hold its own, but fight back against a pirate station is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get.Again, if you have a strong ship that goes fast exploration is enjoyable as you watch the planets and stars go by but can get boring after a while and one starts to resort to the use of jump drives more and more. And for crafting/getting resources, its tedious and grindy especially if you get a large ore haul and try to sell it but can only give each store around 4.5k ore before its completely stocked on it (if this happens sell until you're annoyed and then keep the rest for crafting use) I won't call crafting necesarily fun, its moreso a process of gettings components/ resources together, going afk or mining for a bit, and then coming back to check up on your factory.However building is truly the highlight of this game, there are several blocks to choose from each of these with their own colors and set shapes (there are 4 i think,being the cube,hepta,slope,corner and maybe something I missed?)With all the shapes and colors available allows for many designs and chassis shapes for ships and allows for one, if given enough time, to make their own unique ship but this is the only thing ,aside from making your own station, that there really is to do since exploring isnt too fun if you ave a long range jump drive and just hop over to a point of interest look at it and go back home. I wouldn't recommend this game to too many people I know but this game does have a great potential and would like to see where the devs take this game (I'm aware there might be a few things I missed once I get something decent together in my head for those parts I'll write it in) As of now I give this game a verdict of 4/10 but there is a present potential there and I can't wait to see what will be coming up in future patches.

								Get. This. Game.It's easy to get into, and deceptively complex.  For example, they have logic blocks, aoe triggers, effects (on pretty much everything from lights to weapons) that you can do all kinds of  things with.  Those are  just a few examples.The game is freaking huge...not sure if it ever ends tbh...so many sectors in a system, systems  in a galaxy, galaxies in π and you have 42 (Gorilla math was used).The exploration is like a box of chocolates.  You could find a random shop to buy and sell  things, you could find a pirate station with turrets and ships attacking you, or asteroids, and I even hear you can find  a city but I've yet to find one.  There's planets and asteroids to mine, stations to build,  ships of every kind to make.  There's cloaking, radar jamming, scanning, jump drive (warping / long distance travel), push / pull weapons (tractor beam anyone?), drainers of all types, cannons, missiles, you name it, they probably have it.You can save your ship designs locally and on servers (multiplayer) and load them onto  another server using blueprints.  Think template that you fill with all the components and when the blueprint has all the parts it  needs you can spawn it.  You can build bases and outposts, or repair undiscovered /  unclaimed stations and  claim them as your own  / build on it.  There's factions (corps  / guilds) and every faction gets to claim 1 home base which is invincible to damage unless  they run  out of faction points (hard to do unless you claim alot of systems or die alot), Very customizable server settings so each multiplayer server you play on is probably different from every other.  You can customize your singleplayer server.cfg as well if you so choose.The cons:This is more on the servers you play on but when there's alot of people it tends to lag / warp.  (It's Alpha).  The initial RAM settings for the game is 1024  which  is really low.  If you are on a  64 bit OS you will want to download the 64 bit Java and change the RAM settings.  You can do this by going to the menu in the launcher > Options > Memory settingsI have 16GB RAM so I changed mine to 8192 1000 1000  and I stopped getting running out of memory errors  in game.  You will also most likely want to disable procedural background if you get alot of lag...caused me several seconds delay getting out of my ships in high pop servers.  All these options can be changed in the launcher, there's also advanced settings in  the launcher.All in all, this is a very fun game I would highly recommend it and I would buy it again.  I figured sooner or later there wont be a free demo and the price will most likely go up so why not support the devs now and not have to worry about it later on.Get in a faction with people or with friends as this amplifies the fun factor 10 fold.11/10 would buy again.

								My favorite part of Minecraft was being able to build complex redstone creations to automate all sorts of things. If that's what you liked most about it, then this game is definitely for you. You can set up factories to automatically refine what you collect into pretty much any block in the game. The stack sizes are huge and you can expand the storage space of a ""chest"" as large as you'd like. So if you were into collecting large amounts of stuff in Minecraft, then you'll appreciate how much easier it is to manage here.The best thing about this game to me is the design/blueprint system. When you have a shipyard, you can create a design using creative mode, and then it'll tell you what blocks you need to construct it. You can save off that design to a blueprint and import it to another server or single player game. It's like having WorldEdit built into the normal course of the game.Pros:* One of, if not the best, building systems I've ever seen.* Ability to create huge ships and stations.* Lots of potential for automation.* The ability to save/import blueprints.* Good assortment of blocks to work with.Cons:* High learning curve.* Wikis are sparse, meaning you have to hunt through youtube videos to figure stuff out.* Pirates are devastating for new players. I had to cheat (ie. use creative) to get that first decent ship built. If I hadn't I would have given up on it. Could probably do it now without cheating, but it would take too long.* Some of the controls are inconsistent. Like shift slows you down, unless you're in build mode, then it speeds you up. Sometimes you use Q to go up, other times space.* Ran into a few issues getting it to run on Linux. Almost gave up (glad I didn't).Before this game, I was playing a lot of Elite Dangerous on a Vive. Better graphics and virtual reality were not enough to keep me entertained like StarMade has so far. I wish it were a little more popular, but it has enough for me to play for years, just as it is now. If you can make do without a large multiplayer community (I play SP), and you like building, then I highly recommend it.			"

								Starmade, the game that killed my social life.10/10 It's ok(The demo is the full game until the beta comes out)But if you want a full review...Don't let my playtime deceive you, i have well over 1000 hours of pre steam play time.Starmade is a infinite 3D sandbox set in space with an infinite number of planets, stations, asteroids, stars, galaxies and pirates.You start off with enough blocks to build a small salvager and set off into space. (Well you can also make a nice big gun and attack other players) Then you need to mine asteroids and pretty much anything you find and upgrade your ship. May seem easy but its hard as hell. Pirates will be a constant threat. Teaming up is very important if you don't want your new shiny ship to be blown to the next universe by pirates.I could go on about how to play but wheres the fun if you already know everything?Just remember this game is in Early access and its going to change. Better or worse? no one knows. But with the current developers this game is going to go far.=Here is a little story about when i first met the dev=Turned starmade on one day. first time in a few weeks. There was a new update message talking about the offical testing server and the new improvments in the prebuild (dev build)I download the prebuild, join the server, fly into space, and get stuck. on nothing. my controls just didn't respond. about 5 minutes of laughing away in chat and others trying to help (only to glitch backwards, there was a horrible teleporting bug back then) Schema (the dev) joined the game.so i then asked him for help. He teleported in to see what was wrong and after a bit of silence ""im stuck aswell..."" Minutes later he said he found the bug and updated the prebuild.And that is the story of how i broke his game and caused one of the first (I think it may have been the first) updates since the test server went up			"

								Starmade is a crossover between Minecraft and Eve Online, although only on a very basic level. I'm not a big fan of both of these 2 games, but Starmade is just right.Whereas Minecraft mostly focuses on construction and survival, Starmade focuses on exploration and expansion. You are thrust into a huge world, and can do anything. You can build your own ships and starbases, land on planets and search for resources, mine asteroids and fight pirates. Much like Minecraft, Starmade is very focused on construction as well, but in a much more practical way. Upgrading your ship is something you continiously strife to do, and getting the resources required is a job needs doing. Building a ship might seem complicated at first, but a decen tutorial is added in the game, which will guide you through the basics.In short, this is my experience of Starmade thus far, and im eager to go on and grow. And best of all: It is free. Try the demo (i bought it) and get access to everything Starmade's got to offer. Whether you'll like the game or not: Not a penny has been wasted. I can really give no reason for you not to try.			"

								This game is good for anyone who likes a simple but expansive type of game. while the only complaint I can make is that the tutorial tends to lag a lot, the game makes up for it with its enless content and detatched and lonly vibe. Starmade starts off by dropping you into a sector with a shop, some money, and very limited resources for building a ship. While building a ship is fun, resources for a new ship are needed if your going off to fight pirates or raid a friend's base. The game essentially forces you into the depths of space, where you only have your crew. Starmade is a game that lets you mold it into what you want it to be, and I highly reccomend buying it.			"

								If you want Minecraft in space this is your game. It has thousands of block planets randomly generated in many block galaxies you can fly around in your block ship. You can also build stations or directly on the planets themselves if you would prefer to get into base building instead of ship building. I had a lot of fun making my own mini starport on my first playthrough and launching into space.In multiplayer it has a faction system for claiming home bases and planets, you can build ship interiors and invite friends to fly around with you. Or you can sacrifice interiors to fill your ship with more modules to make them more powerful. Compared to games like Space Engineers its much more fast paced, you can mine enough materials and build huge ships pretty fast in a creative mode like editor.And the game is free with no restrictions if you want to try it before you buy it like I did, I was happy enough with it to want to support it and buy the full version which is no different from the demo version at the time I am writing this review. I have to give the developers a lot of respect for doing that, such a bold move.			"

								Just look at my hours. I only got this a few months ago. With new texture upgrade, weapons calibrations, and the introduction of fleet controls, this game has so much to work with! This is ideal for people who want to eventually create their own kind of EVE in Lego world. Players are relatively friendly and very helpful which helps everyone grow quickly and make fun RP scenarios spanning galaxies. Spurring alliances and rivalries between factions, and it's all done by you! CONSThe usual, it's early access, so updates to gameplay are still significant but there are plenty of very good youtube tutorials by the game's top builders/players. Also, servers can get janky, but that's probably just my bad luck too. I'm sure with new updates they will streamline the issues with mechanics that cause occasional lag. Good thing is!The devs are super committed to fixing problems asap and working on this game more and more. The starnadedock websidte is a fantastic community and the admins constantly respond to queries with hyper-speed! I never pay full price for a game, especially early access, but i saw the potential and i needed this badly, so I went for it, and I don't regret it one bit.			"

The community has been waiting over a month since the last update for bug fixes that are killing gameplay.While indeed the game is fun it is not particularly stable. Servers are a whole other story entirely. Server support seems minimal or just poorly done, either or. This game is only fun with other people, there is no real single benefit apart from unlimited blocks, but even then that kind of kills the point in my opinion. I would stay away from Single player and join a multiplayer server but that obviously brings you to encounter the above.What devs dont seem to realise nowadays is people would prefer a stable game over faster released additional content. People are ditching this game for purely this reason. Its like trying to put together a new desk while standing on your head..overall you're creating more problems for yourself in the long run.When it comes down to it I paid the money for this game so i'm going to stick with and hope for the best. I do enjoy the game and have played a lot of hours but everything above causes so much frustration. I do of course understand this game is still in Alpha but if given the choice im not sure I would purchase this again. Summary ~ Great concept, shoddy execution.			"

								An excellent voxel-based space exploration, trading, combat, build, anything-you-can-think-of simulator. A great game for those of you who play EVE Online or the X series of games. The devs are great, and have been constantly packing this game with tons of great content. Have played it since it was first release on their website, and it keeps getting better! Absolutely reccommended!			"

								Starmade is a wonderfully looking vowel game where you're stuck near a shop in distant space needling to create a ship and persue you future. You can be a miner and refine materials, you could be a fighter and salvage enemy ships, or you could just buy things with the credits you have. And if you prefer a non survival approach you can use the cheats to get infinite blocks and build whatever you can imagine! There is no limit.I've had a really good time on this game, singlplayer and multiplayer. But try the demo first.:D			"

								I spent the last few hours floating around space in a metal rectangle harvesting ore and crystal with no idea what their for, and the insane thing about it is I'm actualy haveing fun doing it. Haven't even goten to the actual crafting part and already the game has me hooked and its almost zen like in its simplicty, well until I flew into a star. Woopsy! Oh and look out for space pirates too, those guys do not mess around! Its basicaly Minecraft IN SPACE! But rather then a simple copy-paste job StarMade actualy improves on the formula in a lot of intresting ways. I like how basic crafting tools are built into the inventory itself so your good to go right from the start and its a lot more forgiveing as you don't have to hide in a hole the second it gets dark. Most the people I've encountered in Mutiplayer and on the forms have been nothing but firendly too. Its a fun game but be prepared to earn your greatness, the ship of your dreams wont build itself but hours of gathering and crafting make it all the sweeter when you finaly take out that Space pirate base with a custom-built weapon system.

								Alright, so you're sitting there thinking; 10$ is it really worth it? Yes. It is absolutely worth it, and if you wont take my word for it, go to the Star-Made site and download the Alpha for free. I've been playing this game for quite some time and I can say with certainty that it's only getting better from here. Of course your experience may vary because of single player or multiplayer but either way the amount of fun you can have is limited by your imagination.  (For those reviews complaining about lags, poor performance, etc. Settings are something you can adjust so the game runs smoothly...)			"

								I cant understand the negative voting for StarMade. In the beginning I wasnt sure wheter it's cool or not, but when i started, I was completly hooked. Get some friends to play with u, open a faction, build ur ships and stations and fight against other factions. How could it be better? :PA positive aspect is, that the developers work a lot with ideas and wishes of the StarMade community. I played this game now for some time and I guess I can say that it DOES make sense to buy this game in order to help the developers! U might think that Early Access is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but srsly guys, this game is better than some AAA-Games (at least in my opinion).And now I wanna tell u something very important for me. THIS IS NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MINECRAFT!Yes, there are blocks.. But there are also Wedges Corners and all taht kinda stuff here, alltough thats not the point! I just wanna tell u smth, I like a lot. If u fly away from Spawn, like 6 systems or smth like that, there wont be Shops. Okay, build a Station and play in that system for a while and BOOM there are shops... How that? Well, the Trading Guild (Some ""NPC"" Faction) built them. And thats not all, just an example. What I'm trying to tell u is: This game is freaking awesome and everyone saying it's a bad ""Minecraft Clone"" just doesn't want to see it.			"

								This is an excellent game if you like space, exploring, trading, fighting, building.It's a voxel style game(Minecraft) so you can build you're spaceships/spacestation/bases however you like.  There are loads of blocks to choose from and includes a build helper for shapes and symmetry and multi place options.The flight mechanics are good,  Astronaught flight can be clumsy at times, but not bad.  Camera options are mostly good but need more added to them.I'm completely addicted to the game right now.   The few downsides i've noted are already being worked on.  The gui is a bit dated but will be changed for next patch.  I think the map view could use some work as well.I %100 Reccommend this title.			"

This game has an exelent combat and resource system allthough do not get scared away by the somewhat difficult learning curve. Pros-Many diffrent weapons and ways to combine them-I think 8 kinds of effects that the weapons can have-A fair and not too hard to learn mining and resource system-Factions-Faction permissions and ranks-Lots of diffrent servers -A inmersive and logical galaxy systemCons-even if 3 smaller ships have the same mass as a larger ship the larger ship will be more powerfule due to the system: there is a buff for the more weapon blocks you have-Planets are a bit unstable.Overall: 10/10 This game really does what no other game does and there are many diffrent ways to play(pvp, miner, trader, rp ect ect).

								The good:- A tutorial - as in there actually is one and it's moderately useful- Various texture packs built in to the client so it looks less Minecraft-like- You can build *massive* ships and there is a decent selection of utlity modulesThe middling:- OK build tools - far better than Minecraft, maybe worse than Space Engineers- The star systems are basically all the same - pick any one and you can find every resources you need, no reason to explore- There are NPC enemies, and they will pester you, but don't expect to be challenged by cleverness.  Tenacity perhaps...The bad:- The crafting interface.  Yes it has a filter to search, but no categorization.  Browsing a small list is painful.- The UI elements.  Ok, this is early access, some of it is likely developer art.  Recommend these guys go look at Space Engineers for a better example of UI.- The flight model.  Flight games *scream* for a joystick and rudder system - this system only supports one controller at a time so unless your stick does everything, it comes out to be much less useful.  Using a keyboard and mouse to fly anywhere near a planet is basically an exercise in frustration - get a gamepad at the minimum for when you step inside a ship.This game is like Minecraft in space, but without so much grinding trying to find resources (they are in fact very easy to get once you build a salvage ship - you will spend more time waiting for the resources to process than actually acquiring them.)  If you like *building* things, you will enjoy this game.  If you like *fighting* things, your enjoyment will probably be short-lived.  If you like *exploring*, you're enjoyment will also be short-lived.But it's still Early Access, so give it some time.  It will no doubt improve (just see how far Space Engineers has come along.)			"

								To be honest, I didn't think this game was going to be any good, but I bought it anyway. Once I had downloaded it and got into the game, I tried the tutorial and got bored so quickly that I exited the game within an hour. Then, a few of my friends got the game, and I can honestly say, I haven't had so much fun playing a game in a long time. StarMade is so unique and so brilliant. After trying to find out how to build stuff and harvest ores off of a planet, I started really enjoying this game. I would write so much more about this, but I want to get back to playing the game.I recommend this game to your Steam Library, it's so fun with friends!			"

								I've been a player since pre alpha, the game has an awesome UI. The ship building is fairly simple to get started. The game shows you how to make a basic space clunker, and how to mine the environment, and you will find it is easy to get moving.The problem lies in how spread out some of these planets and resources are, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.The second main issue is the clunky launcher and massive memory/fps issues. I have a very respectable gaming setup, and I am always crashing, you need to have 64 bit java, and the correct memory values input into the game launcher, the one before you actually start the game. Why the game has essentially two launchers is ridiculous. The game online suffers from the same problem Minecraft does online, you have to hike 50000000000 miles/galaxies away to get started because everything is claimed or you will get ganked. So if you are looking for a fun space sandbox, look elsewhere. If you are looking for Minecraft in space, look elsewhere.I cannot recommend this game at this time.Edit: ""At this time"" Meaning I am AWARE its not at release yet.			"

								It's a good game, played it before when it was just two devs working on this game. And the development on this game has greatly changed and graphic did get better. Have lots of great memories with friends in this game.

								not sure if i've played enough to judge itReal review:This game is not the most realistic game, of course. It has some imperfections (fix descriptions pls) but for me, this game is marvelous. It may not be realistic like Kerbal, but it sure is as fun. Things I can't do in Kerbal can be done here more creatively! Also, guns in space! Who does not want that?However, on the other hand, jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ the controls. I know you can edit them, but the default controls are just what the ♥♥♥♥.			"

								Ahhhhhh, Starmade. Where to start?First off, I have had this game for a long time, I only recently linked it to my steam account, Don't give me any of that""You've only played one and a half hours"" Also, Just because a game is in early access/ beta doesn't make it exempt from critisism. The Good:-Looks fabulous for a block based game. Shadows, bloom, all of it is great and I love it.-Intresting in a way that not many othe games can pull off. This means it is stable, works, and has good content.-Frequent updates. This game gets new content often, and I genuinly beleive the people at schine are working hard.-Building is fun. In some games, building is a chore. You can be delighted as ideas fly through your head, and possibly your left foot, such ""Should I put escape pods?"" or ""Should I put a turret here?"" and so much more.Now, the bad:-It gets boring, theres nothing to convince you to build, and after a while, you just get sick of it. What this game needs is a story that gently prods you in the right direction, like  the one in the game Rodina. The proceduraly generated worlds dont have much variety.-Multiplayer is a cut-throat tedious, and rage inducing experience. You can be a newbie in a server and be killed instantly, or be a pro and griefed to extinction.-The community is dieing. Servers used to be full of people, hundreds, but today you'll be luckyto find 30.-It's going to take you  a long time to be able to build the stuff in the screenshots.In conclusion:This game is a great concept that hasn't really been driven in the right direction. Some updates and a story would make this game my favorite ever easily. Back to Star Trek Online for now.			"

								Probably one of my best game purchases ever. I played it for several hundred hours before finally buying it, and still play it at least 10 hours a week, usually in one session.The best thing I can say for the game is that I keep forgetting it's early access. It's an amazing game already, and so much is coming still. I think it will eventually fill the promises it made, as well as all the failed ones that most, if not all, space sci-fi games made.Pros:-Ships are super-fun to design and build, and ship building is quite in-depth.-Multiplayer is unbelievably smooth, even with hundreds of ships, small or large, all fighting. That said, your client might need the settings turned down if the ships are big enough. Some people (myself inluded) build ships larger than planets.-The universe feels alive. They've redone the map, and it is glorious. We have blackholes (wormholes) now too, and a wide variaty of stations, planets and astroids now.-Despite the above, it manages to highlight how big and empty space really is, which is something i enjoy.-Docking is quite impressive and flexible, allowing for really cool effects to ships (Such as moving parts).-THE DEVS LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY-Beautiful Graphics (if you like cube games)-So many awesome features, Im not going to even attempt to list them-Excelent Configurability-Good Community-Good mod support (never tested this, but I've heard no complaints about it)-Procedurally generated, and absolutly HUGE.-Probably forgot lots-Most importantly: The game is always improving, very quickly too. The devs push large quantities of bugfixes and updates every 2 weeks. It's similer to Space Engineers in that respect. Does not feel like an alpha game, really.Cons:-They're missing the inverse-corner shape D: I should get around to suggesting this. But I'm too busy playing the game.-AI still needs work, though it's getting better-Factions need work as well, though that's coming in a future update-Very large systems cause non-negligable client lag (negligable server lag though) (I mean multi-thousand block doors, etc)-Very large ships cause some lag (500x300x300 m3 + on my craptop, but easily 10 - 1000+ times that for good laptops. Virtually unlimited for a solid desktop.)-Alpha game. Lots of balance changes, content changes, etc.-Tutorial needs a lot of work - it's outdated. Again. Mostly because of the update frequency.Very addictive game, good if you like designing spaceships, or space combat. The game also fully supports mining, trading, etc, however, I stick to ship building, because that's my favorite part. This means I can't speak for those systems, but I've heard they're good.If you want a good example of the game currently, get the demo - it's the full game, and it will be, until the game leaves Alpha. If you want a good idea of where the game is headed, and how it's changed/is changing, check the website, and look at the ""news"" tab.For some of the best reviews about why I (and many others) like the game, read the funny reviews tab.Edit: Forgot to mention the learning curve. I joined back when the tutorial, buggy as it was, was plenty. At the moment, however, the game has become so complicated that I'd recommend starting in MP and asking a player to teach you, or watching a youtube video.			"

								I full heartedly support this game. I've been playing it since learning about it, about .4x release or so, back on Minecraft when i asked a few of my buddies about any other games like it. And by far this game TRUMPS Minecraft when it comes to sheer size, exploration and sense of seclusion.The game itself is a massive sandbox for those wondering about it. It allows you to build practically *anything* from houses,  hovercraft and mining vessels, to fighters, gigantic mining stations and factories! The game itself requires a very good computer to run (a 400$ Acer like me, cannot handle the newer patches to the game for instance. I'll be able to play the game in February in earnest when i build my new gaming rig :) )This game also supports exporting projects from 3-dimensional tools like Blender as blueprints! which then can be implemented into the game and 'purchased' with in-game currency. This helps when you see a 3D model and think ""if only i could fly it"" ;) Combat is heavily based upon your ability to protect your 'baby' (your ship or creation) and it gives you a VERY wide variation in weapons and protection possibility! From mobile sentries to stationary defense platforms you can protect worlds, sectors or even entire quadrants! The game is literally stagnated only by YOUR creativity. YOU control the fun. YOU control the environment for the most part. And as the game says in the description, it is YOUR universe.Personal experience with the game: I first started up on a mini-server called Illusive with 4 buddies of mine. we made a faction called ""The Fringe"". We hung around the spawn for a couple days, learned how to build basic ships and began an adventure out into the void which lead us nearly a THOUSAND sectors away! it took us nearly an hour to reach our base... what started out as a derilect NPC shop out of supplies. We branched off, made 7 massive combat vessels over the course of 2 months and made 6 sentries capable of holding off the average A.I pirate (special made ships which turned out to become more aggressive over the years.) Our three flag ships....The Leviathan: a massive Dreadnaut carrier (blender model i made) designed to carry 120 small fighters with 2 lasers. With 1k engines and a little over a million shield the beast didn't move fast.. but it could take a beating.  Leviathan picture[thesurviver.deviantart.com]The Liberty: A smaller ship, designed to be made in bulk as carriers, support vessels, combat cruisers. These were going to become the backbone of an A.I based defense fleet of about 15 ships. Lead by my buddie's ""Shadow"" Liberty shown here.  Shadow Liberty[thesurviver.deviantart.com]The Behemoth: A project i was working on for nearly 2 months and ended up halting because the size was killing my frame rate (at least until next month ;) ) And at nearly 18million it was not going to be something i could simply spawn in. With that in mind i made this beast a floating battlestation. With 6 guns capable of a mind-boggling 1mil damage output per second, a shield of nearly 100million and a battery chamber that engulfed the inner body of the ship, it wouldn't be going down without a fight Unfortunately my computer couldn't run ascreenshot without crashing the game once i got the second 3 barrel cannon on the ship, so here it is in the prototype stages Behemoth wrapup part 1[thesurviver.deviantart.com] after the first month this is what had been made.... Another ship, which i unfortunately do not have a picture of, is an even BIGGER ship that a member of the Fringe we picked up later had built. It held 18 turrets on either side, with a gun that lined the middle of the dual hull ship with a damage output that made my ships sound like a laughing stock. He spent 7 months building it up. The ship was called the Keldon. I have a partially damaged blueprint of the ship personally saved and will hopefully be able to repair it. However sitting at a whopping 128million to spawn it? i'll be working on it in singleplayer. lol			"

The game is stable for the most part; it's only crashed on me once. I used to play a whole lot of Minecraft, and I might even say that I like this game better because there's more interaction with the blocks. You can build a ship and have it actually move!			"

								This game caught my eyes while I was browsing games to buy in the steam shop.  I saw the trailer and I bought it right after that.I have probably spent 95% of my playing experience in singleplayer.  I didn't have any help from real players so this review will be in that perspectiveFirst, I'll go with the cons.  You can get pretty lost in the launcher for the game.  Also, if you don't set your memory to a good level and don't set the graphics to a level your computer can handle, you might not even be able to run the game at a good speed (or at all).  There is also a bit of a learning curve to the game.  For the first few days you play, you will probably spend just as much time playing the game as you will watching youtube videos trying to figure out how to make things work properly.  As for the youtube videos, a lot of them are a bit outdated, and finding a recent video can be difficult.  There's also not a lot of content when it comes to singleplayer, but that's because this game was built more for the multiplayer experience.  Although there are many planets and systems, they are very similar to each other so the only thing that makes you explore is having to move to the next system to find more resources.  For where the game is at, I think the build mode is pretty great, but it could use some tweaks to make it faster and easier.  For example, I find it a bit tedious to have to go into 'advanced edit' and having to press an arrow 5-10 times and look at a tiny picture of the selected piece, trying to find the right orientation of the block you're trying to place everytime I switch to a different part of a ship.  And I find that most of the time, I get the wrong orientation because in some lightings it's very difficult to tell which direction the block is facing in the tiny picture if it's all one color.  I think a system where you could click and hold the mouse button then move your mouse in different directions to change the orientation would make building 1000% easier (maybe they already have an easier way and I don't know about it).  That's all I really have for cons.For the pros, this game is just amazing.  If the thought of building your own ship and scavanging the galaxy for resources excites you, this is the game for you.  If you want to build a ship with a ridiculous amount of salvage modules so you can mine to the core of a planet in the click of a button, you can do that.  If you want to build extravagant space stations where you can store all your ships, you can do that.  If you want to kill pirates and plunder their stations, you can do that.  All this I'm explaining is still only scratching the surface.  Once you get into multiplayer, there are factions you can join and wars you can fight.  This game is so fun and is only going to get better with every update.			"

								Ok, after I fixed the game thanks to the superb support staff at Starmade, I must say I am exited for my future endeavours in this huge universe. If you are having the player drifting problem, follow these steps.unfortunately it looks like your installation is broken.The best and easiest way to fix it, is to create a new folder and start with a fresh automatic installation of starmade.To do this,browse to your hard-disk (C:) and create a new folder.I suggest using the path:C:\Starmadehowever, any path not in a protected area from windows will work. ('Programs', 'Desktop', 'Download' and 'My Files' are places that can cause problems. Antivirus scanners block access or scan every file-access and slow down your game without a good reason.)Now place a fresh downloaded launcher from the official download pagehttp://star-made.org/downloadin that folder and start it.Now select the correct path in the Launcher:enter the correct path into the opening dialog:Hit OK andlet it install the latest version by clicking on:in the Launcher.Your starmade should work now.If not please add log from that installation.Open:C:\Starmade\StarMade\logsand send in all files you see in that folder.We will check for the source of the problems then.(Yes it may sound like a fraud, but this is the only way we have a reliable log, where we have a good knowledge about the load orders and events happening.)- Andy Püttmann^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This guy rocks			"

								Do you like 4x RTS games? Well this is essentially a 4x RTS played from the perspective of a single minecraft astronaut.When you get past the ship creation and crazy engineering aspects of this game, it feels like an MMO 4x RTS where you build an empire (faction) and claim entire solar systems for resources.This game is insanely good if you can get over the minecraft graphics and bugs and experience the game for what it is, a crazy genre bender of MMO/voxel sandbox/Space Sim/4x RTS.I HIGHLY recommend this game to anybody who is even remotely interested in building ships/space stations, open world corpse looting hardcore PvP or space RP.

								This game is amazing! The graphics can be as good as you choose, so you can run it on almost any computer. It works amazingly well, no matter what you want to do.This game has too many features for me to explain in one review, but I can definitely say it's way better than any game like minecraft, or terraria. The only ideas it shares with those are using blocks, mining, and being a sandbox, and they doesn't just copy it, they make it their own way.There are shops where you can buy whatever you want, and a shop acts like a real shop does, having it's own money to buy your stuff, and having limited stock.But there are more ways to get stuff than just buy them. Some things you can mine, some things you can make with the things you mined and some can be found from the loot of destroyed ships.I admit, they still have features to work on, glitches to remove and inconveniances to fix, but I definitely reccomend getting the game. They fix glitches you report insanely fast, they consider all suggestions, and they just make a great game. 10/10			"

								If you love minecraft this is pretty much the next step.  Still needs alot of work but the devs are keeping up with updates and what there working on.  But if youve always wanted to build your own space craft and fly arcoss the galaxy this is it.  Construction consists of more than your basic square block, theres several tetra shapes and wedges to give a craft or object a more round apearence.  Collecting blocks (mining) is very easy and quick depending on how you do it.  Lots of cool stuff to play with like missiles, sheilds, automatic turrets and AI's.  Graphics arent quite there yet.  Lowest setting some blocks have more detail than they do on the highest setting but it should get fixed(i would think). But ive had alot of fun just playing in single player but it can get boring by yourself.  But thats why theres multiplayer.  Overall its a really good sandbox for the stage its in.  If it follows the minecraft dev line there will always be new content and fun stuff being added and worked on.  Well worth the cheap price!			"

								This is so close to being an absolutely amazing game. Currently, without a more complex/dynamic NPC faction system, my biggest problem is that there isn't enough to do in single player. I don't have a ton of time to invest in playing on servers, so I think that solves that problem, just not for me. Another problem I have is that there are a TON of systems and mechanics to learn, and perhaps they're not the most intuitive. I haven't played in months, but the crafting system was a bit confusing for me back then, and more stuff has come in since then.Now, done with the negatives...This is a great game. Open world? Not good enough, try open space. The building system is fantastic, and you should check out some of the ships and stations people have made- they're absolutely stunning, nothing short of spectacular. The combat mechanics are fun and exciting, and there's a lot of room for ships of different combat and non-combat roles.I can only say GET THIS GAME. It's a ton of fun, and the progress made over the past year is phenomenal. The devs are doing a great job and like I said- this game is just a couple features and improvements away from being something truly special.			"

								Any game where you can build actual working ships is a huge draw for me.  I'm saddened that I didn't discover this game sooner.  After being burned by another game I would rather not mention this game may be what I've always wanted.  Space mining, watching your back for hostiles, and lots of space exploration.  Complete with the ability to build customized ships and with a multiplayer environment even.  :)			"

								I've only played a little over 8 hours so far and I'm simply floored by how cool this game is. The game's Minecraft like take on spaceflight and spaceship/station building is simply fantastic. While my current ship building ability is akin to a 3 year old drawing on the wall with crayons, I'm simply in love with the full gamut of things available to build with. Looking on Youtube you can find users who've built fleets of Titan class ships that look absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully showcase what this game can let you build.The first ship I built was simply a small cube. It was hideous, but after a run in with a pirate station (which chased me for a fairly long ways) I had to rebuild. I landed on a planet and mined the only thing I could see: lava. I wondered what I could do with lava and found out that while it's useless for crafting, it makes a seriously bright ship. So I built a ship out of lava. After watching some videos on youtube I realized that I'd just wasted a significant amount of time doing nothing, and I built a better ship purely for mining. It's ugly as sin, but it can demolish an asteroid in about 2 minutes, so I'm happy with it for the time being. After I mine a bit more I'm going to dive into crafting, then I'll make a really big ship. (Currently mine doesn't have an inside) I'm also hoping that (since I know how to use Photoshop) I can possibly contribute to some of the texture packs on http://starmadedock.net So far I haven't recommended any game to my friends as much as I have this one. I already bought the 4 license pack and hope the developers keep on chugging away on this, it has so much potential.			"

								Hi everyoneI was bored and in search of a new game and i came across this diamond.When i frist started the game i didnt know what to do, but it was not too difficult to get into the game.Mastering was a bit more diffucult. First i had a server running on my comp with 2 of my friends. It worked really well with an good i7. Then we had a dedicated server.It was great fun to climb the learning curve from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ship to planetary harvester and doomstar which can kill a planet with one shot. My gaming time was before buying the game -> just 11 hrs. Now we dont play much because so much new stuff is added  (which is very good) and we want to wait a little bit. I thought about cons alot. i hatet the non newton flight model (->i like it when things are floating through space forever) but now we have it in here as well and i love it.So it is pretty hard judge before the game is not finished.My conlusion -> Play the whole game for free (DEMO). You can not do wrong. And dont let you scare off in first 5min.You will miss a lot of fun.			"

								+400 hrs minecraft+150 hrs empyrion+30 hrs space engeneerhi this is more a WARNING than a review , this game has a lot of potential but, in it's state it is very incomplete, unpolished and with a very steep learning curve. Try the demo to get an idea for yourself. i hear they are working on the game but i have notice they are puting more new stuff in the game than polishing it. Effectively scaring potential new player from the game. I have no problem with caring for existing player but without attracting and keeping new players this game will remain an unfinished product played by ship builders no offence intended. And to finish this review THANK GOD i'm ok in computer trouble-shooting this game is not user-friendly to start or debug, good luck with that. hummm. great potential i tell you so i'll check back in a while you never know.Todo list:A very intuitive tutorial.A very easy level for new or extreme casual player.A few  limited blueprint to start the game.A factory guide ingame.A way to tweak the world you play in.

								The only thing that'll turn most people off is the fact that this isn't really a pick-up and go type of game that people with an attention span of a gold fish are so used to these days..   You really have to sit down and figure out what kind of ship are you going to make, and that is where the real fun of the game begins.    I made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ transport-looking shuttle that I use for construction and stuff, and even added a door on the side so i can get out and come back inside, and even placed lights inside the ship so i can see where I'm walking to go sit at the cockpit and fly the thing.   Once you figure things out from the tutorial menu, things will begin to make sense.   The Menu UI is cluttered, but at the same time helpful once you look past it.   Best feature of this game so far?  You can start a single player mode right away and mess around with the game and learn how to play it before going online and even importing your saved ship in a blueprint file so you won't have to waste time building before getting blasted by other players, something like that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Rust"" doesn't do!Some online servers are ""PvP"" so, it's a good idea to save your blue prints and gather the materials you need to make your ship right off the bat so you're not empty handed.Think of minecraft and star citizen mixed in together.   Do whatever you want.  explore derelect ships, mine resources, fight people.  I heard the universe is very expansive, so there's that too.   Oh and if you want to build the millenium falcon, it can happen as long as you have enough resources.			"

								Very good sandbox game i watch over the years. Build Your ship, stations, bases with blocks. Very nice customization of weapon types. Ability to build automation stuff with logic blocks and rails. Understimated game because it looks like minecraft in space with better shaders. Game still under developement but every patch is big enough. Constant update of mechanics/content/graphics etc. Only disadvantage i found imho are ""planets"" - too small, too strange, not realistic. Overall large potential. Extreme advantage is that you can build even Deathstar in 1:1 scale (if you have enough motivation and time ;) ) Also frequent big updates.I recommend this game.			"

								StarMade is ruining my life but that is okay :P played about 80h so far (in about 5 days cause the game doesn´t let me sleep very much) and finally start to understand the basics...this game is extremely difficult to start with....the tutorial is almost a 5 min videotalk followed by you being lost in space with a shipcore and a couple of credits. There are some good tutorials on youtoube though which you will need cause some things are too techy to work out yourself without being a bloody electrical engineer or something^^The design options are infinite and with the logic modules etc you can (in theory) build semi automated fleets. However, you better be prepared to spend 5h on making your first logic circuit work....or 15h on designing a turret to dock to your ship...or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of hours to design a rail docking system for your mining drones.One real hint to take away: Create blueprints of your beloved ships to be able to rebuild cause pirates turn out to be rather strong and can easily rip your ship apart with a few shots.Back to building my carrier...over and out ;)			"

								Originally StarMade had wonderful promise as a spaceship building and survival game. A comparison to Minecraft in space could have been made, but honestly, StarMade had surpassed in regards to building. Being able to build a salvaging ship and compacting it into your cargo bay was pretty awesome. So was being able to co-op an entire side of the planet and turning it into a mobile base of operations.But the game felt clunky. Little explanation, if any, on how to get started. Survival aspect never was really fleshed out, though a lot of cool progress was made in that direction, but has now seemingly been abandoned in the interest of turning the game into a RTS. Which might be cool in a Unity system, but due to the engine being built on Java makes no sense. Both the community and developers have also seemingly turned hostile against any criticism, which is disappointing.  "

								Theres no content and very many preformance issues. Devs keep saying they will add content and things to do after theyve built a solid base but its been 4 years now and this game is still a laggy bug filled mess. Absolutley not worth $20 and the price is still going to incrementally increase. It has alot of potential and I feel bad leaving a bad review because I know the devs are passionate and work hard with the limited resources they have but the game still suffers. Planets dont ever fully load, weapon graphics bug out and I can only se them half the time, theres no survival aspect: no hunger/sleep/enemies to fight other than generic pirates. Basicaly the biggest problem with this game is that there is no reason to get out of your ship core EVER. Also there are so many game mechanics which are not explained in game or at all. You have to resort to youtube tutorials made by gamers who dont always explain things right. If you havent been following this game from day 1 you wont know what any of the blocks do at all. Like how is a new player supposed to make a basic salvage ship without resorting to online tutorials? Theres no information at ALL for the game functions. Not an exaggeration. I still play this game though because hopefully one day it wil get better.			"

								Don't be fooled by my playtime as I usually play without using steam.Pros:* Excellent ship building. This game probably outshines many other games when it comes to building. It has many tools to make building a lot faster and easier* Multi-player. Even though it can lag in larger ship battles, starmade probably provides the best multi-player experience of all space building games out there. It's especially fun to build and explore with friends on a server. It also provides to ability to run dedicated server for both linux and windows.* Scale. No other game provides this kind of scale. The biggest ships in other games wouldn't even be considered medium sized ships in this games. There are also some extremely beautiful ships made my the community from all kinds of franchises * Great weapon system. Weapons can be combined and used in a lot of different ways. It's very fun to play around with it. It's however a bit imbalanced at the moment for PvP, but that is to be expected of a game in alpha* Logic Systems and Rails. This feature is one of the best. You can virtually build anything. The rail system allows for complex doors, elevators, and countless other mechanisms. The logic systems lets you control you build things from simple light switches to password protected doors to even crazier stuff like space monopoly.* Fleets. Although a bit buggy at the moment, the fleet system allows you to bring your own carriers into battle.* NPCs. The new update provided lots of gameplay for single and multi-player and finally made the universe feel a lot more aliveCons:* The game is still in alpha and that shows at several points in the game. Some features need polishing or more work and there are some bugs. However the devs have announced they will address these issues.* Depending on your playstyle there is not much to do after a certain point in singleplayer. The NPC update did help with that, but there more is needed, and it has been announced that there will be more.* Some ex-community members are extremely petty. Some got banned for insults and trolling on the forums. They like to spread conspiracy theories on the devs, like this game becoming an RTS, even though the main dev explicitly said that is absolutely not true and the claim is pretty ridiculous to begin with. They also post bad reviews from their little group and delete any comments. Another guy keeps bumping his own negative review, also removing any discussion. Keep in mind that all these people got at least 500 hours of playtime on their accounts, which makes this all the more laughable. Some like to discredit java with their nonexistent knowledge of programming languages, which is easily debunked.EDIT: Since redalert is suggesting I'm not on the forum let me insure you, I've been there for a long time, but not with this username.

								I've only just purchased this game so my hours on the demo do not reflect here, but new non the less and my opinion should be taken with a ladel of salt.In one sentence; The integrity and feel of Minecraft's Tekkit mod in space with the galatical proportions and procedural generation of worlds and galaxies akin to Spore. Hard to sum this game up in one short sentence.This will take time to reach a point where you are comfortable with all the features in the game spanning the crafting side of things and most things just take time in single player because, well space has a lot of space.I'm playing on a Mac (eat me, idgaf) so I obviously ran into some errors while trying to play this game, like a buggy tutorial. I managed to over look that and educated myself through youtube on how this great gem works and found plenty of support there. (Yogcast has a series on this I hear, so that's worth checking it out if you like their previous works.)SO will take time due to high learning curve, great for voxel fans and great for space and sci-fi enthusiasts. I don't have the time for this game but It's nice. (If you're working a job with plenty hours, this game may frustrate you with the time base commitment needed to overcome the steep learning curve. Download the demo first, see what it's about and then consider supporting the team if you believe in this cause. I have a full time job, starting me off on a pretty disappointing and frustrating foot, but worth it later on.) "

Download the demo first, see what it's about and then consider supporting the team if you believe in this cause. I have a full time job, starting me off on a pretty disappointing and frustrating foot, but worth it later on.) "

								I played StarMade about 2 years back, and it was amazing, i thought it was kind of hard to get your head around, but i loved it. when i saw it was on steam,  I didnt even need to think about buying it, i just did. now with the basic tutorial you can understaned most basic things in starmade, even though you will need to find a bit by yourself, it is a great game in my opinion, but if they needed to improve something, it would be sound and interface, the interface at the lancher is kind of dull, and a soundless universe where there is no music to keep you up is kind of depressing, over all starmade is a great game, and for 10 dollars, its going ot be worth it, trust me9/10			"

								This game is awesome! You can fly around and sit in lounges with the key O and engage intergalactic wars or build your own super ship with any number of guns on it! You can even explore planets as well as go through warp gates.You can also steal other people's ships and take it for your self or scrap it. If you just want to build a massive ship with your buddies you can start a faction to keep people from using your ship. I would definitely recommend it highly! Amazing! 10/10!PS:  You will most likely need to increase the min. and max. memory in the StarMade launcher up in top left corner before you click start game because it is set to run on 512 mb you will probably need 1024 mb.

								This game has lego style blocks, starships, stars, warp drives and BLACK HOLES! That ^^^^ right there is enough for me to recommend this game. HOWEVER: Note that this game is still incomplete, and it shows. As much as I love what's going on here and the raw potential this game has, note that there's some issues, read: many issues, yet to be resolved. For example, Travel is unbelievably slow. You can easily change this by editing a text file (google ""How to increase Starmade speed limit""), but this is not something a noob like me would even know was possible, let alone standard. Also, the planets currently have no mobs that spawn, so apart from gathering resources here and there, selling them, building a ship, travelling about, and I suppose fighting pirates or joining a server, there isn't much to do. At least it feels that way after awhile. Other stuff needs to be added to make it more engaging. Also, I do not like the crafting system at all, and find that I have much more fun just using console commands to acquire items and building my own ship creative mode-style.But all-in-all, yes, I recommend this game. I'm having fun with it--just know that if you're the type who doesn't like building things.. this game is definitely something to reconsider.			"

								I love the possibilities with this game, and I recommend it to any sci-fy fan. There is a learning curve with this game, but I consider it a game worth learning.Some things you can do in StarMade...You can mix and match weapon systems and support systems for cool useful effects. You can save the ship you just built as a blueprint, build a ship yard, and have it make more ships. You can design functional turrets.  The logic system in the game is stunning, and with it you can make moving platforms, combine logic systems, and do other amazing things. You can explore massive galaxies, connect star systems by warp gates, raid pirate bases, mine asteroids or entire planets.There are many things I am still learning about this game, and some small details I want fixed, but I am loving StarMade as it is, and look forward to its continued development.

								Star made puts minecraft in space creating the perfect universe for a sci-fi lover to work in their own sandbox to creat what they want whenever they want. This game has so much content in it to work with and so many different logic systems to satisfy and creative electronic works (I'm looking at you redstone masters). There are many different kinds of weapons systems and blocks. You can visit space stations or one of the millions of planets and asteroids. You can play online and create your own faction with friends or join a random one and meet awesome new people. Now it says 27 hours on steam, but I have played this game since 2012 before it was on steam. I loved it then and I still love it now. You can treulry live in your very own universe.			"

								StarMade definitely has a lot of elemnts of ""Minecraft but in [blank]"" syndrome going on. It's true. However, it has enough complexity, unique block shapes, and sheer /content/ to make it very much stand on its own. This complexity, though, can also be a bit overwhelming, especially if you want to make a ship that ""does everything."" As of right now, it's not the best at explaining what a lot of blocks do, so you may find yourself on the wiki alot. Despite that, StarMade is still an excellent game. The visuals are pleasing, the mechanics are ultimately as complex as you want them to be, to a point. The sheer amount of ship customization is jaw-dropping, and allows for making truly unique, awesome ships that are tons of fun to use and play in. Like Minecraft, it doesn't particularly have a story, and so you find yourself making your own narrative, which is a bit of childish fun missing from a lot of games. Overall, StarMade is a fun game, and if you're willing to stick your head into the wiki a little, the potential it has is mind-boggling. It could use a bit more explanation on certain mechanics and blocks, but finding them out is often its own reward.			"

								This game is simply amazing, I find almost everything to be perfect in it, there are a couple of things I have to say though.Firstly the game needs more optimization I get loads of lag and my graphics card is top of the line and I have 16 Gigs of RAM secondly steam workshop support, in my honest opinion so many more people would pay attention to this game if it had workshop support. If you're planning to put workshop support in, just after it's come out of early access then that's fine . Thirdly, the map doesn't really work, again all this is my opinion, but the map is very confusing, I get that it's split up into sectors and that you can see stations and stuff, but, for me at least, it takes about 2-5 mins to select the sector that I want, however apart from these three things and maybe just adding stuff in the game is amazing.

								With the advent of the modern voxel adventure title, StarMade may slip past most gamers radar as just another Minecraftesque space themed pretender. Unfortunately for them, they're missing out on a gold mine of entertainment. I haven't been 'addicted' to a game for a long time now, and StarMade has definitely flipped the fun switch for me. If you're a fan of voxel games, it's definitely worth checking out, and if you're a fan of space exploration, you'd be an idiot not to. StarMade has many elements that make the game fun; the building, the vast reaches of unexplored space to cruise in, the challenge of facing unknown enemies, making alliances, resource gathering to gain power, and far more. All of these elements gel very well into what many people are referring to as an EVE experience. Though I don't like comparing StarMade to EVE, there are many resemblances to it, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The game is just really fun, especially if you have goals and friends to play with. Once you get a firm grasp on how to build ships (or just figure out how to search up blueprints on line and gather resources in-game to build them) the game really starts to kick off, as you'll find yourself making different classes, arming your planets/stations, and really just being a force in the galaxy. The only negative I see is the building itself, it can be a challenge to master the concept of building up an entire ship from a single block, but the mechanics are simple enough that most should be able to figure it out. Additionally, adjusting to movement and gravity mechanics can also be a bit of a challenge for the unexperienced. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done with adjusting the UI, adding a proper soundtrack, and various other elements that make a game complete, but it's still in early access after all and you really can't complain for the amount of content you're actually getting at the moment.Considering this game is still in development, I am quite eager to see what else awaits us in the future of the great black yonder.

								Really amazing sandbox game.  One of the best early access games I've tried and well worth the money.  The scope is very ambitious but even in this early state it's a TON of fun to play.  If you like the building elements of Mincraft and don't mind a similar rough art style this has similarities in the building aspects but it stands apart in scope.  Explore hundreds of planets.  Build buildings, spacesports, starships, space stations, mine asteroids and planets,  and combat pirates and loot their stations and ships to make yourself a fortune, make friends trading (or enemies).  There is a simple but broad crafting tree (lots of possibilities for more and a ton in already)  Full instrumentable logic elements and basic animation capabilities (eg open/close doors, elevators etc) Automated build via chained factory systems with upgrades are in.  Weapon and mining systems for ships are customizable (down to color and damage effects eg. explosions, EMP etc)  Cloaking devices, jump drives and shielding are all customizable and craftable for your fleet.  There is a faction/claim system for most entities (ships/stations/planets/sectors)  The universe feels massive with lots to explore including derlict ships ripe for the plundering if you can keep the pirates from one shotting you.   Multiplayer servers allow combat and/or cooperation.  Private server support and hosting services are already established and work well.  There are a few graphical and sound bugs that are an annoyance but no showstoppers.  The Dev's are clearly passionate about their work and have posted several videos/tutorials.   You'll definately get your money's worth.  The learning curve for the interface is a bit steep but there are a number of in game tutorials to get you in the right direction and after a bit of a rocky start I'm feeling very comfortable and can quickly spin up new ships, turrets, stations etc with relative ease.  I expect I'll be spending a lot of time in the starmade universe!Oh and full Oculus support (head tracking and 3d)  WOOT!   "

								I bought this game the day I tried it, before it was ever on steam. It has so much potential as a sandbox space game that I can't help but get a little excited when I see it in my library. Now that it is on steam I have a lot of faith in the development.I do have the occasional bug. However, the game is solid. The physics are pretty good around planets and the multiplayer aspect of the game can be pretty fun. The AI turrets are a solid part of space combat but the AI ships have something to be desired in terms of how far they will go away from where you start them when AI enemies come for you.The combat itself is pretty straight forward and can be pretty entertaining, there is nothing like hiding in your factions home planet or station while your AI Turrets take out the enemy while viewing it all through a glass wall. BTW when you are running a server you can have the game spawn as many ships of any saved design as you want. The game is neat-o.			"
