												oemgee LuvV this game!!So gud givetha best advice, 10/10 IGN.I got SUPER POPular and my dream boyyyyLOVEEE love.Is what i would say if i reviewed this game when i first played it over 6 years ago. Its not horrible given the fact that it is an old game for preteens. I enjoyed going down memory lane. It plays horribly on new systems though.			"
