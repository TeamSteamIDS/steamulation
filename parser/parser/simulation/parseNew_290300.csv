You can't take the sky from me...Take Starpoint Gemini 2, Freelancer, Elite Dangerous and the worldbuilding of Starcraft 2, throw into a foodblender. Put on high for two minutes.*WHIRRR*This is the result. A gorgeous, whisky-soaked blend of a game where pilots drink greel distilled alcohol, where antimatter specks are used for deviant practices, and where combat takes place on a horizontal plane straight out of Assassins' Creed : Black Flag, on crack. All handled with the colour and panache of the original Torchlight, which exploded out of nowhere and revitalised the Dungeon Crawler genre. This promises, and mostly succeeds in doing the same for space exploration.I'm a leaf on the wind, I'm a leaf on the wind!In the time honoured tradition of all space exploration games everywhere, you are thrown into a starter ship, in this case, a dinky little corvette with a few broadside cannons, a few turrets, and a hull made of papier mache and shields made of soap suds. It is your job to find your Aunt Juno, who so very kindly left you this ship, and find out why you've been dragged out to the tail end of space, which is full of the scum of the universe, and work your way up the foodchain, blowing up said scum and villainy, and eventually become owner of a pimped up ship of doom and destruction. Depending on your playstyle this may be a top notch destroyer, with speed and agility and tons of guns, or a dreadnaught with a horrifying number of broadsides, or a heavy hauler with enough armour to qualify as having it's own gravitational pull.Or, y'know, you could buy a strike craft and try to outrun bullets, but that's for the clinically insane. Even top level shields and good guns won't allow you to toe it with the enemy dreadnaughts for -long-, but hey, whatever flicks your switch!Miner, trader, soldier, sailor...Rebel galaxy gives you a very, very diverse set of tools to work with, you can tool up for mining with lasers and fault scanners, or you can go full out commodity trader, and the economy is set up enough to actually handle that, with system averages and station histories that actually work properly and can be scanned from out of station across the system, allowing you to set up profitable trade routes back and forth. This can pay off very nicely once you have a high capacity hauler, particularly if that hauler has one of the contraband cargo expansions which means you can facilitate life as a smuggler on the side.Or you can just blow things up, because explosions are pretty. Blowing things up always work, and there's a terrifying variety of weapons, not just purchasable, but also lootable unique variants which can be discovered in the world, in loot crates or from the hulls of pirate lords, if you feel like converting them to scrap metal.The pool is wide, but not QUITE as deep as space promises...Rebel Galaxy offers a -lot- of activities, and offers enough in each activity to have you happily whiling away your time, moreso than Elite Dangerous did (and yes, I know many E;D fans who are going to burn me for that, but it's true), the mining is more sensibly handled due to the tractor beams, the combat is more visceral and less grindy, the trading makes more sense and doesn't require an excel spreadsheet to get the best out of. There's a real economy, and you don't need to be online to get the most out of the game.There are -two- buts to this rather delicious soup.One : The factions - They are present, but they're rather bland. More time and depth could have been put into them, faction exclusive ships for each faction would have been glorious, along with modules, as well as faction exclusive bases that you could dock at, along with missions and different reactions based on standing, as well as more complex interrelations between said factions. Right now you basically have only two paths you can follow. If there's anything that could exponentially increase the lifespan of this game - Faction DLC would do it. This would convert a 20-40 hour game to a 200-400 hour game. No joke.Two : Whilst the activities are good, they all tend to peter out once you get out past the destroyer mark, and the fact you can only hire gunship level mercenaries puts a hard cap on the kind of fights they can throw at you. Hiring capital level mercenaries would have solved this. Again, faction DLC for the win here.Final thoughts...Do these two issues stop this game from being anything other than excellent? No. It's still a bloody great game, and for the price point they're charging it's an absolute steal. It does however prevent me from slamming the ""Essential"" badge on, because I know that the devs could quite possibly get the Factions some love, and make this ""the"" game to beat. Hint hint. It does, however, easily merit being a game that people should look into, especially if you're someone who loved Freelancer, or similar games.Verdict : Highly RecommendedWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

												Rebel Galaxy... Bought it because of the soundtrack in the trailers... Took a gamble and hoped it would give me some entertainment... Man was I surprised... Sooo.... Breaking it down:1. You will feel like a frikking space cowboy.2. Music so damn good that you want the soundtrack in every possible format.3. The sheer size of this game is just shocking! Did NOT expect that when I started it.4. Broadside battles between two large spaceships might be the coolest thing ever.5. BROADSIDES!!!! (It´s so damn cool I had to mention it twice!).6. Voice actors are actually kind of good for a game thats not a AAA.7. Did I mention broadsides? 8. Simple, but complex. 9. One bug, ONE(1!), found during my entire playthrough. EA, Bethesda, Bohemian and just about everyone else, LOOK AT THESE GUYS AND LEARN!!! It was not even a gamebreaking bug! All it did was made me crash into a station after warp and my ship autodocked, which I had planned to do anyway so the bug actually made me save some time since I didn´t have to ""slowboat"" all the way after warp. Downsides then? Yeah a few actually, but many of them is just me being picky.1. Game gets repetetive after a while and considering how many ships there is you may just finish the story halfway through the ship line. 2. Main story line is waaay to easy. 3. Considering it´s a space game, you may actually believe there would be free flight in all directions... like up and down... but nope! ship stays leveled and all you need to think about is right, left, back and forward... However this is forgiven thanks to the awesomeness of broadside battles. 4. Soundtrack makes this game, without it (sometimes the music stops) it just feels empty. 5. Characters kind of lacked depth and you probably won´t get too attached to them. Despite the downsides I still give this game a solid 7/10. It has the right ""feel"" to it and It´s absolutely one of those ""If this gets a sequel, the devs will get it all right"" kind of game.			"

												A fantastic indie space action game that has a heavy firefly vibe.Pros- Broadside combat- Lots of ships and equipment to progress into- Good story and large universe- Randomly generated universe- Non linear progression- Very enjoyable Combat- Soundtrack is greatCons- Some aspects are shallow such as diplomacy- Side missions are used over and over just with different locations and enemies.- Long travel times- Debris can stop warp

												This was one of the most fun space-based games I played in recent history... and I own/have played a LOT of space games.This is not exactly ""space"" sim as much as naval ship arcade-based action RPG, but it has the atmosphere, characters, and ship variety to keep things fresh.I clocked my 52.5 hours in a single play-through from start to finish, and yes, I did play this game for fun, so I did not rush past areas or just hop from mission to mission. I hunted for bounties, stopped raids, broke blockades, and... well... PLAY the damn game instead of just trying to get it over with.The game's unique take on broad-side combat, old-school battleship-style A la WWII, makes for a refreshing space experience that made me wonder why other space combat games did not adopt a similar format long ago.This is NOT an X3-equivalent space empire building sim, nor is it a hardcore rogue-like. It's simple a great single-player adventure with great combat mechanics and above-average story progression with TONS of polish and character. This is better than most AAA titles today.For the money, it's a steal at full price. On sale it's a MUST GET.			"

												This is an extraordinarily playable spaceship-piloting game. Very simple and easy to get into, whilst yet providing enough customisability and choice to justify the ""open world"" tag, it drew me in from the first five minutes and kept me completely immersed until the endgame. It has an easy learning curve, but it doesn't sacrifice complexity overmuch.Very pretty graphics and gratifying sound - the soundtrack, by the way, is PERFECT. And even if you don't like it, it has an amazing feature of being able to choose your own music, and assign it to different in-game scenarios. Reeeeeally nice touch.The story is quite an interesting one for sci-fi fans, and there is a surprising amount of speech/animation for a game at this price point - enough to make it a genuinely fun campaign. There is even replay value in the amount of choice in factions and weaponry.The only issue I have is that it's too short, in that the game initially hints at a large amount of content - ships; weapons; star systems, etc. and then simply makes these things very time-consuming to attain, and the end of the line- best ship; best weapons; final star system, happens a bit too soon, with the endgame lying on predictable lines from the progression set out on at the start. To sum up - extreme value for money here - just don't forget you're not playing an AAA title, like I did, and be disappointed that it ends too soon.			"

												To some this game will be a disaster that you hate, especially if you want a realistic space sim.Others will find it an exhilarating experience, ""dumbed down"" enough and arcadey enough that it's playable for the masses especially since you're locked in 2 dimensions.PLEASE RE-READ THAT AGAIN.Your ship can not move up or down, only left or right, in space. To many this will be a deal breaker.But wait!I tell you this game is a blast if you give it a chance. It will have you on the edge of your seat having a good old time as you learn the finer points of capital ship combat, and die in the process. The save system is very forgiving and you can have multiple playthroughs going at once (rename your ship to keep the saves separate is a good tip).There are mission boards with side missions and a main story line, commodities trading, tons of action and nothing a well timed deflector shield button press can't solve!  Lots of upgrades, weapons, shields, deflectors, various parts of the ship can be upgraded as well. Just enough depth in missions and main story to keep you going and the action can be intense. Also, each time you start the world you start in front seems to be based on some RNG combo as it's been different the 3 times my son and I started new games. Haven't done any comparisons for the rest of the ""universe""Just make sure you are going in with the right expectations and I would expect you to find this game addicting and rewarding. Get it on sale and you won't be sorry!  Also, the music is awesome, just let the game load and the title screen run and it can be amazing on it's own!Here's a good example of an early experience: Flying an early ship with shields and deflector, trying to get a few side missions and upgrade my weapons. I pick up a dead drop and 4 fighter craft, all pirates, drop in on me and my hired Mercenary. we kick in our engines and split up, both targeting the same ship from different sides, blowing it out of.....space? Not air certainly! Anyway, it's a quick fight and we dispatch them easy, going to hyperspace and heading to take the dead drop back.Suddenly we get interdicted out of hypersace and it's pirates agian, but much worse as it's two medium sized cruisers with fighter escort.  Trying to isolate one target at a time we fight a retreating battle, luring the fighters away from the cruisers and trying to divide and conquer.The cruisers are having none of it and their thrusters flare as they quickly close the distance and open fire. Our shields are taking heavy damage and missiles are coming in (thank goodness for flak guns and deflector shields) when a militia destroyer warps in with fighter escort and opens fire on the pirate cruisers. Our 2 ships and the local constables, basically, wipe out the pirates in a fierce but ultimately one sided battle. The militia ship scans us after, tells us to move along and we head on our way to finish the mission.Phew!  Good times!Please remember this is 2 dimensional, left right only movement of your ship, but trust me it works and the game is actually quite a lot of fun!			"

												This is the most fun that I've had with a spaceship-based combat game since Freelancer and, before that, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter.  I have not beaten it yet, but these are my impressions so far.The Good:  The PRICE. This game plays like a $60 AAA title.  Fast-paced combat in capital ships that actually includes you piloting instead of just giving commands.  Main storyline makes you want to learn more.  QWERTY controls are downright elegant - I own a controller but have no desire to use it.  No Z-Axis - I understand some people refuse to buy the game for this reason but, not only is it unnecessary, it would also make the game extremely awkward considering the types of ships you're flying. You won't miss it, trust me.  Young game, but so far, almost entirely bug free.  Epic blues soundtrack that changes songs depending on what you're doing in game. Fast music for fights, cruising music for, well, cruising.  The game world feels like Firefly would if it would have had a lot more in-space pewpew and also aliens. Lots of aliens.  Enough ship customization, but not so much that you feel like you need an encyclopedia. (looking at you, EVE)  Bits and pieces of humor throughout.  Graphics are pretty, if not necessarily stunning.   The galaxy is persistent, living, and breathing, and things are happening that have nothing whatsoever to do with you, which can cause interesting results.The Not-As-Good:  They're not planning on expansions or DLC or anything, last I heard, and there have been zero updates to the game since launch, though that was only 15 days ago. I'd like to think there's a big content patch in the works or something, but I have no evidence for that. The game is, however, absolutely stable, as far as I can tell, so maybe they're just considering it finished. (edit - as of 11/17/15, they have released a small patch)  Running missions to keep your ship powerful enough to take on the next story element might be too reptitive for some, though I'm enjoying it.  Escort missions are still kind of broken. I just did one where my client's destination was to a base that was aggressive to him, presumably because the base was aggressive to me. I don't know any reason a merchant would purposely go to a station whose defenses were going to shred him. On the first attempt, there was also a BIG fleet, and I didn't get credit for the mission because he got blown up. On the second attempt, no fleet, so although the station's defenses opened fire on us both, I got credit for the mission just before the merchant ship exploded. So I looted him and flew off, getting both the merchant's cargo and the pay for the escort. Amusing, but obviously not what the developers intended.Is this worth your $20? Absolutely. Zero question. Even if you don't particularly like these types of games, the lack of Z-axis might actually do it for you. It makes the game feel a lot less nauseating to those who typically can't handle the extra plane, and eliminates the circling buzzard effect that tends to plague starfighter-based games (Elite: Dangerous, looking at you).  There's something about running straight at a ship three times your size, turning and opening up your cannons and just shredding them that is immensely and uniquely gratifying while some fast-paced, hard-core electric guitar plays on queue, and the pirate-lord screams ""No...no-no-no-NO!"" then blows up, leaving behind a rare piece of ship equipment.

												This is easily one of the year's best games, combining the atmosphere and open ""do what you like"" dynamics of Freelancer, with combat similar to Starfleet Command / Black Flag (like those games your ship is restricted to the same plane, so this isn't a hardcore space sim, but it serves the gameplay well). The vibe is very much like Firefly, mostly due to the excellent grungy soundtrack, but also the look and feel of the ships, stations, and frontier-mentality characters that you meet. It works so well because the core gameplay is hugely enjoyable. Combat is dynamic and in-your-face, ships and missiles explode and shake the screen, lasers sear the side of your ship, damage is nicely modelled so that surviving a brutal encounter feels like you escaped by the skin of your teeth, your hull blackened, components shorting out, systems breaking down as you hurry to find repairs. I've spent most of my time doing missions from the bulletin boards rather than following the story, that's how much fun it all is.The universe is procedurally generated every time you start a new game, which certainly gives it legs, although to be honest the game is pretty large in scope; you'll spend at least 10 hours in the starting system, and there are many more after that. The difficulty at first is quite high, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of how combat works, and a few early upgrades will help you feel badass. Merceneries can be hired if you're still having trouble.There's more to the game than combat though, mining is actually a lot of fun (unlike Elite: Dangerous where it's sadly rather tedious), trading (legal or otherwise) is viable once you upgrade your cargo hold and find the best prices in the dynamic system, and there are plenty of things to run into out in the depths of space. Speaking of which, there's a real sense of ""space"" as you travel around, not enough to be tedious as you travel between planets, but enough to make it feel like a journey, watching nebulae whip by, unknown flotillas caught on the edge of your scanner, and the occasional tempting beacon to check out. The story is also a cut above the usual generic stuff, decent writing helped by the setting, and some nice voice work, plus the story missions are some of the best time to be had.I can possibly seeing it getting a bit repetitive after a while, but tell me a game that isn't. For 20 bucks you should get several days of enjoyment from this. It really depends on how much you enjoy the core gameplay loop, but for me this is the best space game released in 2015 by miles, because the developers clearly want you to have a blast. Constant updates and bug fixes show that they're committed to their customers, a great example of a two-man team showing the big boys how it's done.			"

												No time to read: Very pretty, but very shallow.Rebel Galaxy gives a great first impression. Great graphics, great soundtrack, great atmosphere. Different weapon types and visceral combat. No-one would blame you if you thought that this was the next Privateer or Freelancer.But delve into it a bit deeper and you begin to see the hollowness under its pretty exterior. Combat that was fun at the start becomes very repetitive the 20th time you beat the exact same group of pirates using the exact same tactics. There's not much to do in combat either, all of your weapons work on some form of autoaim so you don't even have the challenge of leading your target properly in order to hit them. The worst part of the combat is how its more attritional than based on maneuver. You'd think that because a lot of the ships' firepower is in their broadsides you can maneuver to 'cross their T' so you can take down targets much larger than you are, but all ships have omnidirectional turrets that make this very hard to do. Instead of fighters trying to get on each other's tail or ships trying to cross each others' T, Rebel Galaxy's ships are more like 2 RTS units shooting at each other: DPS and shielding are king and the effect of maneuver is minimal.This is made even worse by the way the game tiers its weapons and defenses. The tiers are set up in this game in such a way that its possible to get into a situation where you fight a ship you can never beat (i.e. their shields regenerate faster than you can ever damage them), and your only recourse is to grind money so you can buy the next higher tier of weaponry. It makes the game into one big grind. And the grind takes a LONG time. In the later stages of the game it would take upwards of 20 missions to fully upgrade your ship's weapons, shields and components to the next tier.The grind also puts the blandness of the procedurally generated universe into stark relief. Once you've seen all the types of stations in the first system, you've seen all the stations in the rest of the game. The only thing that differentiates one station from another is what tier of weapons they sell. There are no special 'capital planets' or 'story planets' like there were in Privateer or Freelancer. There's no sense of exploration as a station of one type in a system is virtually identical to a station of the same type in another system. You won't get the sense of discovery that you get when you first land in the Oxford system in the original Privateer, or when you land on a capital planet in Freelancer.The main storyline also falters at the very end. Barring the grind, the main quests are interesting enough to get you to the finale. The ending though, is bullpoo. Let's just say that someone leaves for no damn good reason, and you're dumped into the sandbox with very little fanfare. And by the time you finish it, you'd be so tired of the grind that the sandbox would no longer have any appeal.If you're looking for a Privateer or Freelancer-type game try Starpoint Gemini 2 instead. It's a lot less polished but it has a big enough universe to make discovery interesting, has a tolerable grind and more interesting combat. Or dust off the old joystick and play Independence War 2.

												I'm old enough to have fond memories of playing Privateer and Freelancer.  I picked up Rebel Galaxy hoping to renew my love for those games.  While I didn't quite find what I was looking for, I found a solid game worth playing.For people who loved the aforementioned games for the open-ended exploration, the ability to build your bankroll by buying low on some planets and selling high on others, upgrading ships and weapons as you progressed, and the intriguing storyline, this game is definitely worth playing because it does all of those things well.  For those who loved those games because of the thrill of small craft in-cockpit open space dogfighting, you should probably look elsewhere. Rebel Galaxy managed to take the inherent 3D nature of space and reduce it to 2D, implementing a colonial era ship ""broadside"" style combat as if on the surface of invisible water.  It isn't necessarily bad, but not my cup of tea.  Essentially, you can really only do one thing, turn and fire over and over.  It gets repetitive after a while and eventually I found myself wishing I could auto-resolve battles to move on through the story.  That being said, the combat was not so off-putting as to keep me from playing until the end of the main story.  Bottom line, this game is worth what you pay for it but don't expect a masterpiece.

												Disclosure: I received an early Beta CopySimply put, I love the game. In essence for me it's Freelancer reborn, except with capital ships.The gameplay is fantastic, although I would strongly recommend a controller. Both the 360 one, and the Steam Controller work brilliantly with the game.One thing that separates the game from freelancer is the capital ships, and that you use Broadsides for your primary weapons. As such you need to get your sides facing the enemies.Fear not though, it's still super intense, and you have plenty of other weaponry. Ranging from Secondary fire ones such as EMP Waves, Flak cannons and plenty of turrets. Turrets are mostly A.I controlled, although you can set priorities for each and every one of them. Such as Fire at Any Craft, Target, Locked Targets only, or even Fighters only.This means that you can focus all fire on a single enemy, or you can handle the capital ships while your turrets deal with the swarms of enemy fighter and gunships.It's rather odd at first, but after a while it becomes extremely satisfying. To the point of almost feeling like you're in Battlestar Galactica fending off literal swarms of enemies.Sadly, you're unable to be a carrier and have your own fighters, although it's not too much of an issue.The story is very interesting, and it certainly is engaging. Although some story missions have very high requirements and as such you Have to go do other missions to get a better ship and equipment.This is no issue at all, and extremely fun. You can do a variety of missions, or you can just do pirate bounty hunting. Doing missions however increases or decreases your reputation with various factions. This in turn unlocking newer ship hulls, and equipment. You're also able to join some guilds, such as the Mercenaries or Merchants which give extra missions and other unique ship hulls.I would strongly encourage you to find one you like. Trading is not the most complex of systems, but very manageable, and slightly fun. I've never been much of a trader but each system and station has various prices and requirements. An impoverished station will pay a lot more for food and water than a well set up military one. While some might accept some contraband pirate items; ranging from Narco Cola, to Living Organs.Ships can also be scanned so be careful carrying contraband, the Militia will scan you and will hail you to explain yourself. If you simply ignore their Hails they will go hostile and attack you. If you want to play with those items, make sure to get a Smuggler's Cargohold; They can't be scanned ;)Graphics and performance wise the game does extremely well. It's no Star Citizen, but it looks great and runs even better. Now I might have an overkill machine with Two GTX 980Ti's, but playing at 4K with DSR I was topping out at 144FPS which is my monitor's cap, and at worst getting 80fps. The only slight complaint I have is little lag spikes when phasing in and out of a station. Although this is most likely an engine issue that'll soon be fixed for textures loading in and out.As for graphical options the game as plenty and they're all adjusted with through the game launcher. It also has 3 graphics APIs to choose from. DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and even OpenGL if you fancy using that.I unfortunately only have experience running the game in DX11, but it's done exceptionally well.The last thing I want to mention is the brilliant soundtrack. It's very similar to Borderlands, and I feel it suits the game very well. Personally it gives me a Borderlands and Cowboy Bebop feel to the game and I really enjoy having it on.In the game launcher however you can also create some custom music options so you can expand it all  if you so desire.All in all, I simply love the game. I've 40 hours into it, and I've still not finished the main story because I've been having so much fun with everything else. If you enjoyed Freelancer, I would really recommend the game; and for others it's simply a great mini sandbox open Space Action Sim with capital ships.PC Gameplay 60 FPS

												I'm not really sure when space westerns became a thing. My secret inner weeb wants to point to Cowboy Bebop or Trigun, but it just as easily could have been Firefly or Starcraft or something else entirely. They're the logical conclusion of humanity expanding into space, really, embracing the freedom of an open universe without the unity or enlightenment of something like Star Trek. This is precisely where Rebel Galaxy lives, in a simple wild west approach to space battles and exploration.You begin the game by inheriting an old junk freighter from your aunt and running errands in it for an old alien acquaintance of hers. Following the main story missions unravels a lengthy, familiar tale of deep space intrigue and ancient artifacts. This is of course only one option of many in the vein of something like Sid Meier's Pirates! because you can just as easily haul cargo, claim bounties, or pirate convoys for as long as the game holds your attention. A fair spread of ships, weapons, and upgrades are available across several factions for you to spend your hard-earned credits on and advance in power.The moment-to-moment gameplay of Rebel Galaxy is like an arcadey version of naval combat. Capital ships in this sci-fi reality still rely on broadsides for most of their firepower, so you'll be sidling up to just about everything you want to blow away. You also get auto-targeting turrets and a secondary weapon that can fire missiles or flak, as well as shield and speed boosters to expand your tactical options. I wouldn't say there's a lot of depth to the combat but positioning and prioritizing targets can mean the difference between victory and the cold embrace of hard vacuum.Unless you get really into the mostly generic story you're going to want to spend most of your time amassing wealth for bigger ships and guns. There's a basic commodity system you can play space trader with that requires some attention to trade routes and emergent events, but most of your time will probably be spent on missions. Each station has a mission board offering bounty collections, blockades, pirate hunting, cargo hauling, and more. These missions are assigned a difficulty based on your ship's current loadout, which is terribly helpful because anything above Average carries a very real chance of annihilating you in an instant.Rebel Galaxy offers a very promising setup and world to prosper in but suffers from a few issues, the difficulty curve being chief among them. At some point you're going to hit a wall where your next story mission or the only profitable missions are High or Very High risk, and if the enemy composition is not favorable to your particular ship you're going to die very, very fast. Upgrading to a larger ship is the easiest way to climb the difficulty curve but can require a LOT of side missions and busywork if the next hull in line isn't very cheap. People who are easily distracted and habitually clear side missions will fare a lot better than most here.The further you get the more technical issues you'll see crop up as well. Late in the game I started having mission-critical items disappear and enemy ships not properly register as objectives, which led to some aggravating wastes of time. There's also a lot going on in every star system, with pirates and militia lurking everywhere. This sounds cool at first but missions don't account for or clear existing entities in the mission space, so a Low risk battle against some frigates can turn out to be instantly fatal if the game decides to spawn pirate dreadnoughts in that particular sector.I've had my fair share of frustration with this title, but most of my time in it has been a relaxing and rewarding romp around the galaxy. The systems you explore are expansive, colorful, and full of debris fields and nebulae to explore for secrets and bounties. Warping around has a great feel to it, with rich engine sounds and visual distortions through space. The twangy western feel is out in full force as well, with plenty of rough-spoken captains to deal with, junky ships to pilot and pilfer, and plenty of wailing country rock to fill the silent void.At times it feels very much like a friendlier, simpler, offline EVE Online, though it never really matches the same sense of scale or vastness. I mean that in the best and worst ways, too, because it never really aspires to be more than a basic space hauling shooting gallery. And yet, there's an undeniable draw to scraping together the credits to land a new class of vessel and taking it out for a spin in the places you feared to tread before. That's where Rebel Galaxy really succeeds, in giving you a universe to explore and plenty of reasons to see it all.			"

												If they tried, really tried, to make a Firefly game that nailed it...it would be this game.  It's more like Sid Meier's Pirates in space, or crossed with Freelancer/Privateer, than a traditional space sim.  This is fine because those games were all amazing.  You're piloting a capital ship, not a little fighter, which gives it a different feel.  The combat is extremely satisfying, there are a lot of choices in how you equip your ship, and the universe feels like there are really things going on in it besides what you're doing.If you liked Pirates: instabuy, the game systems are similar.  If you like the idea of capital ship scale combat and an open world, also buy.  Firefly fan and like games at all?  Buy.  This is the first space game since Freelancer that I really enjoyed straight out of the box, and it's a steal at its price.			"

												Just beat the game and thought I would write a review.  This game is really good and deserves a sequel.  Definitely has a Firefly universe feel to it which says a lot really.  Definitely worth 20 bucks.Pros - Well designed, awesome soundtrack, great voiceovers.  Cons - A liitle too easy.  I used a merc frigate throughout the whole game, took on whole fleets including super dreadnoughts and the enemy rarely got through my shields.  Using basic common sense is more powerful than a dreadnought it seems.  The ending of the game, while realistic, felt a bit underwhelming to be honest.  The game goes to sandbox only then, but whats the point really..Conclusion: A really wonderful gem here on Steam.  Without a doubt one of the best space games ever made.  These guys made a solid game and it was worth my 20 bucks easy.  Just hate its over.  Now I hope they make a sequel or another game of this quality.  Thanks.			"

If you loved Freelancer, Rebel Galaxy is the game you've been waiting for After playing 40+ hours and not even completing the main story (by choice), this game has content literally for daysthe procedural generation manages to be varied enough that you don't feel that you're repeating the same mission over and over.Heavy customization of ships, 21 playable ships and I've maybe flown half of them, and the ability to customize nearly every aspect of your ship.Solid trading / economy engine, merchants guild faction that specializes in trade, Space truck to your hearts content.Did I mention broadside combatPull up alongside a menacing dreadnaught and unleash hell with up to 20 broadsides, and watch their hull melt before the glow of your might cannons.Solid dialog engine, reminiscent of Freelancer, new in this system the barkeep my have some tips for you, looking for your next score slip the bartender some credits and he may let you in on some secrets. need some help elbow up to the local mercenary, talk shop or hire them to be your wingman.I can't speak highly enough of this game. look forward to seeing this franchise continue into the future.

Posted: October 26, 2015
												So here it is-my Rebel Galaxy review. Full disclosure-I'm friends with the devs and got an advanced copy of the game. That said I've done my best to be impartial.My Tl'dr opinion? I  love it and was well over 100 hours in before I took a break from it. This is so many things about space games I love rolled into one.The Setting.The game goes for a Firefly/Wing Commander:Privateer/Freelancer vibe. The solar systems in this game are on the wrong side of the galactic tracks and haven't had a bath in aeons. They're rude, crude and filled with rocks and junk. Rebel Galaxy features an interesting cast of characters. It's one of the games unfortunate downsides that you never really get to know any of them very well. It's loaded with the kind of wink/nudge humor you'd find in TV series like Farscape or Firefly-for example one of the commodities you can trade is called 'Narco-cola' and it is just that. Powerful narcotics in the form of carbonated beverage. If you're a fan of stuff like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy you'll appreciate the humor. The Story:Length 30-40 hours (20 if you're an old hand at these kind of games).It ain't deep but it gets the job done. Like I wrote above the characters all have interesting personalities but those personalities are shallow and you won't interact with any of them very much. It's a shame because they are just interesting enough where I wanted to get to know them more. By the time I got past the 'Hello, nice to meet you, may I help you kill this troup of troublemakers?' bits their role in the story was done. This becomes even more disappointing by the end of the story. It's a great lead up but the end is a bit of a letdown. I'll give DDGames credit-despite my not liking how it ended I've played through it numerous times now. The Sound:If you're into down and dirty southern-fried blues rock this will be right up your alley. It helps add a lot to the atmosphere and makes you feel like every space station bar serves oil pan shots and barbed wire biscuits. The sound effects are another matter entirely-voiceovers can get a bit repetitive to the point of tediousness at times. Some of the audio isn't mixed well-radio chatter clips/distorts a lot and I don't recommend you use expensive speakers or a subwoofer if you plan on blasting this. Voice acting isn't bad for an indie game. This is one of the things that lends a lot of personality to the characters. It was done by the devs themselves (with the help of the always amazing Lani Minella). I dare say it's better than in most Bethesda games I've played. Even though Travis does numerous voices they sound different enough where it's not that much of a drawback. Ships:There are 21 playable ships you're able to buy throughout the game. Some of these require money and some require you to build a positive reputation with various factions (pirates, merchants guild etc). Each ship is upgradable with a wide variety of weapons and components. Lasers, missiles, shields, hulls-you can customize your ship to beef them up and match them to your playing style. This wide variety and manner of acquiring and upgrading ships means there's a lot of replay to be squeezed out of the game.I did find it unfortunate that you're not able to access all ships. Certain ships belonging to certain races seem to be inaccessible which is a real downer in a game that revolves around the very notion of collecting every ship you happen to come across. Combat:Combat takes place on a 2-D plane. That means it's more like naval combat in games like Assassin's Creed:Black Flag or Sid Meiers Pirates (the 2004 edition) or the auto combat in Mad Max. Thanks to the variety of components and weapons in game no matter what your playstyle is you can adapt your craft to it. Upgrading certain components helps with your survivability. You can also hire a merc to accompany you which is always a smart move as some of them are extremely lethal. The one down side of using a merc is that you can't upgrade their weapons or ships.It would have been cool to see something closer to the pets in Torchlight or Companions in Diablo III-especially considering all the weaponry that drops from capital ships. Being able to give my mercs better gear early on would have helped a lot as the best mercs aren't available until late in the game.The main downside to combat is that difficulty seems to be very imbalanced at the moment. It's a lot of fun don't get me wrong but some missions say they're difficult when they're not and vice versa. It's also pretty spinny. Enemies run but they never run -that- fast or far which  means there will be times when you spend  battles going in circles. That said the effects are glorious and when combat is good it's really, really good. The other stuff:Mining-It's a pretty zen-like experience. Cruise up to some rocks, scan them then go up to the ones full of ore. You can buy a fault tracker early on that paints red circles on asteroids that have more than one piece of ore in them. Blow it up that way and you get multiple ores. It's a pretty relaxing experience unfortunately unless you're very good at the market stuff, explore a LOT and very patient you won't be making a ton of credits mining. Commodities: Stations sell commodities. Buy low/sell high type stuff. Different stations have different events that effect the rest of that systems economies. You can also read the in station news boards or ask the bartenders/merchants for info. Hackable transponders that give tasty info, random cargo containers that contain nice loot (sort of like the outer space version of barrells in an rpg) and rescue missions aplenty are some of the other bits of content you'll find in this game. SUMMARY:Rebel Galaxy is a fun, arcadey naval-game-in-space that provides some of the trappings of a space-sim while ditching most of the complexity and time-investment required of more traditional space sims like EVE Online or Elite:Dangerous. It's great for drop in and play for a half hour or so sessions. If you're the kind of person who spends hours playing space games just for the sake of the atmosphere and love blowing stuff up with enough lights to build a discotechque this will scratch that itch for at least a little while. Personally I'm 100 hours in and haven't gotten bored yet.Those looking for a deeply engaging story you're not going to find one but the characters have tons of personality and give the setting a very lived in feel-just be ready for the ending to be a bit of a let down. Those into trading should be happy though the game feels like it needs a bit of tweaking since not all professions feel viable. The accent is on combat so expect to blow up a lot of ships if you're looking to be one of the galaxy's richest space truckers. Despite its flaws this is an impressive first game from Double Damage Games. The developers put a lot of heart into this and it shows. This would have been a solid deal even at $30 but at $20 it's way more than worth it.			"

												If you're looking for a space pew pew lazorz game, just buy it. Right now. What are you waiting for? Stop reading these words and go buy it.You're still reading? Fine I'll put more words here that might mean things about stuff. Seriously, though, this game overdelivers its $20 at release date price (or whatever you can get it for on sale). There are plenty of other reviews speaking to what's great about this game, so I won't beat a dead horse. However, I would like to speak to some of the negative comments that I've seen.""Missions are repetitive."" - this is true, but that hasn't reduced my enjoyment of gameplay. Sure the missions are repetitive, but each encounter does have variations within it. There are at least 3 major variations with each mission: mission type, types of friendlies, types of enemies. There are escort missions (follow a friendly around at warp speed and defend them from attacking hostiles that pull you out of warm), defend missions (move into an engagement and prevent friendlies from being destroyed), destroy missions (fly in guns blazing until everything is on fire, including you), snatch and run / fight missions (fly into an area teeming with hostiles, grab some cargo, and gtfo), delivery missions (get some cargo and deliver it to another station, while being pulled out of warp multiple times from hostiles trying to take your cargo). There are also other types that I haven't done yet (pirate missions).The other aspect that changes missions are types of friendlies/enemies. Sometimes you're fighting multiple cruisers with minor fighter support, sometimes you're fighting a dreadnaught with tons of fighter support, sometimes you're fighting waves upon waves of fighters - and yes these do require different engagement tactics. Good luck charging into waves of mine layer / bomber fighters with a cruiser and winning. I also feel like I need to point out that repetitive side missions aren't a new thing. How many times have you collected herbs as a side quest in some other RPG?""2D space combat"" - When I read this before buying it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. After playing the game - I just don't care that it's not 3D. I don't feel like it being 3D would make it any more fun, especially with the ""broadside"" style gameplay (which I do enjoy). The 2D movement environment plus broadside style combat provides enough complexity without making it over-complex. You can still use tactics to use a smaller vessel to take down a larger one. I've used my quick cruiser to take down multiple dreadnaughts by getting behind them so that the only damage I'm taking is from their rear turrets and the occasional heat seeking missile, and they can't turn fast enough to broadside me. Plus with a fast vessel you have enough maneuverability to be able to zig-zag between your broadsides (shields don't depreciate as a whole - but each side is separate, for a total of 4 shields) to be able to keep your shields up, all while staying out of the main line of fire. Or you could just buy a huge ship, get ramming deflectors, AND RAMMING SPEED EVERYTHING TO DEATH. Twice.""Main Storyline is [insert words]"" I'm not sure why people are complaining about the main storyline. At the time of writing this I've had 26 hours in the game and still haven't finished it. Sure it's nothing especially fancy... but it is engaging, and seriously it's a $20 game. I'm not sure what you expect. I've played plenty of single player RPG-style games (ones that ONLY have a main storyline) that I've cleared in under 30 hours, and those were $50-60 at release.""Soundtrack something or other"" I also really enjoyed the soundtrack with it's Firefly vibe, however I would have to agree that it starts getting repetitive. I also have an easy solution. Turn off the music. Play your own if you really want music. Again, for a $20 game the soundtrack exceeds what I would expect.Final thoughts - the depth and enjoyability of the game overdelivers as a $20 price tag, making it a worthwhile purchase.  I would also like to see (and gladly pay for) some DLC/expansions to further increase the depth of the game (greater variety of missions, more ships, more weapons, more factions, expand main storyline, more musc, online co-op play)End transmission?

												Rebel Galaxy is one of those games I would call ""delightfully average"". Pros exceed the cons of the game, and replay-value exists. Well, at least after a while of not playing the game. I grabbed the game on a small sale, and played about 80-90 hours so it worked for me. However, there's of course the bad sides, like in almost any game. Only two dimensions available for maneuvering, mundane npc-encounters, a bit grindy and relatively short + clichéd storyline.If you love hearty rock, space fluff and naval style warfare ---> Grab a copy, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, keep that wallet in line.			"

												26 hours in and I'm basically in world 2.  When I play this game, I keep thinking that this is what Freelancer should have been.  When I played Freelancer, I had a ""was that it?"" feeling.  Contrarily, Rebel Galaxy gives off a ""not JUST a space flight adventure simulator"" sort of vibe.Yay:- Ignore the story, earn money, buy really big ships.- Ability to join multiple guilds without needing to quit your current one- Broadside combat in a space sim is surprisingly fun.- Very responsive devs, check the bug reports part of the forum- Prices of commodities go up and down in response to world events and planetary type- Wide variety of missions.  Escort, Pickup, Delivery, Blockade Running, Head hunting...- No speed lanes, you want to get somewhere fast just point your nose and punch the warp.- Dynamic system.  In Wing Commander: Privateer, you could watch the news and respond accordingly to major events.  Is there a famine?  Bring food.  War?  Bring weapons.  Market glut, buy low.  This system is rarely found in these space trading games.  I don't think Freelancer had it.- Good voice acting- Intuitive game design- Aliens!- Varied Nebulas.  Including the classic ones like lightning nebulas that can shatter your shields in a single flash and dark nebulas where danger and mystery lurk within.- Scanner.  A nifty halo emits from your ship and lets you know of nearby enemies, allies, and items.Nay:- Broadside combat is rather easy.  Just manuever until your side is exposed, use precise targetting, and press a button.  The lead is automatically calculated for you.  The only thing you need to decide is how much time to charge the shot.- Fighters are so annoying since they can go to the 3rd dimension.  Plus the strike craft defense options are a bit lacking due to their extremely limited range.  You're left with relying on general-purpose turrets to pick off the pesky gnats one at a time.- No speed lanes.  Most of the time, I neglect to plot a proper course before warping so I end up going through like 3 asteroid fields, 2 debris fields, and 1 planet.  That's like hitting 6 red lights when you're trying to get somewhere.Meh:- No idle radio chatter- From what I've played so far, you pass lots of planets but there is no planetary landing.  You always stop at a station in orbit.  I'm guessing the idea is that space ships should stay in space where they're designed to work. "

												Rebel Galaxy is a cautios recommendation. For 20€ it's a good game. It has some major flaws, but I would still call it a good game at the end of the day. I'll try this review in a different format, because this is a game that could have been a hidden gem of the year if developers had a little different focus. So:What this game should have had First and absolutely foremost: Context. That was SUCH a huge miss. The game provides no context for anything outside of the main quest.Missions and systems have zero context. They are condensed to a marker on the map. No characters to talk to, no multiple ways to complete missions, no multi-staged missions, no consequences. Even faction missions have absolutely no context. Every trader is one of two possible models, they all have exactly the same lines, regardless of where and how you meet them.All mercenaries are 5 characters that inexplicably appear in every system on random stations and can't be interacted with beyond ""Hey, what ship you fly?"", ""What's your skills?"" and ""You are hired"". Really really huge miss, because the mechanics of this game are very simplistic and can not justify the complete absence of context. Fast travel. 90% of the gameplay time is wasted on the annoying warp mechanic. There's no fast travel and you have to go between stations very often. During warp you have to manually aim your ship and it won't exit out of warp unless you aim it dead on point, so you can't just alt-tab and check email. You have to stare at the screen.You get pulled out of warp on every tiny object to the side of your path. And there are a LOT of meaningless tiny objects in this game. You can not engage warp again until after you are cleared from any mass, and it takes a while to accelerate enough to start warping again so travelling turns into an incredibly boring and frustrating experience that you have to endure a lot.What this game should have ditched to get the aboveScale. The game is absolutely unnecessarily large. You have something like 12 systems (don't remember exact number), each has about as many space stations. To travel through the whole map and visit every station once would require a full day of gameplay. And EACH station has like 6 contract missions, all of which are done with one of 3 main templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort), and might as well be MMORPG repeating quests. All of the stations are exactly the same. They vary only in what merc sits inside and the prices they offer on goods. The bartenders have the same dialogue, there are no interesting quests to pick up, no characters to talk to. Hell - even weapons and ships they offer are the same. Only faction stations offer different equipment. All in all it's a typical quantity over quality issue. The game could have been 10 times smaller (not exaggerating, I actually think that would be the proper reduction), but if it had actually interesting quests with dialogue, context and variety to offer it would have been much better for it.Economy. It's just uninteresting and not worth your time.The entire economy in the game could be thrown out and it wouldn't be missed. It's your basic buy low sell high economy, except fetching goods in this game, as I've explained, is tiresome and frustrating, and there's no market manipulation you can perform. The money you get out of it is rather small, overall I just don't think there's any reason to try and make money with it. It's not an MMO. There's no infinite high end equipment and clans and raids you can spend that dosh on. You can buy one of the overpriced heavy dreadnaughts, but... why? They aren't fun to use and what would you use it for anyway? Fetching more goods? It's just pointless and wasted resources IMO.Equipment could have been made into upgradable loot drops - you can't buy gear, but you can upgrade it with dosh and missions. That would have made the game far more engaging too, bring some variety in. As it stands, once I bought a full combo of guns, I just used the same set of equipment throughout the entire game, upgrading it.So as you can see there are some big issues. So what's good?What's good?Combat. It's very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag naval combat, just in Space. It's very cinematic, albiet not exactly difficult. It's by no means a sim, it's absolutely unrealistic and very arcady, but that doesn't really matter. It's fun. That's the main thing. Combat's difficulty comes from how the game is balanced - it is very binary. You are either not having any problems whatsoever, or you are dead. Ship's HP is very small. Your shields and armour are what protect you.  The main skill in this game is to turn your ship all the time to let the shields on another side regenerate. You must never let enemies surround you and you must maneuvre such that you take as little continuous fire as possible, while spreading the damage over all your shields. This is also a reason why you never want to fly a dreadnaught. Small ship that you can turn to spread damage across all your 4 shields and platings is more survivable than large ship which is gonna take all the damage to one side. Sountrack - amazing rock and country music, with cinematic arcade combat in a spectacle of lazers and explosions. What more could you ask for? Graphics - the game looks good obviously. Polish - the game runs well and never crashed or bugged out on me. Aliens - they look and sound cool. I think the alien languages aren't necessary, but the looks and voice modifiers are cool. Progression - there's a variety of cool ships on display and all except dreadnaughts are quite fun to use. Also there is a large variety of guns you can install, each with a specific strength and weakness. You can take control of any gun directly, through in my experience turrets are always better controlled by the AI. Usually you are better off controlling broadsides and maneuvering the ship for the most advantageous angle. Atmosphere. The game's light-hearted atmosphere with a few funny lines of text here and there blend well with combat and music.So in the end I think the game is quite good for what it is. I just think it would have been a hell of a lot better had the developers more clearly understood it's strengths and weaknesses. A cautious recommendation, but a recommendation nonetheless.			"

												After years and years of personally wishing for new space sims, Starpoint Gemini 2, Elite Dangerous and this game all came out within a year's time. Of the three games, this one has the glossiest presentation and best-presented story line. This is like Starpoint Gemini 2 in that the perspective is third person because you are controlling capital-ship sized vessels. There are many jobs and sidequests in addition to the story line and different factions that you can side with or against. Is this a hardcore sim? Absolutely not, but it is fun and combat heavy. Apparently in this galaxy there are hordes of pirates and alien raiders to do battle with...Recommended if you like flying around the galaxy and lots of explosions.			"

												Pros: - Space dogfighting. The broadside cannon system is interesting, and keeping the fighting mostly in 2D solves a lot of the problems associated with this idea. It's enjoyable for a while. - Good story. Interesting enough for the length of the game. - Great soundtrack - look for the playlist on Spotify. I love how when combat happens the music gets more aggressive. Cons:- So damn grindy. In between story missions you'll need to buy improvements on your ship. Have fun doing tons of redundant quests or flying everywhere trying to trade for money. - Speaking of trade, it's largely a waste of time. While you can certainly make money flying around and taking advantage of market conditions, there's never enough stock of anything to make large amounts of money without making the rounds of every solar system. Towards  the end of the game trade is outright worthless as any cargo drop from a ship is worth more than an entire shipload of cargo that you purchased. - Mining is worthless unless you get lucky, don't bother. I would have loved this game if there was more trade\mining options to improve your ship so that I could try different weapons configurations, but I never had enough cash, and the grind became too much for me so I just ended the game. I'm happy I played it if for no other reason than the soundtrack is so outstanding and I was introduced to a whole genre of music I've never listened to. But the game play is just meh.			"

												Did you ever watch Firefly and think ""Hey, it would be really cool with a game where I can be a space cowboy""?If no, that means you're either in the wrong place or you haven't watched Firefly. Go do that now.If yes, then look no further!Rebel Galaxy is a singleplayer open-world spaceship RPG set in distant future.As the player, you receive a message from your old aunt Juno asking you to travel to the frontier. Riddled with piracy, military conflicts, intrigues and other mysteries your arrival marks the beginning of a long journey.Aside from the story you can choose to undertake thousands (if not more) of different sidejobs, it can be anything from an escort mission to the elimination of a key pirate leader hiding in a asteroid field.Freedom is key and the player has many choices available to them, each granting you different perks but also changing the way the rest of the galaxy sees you.A player who help traders and merchants during distress calls or who actively pursue pirate fleets will be seen as friendly by the Confederate militia while a player who smuggles contraband, ambush militia patrols and disrupt authorities will be seen as a friend by the pirates.In Rebel Galaxy the systems you fly in feel very much alive, stopping at a station just to view the newsboard inside the bar is a good idea as it will provide you with all kinds of information regarding politics, bounties or good trading opportunities.Planets can go to war with eachother, raising the demand for military equipment which in turn allows you to profit from it. If you want the conflict to escalate you can destroy any treaty vessels which attempt to broke peace.Newsboard[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]Or maybe you're more of a honest businessman? If so tech booms and market gluts will be your best friends, lowering the value of goods at certain stations so you can buy them en masse only to sell them off at a fringe world for a hefty sum of credits.Market[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]If that doesn't sound like your type of gig you can always become a freelancing bountyhunter or mercenary, tracking down pirate lords or escorting merchants through rough space.The choice is yours.GameplayGameplay-wise Rebel Galaxy is pretty straightforward, with easy-to-understand mechanics, helpful tutorial prompts and simple controls.CombatIn Rebel Galaxy the combat relies on three things: turrets, broadside ports and secondary ports.When not controlled by the player, turrets will act independently and target any hostile craft within the range or specific craft (you can choose). Broadsides are your main weapons and are used to obliterate enemy capital ships, broadsides can be anything from lasers to cannons.Finally, secondary ports are used for equipping fixed weapons and launchers such as flak guns, dumbfire missile launchers or mine catapults.Overall it's a very straightforward system even though it does get a bit repetitive after a certain point.Controls & UIThe controls for Rebel Galaxy are simple and easy to understand, the player has access to full control mapping.As for the UI, it's very clean and elegant. It shows exactly what you need without cluttering up the screen.UI[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]All in all Rebel Galaxy is a fun game. While it might suffer from being repetitive at a certain point it's stilla solid game which I highly recommend.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. Look it up.Fly safe.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 38 hours. Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? Yes but... but if you are looking for a combat/ship/free space game  this is NOT it. A few words about this game? Firefly+Freelancer+Blues= Rebel Galaxy Are you comparing this one with Elite Dangerous? I did too and I chose this one. In fact, they are not the same kind of game, except both are in space. You don't know what's Firefly? Really?!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series) What's Freelancer? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game) Now i feel old... thanks.

Graphics:  I have been playing with downsampling at 4K -30Fps with my mid computer.  You can look at the screenshots included to see the graphics. The ships are well constructed: engines,  turrets, lateral cannons. The planets are good enough, you can't land anyway so...  The hyperspace effect is nicely done, and all the combat weapons, missiles, defense, shield effect are perfect. Now... the npcs are almost clones, you will find the same face over and over although you travel to the far corner of the galaxy. This is really a mess because you speak with a lot of merchants to trade/ rob them, with pirates, guards etc etc. If you are civilizan neutral (at least) you can acces to the cantina, and the bartender has his (i sadly didn't find even one woman bartender...) clone face, you say ok... I won't look at you more than 20 seconds. BUT when you are pirate neutral and go inside the cantina, you expect to find a different cantina with a different cloned bartender but in pirate rol... big mistake. It's the same civilian cantina, with the same bartender (really?)So, graphics approved but very repetitive. Edit: I found at last on my second run a Bartender ""woman""!!! In one of the last starbases of the farthest system... but there she is! (at least for my random generated game). Music: The game ost is really good. The compositor is Christopher Robert Adams and besides the good of his work, the game allows you to customize the directory of each kind of music (exploration,combat...) and you can put there your own ost. I, for exemple, have been listening  Cowboy Beebop.if you want to listen the ost take a look at this link https://www.reddit.com/r/RebelGalaxy/comments/3pe3xg/rebel_galaxy_soundtrack_double_damage_games_a/

Story: It's... simple but enought to do your way through the system, exploring, fighting, trading, and improving over and over your ship. From a little old carrier to the most powerfull destructor... don't expect much more.Take a look at the ships  http://rebelgalaxy.gamepedia.com/ShipsGameplay:I recommend to use a gamepad. And here comes the controversial point... Rebel Galaxy is a 2D space game. Besides, is single player and always in 3rd person (ship) view.   I could compare it to a naval ship combat, with cannons and lateral combat, where you have to change your flank because your enemy will sunk you if you continue on that side. It could be nasty, even an insult for those who think on space games like Elite or Star Citizen but damn... it's fun! I really enjoyed it, it has it's strategic point and you can be quickly destroyed if you rush into an enemy formation that you think that are weak. So, if you can look forward beyond games like ED or SC, you will enjoy it. One interesting thing. The entire game is redone each time you play, the connections of each system with another, the planets each system has, the type of planet, well, everything. You will play into a new universe each time you start a game. Space: The way you travel through system is using jumpgates, and it's instant travel. You can only navigate and explore each system, and to balance that, each system is really alive. Each time you travel from A point to B point, you will find something, let's say: traders convoys, pirates, milita ships, emergency beacons, space trash, nebulas, asteroid field, ice field, debris from older battles, a lot of stations from the different factions and planets, satellites which you can hack to get information... and more. In this game, space is old. Humanity has spread all over the place and thousands of years of races activity, has changed it and let their legacy. while you navigate you will see little pieces of  trash around your ship and if you destroy a big ship and you come back days later, you will find the debris.  Mods http://steamcommunity.com/app/290300/discussions/2/405691491120297253/ This mod will change some important things, add new ships to be able to use and rebalance others. Please read the description to be sure if you want to use it. Thanks to Timberrino for the link to this mod. Negative point: The cloned faces There are few mods. The repetitive missions.   "

												Rebel Galaxy is a bit of a strange bird. It is a spaceship game with a serviceable story told within a pseudo-sandbox game world. The game itself seems polished on initial inspection, but after hours of play certain odd design choices and rough edges start to show themselves.But is it fun?After accumulating 24 hours in the game and just now finishing up the main quest line, I have to say that it IS definitely fun. While the game has a tendency to force you to grind procedurally generated missions, a common issue in open world sandbox games, I have to say that this is one of the few games where the grind did not bother me! Rather fun combat, decent mission variety, and a plethora of (somewhat) profitable side activities keep the game fresh and the amazing looks that the ships have make you want to keep going until you've got that one last shiny battleship. Another thing to note is that this game absolutely BLEEDS Firefly (a fairly popular short TV series) and really captures the feeling of flying around the galaxy in a trusty ship while smuggling goods and blasting other pilots to space bits in a way I, personally, haven't experienced before.Before I get into the nitty gritty details of the game, here's a TL;DR score: 7/10 (I'd say drop it down to a 6/10 if you don't really love spaceships or Firefly).Sound:If you overlook the fact that there really shouldn't be any sound in space, the sound is, in general, pretty good! Lasers sound like lasers, cannons go boom, and explosions seems appropriate! They can get a bit repetitive after a while, but that's to be expected in a longer game like this.Music:The music is awesome! If you've seen Firefly the music will really give you some flashbacks to the show. However, the selection in the game seems rather similar and you start to hear the same thing over and over again. Got to the point where I had to mute the music at times.Voice:The voice work in this is passable, but nothing special. While there weren't really any cringe-worthy moments, I never felt like the actors' performance or the script really pulled me in. The aliens and robots sound pretty neat though!Graphics:The game is pretty freaking gorgeous in my opinion. While not the most graphically impressive game out there, the galaxy looks pretty vibrant and the graphical effects that surround your ship when you are warping around the map is pretty great. The ships themselves look awesome and there are a couple of different ship lines in the game that offer varied ship aesthetics! The UI looks decent but is nothing special.Gameplay:The gameplay in this title is a bit of a mixed bag. The combat is a blast, however little things about it can start to bother you. For instance, the game is played on a flat plane, however at times when ships get close to you they tend to leave that plane to fly around you and at times this makes hitting them with your broadsides feel like a total crapshoot. Unfortunately, if you don't like the combat in this game, you might want to look elsewhere as the other activities in the game such as mining and trading are somewhat underdeveloped and are in general nowhere near as profitable as combat missions which will result in the currency grind becoming much more difficult than I believe it should be. One other huge issue I had with the game was that the UI is very unfriendly for mouse and keyboard users. Everything else in the game works fine with a mouse and keyboard, but the UI is clunky and is not mouse friendly at all, in many cases requiring you to use WASD to navigate. Lastly, certain weapon types in the game seem rather underpowered, in some cases to the point of being completely useless, and there is very little meaningful change-ups in terms of the gameplay as the game progresses.Final Verdict:I think this game is a lot of fun. While it is definitely rough around the edges and features a noticeable grind, it kept me playing for a full 24 hours and I am not the kind of person who typically enjoys grinds in games. Would I buy it at full price? Probably not. However, I think the game is worth a play despite all of its flaws and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to pick it up during a sale or in a bundle. Rebel Galaxy gets a thumbs up from me!			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun, arcadey space game that feels like a mix between Sid Meier's Pirates, Freelancer/WC:Privateer, and Assassin Creed: Black Flag naval boardsides combat combined with a cheesy/awesome Western-Rock soundtrack.There is a main storyline but you don't really have to follow it that much, you can just go around trading/mining/fighting/exploring, but the meat of the game is in the fighting. Thankfully the fighting is pretty fun. Instead of playing as a fighter or small freighter/gunship like many of these types of open-ended/sandbox space games, you start out in a Corvette and eventually work your way up to larger ships, I believe there is roughly 20 playable ships in all. As has been mentioned, the combat plays something like Assassin's Creed Black Flag ship battles, maneuvering on a 2D plane, with a heavy emphasis on broadsides and positioning. Your ship is outfitted with a main battery of broadside cannons as well as some turrets and secondary weapons (like missile launchers). You can customize the weapons of your ship with stuff like long/short range guns, beam lasers, missile turrets, anti-fighter/missile flak guns, etc etc.The game is surprisingly colorful and ships explode into big bright fireballs when they die. Its fun. The music, as I've mentioned is cheesey western butt-rock and, IMO, quite nice. However if its not your thing, or if you just get bored of it, the game has an option to put your own music into the game (alongside or replacing the soundtrack). I haven't progressed too far into the main plot, but this doesn't seem like the kind of game most would play for a gripping plot, as its pretty basic so far. Basically your aunt, an (in)famous smuggler and overall space Rogue, sends you a package containing a weird alien artifact and the access codes to one of her old ships and tells you to meet up with her and you go off to get into cool space battles and track her down.The game is only $20 and so far it seems like a lot of fun for that price.

												PROS:-Combat is amazing fun and engaging, combat is fast and the explosions are satifying-your ship feels like a formula 1 racer in the emptiness of space-space isn't that empty in this game-ships feel huge unlike a lot of titles the capital ships feel like a force of power-free to do as you please-better story than mostCONS:-trading is not that great a career as a trader is silly due to being a little profit career-characters are not memorable, even if the voice acting is miles above other space titles-missions are kind of repeating killing and shipping things-the starter ship really doesnt show the games golden eggsOVERALL:great title totally worth 20 bucks I'd say 8/10, hoping for DLC or Rebel Universe (Rebel Galaxy 2) :D			"

												Simply put. this game knows what fun is. Combat is engaging and fun. Soundtrack is amazing. Completely open world. Real-time economy system. Different factions to work for and become allies or enemies. There is a story, but you can completely ignore it if you so choose so. Too much to talk about in this game. The game is just good. Try it.Full review:

												I had a hard time getting into this at first, because it doesn't hold your hand, and I'm a carebear. Then I watched a tutorial on suggestions to get started, what to spend your money on, and that I should rent a mercenary. Then I absolutely started trashing other ships and it was hella fun. The soundtrack is fantastic, the combat is really satisfying, and I love that you can customize your weapon loadouts and ships, depending on what you want to do. I thought the galaxy was ENORMOUS- zooming out to the map and back into your ship a-la Eve Online gives you a really good perspective of how tiny you are compared to everything else. Then I realized there are like 15 other galaxies and I haven't even gone to the second one yet. I like the characters so far, particularly aunt Juno. I like that you can work for other factions, and end up being an as$hole pirate, an as$hole military agent, an as$hole smuggler, or an as$hole nice guy. It's very quest based, so if that's not for you, then you may not like it, but I dig doing quests/bounties and getting money and upgrading my weapons and ship, I find it satisfying. Really enjoying this game, I feel like the marketing fell through and it hasn't gotten as much attention as it should have.			"

												Wow. I'll admit, I went into this game without much knowledge of it at all... and after the time I've spent with it, I can only say... Rebel Galaxy is totally badass!However, allow me to explain the basics of the game. Simply, you're a Space Cowboy, living on the edge of the law and banditry. You explore the vastness of space, blasting away pirates or helping them incinerate innocent traders while completing missions and getting rich. You get your own equipment customizable spaceship where you can fire broadsides, flak, missiles and all sorts of vaporizing goodness. There are even quite a few ships that you can purchase should you gain enough money. The concept is simple, the gameplay is addicting.Gameplay Footage:

			This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! I've always wanted to be a Space Cowboy!		

The game also has an epic sound track of catchy guitar twangs as you blow Space Pirates into nonexistence. The voice acting is also very solid. As if that wasn't good enough, the gameplay is fluid and the controls make sense. While the control isn't as indepth as Space flight sims like Elite: Dangerous, it's more than enough to keep players interested while also keeping the gameplay fast-paced.All in all, I definitely recommended this game!

												Rebel Galaxy is an indie space game with a variety of star systems to explore and endless number of procedurally generated missions to complete. It shares some similarities with Freelancer, but the core gameplay is rather different.While the game does feature trading and mining, the main draw is clearly the space battles. Unfortunately the combat itself is a rather shallow experience. All ships apart from enemy/allied fighters are restricted to a 2D plane and all your main weapons are fired as a single broadside, so in practice the game often feels more like a naval game than a proper space game. It's fun in small sessions, but gets repetitive really quickly.This isn't helped by an extremely poor item system and ridiculous economy. Both seem to be lifted straight from a bad MMO, which doesn't make any sense in a single player game. Overall you spend way too much time traveling through empty space and grinding pointless side missions to earn enough cash for the next tier of upgrades so you can actually continue with the main game.The setting is quite generic but has enough of a Firefly vibe to keep things somewhat interesting. Unfortunately the main story is not that memorable either and there's not enough variety with the side missions. There's also a faction system, but this didn't seem to add much to the overall game.While I found Rebel Galaxy enjoyable in short sessions, overall I'd consider it too flawed to recommend. Between the shallow combat and the repetitive missions the game got boring well before I finished it.The good:- Combat can be fun in small dozes- Bigger space battles can be impressive and quite hectic- Nice soundtrackThe bad:- Shallow combat mainly restricted to a 2D plane- Repetitive missions and random encounters- Grindy with extremely lazy item design- Story is forgottable and the ending is extremely lackluster- Trading and mining felt somewhat pointlessThe ugly:- Some graphics issues in DX9 mode, switching to DX11 fixed these- Overuse of shader effects and some of the weapons look downright terrible- Even the small space rocks inhibiting your warp drives- Warp pairing with friendly targets is a broken mess			"

												I decided to change my review of this game to offer up points of why the game falls short. I'll summarize this as much as possible. If you want a very short review it is posted below.The super short review :6 out of 10 ( Good for fist timers and the younger gaming crowd )Anyone expecting a game with depth in story line and ship functionality will be disappointed. The story line is predictable, the benefits are minimal, everyone wins gaming.Would I play this game again? No, probably not unless the developer added many more features and vastly improved the game AI.  The good:Overall a good looking game.Runs well, smooth.  No crashes.Great sound track.Multiple paths to follow to end game ( Merchant, Pirate, Combat, Miner )The Bad:You ""fly"" on a single plane and cannot go up or down. While this is a space game I feel ike I am driving a tank or playing a FPS. The weapons systems on your ship shoot through your ship most of the time. It is a race to get Mark 5 / 6 items, you could do without but then you may have a harder times with the game.You simply follow a simple path to the end game.There is never a bounty placed on your head for the waves of AI you slaughter, your participation is not recognized in this game at all, this includes news stories.Between Story line missions upgrading your ship is essential to completing the next mission you will not know this until you jump in and have a WTF moment.There is no communication between stations for commodities ( minerals and goods ) thus what you buy for in one place might not be worth anything in another or one system over it is double in price. You will never know unless you go there. Ships and ship components are at 100% trade in and up value.  Thus switching out weapon systems is never a loss nor is it better from one place to another.The AI never recognizes you. Sure while you can slaughter pirates whole sale in the hundreds, save countless traders or conduct crippling raids against the AI at no point does the dialog or your player presence change anything in the game. It is one dimensional.  There are always more AI, Going to a pirate faction station and eliminating everything in sight does nothing. The stations cannot be destroyed so eradicating a system of pirate activity is impossible. Random encounters with AI fleets are pointless. Unless there is a bounty loot drops will not even pay for your spent missiles or damage you may take. Best to just avoid them.The face you see of the AI are all the same. Pirates will taunt you and well this is the 100th time you killed that same pirate. Aliens all look the same also. Even some side characters look just like the random pirates as well as the Militia.The lines for the AI or NPCs are the same and repetitive.Trell the AI the story line revolves around makes some minor upgrade to your ship. These are nothing amazing just some sensor and defensive bumps. The only time you interact with Trell is when she wants something ( typical woman ) For an AI with vast knowledge you would think she would tell you how to boost your weapon performance or make some great weapon system or a new type of ship.... nope.I came here to save Criminal Aunt Juno. However the dialogue with here does nothing to tell me why it would be worth it. No back story to tell me why I'd risk my♥♥♥♥♥to save this woman from the crap she got herself into.   Random AI gotcha moments, taking on a merchant mission with a low threat level was not really low at all. This was a game breaking moment for me because it made no sense what so ever. Enemy ships appear out of nowhere, surround your ship and disable it thus killing your mobility. This continually happens while fleets ( from fighters to dreadnaughts ) of AI pop up randomly. To sum it up the game mechanics cheat. You can attempt to run or if you have the right ship component ( so I am told ) nullify the effects of the disabling missiles.  The end game moments are really nothing special. I never got attached to Trell, she did nothing but get me into trouble, heck her upgrades were minimal at best. The was no big glorious end game movie clip or anything special for saving the galaxy from a deadly invasion. After all this Juno buys you a drink and that is the game.The end game:I wanted to finish up achieving the end game in the most ""advanced"" combat ship with a decent fitting. There was a level of satisfaction at that point because annihilating even a super dreadnaught AI at the end was easy.  Completed with mark 5 / 6 equipped Black Gate Dreadnaught 54,000,000 credits, 1498 enemy ships destroyed. This tacked on another 5 hours of game play before I took on the end game mission. The threat level went from Very High to Low.Wasted time, I spent a couple of hours sorting out the AI ""cheat issue"" with the Merchant mission before walking away from the missions. Ironically the combat missions were less dangerous. Exploration, mining and other activities burned up a few hours also. So in 20 to 24 hours you can complete this game with a solid kitted out ship.			"

												Aiming to misbehave is not only rewarded but maybe even required to survive in Rebel Galaxy. Your goals are simple in the black, live, make money, and take care of anyone who tries to stop you from doing the other two. To help you is your trusty vessel of death and destruction, which can be armed to the teeth with guns, missiles, hull upgrades, shields, and gods know what. Along the way you will meet some interesting folk whom may or may not have your best interest at heart. While the main campaign does an okay job of expanding the universe. The meat of the game lies in combat, random events, and upgrading your vessel. The game itself is gorgeous, you can almost feel the sizzling heat of your cannons firing. The explosions of missiles rocking across your ship, and satisfaction of watching your enemies explode in a fiery death. All the ships look unique, the weapons have the proper amount of oomph behind them, and the soundtrack is a homage to Firefly. On top of all that sweetness, the game is really easy to get into and start playing. The game really reminds of AC: Black Flags naval combat, just this is in space. Same level of simplicity with more customization in weapons. Now Rebel Galaxy does have its occasional black holes. There are times where repetitive missions come into play and are required for equipment advancement. Lack of cosmetic customization feels like a miss in an outstandingly done game. The games story itself does feel like it could be a bit more exciting as well. Occasionally during combat it does feel odd you can't move up or down in space. Despite these issues, the game is still extremely well made. No bugs ever interrupted my gameplay. As far as replay goes, there are multiple factions to pursue an allegiance with and multiple play styles you can choose from. Be a bounty hunter, cartel member, or trader, the choice is up to you what role you will play in Rebel Galaxy.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Pros+ The game is massive and from my understanding the systems are randomly generated, so you'll never hit the same systems on a different playthrough. It is probably not as large as other space-sims, however.+ There's lots of things to do, which checks off most of the traditional space-sim tropes: Mining, Trading, Bounty Hunting to name a few as well as a good variety of side missions which cover your basic 'go to point A and blow stuff up' runs to things like 'Go to station B and run/break a blockade to deliver goods'. I've played for 30+ hours in a game which cost me a third of the amount a AAA game does.+ The games events and economy, while basic, are a living thing. They'll play out whether you're there or not. If a station is hit by a crime wave, it will remain until someone goes and cleans it up, whether it's you or the AI militia. Trade convoys cross the system and deliver goods, which effects the prices you buy and sell for. If pirates (or you!) happen to cross paths with them on their trip the items will never get there, which may cause their stock to drop and their sell prices to rise.+ The soundtrack is awesome and makes the game very reminiscent of Firefly. It fits the game incredibly well and makes battles against enemy cap-ships all the sweeter+ Broadside combat is excellent, and remarkably fun. No longer do you just point at an enemy and click - your shields and armor are seperated in to quadrants and you constantly have to think about the best maneuvers to maximise damage while protecting your vulnerable sides. You can even direct-control the turrets on your ship, as well as deploying flak, EMP's, Mines or missiles. + Good variety of ships and weapons. Yeah, they're all cap-ships but that's the name of the game. You're not just some no-name rookie making your name running your fighter from a carrier. You captain corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and even dreadnaughts fitted out with machine guns, missile launchers, pulse lasers, beam lasers, flak cannons and your beastly broadside weapons.+ In almost every regard the game is top-notch: the aesthetics are excellent, the controls are excellent, the sound design is immersive, the world is immense and the gameplay is, most importantly, fun. + The best custom soundtrack integration I've seen in a recent game, you get to pick which tracks play in combat, stations, while cruising... hell - there's even an option to mix your tracks with the original soundtrack.+ Piracy pays in this game - one of my favourite pass-times in this game is responding to merchant distress calls with a few tons of high-price cargo in my posession. Save the merchants, sell the cargo to them at a premium and then threaten them to hand back what I just sold them for free. It's a brilliant way of making some extra cash.+ 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment and ships, so there's never any risk of being stuck with expensive gear you decide you don't like.Cons:- Missions can become a little repetative after a while, although if you begin to feel like this you'll realise it's because you've played the game for a decent stretch of time- Travelling across a system can take a little too long sometimes, even with engine upgrades I'm never feeling like I'm moving fast enough while in warp- Difficulty can spike without warning, usually when you equip your first bit of next-tier tech: there's a reason even the bartenders tell you to upgrade shields and armor before weapons.- Voice acting is 'just' OK. The npc voice pool is shallow and some of the emotional delivery is pretty bland.- The dialogue options really don't serve a purpose. it boils down to 'Option one to be a coward and drop your cargo', 'Option two to politely refuse and lose a faction point', 'Option three to be a badass renegade, 'Option 4 to be a badass renegade and ♥♥♥♥ off this faction' all of which provoke the most pitiful and monotonous responses. If you want to be a badass renegade, be prepared to hear 'I hope you like the cold, Cutter' without an ounce of anger or fear behind it 9/10 times.- This game could have really benefited from a sort of 'infamy system', which, depending on your net-worth, loadout, faction standing or how much ♥♥♥ you tend to kick provided a little more of an emotional response from your attackers. No matter what you do, say or how many of those pirate jack-offs you just disintegrated, they will always give you the same responses - 'drop your cargo or die', 'no? ok, now you will die'. They even say it if you've literally just wiped out all their health and their ship is about to explode.- While the soundtrack is awesome, it's short and the tracks cycle every time the situation changes - it's rare you'll hear one all the way through. I don't think there's more than 10 tracks in total and some of those are instrumental versions of the others. It begins to grate a little around the 9 hour mark - thank god for custom soundtracks. The 'Sons of the North' and 'These Savage Lands' Albums by The Black Spiders fit the game incredibly well IMO and have saved me from getting sick of the original soundtrack.- Once you finish the story, get yourself a dreadnaught and kit it out with 6th Tier tech there isn't really any motivation to continue. The story missions aren't particularly exciting enough to play again so your only goal after that really is to make money that you can't spend on anything. It's unlikely you'll feel motivated enough to commit to a second playthrough due to the 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment. If you have a Blackgate with Mark 6 Beam Turrets, Beam Broadsides and Defense tech then you can literally sell it 1:1, which lets you switch to any other ship you may have missed. The only way to screw yourself out of money late-game is either by trading like an idiot, fighting like an idiot or recruiting mercs who are idiots.Unsure:+/- Yes, it's been said countless times: there's no Y axis of movement. However with broadside combat I believe the game is better off for it. This game would be frustrating levels of fiddly control-wise trying to move up and down, while trying to maintain target lock with your broadsides/control lateral movement while aiming your turrets, while trying to line up your secondaries and maneuvre your ship to keep your target on your strongest side.Summary:There's a lot more they could have done with the ""Negotiate"" part of the game (they put that part of the tagline in quotations? has no-one else mentioned that?), it can get a little bit same-y and repetative after long stretches and it could do with more ship and loadout options but in the end the game is pure space-cowbow fun. My interest only began to waver at the end when I suddenly realised I had enough money to cover buying everything in the game and completing station missions, trading, mining or pirating were not only no-longer a challenge in my mile-long Dreadnaught, but also no longer pushing me towards any kind of goal. This is, however, over 30 hours in while most AAA titles struggle to hold my interest for more than 8 hours.If you love Firefly and the space-sim genre but are put off by the overly-complex nature of some of them then give this a shot, it's the one you've been waiting for. Even if games like X and ED are your bread and butter, buy this as a sort 'tune out and have mindless fun' kind of game to sink a few hours in to. Despite it's lackluster story and character performances as well as a few missed opportunities in gameplay design, primarily it's a game where you're expected to have fun blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and besides Jahovas Witnesses, who doesn't like that?

												Imagine you're playing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.  Now, imagine that instead of being stuck with that one, tiny, but somehow infinitely upgradable little ship, you can actually buy new ships as your fortunes improve.  Now, imagine you're in space.  Finally, imagine you don't have to get out of the ship to follow some British ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around the island for 20 minutes in an area that is suddenly, inexplicably teeming with soldiers.I think I got sidetracked.  Anyway.  This is an excellent quasi-3D ship combat game.  Not a full 3D sim like Freelancer... all player-piloted ships, and those of similar size, seem to occupy the same plane of space.  Rolls, climbs, and dives are not valid maneuvers.  Shields go fore, aft, port, starboard, with no concern for doral or ventral.  Despite this, you don't feel particularly limited in your play.  It's just streamlining something that can overly complicate some other games.There is some downside.  There isn't a lot of variety to your available weaponry.  The targeting AI that controls your turrets most of the time is kinda stupid, and works in exclusive terms, rather that allowing prioritization.  There are, inevitably, escort missions, some of which you will lose for no good reason.  The in-game economy is a little capricious, which makes moving goods profitably as a trader a bit of a long game.  But I still find it enjoyable to spend a few hours making pretty explosions in space, set to a soundtrack that you might find playing in Jim Raynor's house back on Mar Sara- forgettable, upbeat, twangy rock.

												Two dudes got together, drank some energy drinks, and rocked out to Clutch while storyboarding a game.   They needed some fast cash to get their Chevy Nova off the cinder blocks, and had to do it both cheap & good.  They took the basic engine from Torchlight, used it to make a galaxy, and replaced people with spaceships.  They set it to motion with steel guitars, particle effects, and lots of badass.  Rebel Galaxy was born.Do you want to be a badass outlaw space trucker?  Can you deal with not being able to go up & down, an do barrel rolls in exchange for easy to use controls & fun combat?  Can you tell your OCD tendencies to STFU & just enjoy the content?  Most importantly, do you want to be a badass outlaw space trucker?Rebel Galaxy:  Malt liquor & unfiltered cigarettes not included.			"

												I purchased this game on sale at the time for $10 bucks hoping for a fun little space adventure............ 281 in-game hours later and all 37 achievements I would have gladly paid the full $20 price. Rebel Galaxy was satisfying in many ways with very few bugs that i noticed (escort missions being the main issue). With that being said, the trailer is only slightly misleading and i do wish the game had a more involved story and some extra content (DLC involving quest lines and new ships). In all fairness, my final judgement is 9.5/10 BEST 2d plane space game i have played in a long time and i have hopes that I will see Rebel Galaxy 2 someday.......			"

												If you are looking for positive affirmation that this game is worth buying, then stop here and buy it now.Every time I start this game, the start menu music sets the ""Firefly"" vibe of the Wild-West frontier in space.This game is fun and reminds me of playing privateer all those years ago, as a space captain just trying to make a living on the edge of known civilization.Finally, with regards to the Forum-Warriors that loudly whine and lament the lack of Multi-Player, go and play Fractured Space, or even Elite Dangerous if you really need to have PvP or Co-Op.To me one as a time poor Dad, one of the best things about this game is that it is a SOLO PvE game, that I can pause any time, or save and exit anytime without losing my progress.

												Much too grindy and relatively easy. Money is everything - the story itself isn't really driving the game (at least for me).I admit that the game is very enjoyable for the first few hours, but it becomes boring and then annoying. The Equipment/Weapon system is extremely linear (replace Mk 1 with Mk 2, then Mk 3 etc....) and in order to follow the main story line you have to grind through the typical MMO-style missions to buy better equipment...a lot...You cannot capture ships.You cannot make more profit with trading than with missions/fighting, as the trading system is a joke (trade volume is much too small).Fights are fairly unrewarding  (literally ... as most enemies only drop sh**) and boring after you found the best approach to them. It is not true that you cannot fight (slightly) stronger enemies, but at some gear-level difference there is no amount of tactical thinking that will save you.For the rest this game feels like a walking simulator...in space. It is very very very similar to starpoint gemini 2 in that respect.... you watch your ship slowly warping through space for a long time (even with upgrades), and the worst part: any stone/asteroid/enemy/ally you come close to during warping will kick you out of warp (""Warp inhibited by stellar mass"")...after 50 times of this I just cannot take it any more.

												Coming from the guys behind the first two Diablo games and Torchlight, I had some pretty high expectations for this game...and it *delivers*.  The combat is fun and frantic, the graphics are good, the interface is decent, but what made me sit up and pay attention was the soundtrack.  My god, the soundtrack.  No techno-electronica or big orchestras here.  What you get is a hardcore mix of blues, rock and jazz that really just fits better with the Firefly/Cowboy Bebop feel of the setting.  Anyone who puts Blues Saraceno into a used-future space combat game can have my money.  Hearing ""Evil Ways"" start as you get jumped by pirates is a straight-up rush!			"

												I finished the game, and it's time to write a love letter to Travis and Erich and all the people they contracted out for ship modeling / designs / voiceovers, etc.THANK YOU.From the bottom of my brown coat pocket, this is a game that immediately put me in what I could only imagine before ... something resembling the Firefly universe. I think you hit the absolutely sweet spot of fun / progression / story and artwork. I sometimes lost myself flying around, you made it really feel like I was out in outer-space, with the wide variety of planets / nebulas / junk fields / ice fields / asteroid fields, what have you. The sheer number of stations and objects you would run into while out in the cold really made it feel great. The care & thought you put into the simplified UI design was nothing short of brilliant. Simple & elegant.  I thought you had thought of everything and once when flying, my UI popped up and said ""It's been a while since you saved, you should dock at a station to save your game"" or something - then I knew you HAD thought of everything. The story was engaging, and the missions were enough of a large variety. Trade missions, assasination, protection, dead drops, the game really gives you a lot of options. So many cartels to see which one's you'll join / fight. The emergent game play - the distress signals (and ability to trade with the merchants was again a wise design choice as it reinforces saving their butts ;-), the un-identified signals, getting popped out in a junk or ice field, you made what should be a very empty space interesting while travelling around. For two guys and a small army of outside contractors / agents that you employed, this game rocks. I'm so glad that you decided to make this game. THANK YOU!!			"

												Having now played 60 hours into my first Rebel Galaxy playthrough, I feel i can give this game a solid review.Pros:- Awesome graphics (on max settings) that somehow find the right balance between cartoon-ish and realistic.- The ships are very customizable and they all look amazing, with pros and cons to each of them.- Custom music for any area of the game. (if you want to have shopping mall music in your space stations more power to you)- Simple yet effective combat system that relies heavily on shield management and ship positioning. (unless you want to repair at every station you dock at)- Accessible trading system. (buy when red, sell when green)- Good replayability due to the procedurally generated star systems.Cons:- WARP INHIBITED BY STELLAR MASS (this will be burned into your psyche) Literally everything kicks your ship out of warp once you are within 3.0 sm (solar mile??) of it. At least give me the option to smash my ship into an asteroid at warp if i'm that dumb.. this would be equivalent to getting demounted in an MMO every time you were within a few meters of a large rock or a tree... or another player.- While vast, the galaxy, and the solar systems feel lifeless. You will realize very quickly that you are playing a single player game in the cold loneliness of space.- Mining, is borderline pointless once you're at the point in the game where a single upgrade is well over $1,000,000. This is because the average mining drop is either obtanium or meteoric diamonds which sell for $1,000~, and $20,000~ respectively.- I found the default music to be irritating after listening to it for over 5 hours, though some people like it, at least there is the option to play without music or use your own.- The combat is mostly automated and based on whether your ship is stronger than the other one or not... not much outmaneuvering is possible in Rebel Galaxy, so you don't get rewarded for being a better pilot than your opponent.. that and the enemy AI is pretty terrible.- The economy and commerce of the game is completely random, so it makes trading at times very frustrating. Also, some comodoties becomes obsolete due to the limited storage space you have because of how little they sell for. There is also no way to sort or filter the viewing of the comodoties at stations, which you'd think would just be common sense. Any game in this day and age that has an auction house type system has the ability to sort and filter it. What i found to be the best way of making money was to just amass a ton of expensive comodoties and fly around the galaxy and rescue merchants. After resucing them, they will buy your stuff for the max market value, and you also get the cargo of whatever ship they were under fire from.- The story is very simplistic with some unique enemies generated from the missions, but overall it lacks any sort of emotional attachment to the characters or development of said characters. I will say however that The final mission with Trell's goodbye left me a bit dissatisfied, not sad mind you, just annoyed that there was no CGI end sequence like there was at the start of the game. Or even mid-game when she was telling you about how countless past civilizations used her for war etc. Would it have broken the budget to make a cutscene like that while she's explaining her origins? Probably.Overall, the game was fun to play, and advance with the new ships that i upgraded to, but i'm skeptical that i'll be coming back for round 2 anytime soon. Maybe if the weapons were more varied or the trading and economy was more flushed out the game would feel warmer and more dynamic, but i guess this is what you get for a budget title.Rating - 7/10			"

			These are my first impressions of Rebel Galaxy for PC This is not intended to be a considered review. Please keep that in mind when deciding weather or not to pick up the game.		

TLDR: This is another game that needs a maybe button. It's a standard space sim and if that's what you are looking for there is a lot to enjoy here. However, if you are looking for something new then this isn't the game for you. It's also important to note that this is not a serious sim, and it isn't very realistic. However, it's presented well and has a more fun and light hearted theme that some will enjoy. For more please watch the video.			"

												Played this and was essentially excited at first.  I thought ""Woohoo Space Pirate"".  RPG element was something I don't mind and kinda look forward to.  However what killed it for me was the fact that you're in a big cruiser-type ship and you're stuck driving the thing around like a car on a flat surface.  No going up or down, just forward, back, turn left, turn right.  Meanwhile your enemies use full range of 3 dimensional space swarming all around you going up, down, left, right, forward, backward and essentially while you're looking around you can't go up to catch them.  I've had problems where the enemies went way too far up for me to actually do enough damage so I had to give up on the fight.  Every planet and every piece of the galaxy is on a flat 2D surface except somehow the enemies are the only thing that can and will defy that logic.			"

												The only thing that stands out in Rebel Galaxy is music - a metal take on country genre. Otherwise, it's incredibly bland and nondescript: the galaxy is procedurally generated and so are missions (except story ones which aren't captivating either). The AI is bad, the world doesn't feel alive, NPC behavior is way off (a single bomber trying to rob a fully operational dreadnaught - that's par for the course here).Basically, it's a grindfest: you pop ships, buy bigger guns, pop bigger ships and so on until you get to top tier equipment. You can't turn the tide in galactic warfare. You can't make friends or even get in the news. So, in short: if you want a 2D procedurally generated game, play Space Rangers. It holds up well and offers much more nuanced gameplay than this.			"

												I have always been leery of space sims, hearing of the \'horror\' stories of EVE online and the sorts. That is, until my friend introduced me to this. It literally took me five minutes of listening to the soundtrack and watching him play the game for me to get hooked. It was one of the few games on Steam I purchased at full price, and I was not disappointed. Despite its Indie tag, it doesn\'t feel like an indie game. The visuals are spectacular, the campaign is entirely voice-acted (even the alien species), and the combat is great.I don\'t think I need to explain the plot or setting in detail. You\'re in space. You\'re finding ancient♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uhh... Untrustworthy aliens/Australians. That\'s all you need to know.This game does the RPG-style building-up of your equipment very well. You start with a dinky little ship with a laser. After you\'ve completed a few missions and/or saved/looted some traders, you can buy better lasers. But wait! Your ship\'s too small for any more lasers, and you\'re finding it difficult to deal with pirates/police! Well, now you\'ve got to get a bigger ship that can withstand more damage and wield more lasers. You complete a few missions and save/loot some more traders...The game gets progressively difficult in a way that takes you out of your comfort zone. You can continue to do missions in your current system where enemies aren\'t hard to beat, but the reward is significantly smaller than that in more difficult systems. Additionally, you can only get better upgrades to your ship in harder systems. Frequently, you\'ll find yourself battling against a superior opponent, only to either destroy them or escape at the skin of your teeth. The difficulty does peak at some point though. Enemies don\'t seem to get much harder or meatier just as you\'re able to get MK6 weaponry (last tier), while you can still acquire better ships and better equipment. Once you\'ve got the money to afford a Blackgate ship, the game is practically over.The trading system is not as powerful as simply completing missions, but I overheard that the trading system used to be busted, allowing players to make millions within an hour by only trading. Either way, you can still make a hefty sum from researching how each \'event\' changes commodity prices (such as when a planet/station\'s at \'War\', the price of Ammunition goes up). If you\'re looking for a great singleplayer game that\'ll most likely last your 10-20 hours, this is the perfect game, ESPECIALLY for an Indie game. It\'s not confusing, combat\'s satisfying, the soundtrack is rockin\', and... just, everything is there.			"

												First Impression: Fun.  Very fun.  Reminds me vaguely of Star Control 2 mixed with your standard Freelancer-style space game.  Combat is naval-style ""broadsides"" on a 2D plane (not true 3D space combat) but once you embrace that, it's well designed.  You really do get that feeling of capital ship combat, with mini-turrets blasting away at circling fighters and powering up your big guns to take... down... those damn sheilds.  Good good fun, and certainly worth the sub-20 dollar price.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fantastic throwback to games like privateer from my early child hood. Something happens your given a rust bucket from a family member and kicked out into space to do whatever you like. There is a story there if you'd like to explore it, but theres also a very large set of systems for you to get lost in. These systems start easy and quickly ramp up into fleets of doom that look like something out of babylon 5 or a borg invasion.Graphically the game is very pretty. Each weapon type has its own effects and its easy to tell what your oppents are using once you get familiarized with the types. You'll know when your enemy is shielding himself from your attacks and able to plan accordingly.Combat is a blast. Its a traditional ""sailing"" broadside system with a bit of a twist. There seems to be 2 types of ships. Broadside focused ships and turret focused ships. Turret ships have weaker broadsides so slightly less punch but they can hit in 360 degrees around their ship. Broadside ships usually have nasty blind spots at the front or back of their ships but if you end up on their sides your going to be sucking vacuum very quickly.Gameplay is very open. You can do simply the main storyline and just enough side quests to up your combat effectiveness for the next mission or you can join one of the guilds. Partake in trading, Mercenary work, Pirating, and evening mining to pay the bills. All of these have their own supporting play styles, missions, and equipment.Keep in mind that there are also factions in the game, so if you choose to start popping merchant ships for their yummy goodies expect to have to deal with that militia destroyer next time you hit a station.Alternatively there are TONS of randomized seemingly procedurally generated encounters as you fly along towards your missions or stations. Merchentmen calling for help under attack by pirates, pirates trying to lure you in with distress calls, communication beacons you can hack to get some secret info for trading, mining spots, or loot caches, and of course the occasionally massive fleet battle from one of the many factions who's decided to take a crack at each other.All of these features lead to making Rebel Galaxy on of my favorite games for the year and at a price point that is simply mind blowing.If you'd like a bit more info and see how the game plays before hand check out my lets play below.

												If you liked Privateer or Freelancer you will like Rebel Galaxy. Only caveat is the game is a 2D Naval Style Combat. But for the price, it can not be beat.			"

												Though it has its shortcomings in the story arena, it's really an excuse to join the upgrade treadmill in buying the biggest, nastiest, blow-things-up-est ship you can manage. It's all about playing missions to get money and buy those sweet, sweet weapons and armor upgrades until you have a veritable capital-ship erasing fortress. At the end of the game, I spent a good couple hours just annihilating missions for giggles; very fun!And a hint if you plan on playing this on easy mode: join the Merchant Guild ASAP. Equip your ship with Null-Grav Boosters. Occasionally they'll have a mission that's worth like 10x the average mission price because you're supposed to obtain materials and deliver them through a blockade. Obtain them by going to the Commodity Market and looking at which station supplies them. Go to that station, buy their stock, and exit the game. When you continue, they'll have restocked. Keep doing that until you have the necessary units, then deliver to the target station. About 30sm from the location, you'll get pulled out of warp. Just engage your boosters and tap deflectors when rockets are about to hit you or you need to recharge the booster. The first time I did this, I made $250k when missions in the area were only $20-30k, and I wish I knew about it way earlier.			"

												Rebel Galaxy has the potential to be a really fun game, it's very smooth, pretty, and fun for a while, it reminded of Sid Meier's Pirates in space to an extent. The hugest problem though is the game's combat pretty much comes down to grinding for money to get gear so you don't instantly get blown out of the sky. There's very little strategy involved, you either have the right gear or you just get ♥♥♥♥ed. AI ships will just EMP you to oblivion so you can't run away (And you basicially have no defense against this whatsoever), they eat through shields and deflectors like crazy, and if your weapons aren't good enough its game over. Combat in the later game just feels like a war of attrition. I think what ties into this is they focused way too much breadth and instead of depth, the game's big but there's not much there. Hopefully they either fix this or just learn from their mistakes for a sequel, because I did have fun for a while, but the lategame ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t just bored me.			"

												A wonderful game that you can approach in a few different ways. You can run around as a merchant, playing the market for locations to get goods for cheap and sell them at a profit... you can be a mercenary (or a pirate), taking jobs and hunting down bounties... you can even while away the hours mining asteriods for ore and diamonds. Add in a main storyline just engaging enough to keep you checking in on it (when you have the ship & supplies to do so) and a fantastic soundtrack--Rebel Galaxy is worth every penny.			"

												Wow.. This game left me pleasantly surprised. First thing I want to mention is NO you cant get out of your spaceship and walk around on planets. That being said everyhting else in this game is great; the combat, the trading system, the story, the ships, the loot, the banditry, the contracts AND ESPECIALLY THE SOUNDTRACK! If you want a space exploration/battle game I cant recommend this game enough.			"

												I bought this game based on many reviews comparing it to Freelancer. Judging from the youtube gameplay videos it didnt look much anything like it, but I thought it must be a ""freelancer-ish"" feeling about it, once you get your hands on.Nothing farther from the truth. It is nothing like Freelancer. Nothing.+Pros:+ runs decent on older machines ( I cant tell this for sure, i am basing this comments on the sys-req I read on the steam)+ can provide some hours of fun for the really stubborn fans of the genre waiting for a good game to pop out.******- Minuses:- space is 2D. I know many have said it before me, but GET THIS NOW: it is really 2D.- poor controls on keyboard and mouse, clearly designed to be played on controller.- uninsipred controlls for non-flying/combat (i.e. to see your current mission you have to press ESC and pause the game, then navigate some other menus which are selectable only by using left and right buttons)- MISSING a map legend. You learn what everything is by exploring and making mistakes.- menu navigation in bases is cumbersome and the inventory is navigated left, right, up, down (similar to the hellish system from the first Mass Effect inventory, brr)- activity in game feels grindly and repetitive, when not doing the main story missions.- non compelling story arch.- non-human NPC's voices are ghastly and sound like rubbing an angry, hissing cat against sandpaper.- human NPC voices are gruffy as if everyone in space has a cold. Those who are lucky enough not to be cold, are cliche-ish both in tone and vocabulary. Think of any other generic NPC you have heard in 1000 games before.- soundtrack saves face, BUT only if you are into his genre. For me it was fine ar first, but i muted it soon (please don't comment about my music taste; believe it or not, not everyone is into blues rock or country rock)- system voice, ambient and effects are not independently configurable, meaning you will often not hear important system messages over infernal blaster fire.- very poor graphics for a 2015 game, and not many advanced options. Just the very basiscs.Conclusion: I praise the developers for the effort and time they took to create this game, but the overall feeling is that it is amateurish. Not indie, but amateurish. I won't shun away from buying again one of their products, but I will put a lot more scrutiny into it, before buying it.Thank you fellow gamers for your time reading this.Play well.			"

												Rebel Galaxy, a game developed by two guys in an apartment somewhere.  It has you, the protagonist/antagonist, piloting a myriad of ships on a 2D plane while searing holes through smaller ships buzzing around you.  It's a simple game with beautiful visuals and a non-complex playstyle.  It takes a few minutes to get the controls down, but once that's done, it becomes second nature.It's the choose your own adventure book of the space World.  Want to be a militia-supporting pilot that tries to do the right thing?  Ok.  Prefer to be a pirate that melts the armor of miners and traders?  Ok.  Want to be a miner or trader?  Ok.  Bounty hunter?  Done.It has capital ships to fight/pilot, an array of modules/weapons to upgrade and many missions to accept and complete.  There is a propensity for the missions to get shallow, but the combat is fun enough to continue.  The desire for me to have the biggest, baddest ship in the Galaxy continues to drive me.  If I find myself getting a little weary from the missions, I go mine, or trade.  I find myself thinking about how I want to build my next ship.  Do I want an array of beam lasers?  Or do I want to build a missile boat?The game does have a storyline arc, but I'm not fully through it yet, so it's difficult for me to comment on it.  I am intrigued though, because I want to see where it goes.  Since that's the case, it has sufficiently pulled me in enough for me to continue.The music is terrific, and the game offers the ability to point toward your own local set of music based on triggers.  Want your collection of dubstep to play during a battle, but have a desire to have your atmospheric collection to drone on when you're just flying around?  Totally doable.For the price, even at full cost, it's my opinion that the game is worth it.  It's a fun time sink that allows me to drop the ""why so serious?"" facade and just play a fun game involving lasers and explosions while making my own choices.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a babyproofed Freelancer with naval combat and a touch of Firefly.A fun game that unfortunately has too few features to justify getting really invested in it. Space sim fans will probably find this very shallow in comparison, but it can still provide a good ~20 hours of enjoyment for a reasonable price.Not a bad game at all; just don't buy it expecting Star Citizen.

												Honestly, there's nothing wrong with this game. However, after 17 hours in...I felt nothing. It was cool as first. The music got me hyped up, the fighting was...meh. The ship only navigates on 1 plane...but we are in SPACE! So the combat and the movement seems kinda lackluster and once you get passed the cool music you start to realize that the game is super repetitive, kinda bland, and just lacking in life. It's not a bad game by any means, but not something I'd pay full price for, especially when there's other space-shooty-grindy games out there. You want space? Play Elite:Dangerous or something. This is Elite:Lite and Low Fat.Only get it on sale for like...under $10.00			"

												Its unfortunate as the game has so much potential, but in reality is nothing but one big grind.It basicly goes like this, you do a story mission, then you have to grind for hours doing repetitive missions to gain new gear after which you can do another story mission and have to grind for hours again.When you finaly get the baddest ship in the system the story progresses to the next system and it all starts over again.The praised music is nice, but it does get repetitve too when you play for a few hours, its like a cd on repeat all the time.It also bothers me that this game is clearly made to be played with a controller and not with mouse/keyboard.Aiming is done with the mouse on a 2d plane, but in all modes but broadside the crosshair snaps on targets so there is very little manual aiming to be done.You simply select a target and click the mouse to fire the weapons group.Seeing the crosshairs snap your constantly moving you mouse to try and get it to snap on the target you want it.On a controller this isnt a problem as you just move the analog stick, but a mouse doesnt move infinite.Ironicly you cant aim up as everything happens in a 2d plane, but small strike craft do fly over you.Its also not possible to assign weapon groups, the groups are assigned automaticly by the type of weapon used.They are ordenance, projectile and beams, its not possible to manualy fire a mixed selection, you can only control one at a time with the number keys, they others are ai controlled.The game does have allot of good pointers though, the graphics are awesome, the mood is good, its casual and laid back.AI turret control can be set to your preferences, like shooting only selected or target only small craft.There is a large selection of ships and weapons to be had, which gives allot of variation in tactics.The ships are clearly a progression over eachother though, they dont give you room to select multiple ships of a same strength, the next ship in line is always more expensive, and somewhat better than the last, yet requiring a different tactic.Pro's:Great graphicsGood moodVery casualGreat controller supportSomewhat intrigueing storyCons:Allot of grinding requiredRepetitive missionsPoor mous/keyboard support, fixed mouse ballisticWeapon groups are fixed, no buttons to fire other weapons than the ones selectedLooking back, i may not have bought this.

												You can see that I've given this a thumbs up well okay but let's get the bad parts out of the way first. Right off the bat this game is overrated by people new to the genre, who have had bad experiences with other games in the genre, are impressed by dev team responses in threads, are amazed that it's made by a two-man dev team, and love the soundtrack. New to the genre is self explanatory - it's a great and under used genre that has been a niche for far too long. Bad experiences..well a lot of the games of this ilk are either out dated like the greats Freelancer, DarkStar One, and the whole Privateer series, whilst the X series is notorious for being released in terrible condition and aren't patched to a high standard until usually the 3rd major patch. This doesnt make them any less worthy examples of the genre when they ARE finished but the initial buggyness and headaches tend to make people react so badly that the games are crucified before they even get to that stage. As for dev responses..I've not had one to my queries and even had one deleted from the threads altogether so no brownie points there fanboys. Whilst Double Damage are a two man team it is very rare for small or solo teams to do all the work themselves..they hire part-time fillers for artwork, coding..whatever is needed..I'm sure that's the case here - When was the last time you saw a credits list to ANY game that showed one or two names? The soundtrack IS great with its modern outlaw theme (very similar to some of the music in the Sons of Anarchy T.V. show) but great music alone does not make a game.All this said, it's an accomplished entry FOR THOSE NEW TO THE GENRE who may be put off by something a lot more wide ranging and complex like Elite Dangerous; others may be put off by what can seem dumbed down and simplistic by comparison leaving a somewhat arcadey feel to combat. Regardless of how you feel in that respect it's a decent game that is certainly worth the asking price.			"

Pros:- Great graphics, sound effects and music- Enjoyable 2D broadside combat- Missions are quite varied and sometimes fun- Has a campaign- Well optimized*, no bugs encountered aswellCons:- Very few factions that you can actually befriend- Some ships can't be acquired- Extremely simple combat (can be a pro for some, certainly not for me)- The universe feels empty* = I use a pretty dated computer, so it should run well for most people.

												One of the most underrated games on steam. I grabbed this on sale and didn't touch it for weeks but I'm so glad I did. It's action packed with a lot of RPG elements. You can spend hours just exploring or jump into a battle at any time. I was a bit hesitant over the lack of full 3D movement, but it's not an issue at all. This is like a more badass, space-themed version of Sid Meier's Pirates.			"

												Classic space game formula done right. Summary: If you don't hate naval style combat / movement you need to get this one. You don't need a lengthy review on this one, trust me. Chances are you've already played other space games and on paper you'll get exactly what you expect: A short story, fighting, trading, smuggling, mining, rescuing, escorting, ship upgrading, new ships to buy, some factions, some solar systems, jumpgates and .. well .. you get the drift.Originality is not why eventually you'll decide to buy this. Polish and charm is. Very enjoyable naval-style 2d combat. Easy to get into, few keybindings to remember, requires the correct amount of strategy (aka it never gets boring and it never makes your brain melt).Opportunistictrading and mining. No need for spreadsheets or noting something down. You'll instantly recognize red prices, stations with famine, mining rushes, market gluts, under siege etc and you'll know when to buy or sell. You'll stop to help traders being attacked by enemies and then sell them high some of your cargo. Addictive progression system. There's always a new ship, weapon or component to aim for and it will always be addictively close to your budget.  Short, classic, cool story. It won't win an oscar, but the voice acting and general style is pleasing and keeps you mildly hooked. It never limits your sandbox experience though and you'll probably be alternating between sandbox and story. Style. Lots of it. Very enjoyable and unique slide-guitar firefly-like rock soundtrack and you also get to use your own music for fighting, idle and in-station situations. Very colorful galaxy with cool gameplay-changing nebulas and asteroid fields.Make no mistake though, this game won't replace elite dangerous or star citizen in your library. You'll probably be alternating between them. One's for the serious long-term thinking space pilot that grinds money and faction influence with his multiplayer buddies and the other one's for the colorful opportunist lone-wolf / firefly / Han Solo experience.EDIT: Almost a year after having finished my first playthrough i find myself again drawn to this game and going for a second playthrough. In the meantime i've been playing (or re-playing) elite dangerous, x rebirth, ring runner, pixxelfrazer, endless sky, galak-z, beyond sol, cosmonautica and other space games - and i have to say i'm having the most fun with Rebel Galaxy (Beyond Sol and ring runner shared the 2nd place).

REBEL GALAXY IS AWESOMEI am to misbehave... FULL REVIEW[gonewiththewin.com] (gonewiththewin.com) It's Firefly. It's also Privateer. You know what it reminds me off also? Star Fleet Command the old Interplay games. What it boils down to is that Rebel Galaxy is great fun. An easy recommend, and hours and hours of just blowing things up that does NOT get old.

			Do you like Firefly? or maybe Privateer? What about Starfleet Command? Then you will love Rebel Galaxy. Fantastic open world sci fi adventure with a hella dose of sass!		

What is it that you are looking for in a game? Hours of entertainment? That's usually a major defining point if I'm going to drop any kinds of serious cash into a game. Will it invoke emotions? Will it capture my imagination? Does it mechically perform and excel at what it claims to do?Rebel Galaxy is that and more. It draws serious consideration for game of the year. It delivers in terms of exploration, action, strategic combat, and kickass explosions. Is it perfect? No. Missions are repetitive, trading is something you do, but its not viable. Same with mining. Is it fun? **** yes.			"

It's just how they describe it on the store page, a swashbuckling space adventure.Works well with keyboard/mouse, or a  controller.

												This game absolutely has that ""one more mission"" feel about it, typically my ""one more mission"" ends up being a dozen more! It's very easy to get into, and to be honest there isn't a massive amount of depth to it, but what it does, it does well. If you like very open games that reward you for being willing to work to your goals in a manner of your choosing (trade, combat, mining) then this is a good example. If you're looking for in depth storytelling and characterization, you might want to look somewhere else. "

												Its a casual smooth action game. Your space ship cannot fly up or down though. Piloting and combat feels a lot like commanding a naval vessle. The designers could easily use the same engine and core data to make a naval game. Its not bad though. Not at all. Once you accept that's how this game is its super cool! Combat is fast paced and intense. Some fights are insane! It delivers with this very well.I am not far in the campaign but I enjoy what story I have uncovered. Rebel Galaxy shines the most for me with how well it has taken a space simulation idea and turned it into something fast paced. Its married to good action combat and randomly generated missions, events and economy. In a half hour you can have do a hard combat mission, go mining, trade commodities between stations and try to hack into a nav beacon.This is both a blessing and a curse though because those few things I listed is really all Rebel Glaxy offers. Then again, that's pretty much the core features of a space sim too! The difference is the speed at which you can do things here. Its very drop in and drop out (or log off I mean in this case) gameplay. It is great fun for me as I love the X series. But this is NOT a space sim. Its LIKE a space sim with space sim LIKE elements. Which is cool. The focus here is on the action. And the sweet cowboy-like vibe you get everywhere.I strongly recomend this title with a 4/5=======I would really like the designers to come back and add some more stuff in a patch though. I would welcome a good $10 DLC if it added a generous amount of things too!			"

This includes the 2d plane in which you move, aswell as broadsides.The general feel of the game, the vibe it gives off is closer to... well firefly. The music and characters are interesting.If you like sci-fi, piratey stuff and a game with a good vibe you should really check this out. Don't expect anything like EVE for example though.			"

												If you enjoyed games like Freelancer when you were little, then this is the game you need in your life.  The controls may seem a bit simplistic going into it, but once you realize how heavily you have to be timing both the broadsides, managing approaches, and using the deflector, the game can become complicated fast. I mainly did merc work, didn't find much need for mining, and within a little while I found myself turning to piracy as well.This is a very well rounded game with good graphics, only the odd bug or two, and an amazing soundtrack that had me checking their web page, pretty certain I'd just heard Chris Cornell and Zac Brown going in again. Of course, it wasn't, but the hard rock sound track none the less seals the deal. This game seriously feels like it should have a much higher price tag and I highly recommend it.			"

I find it hard to have a negative reveiw for something I put so much time into, So its positive now.Pros: Good musicGood graphicsSolid progression systemOpen world with the ability to choose what you want to do to progressCons:Simplistic combatHighly repetiveMeh main plotlineSome early parts i found very frustrating and had to save scum to get past itSo orginally i didn't like this game.  But what i failed to realize was that this isn't a game you sit down and play for hours on end.  Its a game you play for a bit then come back the next day or so.  Thats what got me I just kept coming back.Also I only spent $6 on it that might have helped.Space pirates/traders/anti pirates unite!			"

												This game feels just right. Its the feeling that you are a space cowboy and the universe is there for the taking. Imagine a mix of Escape Velocity series (Escape Velocity/Override/Nova) and Firefly. This is it. The soundtrack is epic, its the best combination of music for this kind of game I have ever listened to. It makes the game enticing. The gameplay is quite easy and easy to catch up. Space navigation and combat are too easy, specially because there is no movement on the Z Axis. The story in itself is very simple, both in lenght and content and there is only ""one path"" to follow trough. You can continue playing after you finish the main storyline, and that is a huge plus. Specially if we can add mods/dlcs in the future. New ships, new weapons, new missions.I would def. recommend this game.Pros: gameplaymusiccombatgraphicsCons:story qualityonly one path to victoryshort list of weapons/ships "

												Gonna keep that review simple. It is a good game which may keep you busy for 20-30 hours. It has a pretty low replayability though as there is very little interest in restarting the game from scratch (the story missions give you 2 different minor bonuses to choose from on 2 occasions).So about the game, it is a pretty standard space opera trading/combat game and has all you could expect from the genre. Its (only) originality lies in you controlling capital ships (from the small and fast corvettes to the massive and powerfull dreadnoughts) and having 3 sets of weaponry (broadsides, turrets and a tertiary weaponry). Making money can be achieved through a variety of quests, piracy, bounty hunting, helping attacked merchants, mining, looting and of course trading. It is grindy, but fair.Overall it is a solid title and I recommend it for what it offers which is a couple dozens of hours of fun (I have more on record because I deleted a save by mistake).			"

												I'm a big space games fan... but I've been disappointed by Elite Dangerous' ""mile wide, inch thick"" issues, even EVE got boring (though I'll always return to it)... and I've tried an assortment of other space genre games on steam, only to return them after 30 mins of gameplay. In fact, I hardly ever write reviews.But this game really caught me by surprise. This is an original game on steam that I actually love.If you want a Firefly experience, then this is the game for you, complete with the western grunge music. Excellent soundtrack, in fact.Buy it, it's definitely worth $20.			"

												UPDATE:  This review is out of date, so take what I say about the mechanics with a grain of salt.  I will not be playing this to see what has been fixed any time soon.  Seriously, I spent a lot of time and got no real reward for the MASSIVE grind.  I doubt I will ever beat this game.  Like I say below, the reward does not justify the time it takes.Like some others, I really like a lot about this game but it has some problems.  The kind of problems that caused me to just set the game down, and walk away.  I will start with what I liked. I liked the: GraphicsShip designCombatCustomizing of ship loadoutsChance to buy items low in one system and sell high in anotherAtmosphere\EnvironmentsAbility to add a custom soundtrack  (I used tracks from the Endless Space and Dungeon of The Endless Soundtracks and I liked it better than the normal soundtrack.) What I did not like:The grind! and lack of variety in objectives - This is the biggest problem for me.  You have to grind a lot to progress, with no real change between the different star systems aside from harder enemies/missions + higher tier gear/ships.  This would not be so bad if there were more to do than the same basic missions repeatedly.(IMO: I think having some unique things to find around in space could make flying from port to port a bit more fun.  You know, things that add life and history to the universe you have created.  )Difficulty Spikes - As others have pointed out, there are delivery missions where upon near-arrival to your destination, a ring of fighter ships appear around you.  These ships are quickly reinforced by more ships.  Even with the threat level low, these fighters annihilate your shields and you get picked off pretty quick.  I have had to quit almost every one of these mission due to an absolute inability to get past these ships. (even after upgrading) Merchants Guild Missions - I had originally planned on focusing my time with the Merchants Guild.  On top of the painful delivery quests, I found the others tedious and boring.  Some require you to purchase a large amount of relatively uncommon items and then deliver them to a certain station.  The amount of time and cargo space required for those missions make them a total waste of time.This is too bad because I much prefer the idea of playing a merchant/smuggler, and I like the ships they offer as well.  So I switched to the Mercenaries Guild because the missions are more fun and make more sense.Except rescue missions.Does anyone else have a huge problem with the rescue missions as well?  Maybe I just suck at those.TL;DR - You might like this for a while if you love space games.  But, there is a good chance that you will hit a wall where your time spent isn't worth the fun gained.  I really want to recommend this game, but cannot. In one word: Plateau.			"

												This pseudo-3d combat sim actually had some potential to be good. Like a lot. And it still has some features that are exemplary. However, it has some awful things in it too.The good:The music. Like the series called Firefly? It will bloody catapult you right into the feeling. It's absolutely fantastic, and you can set your custom music, separated into 'combat', 'ambient' and other categories, and you can even tell the game to mix the originals and your own. This is actually my favourite feature of the game, it is so simple yet so effective.Controls (with gamepad mind you). Intuitive, however, you pretty quickly end up ""HOLD DA BUTTONZ, ALL OF 'EM"". You need to hold X for flak coverage, left stick inclick to use the afterburner, left trigger to aim, right trigger to fire broadsides, right stick to aim your broadsides, so yeah. But still, the controls work smoothly and comparatively easily.The combat in the beginning. While the game still attempts to be fair, it is pretty fun. Small craft can be taken out by your flak and turrets, larger ones get the broadside.The bad""Hey, you go for an Average difficulty mission? How about you get 3 random encounters in the mission area, so you not only have to destroy the 2 light frigates we've sent you to kill, but also 3 destroyers, 9 heavy frigates, about 20 corvettes, and about a 100 fighters, bombers?"" And once the random encounters locations are generated, they cannot be changed. So I have a practically impossible main mission in front of me, ♥♥♥♥ you very much.""Trade system"". Components cost about 100k+ once you hit tier 3 (in the first system, there are already 2 tiers, so tier 3 is fairly early, but you have a good understanding of the mechanics by that time) and your cargo can be about 50 units at best. However, you cannot check the prices of other stations in real time, and you can certainly simply buy everything a station can offer in trade goods, and have half the cargo empty still. An extremely lucky trading run can net even 50k, however, you can earn literal millions with single missions by that time.Pseudo 3d ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The problem comes, is that some stuff is in 2d, some is in 3d. Asteroid belts are in 3d, but your radar is in 2d, which means if you warp travel, you have no freakin' idea wether you'll get stuck in that asteroid field by the annoying ""WARP INHIBITED BY X/Y"" (X=stellar mass, Y=hostile forces) every five second, because some asteroids are on your level, some below, some above, some while you could easily fit under/above it, still inhibits warp because ♥♥♥♥you, Enemy fighters, bombers, gunboats move in 3d, you move in 2d, enemy corvettes and above move in 2d. Your flaks only cover your port and starboard, however, if a bomber is shooting at you from your keel, or from the mast (the bottom and the top of the ship respectively) you can only pray that your turrets deal with him in time. Even better, if it shoots you from your poop, where usually no or few turrets face, and your engines exhaust is harmless (however, you can at least turn and face them with your flaks and broadsides then).Overall, the difficulty spike inbetween tiers is too big (your tier 2 turrets are BB guns against a tier 3 shield), forcing you to farm in the previous system for cash before you can afford proper equipment for the new system. Way, waaay too much farming, and even then, the random events are simply unfair.			"

												TL;DR below.This game should be called 'Grind Galaxy'.That's because grinding is basically what you will do for 90% (or more) of your game time. Except you're only going to play it for it's main (and only) story. There are no story side quests. Only missions like: destroy some captial ships, rescue a trader by destroying more capital ships, escorting another ship to it's destination while destroying even more capital ships or deliver goods to a certain base which will be hindered by - you guessed right - capital ships which you will have to destroy or run away from.If you want any challenge out of this game, don't upgrade your ship too much. Do as little grinding as possible, so your missions will stay at least at normal difficulty. The game tells you the difficulty for every mission going from 'extreme' to 'low'. I did the mistake of grinding for a dreadnaught ship with level 6 equipment and the game became childs play.The story of this game is very lackluster and demotivating. There was much more potential in it to work with, but the devs didn't build on that. It also ends very abruptly. Even the mediocre story of Freelancer looks like a masterpiece compared to Rebel Galaxy's. I was very disappointed by the story. Especially after the ending.Trading is a waste of time in this game. It has no real simulated economy and the profit margins are so small that it's just not rewarding. The fastest way to make money is to do side missions which, in basically all cases, come down to combat. And after them you can sell the loot you've got from your fallen foes and still make more money than having bought and traded them.Mining is even more useless than trading except for the one achievement you can get.The visuals of the game are okay. They don't make you go 'wow', but at least they're not ugly. But even the old Freelancer can hold up with it. And Freelancer has a greater variety of areas you can visit. In Rebel Galaxy every solar system basically looks the same.The sound of the game and the appraised soundtrack are okay. The soundtrack might annoy you after some time since it's not very diversified. Too few songs are in the game. At least you can set your own music for the various instances of gameplay.TL;DRIf you're looking for a space action game and haven't played Freelancer then definitely go for that. Or if you want even more quality check out the Descent: Freespace games. Google for Open Freepace for a improved version of them.If you've played Freelancer already and are looking for something similar, even if not as good, you could give Rebel Galaxy a try. But better buy it on sale. It's not worth it's full price in my opinion.If you're looking for a space sim where you can do more than just continuous fighting - like trading, mining, building an empire - you should avoid this game and rather check out the games from the X universe or Elite Dangerous.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Double Damage GamesPublishers: Double Damage Games Initial release: Oct 2015Genre: Action, Strategy, Economy Simulator, Space #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationBuy red, sell green. “Economic prosperity and quality education for our children are inexorably linked.” - Jon HuntsmanRebel Galaxy is a indie developed game best summarized by calling it a space trucking simulator. Think of Elite Dangerous in the ocean. The games combat takes place on more of or less of a two dimensional plane. In the the way that Assassins Creed IV Black Flag naval combat has become a bit of a standard. However fighter ships can go a bit above or below the playing field. Of course there are contingencies that allow you to deal with these inconveniences such as automated scatter turrets that can have a tactical assignments selected while you are trying to focus aiming your broadside hardpoints. The game has faction warfare that evokes a feeling of Mercenaries. Some factions are needlessly hostile to you to begin with while others can be swayed through favors or pushed away by other actions. There is no ship customization other than changing hardpoints, shields and deflectors. Or strait up buying a new ship. The game, despite its open nature, has a very linear progression. I see only 2 ways to go. You either become better at killing other ships or pick a frigate that is better at not dying whilst transporting cargo. Essentially be a bounty hunter bent on protecting the citizenry of the known universe. Be a space trucker and keep your nose clean at least in areas controlled by the militia or become space pirate. This is not necessarily a bad thing but in all honesty it feels very shallow and has a feeling (the entire experience) of being a tutorial to Elite Dangerous. Which again is fine, so long as you expect that going in. There are commodities at each station. In essence you could just play the market to progress and get ahead. There are often events going on like a tech boom or famine where buying low and selling high should be a strait forward affair. The game features a custom soundtrack option. And no, I don't mean like putting on a playlist from spotify. You actually set up custom pathing. As in, choose from list A for battles, List B for Exploration etc etc.. However the game features an OST that I consider quite superb. Its consists of some amalgam of slide guitar space cowboy jams and 90's grunge. Which feels not to far to removed from the serious/satire ratio that Borderlands possesses. THE GISTThe game is basically a more friendly version of Elite Dangerous and that's not a bad thing. So long as your expectations are not higher than that it is a very enjoyable game indeed.Follow my curation for more "

												People keep saying this little gem is 'the spiritual successor to ""Freelancer""'...well, I feel it's more of 'the more faithful sequel to ""Privateer"" than ""Freelancer"" was'.  This is not to say that Digital Anvil's last(?) release was *bad*, but it's more like this later game manage to recapture the first game's core 'feel' than the sequel.  Make no mistake, it does fit in that same grove as both of Chris Roberts' titles, but it lacks the 'glitz' of a AAA-game like Freelancer; it's got more of a 'rough gem' feel like that Wing Commander spin-off was.And tangible things bear me out: the 'meta-game' is very similar: you have stations/bases that allow you to buy and configure ships, commodity markets to buy and sell goods, a mission computer to take various jobs, a bar to meet storyline people, chat with the bartender for rumors and info and hire wingmen...and two 'guilds' - Merchant and Mercenary - who offer better jobs than the mish compy...with membership.Rogue Galaxy adheres to this system, but adds a little to it; the guilds supply unique gear and ships, for example, and your standing can grow over requirement levels to make same available to you (there was little point in 'grinding favor' with factions in Privateer once you were 'friendly').Now the core gameplay (combat and station-to-station travel) is different; you're captaining a large ship that operates like a blue-water vessel, rather than a glorified 'space plane', and combat is 'raking him with your broadsides' rather than 'curling in on his six and shooting him down', but even that difference doesn't weaken the bond.Even the story premise - you speak with this person and that person, and are given an 'artifact' to hold on to momentarily for someone, and it proves to be very desirous for just about everyone else, painting a giant bullseye on the beam of your frigate.But again, this seems to be loving and faithful emulation of a great older title, and it helps the new game.If you liked Privateer (or even its 'big show' successor Freelancer) you WILL like Rebel Galaxy...even if you prefer dogfighting to battleship steerage.  It will 'scratch that itch' while you're waiting to see how Star Citizen will evolve into something that likely won't be able to....oh, and as I'm sure many others have said: the soundtrack is AMAZINGLY good; catchy tunes that you'll find yourself humming on the commute after a while playing. :)			"

												So much potential! The game made a good first impression, and has quickly gone downhill from there. It seems really padded, with tons of watching your ship warp and a lot of repetition in not only the missions but how the battles play out. It just gets... boring. There's all this seemingly cool economy stuff going on, and NPC ships going places - but they all lack personality and I just can't be bothered. It also lacks gravity - in a tough fight? Just run, warp out, dock at a station repair and reload, and the enemy will just wait there for you to come back and finish it off. I have never seen an enemy ship run once I start wooping them (and therefore I never feel any urgency to chase it). I've also never failed a mission so far - they don't seem to expire, they don't move, they don't get effected if you go dock or go do a bunch of other missions.I WAS super excited to finally try this game. SO MUCH potential. BUT it looks like the devs put all their time into making it look good and forgot to make it IMMERSIVE and FUN. I just don't have any reason to open it up again.HERE'S WHAT WOULD MAKE IT AWESOME - - NPCs that reward you with more than just credits... how about loyalty? How about some good cargo? How about doing a han solo and swooping in to help if I'm in a pinch and they're nearby?- Feel like your actions ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. How about after you blow up 200 cartel ships, I dunno, the Cartel gets weaker? Or puts a price on your head? OR SOMETHING??- Ability to attempt to take over ships would be cool- Ability to build your own small fleet, dominate or take over stations, actually look forward to more than a bigger ship after a crazy amount of grinding- A lot less padding would go a long way to make this fun!!

												This game reminds me of Freelancer. In my opinion Freelancer was one of the best space games ever! This game is very easy on computer requirements. I can run it at max settings with no issues and I have a much older system. Pros: Feels like Freelancer style of play but a bit more dynamic. Space combat, tradeing with stations and vessels in space, real piracy including gangs to join, differnt factions that interact based off your standing and more. A variety of ship combat styles to your likeing. Much to explore like Freelancer. There is a cool story that you aren't require to follow but keeps things interesting.Cons: The galaxy isnt known for its extreme beauty but I think thats just a minor. If the game was 60$ then I would complain.I think the ships are all rather ugly. Usually space crafts are designed to look very alien and beautiful. All the ships in the game have this rustic western look and fee. Also the music is filled with that style. So no beautiful space music. (It clearly gives you the option to put your own sound tracks on opening the game)Even conversing with the differnt people at stations they have this western voice style and attitude. It's not my personal taste but to my surpise it is a very minor detail if I turn off the game music. Still these are all very minor cons for a 20$ game that WILL give you many many hours of game play easily paying for itself in gameplay time.If you do the same thing over and over while it may start to feel like a grind to get a more powerful ship and upgradeing it. I recommend doing a little of everything so stays fresh for many hours.This game does feel like a AAA game but at a 20$ price which is very worth it. Hell if you can get it on discount even more so.TLDR: If you like Freelancer and space games this is a gem. Cheap in cost, runs very very well graphics are very good. Lots of fun to be had for a cheap cost $ .			"

Neutral review but steam doesn't allow that option.Pros:- Optimized well, runs at a constant 60fps+ no matter how many ships and effects are on the screen.- Has nice sound effects and music.- Looks good visually.- Fun basic space game with killing and trading.- Ships are varied well and don't look the same as others.Cons:- Lack of ship customization, can't choose turret placement or even colour palette/pattern.- No option to auto repair/refill at stations have to do it manually.- No real tactics other then spin in circles while your turrets shoot and you fire broadsides.- No post-launch updates other then a few bug fixes, no DLC/Expansion to expand on gameplay.- Few mission types, gets repetitive essentially just shoot bad guys, protect good guys, move some cargo around.- Trading is random, consists of buy it when it's low and hope it eventually goes up which can take forever, so need to stop at every single station to try to sell.- Story is shallow, missions are the same as the ones you pick up from stations.- Can't go to the last sector again once you leave it, no warning about it.

												When I first started playing I was put off by the lack of Vertcle movement, For some reason it reminded me of Sid Meiers Pirates (Newest one) and that totally fixed it, I just imagine that my Frigate is Sailing the Solar Sea, and it is great, The game is rather Grindy, but some of the fights I have gotten into just flying about doing Bounty hunts and other missions have been great, Flying to a station for repairs after a rather painful bomber fight, only to find a Juggernaught attacking the station, this thing is at least 5 times the size of my measly frigate, with 4 Frigates larger than mine and plenty of small fighters I though ""F*ck that noise"" Then I spotted the 43,000 Credit bounty on it and I just had to, drawing out his support one by one untill it was just the ""Big Bast*rd"" himself, 10 minutes of circling the slow moving Juggernaught and breaking through his shields and I finally finished him off by Ramming him full speed with my Ram Shields activated.I barely have 10 hours at the time of this review, but I expect at least another 40 in the next week.

												I am very sad and a bit conflicted about giving this game a negative review.  In truth I consider it ""meh"".  Its only real contribution to gaming as a whole is the broadside, Assassin's Creed 4 style ship to ship combat, which is a lot of fun.  The rest of the game is a pretty stripped down and bare bones space sim.  Almost all missions involve combat, even the trade runs.  Being knocked out of warp is commonplace and makes just getting from point A to point B needlessly tedious.  The universe has no depth, there are several factions with friend/neutral/foe ratings you can adjust, but none of them have any substance or even an explanation as to who or what they are.  Trading and mining profits scale poorly as such that they're not a real way to make money as the game progresses.All of these things being said I did put 50+ hours into the game and earned all the achievements.  I enjoyed myself through at least some of that or I wouldn't have done it.  The real problem comes down to the fact that its just a bare bones game that does one thing well: combat.  This is a space game to get if you want to get in quick shoot stuff and get out.  Its also good for fans of the show Firefly who like that type of universe and that type of ""space-western"" soundtrack.  Personally its not my cup of tea but that's just a subjective opinion.  While I don't necessarily regret buyint ir or playing it, I don't think I would have missed out anything had I never bought it.			"

												So. Rebel Galaxy.If you're wondering if Rebel Galaxy is a fun game to get, well, here's three stories to help convince you.Scenario One: Laughing at Bandits.I took a mission to pick up a dead drop, pretty simple stuff. Fly to the location, use my tractor beam to pick up a box from the middle of nowhere, and then return it to the station I left from. Simple stuff.Well, apparently some folks didn't take too kindly to it. I come under attack from a wave of pirate fighters, but due to their.. ahh.. 'Lack of tactical prowess' they all come in at different points across the ice field. I start burning away, because there's no need for a fight, am I right guys? Besides, I have a small network of flak cannons (Secondary Weapon System), so these fighters can't do crap anyways. Well, one fighter (let's call him Jim-Bob) decides to go for it anyways.One fighter against a Corvette. Bad choice Jim-Bob. About 10 seconds later, Jim-Bob is a frozen corpse in space, and seconds before my warp drive fully kicks in, all the bandits can hear is a ""suck it, nerds!"" across the comms.Scenario 2: I'm a Big D*** HeroNot too long after that, I take a job to protect some miners. Might come under attack from some more bandits, maybe the same crew I ran into on the last job, no big deal, easy pickings. I head on out, enjoy the sights for a few seconds, before my ship tells me some unfriendly locals show up. Alright, no big deal, some fighters and a pair of gunships. Still in my old Corvette, with the flak system installed, so no big deal, they all get wiped out, I get paid, everyone's happy, the miners all lived, I got paid, played the hero, good stuff. I do my usual heading on out, accelerate to sublight, and hit the warp engine, all cool-like.I feel the kick-back of the warp engine, and am ready to sail off towards my next job...Except I forgot to keep an eye on the asteroid off my port side, and make it about ten feet before dropping out of warp, where I embarrasingly have to boost past the asteroid, re-accelerate, and then hit the warp drive again.I can still hear the miners laughing...Scenario 3: Lightning in Space. Not so PrettySo, easy job. Eliminate this particularly nasty bandit who's been pillaging and marauding his way across the system. Easy-peasy according to my mission log, thanks to some recent upgrades after a few.. less-than-stellar performances on my next story mission. Head on out there, and as I come out of warp, I notice this beautiful blue nebula, with a bit of lightning. I think it's some really nice decoration for a pirate base, kinda fits the motif.About three seconds later, my computer's lovely voice tells me that my port shield is down, and as a I look at the display, not only is my port shield down, so are my fore and starboard shields. Right as the enemy enters weapons range. Beautiful, simply beautiful. That easy mission turned out to be not so easy. A wave of pirate strike craft, and a Corvette greet my in my old Corvette. I've been looking to upgrade to a nice frigate, but that doesn't exactly help me right now, I'm still in this now-battered heap after fending off most of the wave as the enemy Corvette, my target, starts speeding away. Thankfully, sublight boosters help me catch up to weapons range, which, thanks to my shiny new Proton Cannons, is about three to four times longer than my old standard probably-shooting-a-space-potato broadsides. Well, apparently he notices how my guns are about to fire on him, and he turns towards me, not that far off my starboard side, when my helpful computer notifies me of another problem""Starboard shields down""Well, that's just perfect. the shields I NEED to be up are down, thanks to the space-lightning the pirates conveniently chose to hide in. I'm still kind of battered, a few scorch marks and maybe a piece or two of my hull missing, but this is the one guy I positively, absolutely, have to destroy. I open up with a salvo of Proton fire, and close range to get my Scatter Turrets (run of the mill space-laser ""machine gun"" turrets) to fire on him, hopefully preventing a bit of shield recharge. The gambit works, and despite a few more scorch marks to my starboard side, the enemy Corvette explodes, and the people of the system are safe once more!And I don't get caught on an asteroid this time, letting me feel like an actual good guy. Until I explode next, that istl;dr: Buy the thing. Seriously. I would've paid 40$ for this, and they're selling it for a sale price of 18, and a regular price of 20.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is action-packed sci-fi adventure game.Before you even notice beautiful artwork, textures, models and space, first thing you will love is it's soundtrack and music.With countless side missions beside main story, lots of hours of fun are guaranteed.Game is really well optimized that can run 60fps easy even on weaker machines, overall controls are simple enough that beginers wont have trouble starting a game.Battle mechanism is also a job well done, so even if you get a biggest ship in-game with tons of guns, you can't just jump in combat Rambo style and kill everything, especialy in battles where are bigger ships, a caution is always a must.Despite a decent ammount of buyable and playable ships with a good variety of upgrades, I find lacking that you cant actualy change the ship colors,hell I dont want my ship to be yellow/green.  ^^Another con I find is that you actualy can't make your own fleet, you can hire one wingman and thats it. Also there is no crew whatsoever, it would be nice that you can hire crew that will in someway improve your ship stats and effectiveness.Beside that, I only have words of praise for this game, I can say that it is definitely worth 19,99 with what it has to offer to a player. It is super fun, it has good quality so I can easy recommend Rebel Galaxy to everyone.			"

												The combat mechanics are fun and the graphics and interface are well polished but sadly, this game is lacking any depth.The main story is particularly short and uninspiring, which would be forgivable if there was enough diversity in the sandbox universe to give you something to do but there just isn't.You grind generic missions (take cargo from point A to point B), to save up cash for generic upgrades (laser canon mk1 to laser canon mk2), the systems all look the same, they're all populated with the same few NPC models and the ship selection is limited and dull. All in all it's a bland experience with zero replayability.			"

			Review van Rebel Galaxy http://store.steampowered.com/app/290300/ Rebel Galaxy is een roekeloos ruimte avontuur, vol met actie, ontdekking, handel en onderhandeling met de bewoners aan de rand van...		

 )Double Damage was kind enough to sent us a review copy of this game. We're very impressed with it. It's old school fun in a modern setting. The ships designs remind me very much of the Terran Trade Authority Handbook SPACECRAFT 2000 to 2100AD By Stewart Cowley.The game is an open world sandbox with 14 galaxies. You fly around in big capital ships, which you can upgrade or trade in for a better/larger one. The ships can mine, collect, transport and fight. Mining is done in astroid fields scattered all over the galaxies. Each galaxy is full of spacestations, belonging to one of the 4 or 5 factions (sorry don't know for sure if it's 4 or 5). At the spacestations you can sell your mined items, but also buy and sell a lot of other commodeties. You can also upgrade and buy ships there, hire mercenaries to support you and select missions you want to play. Factions offer missions there and by doing them you will grow in popularity with them, while loosing popularity with others. The less popular you are with a faction, the more likely they will attack you when you encounter them in space. When you are really unpopular with a faction, they will not allow you to dock at their spacestations. Throughout the game you can gain or loose popularity however you see fit. Missions can be focussed on trading, mining, defending or helping others, smuggling and battling.The ships are quite cool, all of them have a bit of an 70's - 80's scifi game to them. You can upgrade their strength, equipment, cargo space, weapons and much more. Quite some options available. To make things easy, the ships more one a 2D plane, in a 3D world. This works very well for this game. The act more like a ship then a plain. They have a main engine, sub warp enigne (booster), warp engine and a interstellar warp engine. Weapons consist of turrets and broadside cannons. You can let them fire pretty much automatic, or take control of indivual turrets. Fighting is done like sail ships do, facing sideways and firing away :DYou can fly around anywhere you like and while doing so you will encounter loot, pirates, astroid fields, others in need of assistance and more. This is all aside from the missions you can do. There are also guilds in the game, joining one or more will give you access to special equipment and ships. The ships you can fly in the game range from firefly size ships to battlestart galactica capital ships and beyond.On top of all this, there's a full story with all kinds of missions and mystery going on. You can focus on the story, do it once in a while or even neglect it completely. Besides the main story, there are a few smaller subplots as well.The best thing about all of this is the freedom you have. Go anywhere you like, play the way you like. Be a pirate, trader, merchant and so on. Follow a story, neglects, do side mission, explore and so on. Mix it all together. The game is really easy to get into, easy to play and offers all kinds of levels of mission, with a very low risk to a high risk. The further you fly into the universe to more hostile it gets and the more advanced upgrades and ships you discover. Easy to play and to pick, yet offering a good challenge as well. Flying is easy, just like driving a car. Battling is really done awesome, you get the whole star trek, battlestar galactica, star wars feel when doing so. No puny little fighter..... no massive firepower :DI guess that pretty much covers it, sure I forgot a thing or two. Is it worth it? Yes, without a doubt. The whole concept is done innovative and very well. Everything blends in and just works well together. It's a very welcome break from all the massive space mmo's and all the small spaceship focussed game.			"

												Cowboy Bebop: The GameI wont lie, this game has blown my expectations out of the metaphorical water. I haven't played long enough yet to give a full review but after 5 hours I have to say this is like a lovechild of Elite Dangerous and Red Dead Redemption (gameplay wise) and also Starcraft and Cowboy Bebop theme wise. It also feels like it could be an extension of the Mass Effect universe.The developers have really focused on perfecting the basic core mechanics that are both simple and have a lot of longevity. I think this is the kind of game you could enjoy for a long time.I've owned this game for quite a while and I never touched it until now and I'm really glad I did. If you're out there and you're on the fence about this game I promise you it is very easy to start. You wont be looking up tutorials unless you want to.Update: After 26 hours I'm finally putting the game down. It was a great journey and whilst the story was nothing special, if you enjoy building up a character from scratch then you'll love this game. As I progressed I felt stronger and stronger but some of that was lost because as you progress to further and further areas the enemies get stronger with you. Whenever I visited earlier systems I was always reminded of my progress though.I think if you were to play this strategically and focused on min-maxing your ship, you could easily get 100+ hours out of this game.Overall a fantastic SCI-FI game and a must buy for people who enjoy starting with nothing and earning a spot at the top.

												Think of it like the naval combat from Assassins Creed Black flag ...but with space ships.Yes it is just a 2D plane combat but it s easy to master and fun.Don't expect this to have the depth of X3 or something that big, it's a small enjoyable ,well designed ,atmospheric and relaxing space combat game.Plus, the space country OST takes you back to Starcraft terrans :)			"

Rebel Galaxy is a story driven space exploration and battle game with a unque style and a firefly-esque feel. Above is a short video of me running through th first half hour or so of the game, below are my thoughts on Rebel Galaxy. TheHiddenLevels.com was provided a review copy by Double Damage Games and for that we thank them.The opening soundtrack and just the music in general really gave that space junker, firefly, out in the verse where there is little law and less integrity vibe.. The following gameplay did not let this notion slip away. This is a fantastic western style space traveler and battle game. I was hooked pretty quickly by amazing music and voice acting, the graphics are impressive as well.I engaged my first enemy and honestly thought I was about to lose my ship when I shot them down just in time, the battles feel tense and while manuvering isn't the focus, you've still got to be crafty. The only thing that was a slight turn off was that other ships I was fighting were able to move on a 3D axis, but of course our ship is not capable of 3D flight. It is a game mechanic so that is the last I'll mention it, becuase the game is supremely fun even without that facet involved. The ship building and upgrade possibilities are relatively deep, and offer a real variance in experience and gameplay. I really enjoyed the feeling of landing on new planets, talking to folks in smoky dive bars, and running errand / bounties for unsavory space characters. It's a great adventure game and I'll likely be coming back to it often to see what's next in the story.I'd reccomend this one to any fans of space games, especially those where players can outfit ships and fly around a massive galaxy. Thanks for wathcing and reading, check out www.thehiddenlevels.com for news and reviews!			"

												great game!- easy to master controls- focuses on things you like to do in-game- you can stop and continue whenever you want- good design (at least I like it ;)- great soundtrack- even if missions from the mission board somtimes repeat, trading and mining gets dull after a while, the main mission-line pushes you continusously through the solar systems where you discover new thingsfirst time playing, 28h on clock, still a lot of fun! :) "

												I came in to this game with the idea that ""If you liked freelancer, you'll like this"".  I liked Freelancer, I didn't like Rebel Galaxy.I felt like the camera was always way zoomed in and at a weird angle, and during combat it's pretty much always facing at a right angle to the direction you're moving (because of broadside combat) so I run in to asteroids a lot.  My second time out in a combat zone I ran into an asteroid that had something else next to it, and my ship got stuck such that it couldn't turn, and you can't go backwards, so I had to reload to get my ship free.It feels like you're flying through something far more viscous than water.  I can forgive constant thrust = constant velocity in space games if they at least let you cruise along for a while without slowing down super fast when you disable thrusters.  This game feels like a naval combat engine with space combat art resources.  I think the ship in assassin's creed black flag has less resistance from the water than your spaceship does in the vacuum of space in this game.I also didn't like the weapons.  They auto aim at stuff, and you do broadside combat where you don't really have to lead or even aim close, your weapons all just kind of pick stuff and shoot at it.  The combat is very non engaging and easy, and if it were hard I'm not sure it would be anything but frustrating since there doesn't seem to be any strategy or skill involved.The UI and the controls on keyboard and mouse are also not too great.  It seems like it might feel better on a console, but that's not much of a ""consolation"" on PC.			"

REBEL GALAXYDamn! This is such a nice discovery that I made with this little gem of a game. I had bought it, uh, long ago but finally managed to find the time and see what the hell is up with Rebel Galaxy. Oh boy, why have I waited so long? Close to 47 Hours in playtime, I think this is the longest I've played an Indie game!So what is Rebel Galaxy?If you're familiar with FREELANCER, STAR LANCER, FREESPACE, then you will feel right at home in Rebel Galaxy! The main difference is in RG, you pilot a ""BIG"" Capital ship... well, not the starter Corvette ship but there are many ships to choose from as you progress further till the untouchable ENORMOUS Dreadnought BLACKGATE! Took me forever to get it but once I did, game is just too easy...  Anyhoo... let's see the pros and cons!PROS:+SOUNDTRACK! That Dark Country musical genre is so damn good from the composers known as Blue Saraceno, The Dirty Diary and others!+Simple yet really fun and addicting gameplay.+Controlling a HUGE ship is quite satisfying! You ain't a tiny fighter here but a Capital Ship!+The progress system is taxing but rewarding each time you buy a new ship!+Freedom of progress. Want to farm/grind some more credits to have better gear/ship, do so!+Randomly generated ""universe"" so the solar systems aren't the same in each playthrough. Doesn't really matter I'd say as trading is rather pointless in RG!+21:9 UltraWide Monitor support! Visuals are pretty simple which makes RG not a demanding game!+CHEAP! For a 20$ game, I got more than my money's worth out of RG!CONS:-Average story. Hopefully Double Damage Games can improve upon that in a sequel!-Highly repetitive: Lots... LOTS of grinding. You are warned! To make it easier, focus on the ""DEAD DROPS"" side missions, they don't take long to complete and you can repeat them at will.-Ally/Enemy factions doesn't have any territories. You see them everywhere in all Solar Systems... would love a fixed territory setting like in Freelancer!-Would love more variety of missions, mostly all ""dead drops, escorting, go kill Mr X"".OVERALL:For the first game developed by Double Damage Games, I'd say they started amazingly! Sure there's some irks and quirks to work around so hopefully on an RG2, things would be polished and more meat be added too!RECOMMENDATION:Love space games? You'll love this! I just want to warn you that if grinding in a game annoys the sh!t out of you, play RG in quick daily sessions, that way you won't feel it too badly! At first, I felt the annoying grind but as you progress and get a better ship, the grind is less significant as the rewards are much bigger... so is the drops from killed enemies!I truly recommend this game especially at this low price of 20$, you'll get your money's worth!

												I would buy it again and Rebel Galaxy 2 if it would be there.This kind of game was there once or trice with only a few pixels trading and fighting. Now it's here fully 2.95D with beautiful visual effects. Easy and fun to play (with a controller) after investing a tiny bit of time.This game is not 100% for the hardcore space gamer that's needs to have everything perfect (and boringly slow). For example space is just not as empty as it would be irl,.. but I like that.  It misses i tiny bit of immersion (like a few more different faces or discussion options or some side stories or a bit more rare cool stuff or safe stuff for your retirement). But it is finished and as good as bug free (which is rare).On the other hand there is not as much time consuming todo list management. you can actually ""play"" a lot in less time.There is a lot of action per hour combined with the enjoyment of cruising through well ambianced space... not too long... just enough to enjoy the quiet lovely star rays, while in a warp bubble, or meteor belts before an adrenaline rush when going after some fleet of pirates or when they come after you ;-). Not being bothered with loosing track of everything in fully 3D (for die hards). I simply enjoy playing this for fun. Well balanced between trade, fight, travel, progression. Good interface. Good controls. Still room for a better version or dlc ;-)I vote for version 2			"

												""You can't take the sky from me""I've only just begun, but I can say that the combat is very fun, the game plays like a 2D version of FREELANCER or PRIVATEER. Graphically, it's got a lot in common with Freelancer, the color-pallet is even similar.It has a 2D combat that's easy to get into with a heavy influence of naval broadside combat.The game has a wonderful FIREFLY flavor to it. It's got a rockin almost honkeytonk soundtrack that never feels out of place.The universe is DIRTY, it's ORNERY, and it really doesn't like you.The only thing I can think of that would add to the game, is a crew aspect. If you had to find and hire good gunners, or missile loaders, or navigator, I think it would have added a bit of depth. It's not poorer for not having those things, but perhaps a sequel later on can explore that aspect.This is very satisfying game in this genre, and should keep the appetite sated until the Persistent Universe for Star Citizen[robertsspaceindustries.com] (also by the guy who did Freelancer, Privateer, and Wing Commander) comes out. Which will have a similar trading system, but a 3d environment.I'm having a ton of fun with Rebel Galaxy, and I can't wait to play some more.			"

												A very good space RPG game. A very good one for those who don't have the $$ to spend for Elite:Dangerous, EVE Online or Star Citizen.The map per star system is quite big with many enemies or allies roaming around.There are many types of ships to choose on different Stars but they cost quite a lot.Combat is for me, hard as I have yet to master the shield system.You can trade with merchants and different station and read the news to see where is the cheapest and highest market.You can also mine though you will have to sacrifice some of you ships combat parts.There are plenty of enemies that they mostly travel in groups especially if you bump into a Flagship or a Pirate Lord which basically murdered you.Music is awesome all the way.Graphics is beautiful, stunning effects and pretty display on the combat.You can customize you ship from weapons to armor to system though you can't colour it. You can hire mercenaries though only 1 and they can really help take away some of the enemies focus from you.			"

												If you're on the fence about whether to buy this game or not, go for it!  Replacing and upgrading your ship with different weapon systems and components is extremely satisfying!  You can change your tactics depending on your preferred style of play, your weapons, and a slew of other interchangeable options that allow you to specialize your ship.  I honestly don't want to give too much away.  The combat is so much fun and it's running at 3840 res well over 100 fps.  The graphical rewards are awesome!  Buy it!			"

												Great game, incredible music, super easy controls, the ships look like something out of Cowboy Bebop (kinda) mixed with Star Wars frieghters (more so). Looks great and plays great on my mid range pc, no frame rate problems or bugs for me.I think I paid $20 for it, but I'd be happy still if I paid 40+I love how the ships scale up as you go, the universal turret mounts get smaller as your ship gets bigger, and big ships handdle as they should.The story is crap but who cares! you get to fly though space and wreck havoc. make your own story. The 2d plane you fly and fight on just works, attacks just like a naval battle, and is really easy to track enemies. Heres hoping we get a second Rebel Galaxy, cheers!			"

												IntroductionRebel Galaxy is the space swashbuckling brainchild of Double Damage, reminiscing of arcade space games like Freelancer, and is supported by an excellent Firefly-like soundtrack. Unlike most space arcade shooters, the game has no pitch movement, instead opting for travel along a single plane. The main game is set inside a galaxy, although it does feature multiple maps, relatively large in size. Despite its similarities, it does a whole lot of thing in a slightly different manner, from combat style all the way down to the way you travel. What you see is basically a new breed of space arcade gameplay, and very much feels like its own brand of shiny new original IP. Prepare yourself for broadside battles and inter-faction negotiations, along with a whole lot of lighting effects to blind you mid-mining.StorylineThis game actually has a rather interesting story line, which is something I didn’t expect. Basically I was expecting it to be like Freelancer in most ways, but be lacking in some department or other. Despite my previous disposition, Rebel Galaxy follows a decent storyline. Basically you’ve been sent a message from your old crazy Aunt, who actually turns out to be a swashbuckling badass space-pirate at the age of late 50’s early 60’s. You’re trying to find out where she is, and make some sense of this weird AI you’ve gotten a hold of. Needless to say you get backstabbed and used like no tomorrow, and very often end up murdering the people you started out helping. It’s all a bit up and down, but heavily broken up by side quests and random world events. It’s similar to Freelancer in that you really need to do side quests and random events in order to upgrade your ship between main missions.GameplayLearning Rebel Galaxy initially can be a bit odd. I went in expecting one thing, and discovered it was something different. The key problem is I was expecting something akin to most space arcade titles. I wasn’t far off, but I was enough for the game’s management to throw me a bit. From scanning areas to turrets with AI, that and the fact that despite manual aim there’s still an aim assist – don’t walk into this expecting Freelancer/Freespace/X-Wing. Take portions of a number of space arcade games, and you’ll eventually have a recipe for Rebel Galaxy. The mystification lasted only a short while in fairness, it’s just something new you have to get used to, but once you do it becomes second nature. To clarify, this is a good thing. What we have in Rebel Galaxy is something that feels at least a little bit unique, unique enough for us to be learning something new, while enjoying ourselves at the same time.I’d like to go on about how much I love this game, so let’s first get the crap out of the way. Two things disappointed me most. First and foremost is the aiming system. AI turrets are awesome, configurable, and there’s a whole bunch of them and they do their job. Manual aim however, felt consistently interrupted. When engaging in broadside battles the game is constantly doing what it thinks is best. I aim the broadsides at a ship, but there’s another smaller ship closer which the game’s AI thinks is a more important target. The catch is my broadside weapons are slow velocity projectiles, and quite frankly I don’t give a damn about that tiny piece of crap. My lasers will take care of it. Instead of simply aiming at the ship I want to kill (which is usually fine in most cases I might add), the auto-aim kicks in and starts shooting broadsides in a direction that is not where you’re pointing. I hate it when a game thinks it knows better than me, and is flat out causing issues for me in intense combat situations. This doesn’t happen all that often, but it’s enough to annoy me a bit. Freelancer had it right. Allow full manual aim, but add aim assist circles to shoot for to shoot ahead of an enemy’s flight path. Auto-aim is just plain interference, because if you want to adjust the game’s target, you have to go into scan mode and switch targets.This auto-assist comes in a second form, with the game’s speed and travel system. I cannot abide it. I’m sorry, but throttling my sublight speeds and dropping me out of warp at the hint of a sparrow’s fart gets extremely irritating throughout the game. Basically warp can only be engaged when the game says so. Sublight can only be sped up to cruise speeds when the game says so. Give me control of my damn ship’s navigation, and stop farting about like my mother. Nothing has been more infuriating so far than travelling 6000 game-lengths and getting stopped three times between A and B because you skirted around an asteroid field. Freelancer solved it, but adding AI auto-avoidance around objects. You’d occasionally hit stuff and lose some shield, but no problem. Slowing me down, and then further slowing me down to the lowest sublight speeds, forcing me to turn ninety degrees and boost out of an asteroid field is immersion breaking.Rant over. The rest of the game rocks. This game is not Freelancer. Stop right there. Take all those predispositions out of your head, and prepare to play an all new type of game. Movement is entirely on one plane, but that’s cool. It means you can focus more on your tactical (or woefully haphazard) combat with those big♥♥♥♥♥broadsides. Turrets have varying types of AI that can be programmed to fire at certain types of targets, and there’s so much variation in weapons it tickles me in all the right places. Combat feels punchy, it looks pretty, and quite frankly simulating space-pirates is an excellent idea. The easiest way to make money is to pick a mission and then do all the randomised events that happen on the way there. There’s tonnes to do, and an enormous solar system to do it in. You might think to yourself that after the first solar system you’re halfway done, but you’re wrong, there’s a tonne more, and each map is as big as the next. Quite simply put there’s an awful lot of content and a lot of sights to see.Unfortunately I can't fit my entire review in this section.To read the full review, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-review/To read the performance analysis, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-performance-analysis/ "

												Highly recommended for space pilots, space pirates, and especially, space pilot pirates.tl;dr:  Firefly with capital ships by a well-credentialed indie developer (i.e, Torchlight).   Elite Dangerous in an arcade, but still mature, setting.Pros:+ Great polish in graphics.   Crunchy, but colorful.   Just the right amount of JJ lensflare.+ Excellent, excellent, excellent sound design.   Audio feedback is excellent.   Soundtrack fits perfectly.+ Varied ship customization.   Even the starter ship can be outfitted for very, very different roles.+ Thank you for on-screen button reminders!   For a casual, ""old fart"" gamer... that's huge!   (It's not memory loss... not yet... it's only playing 20 minutes a night)+ Broadside combat maneuvering is great!   Many ""Age of Sail"" ship games don't do broadside maneuvering as well as Rebel Galaxy does it. Cons:+ Minor Nit:  Some odd UX choices.   Radial menu has most of what you need, scan button has others, and yet the start menu has even others.+ No multiplayer.  Wow, would this be fun in a team!  I get that it would be out of scope for this sorte, ala Torchlight 1.+ Another minor nit:  Who are the factions?  Are they important?  Not sure.  A few brief pop-ups when you gain/lose standing might help.For <$20, I highly recommended buy for spaceship fans and browncoats alike.    A nice hybrid of space sim and space shooter.			"

												SUMMARY: A simple to play, but surprisingly deep space adventure sim with a lot of personality and style that gives you a solid ""Space Western"" adventure where you can carve your own path.It took me awhile to get into Rebel Galaxy as, early on, the directions weren't that clear and the difficulty was erratic.  That's when I realized Rebel Galaxy, for all its great graphics and soundtrack, really is a throwback to the old ""drop 'em in space and good luck"" games of the past.  Once you realize you are on your own in just about every way, it all comes together.In Rebel Galaxy you come to a distant set of stars to find out what happened to your Aunt Juno.  And from there you can do anything you want, from following her legacy, to trading, to piracy, to naming your ship ""Cosmic Bannanahammer"" and doing donuts in space.  It's pretty much up to you.Basic gameplay involves piloting your ship to different locations and pursuing different tasks - trading goods, fighting enemies, raiding ships, mining asteroids.  From firing broadsides to talking to people everything can be done with a standard game controller, which makes it extremely easy to play.  Though controls can get complex, the layout and design makes it very easy to get into the game.So let's break down the usual parts of these games:PILOTING: Space is 2D here.  Sorry, 3D is just for display.  This may seem limiting, but it fits the easy-to-control method and keeps the game from getting insanely complex.  See, battles are done by . . .NAVAL BATTLE TACTICS: This may take a bit of getting used to, but the game emphasizes a mix of broadside weapons, turrets, and specailized items.  Learning to juggle when to attack, maneuver, and fire takes a bit of work, but is rewarding to get right.  Also some of your weapons are AI controlled, making life much easier.  Speaking of ship components . . .PLENTY OF SHIP OPTIONS: Equipment really matters in Rebel Galaxy and has tradeoffs.   Once you get your playstyle down you can buy and customize ships that fit you.  Little changes mean a lot, which is good because . . .PLENTY OF MISSIONS: Sure they're often find, kill, or trade, but they're fun and more importantly they have impact with your standing of various groups.  Pirates, Militia, Citizens, and more will come to regard you differentlly depending on what you do.  This gives you quite a few ways to play the game.LOTS OF LITTLE BITS: There's also a delightful amount of extras.  Trade advice and data that appears to help you trade.  Guilds to join. Bits of humor.  Random events that pop up to keep the game rich, from ambushes to data transponders.  The more you play the more you find.A STORY THAT SEEMS INTERESTING: At first I wasn't sure about the story, but a few missions in it actually got my attention.  You don't have to play the story, but still.A SENSE OF ATMOPSHERE: Finally the game really manages to create a great ""Space Western"" atmosphere, somewhere between Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and its own thing.  This is helped by . . .A COWBOY BUTTROCK SOUNDTRACK: Really, the soundtrack is the icing on the cake, a bunch of country-rock hard-edged western type songs that complete the experience.  The details in this game really make it.Is the game perfect?  No.  Some of it's very standard game-play, if well-implemented.  The combat can be a bit twitchy and confusing.  Some of the data and info layouts could have been better done.  The thing is with Rebel Galaxy, most issues are really minor.  The game is fun, obviously made by people who love games, and has a clear, well-defined identity.  It delivers.So if you like a good space adventure game, want one that's challenging but you can pick up with realtive ease, then buy the game, get on board the Cosmic Bannanahammer, and head on out to find Aunt Juno.

												Basically AssCreed Black flag in Space, including the grindy and repetative nature that BF had.It has a great charm and flare and perfectly nails the space western vibe that it wants to set up. All the ships are dinged up and rusty buckets, your warp drive sounds like it needs a crank start half the time, everyone including the aliens sound like rednecks while vibrant nebulas full of warm yellows and purples makes the dreary backwater system you're in look cozy despite the absolute zero conditions. Combat is fine if pretty shallow, it emulates Black flag almost completely. Combat is mainly through the use of broadside cannons of which there are three main types for your preffered engagement range as well as a slew of secondary weapons that can either be AI or manually controlled. The main unique spin in all ships have shields as their main defesne and these are set up in quadrents with their own independant health pools giving a bit more importance to positioning than Ubisoft's pirate game. Ultimately that is the crux of the entire game, what is has works well but there is very little variety. You'll find one or two setups that are effective and then proceed to grind away doing randomly generated missions or trades to generate the cash needed to buy the next tier of upgrades to survive the later systems and missions, progression is purely numerical. The story itself while not offensively bad won't offer any suprises but gives a good enough incentive to have you roam around the game world.			"

												After playing 20 hours I must say this plays the ""Freelancer-Card"" best since, well, Freelancer. Just with bigger ships and stuck to third person and only two axis you play it like naval battles in Assassin's Creed Black Flag but this runs even on a TI-30. Trade, Mine, do a bazillion of generated missions, hire a wingman, upgrade your ship, get a new ship, upgrade it again, follow the story line. Quite addictive this is not done like Freelance in 20 hours (which is not a problem, played it five times over the years) it is thankfully not as much grind as I've seen in Starpoint Gemini (which might be we worth checking out as well if you played this to death).

This is a review discussing specific points about the game as a comparison for veterans of the genre.An excellent free roaming space game. Very much a Freelancer for the new generation, featuring Capital class vessels!THIS GAME IS JUST FINE WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE, DONT LET OTHER REVIEWERS TURN YOU OFF OF IT BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE A GAMEPAD!So, in Rebel Galaxy, the value of ALL of the parts you buy for your ship is fully refundable. Including ship chassis. You're free to experiment with new types of loadout at will. No charge for resale at all.There's a stat in the pause menu that shows your Net Worth, including your ship and all of the parts you have on it, what's in your cargo hold, etc. It's a great way to do a single-player space exploration game.People complain a LOT about warping taking too long, but I don't find it a problem at all. You can get upgrades to your warp drive that increase the speed dramatically. As for hitting asteroid belts during a warp, you can and SHOULD watch for oncoming nebulae and asteroid fields. You can literally see them coming from a million miles away, and just steer out of the way. Snake around space for a better paralax view, so you can tell whether you're coming up on something big.Combat is on a 2d plane for capital class vessels, and a 3d plane for fighters and bombers. So, your turrets can hit stuff above and below you depending on their placement, and your side-guns are primarily for hitting the bigger stuff.There is a surprisingly large number of ships in the game, I'd put my currently seen number at about 20. Each faction has their own set of ships on offer. I particularly like the trade faction's GIGANTIC verticall wall of shipping containers, bristling with turrets and cannons.When considering your loadout, you spend a lot of time trying to strike a good balance between equipping anti-fighter, anti-cap, anti-shield, or anti-armor. Each turret and cannon has it's own set of attributes, and the jack-of-all-trades stuff is lacking a little in the numbers department. Over all, weapons feel good and balanced between types, with a slight leaning toward Mining Lasers at the start. I found them good for the first system, and switched out to specialized guns later.The cowboy music aesthetic is nice, very firefly. I ended up turning it off after a few hours of hearing the same four or five tracks, and loaded up a playlist with all the Star Wars music from the original trilogy. Definitely a good choice.Bounties are very easy to get in to. You can find them at random when flying about by using your PULSE scanner, and waiting for the ""Bounty Detected!"" notice, then flying to the nearest enemy group. You can get map icons and waypoints to them by paying a small fee to bartenders at any station. While flying about, you'll come across lots of other stuff too. Message terminals that you can hack with a simple timed button-puzzle put waypoints on your map marking weapons caches and asteroid belts uncommonly rich in minerals. You can find distress beacons, traders or military who are fighting a losing battle and pay you VERY well to save them! You can also find ""Pirate Lords"" floating around out there. They are elusive and unusually powerful enemies with huge bounties on them.Missions are the same old cookie cutter, go here, kill stuff, gather items, come back. But! You can take three at a time, and bang them out really quick. Every station has missions, you can see the relative difficulty of each one as a color-coded mission title, green being easy, red being hard. It's actually quite accurate so far, hard missions definitely require some interesting strategies. The missions pay out as SOON as you complete the objective, so if it's just a kill order, you don't need to return for the reward. Super handy!Some of the later trade-faction missions are super lucrative, but require you to actually go find minerals on your own time. I got a mission to gather Pure Water that took me an hour or so due to NONE of the local stations having any, but that could be why I got the mission in the first place! I ended up mining out a few ice asteroids for the loot, and the reward was over $300,000.Trade itself in the game is very simple. Go to station, find merchandise that is selling low, travel around until you find a place to sell high. Each station you visit will book the sale price of each item FOR YOU, and then map them on a really clever line graph showing maximum price, minimum price, and the average price. This means you can do everything at a glance, and don't need to worry about note keeping on paper. Cargo upgrades are pretty cheap, so most any ship can do some hauling. Obviously, gigantic hauling ships do have a lot more to offer that way though.Some ships concentrate much more heavily on rotating turrets, too. So if you don't like the whole ""Broadside"" dynamic, you really don't have to do it at all. I had a little cruiser with 7 turret slots and only 3 side guns, it was just perfect! The downside to a turret-ship is primarily cost. Turrets cost as much as the entire battery of your broadside guns. They lack a little in pure DPS as well, but you can easily make up for it with proper tactical positioning. Broadsiding is hard to line up against faster enemies, and makes you extremely vulerable to flanking by other enemy ships. It does have a pretty devestating hit if you nail another ship with the whole volley, though!You can blast fighters to smithereens with a well-placed cannon volley, too. That's a little tough, but super satisfying.Over all, I rate this game very highly. Each of it's features feel polished to a mirror sheen. It's very, VERY well thought out, and plays like a dream. I've run the gamut of space-freedom games from EVE to Freelancer to EV-Nova, and I feel like this game is a shining star in the genre!			"

												Great game, incredible music, super easy controls, the ships look like something out of Cowboy Bebop (kinda) mixed with Star Wars frieghters (more so). Looks great and plays great on my mid range pc, no frame rate problems or bugs for me.I think I paid $20 for it, but I'd be happy still if I paid 40+I love how the ships scale up as you go, the universal turret mounts get smaller as your ship gets bigger, and big ships handdle as they should.The story is crap but who cares! you get to fly though space and wreck havoc. make your own story. The 2d plane you fly and fight on just works, attacks just like a naval battle, and is really easy to track enemies. Heres hoping we get a second Rebel Galaxy, cheers!			"

												It's a *very* well put together game.  I run it with a steady 60 FPS on my potato without having to reduce the settings hardly at all which makes for a rather pretty playing experience.  Well optimized and fun to play and it has a killer soundtrack.  There's definately a Borderlands + Firefly vibe going on and I love it!!  This isn't to say the gameplay is like Borderlands, because it totally is not, but the story, atmosphere, and humor reminds me of Borderlands and Firefly together.It can get a bit repetative.  During a long session you might realize that a particular song has come on more than the rest and it may seem like you're running the same kinds of missions over and over, but so it goes.  The story thus far has been pretty engaging and I don't try to skip every scene because, again, it's a very well put together game.My only regret was not buying it sooner.			"

												This is the most surprising fun game I've ever played. It has me so hooked that I took a break from Fallout 4 to go back to it. If you read the description, you're likely to tilt your head and say ""really?"", but I swear, they got the formula right. The fights are frantic and intense, but very fun. I have no idea how much story I have left, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens, and the many, many battles I will have to fight before I get to the end.One thing I discovered late is hiring mercenaries from a bar. They are helpful, but have personalities that add to the fun of a mission. The music is a great mood setter, the graphics are good, and believe it or not, locking us to two dimensions makes the fighting more fun because it reduces the complexity of navigation and lets you focus on ship position and weapons timing.

												I am enjoying this game immensely.  The capitol ship combat is a lot of fun and a nice change from the fighter craft games that I am mostly familiar with.  The broadside combat combined with AI turrets makes for an easy to learn and very fun experience. The only thing I am not sure about is the lack of three dimensional flying, but that only seems to make things easier.  I find that when I play I don't mind not having vertical maneuverability, so it doesn't seem to be that big a thing.			"

After the main story is done, all there is left to do is grind some Reputations for kicks and do achievements if you want.Having said that.+Fun gameplay+Multiple ships & weapons+Lots to explore (though limited finds)+Actually have to play smart as you fight stronger enemies, changing what sides they are hitting to allow shield recharge, using deflectors to counter missile/laser barrages etc.-Not a ton to do outside the main story besides money/rep grindingThis game is a blast (pew pew) there is a variety of weapon types for various play styles, you can (and have to) use objects in the game world as cover if you are over run (asteroids, enemy structures, even larger enemy ships! better to be shot at by 1 than by 6)			"

												Think Elite Dangerous, but with naval combat and a good story.The naval-style combat deters a lot of people, but it actually works quite nicely with the single-plane orbit everything has in every solar system.  That means you can't fly up or down, only left or right.  However, smaller fighter planes and asteroids can fly beneath or above you, requiring your ship's turret placements to be more strategic.You can trade, mine, steal, join factions, make factions hate you, help people in distress, escort ships, fight every time, flee every time (depending on ship speed).  You can play as good, neutral, or evil, or jump around and do whatever pays the most.The game allows you to easily put your own music into it. You can resell every ship or item for 100% retail value.  This means you can test out ships, weapons, defenses, etc. without fear of wasting money.  This is a nice way of getting around the fact that you can only own one ship at a time.I think this game is definitely worth the price.  As of writing this I have played 32 hours.  I'm not done with the main story line, and I don't think I will be for a while.  There is too much money to be made, and too many ships and ship upgrades to buy.			"

I loved making my ship better and better and exploring more of the map as I did so. It can get a bit repetitive, but, overall, it's a fun time.			"

												Its a cool lightweight space sim. Its got good graphics, and the alien voices are pretty cool, especially when they say words you recognize in the subtitles. The music isnt your typical space game ambient or electronica, its a kind of bluesy rock that reminds me of Pandora (Borderlands). Its great.The weird thing about this game is it looks 3d, but its actually on a 2d plane (no Y-axis). Think a top down space sim like Escape Velocity, Ring Runner, Trancendence or any of those, where you are moving on a 2d plane. But imagine the game has a similar POV as the X series. Its really weird and disorienting to be in front of a station and not be able to dive under it.Again, let me state that the game is *lightweight*. Not casual, just not as deep as a game like X3. If you love incredibly in-depth games like X3, Eve, or any of those, you will probably find this a bit too shallow.People just breaking into the space sim genre, or those of you who prefer lighter weight or 2d space sims will probably like this one. For what it is, its done very well. That lack of a y-axis  is hard to get over though, especially if you've come from a full 3d space sim.			"

												I was really curious how they implemented the broadside-combat in a space game. It seems like they found out that for the broadside-combat mechanic to work, the game had to be in 2D space instead of 3D space. So essentially, a pirate game with the looks of a space game. That would have been fine, if it wasn't for every other ship in the game being able to fly three-dimensionally and you only being able to fly and aim two-dimensionally. So, basically, auto-vertical-aiming, like in the original Doom. But then again not like Doom, as you just have to aim directly at something for your guns to auto-correct the trajectory of your projectiles so they hit a moving target. Makes combat increadibly un-exciting. As combat is an integral part of the game, this just completely turned me off.			"

												It has that one good soundtrack, but god, 10 hours in and its just so repetetive. Kill a few more mercs to get cash to upgrade a ship, which lets me kill more mercs, to better upgrade the ship, to travel to a new sector. Here the mercs are harder, so better kill a few to upgrade...TL:DR. Looks good, sounds good, but grrrriiiiiiiind.			"

												Rudimentary plotline, but it doesn't even matter. If you liked naval battles in the AC series, this could be for you. Randomized side missions (with estimated difficulty ratings, which can be a bit misleading) lets you broadside massive ships, let your turrets pop frigates and time your short-duration shielding to absorb incoming fire; standard mission types (escort, bounty kill, rescue) lets you gain money to upgrade ships to fit your play style.

												Interesting concept that gets old really fast. If this had been done better it'd feel a lot more like actually being a space bounty hunter or bandit but after like 6 hours it just turns into doing random missions and running supplies around to get more ship upgrades to do more of the same. The combat never changes the enemies just do more damage, so it just feels like a grind as you do missions to get upgrades to... do more difficult missions... For a world as big as it tries to be, the hubs are extremely generic, the bartenders are almost all the same, and your 'random encounters' all play out idententically with recycled voice overs. The soundtrack gets old af after like the first hour. We get it, the final frontier is an allegory for the western frontier, you don't need to dial that theme to 11. This game had a lot of potential I feel like but ultimately didn't meet it at all, just feels like the project funding got cut as soon as they had something that looked like they could sell. I wouldn't pay more than five or ten dollars. It's fun for an afternoon but aimless after that.			"

												Of all the Space sci-fi games I've played, this is easily one of the most satisfying ones I've played in a long time. It delivers on a great Firefly-esque atmosphere, making you feel like some outlaw merc on the fringes of space, saving or sacrificing whomever you choose. The soundtrack is great, the graphics are quite good, and the gameplay feels incredibly satisfying. From the ""float like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion"" action of the smaller, faster ships, to the bulky and powerful dreadnoughts, each ship class has a great feel to it.The story, while not groundbreaking, does it's job well. And the voice acting, while limited, is more than tolerable at the very least.If you're looking for a super-realistic, newtonian physics based spaceflight simulator, you're at the wrong galaxy. Rebel Galaxy delivers on an incredibly satisfying space cowboy feel, and at a great price too.			"

												If this was being marketed as some $50 triple-A title, it would be disappointing, but as they say in the ad, it's 20 friggin' dollars (and that's when it's not on sale). Rebel Galaxy is a very simple game, and that is its strength and its weakness. If you're looking for a game with a deep story, complex controls, or a fully realized universe with a vibrant dynamic economy, then this ain't it.  Rebel Galaxy is just a fun way to pass the time. It's a nice looking space game with simple controls and a good cowboy rock soundtrack. Incidentally, if you don't like the soundtrack, or you just want a little more variety there is a way to replace or add to the playlist in the game's launcher. I like that it lets you add different folders for different parts of the game. You want honky-tonk piano in the stations, smooth jazz while exploring and speed metal during combat? You can do that.The game is easy to learn and easy to play so long as you understand that running is often a better option than fighting. A fast ship lets you choose your battles and outrun those nasty pirate ambushes that some players seem to have trouble with. It's also a fun way to play. I especially enjoyed the dead drop missions in which I warped into the middle of an enemy formation, grabbed the loot, and hightailed it out of there before they could say, ""Prepare to die!""Are there better games in this genre? Of course. But sometimes I don't feel like firing up an Egosoft title and micro-managing a fleet of traders. Sometimes I just want to have a little fun. Rebel Galaxy was made for those times.			"

												I must say that at almost 50hr's into the game, I love every moment of it.  Honestly, at this point the only thing that I dont particularly care for is the fact that there isn't any kind of co-op/multiplayer mode to it.  The story line was compelling to the point that (aside from getting the distress call or unknown signal source) that i found myself wanting to know what would happen next about midway thru it.The soundtrack is very nice, but as with other games, when i want to listen to something else, i mute the music in game and play my own play list.The Broadside combat i throughly enjoy as i enjoy other games such as Black Flag (console), World of Warships, and back in the day Starfleet Command.  To many space sim games that do give you the whole 3D still even lack the simple ability to do a loop.  So why bother calling it a 3d game? (yes i pointing my finger at you STO and EVE)The missions will get repetive, but honestly, what game doesn't make your grind once you reach that certain point?  And there are enough different ships in the game to let you find the ""one"" that fits your play style.  I would love to see more ships added eventually.  (i want to fly that Proteus (red devil cruiser/dread (has the look of the Galactica to it))).   I would pay a little more for a DLC with the ability to fly the Alien/Pirate faction ships.As one other person mentioned, there is no cookie cutter build to deal with all missions.  The only ship that will come close to that is the End game Dreadnaught, but all that does is make you a Jack of all trades and Master of none.  (small spoiler below)(small spoiler below)The only constant you can get is the Broadsides destroying everything in 1-3 volleys unless your doing certain Heroic mission.I hope this game continues to add more to it, but if it don't, i've gotten a great game for less than $20.

												The game is a hell of a lot of fun until you realize that you can't manually save it. The game only auto saves when you dock at a space station. Prepair to waste tons of time completing missions, bountys, and getting loot only to lose it all because a group of high lvl dudes randomly pull you out of warp and kill you...quickly.   The Devs solution?... quit the game and reload because it saves when you quit. Apparently they don't want you to have so much fun playing their game that you might forget to quit and restart. Until it either auto saves after completing missions or has a manual save, I can't recommend it. It's a shame cause it's a lot of fun. I just won't waste any more of my time losing loot and replaying missions.			"

												Early impression is very good. It's a casual game which is a good thing for me considering how time consuming many space based games are. Rebel Galaxy just lets you jump straight in and start having fun.The attention to detail is one of the most impressive things, most noticably the sound effects and music. Firefly was clearly an inspiration here. Full voice acting is a refreshing change from walls of text in many new space games have used.If I had any complaints it would be that being 2D does feel a little restrictive, but I get why they did it. This could have been something really special if they made it with PC's in mind instead of consoles (but thats just me still hoping for the utimate PC space game to arrive). Dont let that put you off, it's good fun and well worth the price.Something to add - I've noticed people complain about being dropped out of warp due to asteroids and debris. That happened to me the first time I played, but then I realized you can steer around them while in warp. It's very easy to see objects coming up in the distance and it hasn't happened since.			"

But you can tell in so many places that it could work so much better and do so much better with a PC in mind.You buy and sell gear at the same price.  So you can experiment without punishment.Very very few weapon types to pick from.  Your lucky if you get more 2 choices for the rest of the gear.  It seems to cap at maybe 3 options for everything else (shields, armor, engines....)Felt like alot more variety in terms in ships.Does have decent voice acting.

												After reading reviews about this game being successor to the freelancer classic, I bought the game. The first few hours of game was quite disappointing as the 2D flight mode and the lukeworm story can hardly convince me that this game is even comparable to freelancer. After 5 hours, however, the game became a little more interesting as weapons and ships are unlocked and some of the missions are quite interesting. I have to admit the graphics are good, not superb, but comparable to the freelance --- a shame on its own as the freelancer was a game almost two decades old. The combat system was not inspiring but acceptable and admittedly quite fun to play. Just as I thought the game is getting better, it quickly revealed to me that this is no more than a freelancer game in its core repacked with better graphics and a toned down 2D flight mode. The game soon degenerates into a struggling effort to complete repetitive missions to gain enough money to upgrade ships and components that are ridiculously expensive and are so for no other apparent reasons than to compel the player to complete those stupid missions. So far I think it is unrealistic to make enough money to buy any of those higher level weapons and ships with trade alone. The difficulty associated with some of these missions are also questionable as some missions would see you quickly swarmed by a horde of overpowered enemies ships while other missions give ridiculously high reward for the simpler tasks.In conclusions, I believe this is a game suitable, in fact I would use the word ideal, for killing your excessive pastime at a moderate price. However, to comment that this game may even aspire to be of the equal to freelancer is a severe overstatement.			"

												Overall this game is amazing. As other reviewers have mentioined this game plays like Freelancer and the Assassins Creed sailing mechanic had a baby.  One issue for me: I did not find the soundtrack to be as wonderful as most do. There are moments where this game genuinely feels like a space western in the vein of Firefly, with moody slide guitar and banjo cues.  At other times, the music drifts into the realm of nickelback clones and pop country (even worse than Whedon's godawful song at the beginning of Firefly).  Personally, I'd ilke to see some of those lound country and blues songs toned down or replaced with a wider variety of background/atmosphere-building music.  Other than this particular issue of taste, I wholeheartedly suggest you buy this. Best space sim I've played in recent years.  Combat is very satisfying and upgrades come quicker than you think if you go about your purchases the right way.   A small tip: don't constantly strive for a new ship. Instead work at upgrading your defenses and weapons. Once I figured this out, it was much easier to complete those high-paying missions needed to finance the next vessel.			"

												this game totally exceeded my expectations: every other indie space sim of similar price point just doesn't have this level of polish. the UI looks amazing, gameplay is challenging and sensible, the characters and the plot are engaging, there's even some amount of post-story gameplay (grinding for dreadnaughts and rare alien weapons, working for faction reps, killing pirate lords, etc).the music is amazing, but it does get a little repetitive, since the game seems play the same short rock song (with actual singing) for the same scenes. regardless, the songs are pretty cool and firefly-esque, and would be nice to own as a soundtrack.there's even that little bit of modding possible - basically, opening the game's ini files and modifying the values to unlock certain assets for players to buy. flying a greel ship is just so awesome.

												I'm a fan of the old-school get your mission from some weirdo in the bar of a space station style of space combat sims. My all-time favorite game would have to be Wing Commander: Privateer. This game does a really great job of coming close to that experience.Pros:The soundtrack is fantastic. All the music tracks are well chosen. I only wish they would release the soundtrack as an option to buy.The choices of ships and equipment are not vast, but just right to keep things fun and keep me working to get more cash so I can try different combinations of builds.The environment is really beautiful. The game is fun to play. I would find myself warping to random spots on the map just to see what was there.Meh:The lack of a 3rd axis took some getting used to. If you put it in your brain that it is a sailing ships game with space textures instead of water it will be easier to wrap your mind around it. Once you do that you will stop noticing the inability to fly up.Besides. ""Up is just where you are looking"" -EnderCons:Some of the pirate encounters feel very RNG. I'll be flying along doing great and defending myself to suddenly find myself in overwhelming odds for no reason what-so-ever and go boom. Mining is boring as hell. And this is from someone who enjoys mining in Eve Online. Overall: This game is worth the price of admission. 7/10			"

												I had been looking for a single player space based game that included missions, mining, exploration and ship to ship combat for a long time before I came across Rebel Galaxy. I picked this game up on sale hoping it would provide me with what I had been looking for and was happily satisfied. You start Rebel Galaxy off in a tiny ship and are quickly thrown into this massive galaxy head first with no real direction and plentiful choices on what to do first, an amazing first impression. After a few hours I found that some of the missions were kind of repetitive so I moved on to a different sector to try a new guild. While the missions did vary there are a lot of fetch quest style side missions that unfortunately did not change as the game progressed. Rebel Galaxy shows you straight from the start these giant dreadnaught class ships worth $15m+ while you are making a measly $10k a mission. This while great, also lead to a desire to acquire better ships and gear as quickly as possible. The problem with this choice is due to the games difficulty system, which  is never explained. Rebel Galaxy seems to use four mechanics to set difficulty; system rating, mission difficulty and the last two are based on what hull class and gear type you are using. The game only considers your highest individual type of gear to set the difficulty which can lead to some annoying situations where you are severely outclassed by the enemy ships . These two points should not dissuade you from this game, however. Almost every other aspect was fantastic. The music, while I found not suited to space exploration, was great and has been well received by the community . The ship types and styles all were unique and looked great while offering a variety of build possibilities and attack styles. The weight and feel of the ships during combat and the combat itself. The battles at the core of the game can be amazingly chaotic, the large varieties of ships / builds with different amounts of each in a fleet can lead to some of the biggest fights you have ever been in. I went into a great number of battles ridiculously outnumbered and when surviving in the final moments after a tense and carefully executed fight,  let out a profanity or cheer due to the satisfaction of these sometimes epic encounters. Overall this game scratched an itch that I've had for years that nothing has come close to. For the price and the amount of time you can get out of this game I couldn't recommend it enough.  "

												From the first riffs of the soundtrack, to the thundering broadsides in your first battle, Rebel Galaxy grabs hold of your inner ""space cowboy"" and never lets go.Honestly, not many games give you the full experience of being an outlaw like Rebel Galaxy. Sure, other games has the long arm of the law chase you around, have you be loathed by the locals, and generally make life less than pleasant as it should be. So, what was missing? The soundtrack. This is hands down one in the top 20 game soundtracks I have had the pleasure of listening to while I played a game.As for the game itself, it is pretty straightforward. Take missions, get credits, earn/lose reputation, and along the way solve the mystery of what happened to your Aunt. While it can get grindy, especially for those wanting to be outlaws and getting that initial ""bad reputation"" you need, there is a fair amount of variety to the missions, as well as stuff to find, kill, mine, trade, etc. You can also customize your ship in a plethora of ways, from weapons and armor, to ship class itself. From gunship to dreadnought, there's a ship for just about everyone.Combat is pretty straightforward, you use devastating broadsides on larger ships to tear them apart, while using your turrets to add to the carnage, or use them to pop pesky fighters. With the customized loadouts, you can make your ship a straight up brawler, or make it a long range ship that deals damage from afar without having to worry about heavy plating. There are also support abilities that can further refine your battle plan, or round out a particular weakness.The map is pretty expansive, and the economy reacts to events, so raiding a convoy or breaking a siege will also affect prices of goods that can be traded. This affords you the player lots of ways to play, from being a miner to a no guts no glory pirate.My only gripes are that it can get grindy, but I really don't mind. The soundtrack and visuals clearly make the downtime less unpleasant, and the long warps around the map have given me lots of places to visit along the way. For someone that enjoys being a space privateer, Rebel Galaxy is a game I am glad that I did not miss out on.			"

												Cool game overallnice story & artwork, classic quests + dynamics event here and there across the galaxy (trading, bounty, delivery, escort, scouting, etc.)struggle a little at start, get set, and have fungameplay is kinda arcade and nervous if you choose and equip wisely your ship(especially recommanding to complete the story line with a frigate like the Sturville definetly a must to me gameplay wise, and trying bigger ship afteward)cool thing once your done with the story line ,while the quests or dynamic events system might be slighty repetitve it doesn't impact the fun of the ""arcade"" gameplay aspect later on for casu epic or not space battles			"

												So... Rebel Galaxy...Rebel Galaxy is a game with a space setting that locks you in a 2D plane. You can steer right, you can steer left and that's it. No up, no down, in a game with a space setting, one of the only settings in which you expect full freedom of movement and you're stuck in a 2D plane. This just doesn't make sense to me, why would you make a space game but then handle it as if the player was a ship in the ocean.This was such a disappointment. I bought this game after I watched the trailers, had a loock at the screenshots, which do look good, and read some of the user reviews. These reviews described this game as a mix of Freelance and Sid Meier's Pirates, games I absolutely love and I go back to play them regularly.What else can i say about this game?The graphics are okay, the music is... well I am not a fan of country music, so it's not for me, but that's something you need to decide yourself.I can't say much about the quests you get or the universe itself, as I only played about 20 minutes and then shut the game down in disappointment.So in conclusion if you want a very good space game with lots of freedom get Freelancer and if you want a game with naval combat on a 2D plane get Sid Meier's Prates (it's on Steam).I will refund this game and I hope that if you buy it you will have a better time with it than I did.

												I bought Rebel Galaxy on a whim, and thus far it has been the best impulse buy I've ever made on Steam.  You control a space cruiser flying around the galaxy trading and fighting.  Make money from trading at space stations buying low, selling high, and use the money to upgrade your ship with new weaons, armor, and equipment.  This will allow you to take on pirates (or become a pirate) and loot your fallen enemies.  Trade, fight, loot, upgrade, repeat until you have enough for a bigger ship and repeat the process.  This is much what I imagine Han Solo and Chewbacca did before running into Luke and Ben in Mos Eisley.  Do you want a Han Solo simulator or a Firefly simulator?  This is pretty much it.  I also enjoy the amount of choices the devs chose to throw at the player.  For almost every mission you have multiple options of how to proceed, be it violently or non-violently.  I have yet to see how many of these choices play out, but Rebel Galaxy has made a very good impression in my first few hours of gameplay.			"

I like it, but...As a fan of Firefly, I like this game for both the whole living-on-the-edge vibe, and for the slide-guitar soundtrack. It's cool.But as an astronomer and lover of science fiction, I'm disappointed.First, in space a real spaceship does NOT slow down just because you kill the engines. There is this thing in physics called ""momentum"". You know, the whole thing about an object in motion tending to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force? In space there are very few outside forces that would cause a spaceship to slow to a stop just because the engines are off. At the bottom of a gravity well, like, say, on the surface of the Earth, a vehicle like a car will slow when you take your foot off the gas because of friction. Silly programmers... If you're gonna make a game set in space, at least pay attention to how things BEHAVE in space.Second, even though the POV can be moved around in 3 dimensions the actual game play is 2-dimensional. You can go right & left (port & starboard), but not up or down. Remember Star Trek II, the Wrath of Khan? How did Kirk beat Kahn? Because Khan was operating in only 2 dimensions, whereas space is 3-dimensional.I mean, c'mon, guys! If you're gonna go to all the trouble of programming a game that is smart enough to have you colliding with ice chunks, asteroids and planetary objects, can't you figure out how to deal with 3 dimensions?The last item is that, like so many other games, once you’ve got the basics down it’s “lather, rinse, repeat.” It would be nice to have more different kinds of missions - medical rescues, something that involves landing on some of the worlds instead of just flying by, I dunno. Something other than just blasting things to smithereens.Ah, well. Given the limitations, I'm gonna have to give this game 3.5 stars on a 1-5 scale. "

												 Rebel Galaxy from Double Damage Games is the space shooter for the fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly who thought the writing and characters were too complex. While the writing is just passable the gameplay is simple in a good way. The player's ship is stuck on a single horizontal plane and 2/3 of the weapons either auto-fire or auto-target but instead of oversimplifying the game it focuses the experience on maneuvering.

												One of my shorter reviews.Looks nice.Plays nicely.NPCs are limited, but look, sound, and interact nicely.Story starts simple; quickly escalates into ""new guy saving everybody"" territory.Limited ship selection, but not enough to get angry about.Only negative I found was the main story was short and the universe feels empty once that's over, so longevity was an issue.Check it on Youtube, I'd say it's worth the price tag.

												This game is amazing!  It has great gameplay, from zooming around killing dirty ol space pirates, to mining for riches, or delivering cargo to and fro.  The visuals on it are breathtaking, and the amount you can customize your ship is awesome too.  I just made it out of the first sector, and I'm finding new enemies, a new guild to join and do quests for and new parts of the storyline.  The one thing that I find the coolest is the amount and difference in ships.  I started off with the basic little ship, it has like 4 broadside cannons and 2 turret placements.  I saved up enough to buy the next one that had one more turret placement and thought ""holy crap, I am way stronger now"".  Before I jumped sectors I had saved up for a half million dollar ship ""the barracuda"", because it had very fast speed and manuverability, along with 5 turret slots.  I thought I was the boss... and then I saw the ships in the next sector.  This one I just saw costs 17 MILLION and has 13(!) broadside ports and 13(!) turret placements and is HUGE!  Holy crap, time to do some more missions and save up to get one of those beasts.  I have played for 16 hours as of this review, and I can see myself playing for many more hours to come.  So worth the money!			"

												This game is definitely worth it on sale. The gameplay is repetitive but fun. I recommend playing as a pirate for maximum fun. There is just something so satisfying about flying up to a trader asking for help because he is bring attacked by pirates and joining in on the kill. The life of an outlaw is fun, running from or destroying the militia as they chase you around each system. The music is great. I created a playlist of the songs and have listed to it hundreds of times. The space western theme is well flushed out. Mining and trade are boring. It's much more fun to just take from others. The missions are repetitive but are fun if you like blowing stuff up. There are a decent number of ships and some are faction specific. I enjoy the 2D combat. I fully admit that I find 3D space combat to be too difficult to enjoy. This game is more like eve online in that sense. I definitely recommend you get this on sale. A few dollars for a solid 30-50 hours of fun is well worth it.			"

												Great space action RPG. As a low priced space game I didn't expect much, but have found this game fun and satisfying.The world is full with a great variety of things to do. Everywhere you go are distress beacons, asteroid fields, ships to fight. Even while on a mission you constantly run into things to distract and entertain you. There are a huge variety of quests to suit any play style.The combat is interesting and challenging. The world is 2d and the ships feature big broadside guns, naval combat style.There are a variety of upgrades that will change the way you play. Broadsides cannons, turrets, missiles, different shield and engine styles.If I have a single complaint it's the difficulty curve of the main quest. The missions ramp up very steeply and require doing tons of side missions to earn cash for upgrades. While I'm still enjoying myself, it does get a bit grindy.			"

												I have to say, I love the style and presentation of this game, and the gameplay is superb. There is a balance in every type of play style and it feels fantastic to lay waste to your enemies in whatever fashion you choose, be it ramming into the hull of enemy ships, overwhelming them with a superior arsenal, or quick strikes that topple your alien foes with mosquito bites. The base soundtrack is limited but manageable with the option to extend the playlists with your own tracks. If you want to blow up♥♥♥♥♥♥while listening to Drake, you can do it! My biggest gripe with this game however... Is the repition. You will be destroying bandits, evil alien factions, the lawmen and women of the galaxy... but thats all the game has to offer. Even into my 20th hour of gameplay I was in love with the combat system, but as the dust settled and the story came to mind, I couldn't find it in me to play past a certain point. I love this game and I believe with a little love and attention for the story or making the economic elements more accessible it could be great.			"

												Bought it and immediately tried this game after looking at the nice reviews. Anddddd....... 8 hours gone just like that. And another 7 hours in the second day.....Ok here is my short review about the game after playing it for 2 days:PROS:- Nice graphic- Nice background music- You can change the background music with music you have, you even can change it for specific situation like music in combat or just gliding around. I use battlestar galactica bgm and it's awesome- Awesome broadside combat, blast away enemy ships with lasers, photons, or whatever you have- Lots of customization for your ship- Cool shipsCONS:- For unknown reason, when I enter the main menu sometimes the game crash- You can't customize ship paint, I really hope I can do thisNEUTRAL:- You can't go up and down in this game, pretty weird since the setting is in space. But this make the game easier to play- No mod support now AFAIK. If there is a mod support, this game will be even more awesomeIt's on sale now and I reccomend you to buy this especially if you are a fan of space battles.			"

												Rebel Galaxy plays like a mix between Privateer, Freelancer and Sid Meier's Pirates in a good way. You have all of the staples of the arcade space sim golden age. Lots of stations, equipment, ships, systems and planets. You have combat and trade missions. You have bars to visit and fully voiced characters and wingmen to talk to and a full campaign story. I loved it and I'm sure that you will too if you remember the old arcade space sims fondly! My first impressions:

												This is the most fun I had out of a game in a long time. The music is fantastic and really sets the mood. The combat might be 2D but I feel it doesn't take away from the game at all. The ships and stations have this old look to them that I like but not be for everyone. Combat isn't easy either! I often found myself running into fleets of space pirates and getting rekt, thankfully hiring a mercenary really helps. Saving can be annoying because game only saves when you leave a station so you have to be careful going place to place.			"

												Rebel Galaxy....Probably the most fun I've ever had with a space game like this ever. The soundtrack alone attracted me to this wonderful game, only because it's such a perfect match. Though I must say, at the time of writing this, I have roughly 60 hours set in right now into Rebel Galaxy, but it does not match the potential amount of hours I COULD be spending playing this game. With it's randomly generated ""Systems"" or whatnot, it provides a relatively fresh experience with every new playthrough. The only downside with this model, is there is a general process that is the same, and it goes with the advancement in tech vs. the contracts price in every system. Right out of the start cutscene, I could spend maaaybe 2-5 hours building up enough money for a new drive that allows for Solar System Gate use, and start working easy contracts in the furthest system. Run into no conflict, and in the matter of hours attempting at getting high tier gear relatively early on in the story breaks the immersion a little bit. Even if you were to stay true to the story aspect, you can get to a specific point and still go do side quests and contracts for money. There are many directions that you could take with every playthrough, and thats what I'm getting at exactly. No matter how hard or easy you make it for yourself, it's still amazing what one could do in this game.I will have to say, it does break a little bit of realism/immersion at times, when Juno talks  about ""your small ship and how it may be time for an upgrade"", and you already maxed everything out. It just seems weird to me. Little prompts like that. Another thing that concerns me is the difficulty overall, it goes from baby steps to smacks in the face pretty quick, and the overall progression seems a little awkward when moving up in tech. I found that the only way I could survive going up in difficulty for the next system was to earn a ridiculous amount of money, go over there, and buy the highest tech because that would be the only way I could even survive there. The whole concept of Mining or Trading seems a bit awkward to me, because if you want to mine, you have to go at it for a long time to make any real profit. It feels almost useless to me (Mining), unless you find that golden nugget in a desert, the Antimatter Specks, which I have yet to find. The only way you can even make trading profitable is if you attack convoys or traders due to the large amount of items they have that are super profitable OR fighting Pirate lords with high end ship systems, though, they are insanely hard sometimes.PROS:1. The whole badass atmosphere (with music) gives the player confidence and has a really good feeling while flying through space in my awesome ship with big weapons2. Optimization and level of content allow the highest graphics even on lower end machines3. Ship designs seem really well thought out and allow for a multitude of playing stylesNEUTRAL:1. Combat feels tasteful and well done, though lack of ways to end your enemies in your travels feels saddening at times. When I'm flying past, I feel the only way to really do damage is broadsides or lots and lots of turrets. If only there were more ways, it would feel just perfect.CONS:1. Mining is tacky and has a useless feeling. One could be mining for hours, but unless they are mining the right materials that usually scarce in most astroid fields, so it doesn't feel fulfilling2. Solar Systems never really feel unique, a few system is a new system. It may have labels that some places are better for trade or mining, but I haven't really noticed a difference anywhere.3. Factions seem pointless sometimes - because I could be super friends with the militia and citizens, but NOBODY else would like me, and it wouldn't matter because I wouldnt gain anything from them anyways. The only other faction that matters to some degree is the Red Devil Raiders, but they offer mid-game gear from my current understanding. If the other factions had more purpose and personality, I'd be more inclined to try improving relations with them, IF there was a way besides surrendering all of my cargo whenever they see me.Rebel Galaxy is definitely a fun game and I highly suggest you give it a try!---NOTE---The game is not far from its release date, so I expect a lot of changes in the games further history, but for now, this is what I see :)			"

												I've only gotten a few hours into this game, but I'm already loving it. It appears to have the full range of activities in the Freelancer tradition: exploration, trading, mining, and loads of combat. You have faction relations that can go up or down depending on who you do missions for, and there seem to be space ports all over the place to dock at for missions and equipment. I've only barely scratched the surface of the main story, but it's intriguing so far.Combat seems to be the focal point of the game, and it's really well done. I'm not sure how much more layered it can get, but it's nicely varied so far. You control a capital ship rather than just a fighter, and you seem to have two primary classes of weapons: broadsides and turrets. Broadsides do massive damage, but are slow and can't track fast moving ships. They're great against other capital ships though. Turrets can lock onto targets and tear up small fighters, but they can overheat if you don't give them a break from firing. And the cool thing is, they will automatically fire while you're controlling the broadsides. In addition, you have a thruster boost mechanism that can increase you speed, but which can also be depleted from over use, such that it needs a rest to recharge. On top of that, you can get a deflector add-on which is something like an extra shield that absorbs essentially all incoming damage. When it's up, you can't fire your weapons, and it has limited energy which drains over time or rapidly when it's taking hits.What all this means in practice is that you've got a lot of systems and energy bars to keep track of, which keeps combat really engaging. It was a tiny bit overwhelming or frustrating initially, but I felt like I got the hang of the essentials within maybe half an hour. At that point, combat was a blast.I can't say much about the main story, since I've only gotten a couple missions into it, but it seems to revolve around some form of advanced technology and finding a lost relative. Interesting enough that I want to see where it goes. The world feels large and full of activity. Visually, the game is gorgeous, with great effects for all the weaponry, and the music is awesome, a dustry, countrified rock soundtrack that really adds a lot of character to the experience. I love me some electronic music, but this is a nice change of pace that gives the game a distinct personality. In summary, if you ever played the old Wing Commander games, or Freelancer, or anything similar, you will love this game. It even more closely resembles another game call Nexus: The Jupiter Incident that came out about a decade ago, which had an equally interesting story. I'd say the primary difference with that game is that combat is much more refined and well done here. If you're like me and aren't sure, but crave space adventures, get this game.			"

I though the pinacle was HOMEWORLD from back in the day and then they re-released it with better bells and whistles and I never thought there could be a better title. Then my sister sent me this game for a present...and it BLEW MY DAMN MIND! I slobbered over my keyboard at the sheer epicness of this game. Hours and hours of gameplay and I haven't even scratched the surface!BEST SOUNDTRACK TO A GAME EVER! And they even let you use your own music plugged directly into the game with their own OST...WHO DOES THAT!?There is a litteral trade/consumables market that fluctuates like the stock exchange and I've never felt more satisfied from an in game payday than this!Seriously, if you love space sims (without all the dizzying directional BS) If you love some broadside pirate-style combat,If you love going in balls to the wall against impossible odds,If you want the choice of forging your living as a pirate, privateer, mercenary, or smuggler,THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!

												As a fan in general of the larger and more complex space sims such as the old X games I can say I had a lot of fun with this game despite it being ""simpler"". If you're looking for a game that is very deep and has fully fleshed out trading, reputation, 3d flight you may want to look elsewhere (X3 or Starpoint Gemini 2 come to mind). I don't think that's what the developers were trying to accomplish here. I think they wanted the fun and engaging nature of a naval pirate game with some light-weight trading mechanics, where the focus is kept on the combat with the loot system basically for rewarding the player and enabling progression. In that I think they succeeded and did a great job in bringing that feel to a space setting while adding a distinctive feel with the music and pace. I will say that I did have a minor issue with the game where once I found the right setup it became pretty easy to cheese my way through the fights, but it was still a blast.			"

												This game is great! You'll be able to find a lot of reviews listing its general qualities, so I'll just talk about my experiences with its combat.Note: This is not a 3D movement dogfight space combat sim,  combat in this game is closer to what you might find in old naval battlesCombat against a mixed enemy fleet is truly a multitasking excercise. You'll be using your boosters to keep yourself alongside larger enemy ships so you can use your broadside cannons, timing your deflector shield uses to block their incoming broadsides/missles, and spamming X button to fire EMP flak at the smaller ships so you can focus on the big target.I find myself having to think about positioning alot, and having to boost away from larger ships or swarms of small craft while i swing my own ship around because the big hole in my leftside hull cant take it anymore, so i reorient and come in from a new angle. So far about 50% of my combat has been outside of mission running. You'll often find distress beacons, get tips from bartenders on bounty locations, or just plain run smack into an enemy fleet while warping somewhere else. Certain missions seem really unbalanced at first, but after refitting to the right weapons or adopting new tactics, suddenly theyre totally manageable. "

												I am old enough to have enjoyed the original Elite back in the '80s and this has the same basic game elements - start with a clapped-out old ship and upgrade it through a series of missions (story and optional), obtain better weapons, carry more cargo, etc. etc. and choose how law-abiding or otherwise you want to be. The game's strengths are the solid storyline, music and easily mastered combat system (although it  is slightly confusing at first, given it operates mostly in 2D in a 3D world). There are enough factions, mercenaries and systems available for this to be fun - it's no space simulator. The main con would be the other side of that coin - once you've completed the story it's hard to see the replayability but at the price point it's well worth investing in. Hopefully a sequel and/or DLC will expand the story/universe and/or gameplay without making it a game where you need to memorise the mapping of your entire keyboard.			"

I'm having a blast and I could see this becoming one of the best space games after a few content updates. Excellent job guys.			"

												This is actually one of the best games I've played in a long time. Ship upgrades and missions and mining and it's just great all over. There's even a decent amount of trading that can be done and the storyline makes you want to find out what happens next. Managable difficulty spikes and I didn't even realise that I spent 8 hours playing today because it's so immersive. 9/10 Will def play again. And probably alot.			"

												The soundtrack makes this probably the best Firefly game we'll ever get, but if - after a dozen hours have you memorized every note of the included tracks - you throw in the right custom soundtrack it pretty much covers Cowboy Bebop as well. Mechanics-wise this is basically Freelancer 2, except with far better 2D naval combat, randomized systems and sectors, far less ""loadscreen"" traveling (instead you free-form warp and dodge obstacles and it usually takes 40-60 seconds) and the endgame is you piloting gigantic behemoths with dozens of automated turrets in gigantic battles with up to a hundred ships.The variety of mission types for the generated missions is reasonable but limited, so it's up to yourself to pick the type you enjoy (pro-tip: escort missions usually pay that much for a reason) and to get the insane(ly expensive) gear you'll need need to either batch a few dozen missions or - much more exciting - pick the contracts that the game deems far too hard for you and play smart (and hope for the best). So that's both difficulty selection and clever risk-reward choice to let you pick the pace you enjoy.There are definitely a number of systems that feel functional yet rudimentary that i'd like to see expanded for a sequel, but this delivered everything i always thought i wanted from the larger space games like Elite or EVE (ha) or that other sad joke in a much more condensed and enjoyable package.

												This game has the understanding that many of the more recent space sims do not, namely that a living world creates immersion and that the major component for creating a living world consists of real voices, simulating communication with the player, and a vibrant AI system. Add to it some hearty music and Rebel Galaxy feels warm and alive, unlike its much more expensive predecessors.The main gameplay feature that sets this space sim apart from all others is that the battle happens with Black Flag type naval combat, where the ship stays on a flat plain and fires cannons from the sides. Pro's: Good flow: you complete missions, scavenge ships, buy upgrades, move to more dangerous areas, buy better ships, help out allies, do more missions, etc. It gets addicting.Dynamic unbalanced world: I once came across an enemy capital ship in a low-difficulty space that annihilated two militia capital ships and was clearly overpowered for the area. Another time, I came across a giant pirate armada next to a planet. Yet another time, the mission was labeled hard but turns out to be super easy if you are fast enough. Maybe these are all bugs, but they make the game feel more dynamic and realistic.Music: slide guitar rock is great. I bought the songs before the game even came out.Combat is fun. Lots of ships flying all over in the colourful chaos of battle.Customizable fighting styles: Buy a fast ship or a slow mammoth; long range torpedo boat or point-blank cannon. You decide.Good value for your money.Cons:Saving behavior. At the time of this review, the game saves whenever you quit the game or at a station and there is only one save. This means: 1. you cannot load a previous game if you mess up and 2. if anything happens to your save, you are screwed. This means you have less freedom to experiment. I have yet to find a game where the checkpoint system did not annoy me.Flat space: While the naval combat system does work, part of what I love about space sims so much is the freedom to fly anywhere and by restricting the movement to a plain you are cutting at the core of what is interesting about space sims.Trading system is mediocre: You can buy low by paying attention to the news and then sell high but it is nowhere near as profitable as doing even the easiest of the combat missions and just does not work very well.In time, a few annoying bugs did reveal themselves, though nothing gamebreaking.

												I bought this game on 2016 winter sales for about 9 bucks. With that amount of money, and with our alcohol's price, I could have got like couple of beers, may be some spirit, and then proceed to get waste on New Year eve.But no, I bought this piece of work instead.On my first hours, I died 3 times.

I guess the system should have warned me at a safe distance, not when I was up close and personal then a red text that said ""red level"" appear. The second time, I flied too close to the sun (planet) and the third was when I have the idea of taking a gunship ""up close and personal"" with a destroyer.I should have bought the beers.

Posted: June 7, 2016
												Yet again, the fact that Steam reviews don't have a ""Meh"" button, is really unfortunate.At first, I didn't like the game - death was frequent and random and the camera was terrible. I even got a Steam refund, thinking that the game was horribly ported, but I found myself missing the combat and feel of the game, so I bought it again... on sale mind you.Having a lot more time in the game now, I can give a clearer opinion on the good, the bad and the plain outright moronic.You control a capital ship and you shoot at other capital ships with a combination of turrets and broadside guns. While there are also smaller ships in the way of fighters, gunships and bombers, you can't control them or even deploy them. If you want an idea of how ship combat works and have played SPAZ2, then you pretty much know. I'm not sure who plagiarised who, but someone did. I can't seem to find anyone else who has raised this point, which is strange, as the similarities are uncanny. Anyway, the good points and the bad.First the good stuff. The graphics on the ships are nice - very nice. Everything else? Not so much. I'm not sure why space is so bright in video games, but I don't like it. The planets look pretty bad in particular, but luckily they are just obstacles to go around and the level of interaction with them stops right there. Another good point is the feel of the ships.Another good thing is how the combat feels. At least most of the time anyway. Flying around in a big ship with turrets and lining up broadsides is pretty neat, though I tend to stick with turret heavy ships and let the game do the aiming, as broadsides don't seem particularly useful most of the time with the speed of combat as it is.So the bad stuff. This is tough, as I don't know where to start. Ah wait, I know.""Space"" is kind of a strange word to be using in this game. You are on a 2D plane. There is no up and there is no down. This might as well have been a boat game rather than a spaceship game - it would have made more sense. It's not too much of a bad thing, I guess, as full 360 movement isn't always done well, but then come the obstacles. Flying through asteroid or junk fields is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ especially when you graduate to the bigger ships. Squeezing in between spaces can be awkward. Even worse is when you are ""warping"". See, when you aren't in combat, you will, after a time, automatically start going at ""sublight"" speed, in which your ship will go faster than it normally can. Any ship, or rock, or piece of space junk and this faster speed will cut out. Let me tell you: ""space"" is full of crap in this game. I dare you to fly any sort of straight line in this game without running into a junk field, asteroid field, ice field or random pirates who happen to be sitting in your flight path. It's so bad that it feels cramped and clunky. It's really bizarre.Another issue that I find annoying is to do with the fighters. Remember I told you that the game is on a 2D plane, right? Well that doesn't apply to fighters. They have full 3D movement, so targetting them can be really hard, especially with the broadsides. Turrets can handle them but they seem infinately more powerful than capital ships when even in small groups, which I find pointless. Also, you'd better pray that you don't encounter fighters of a higher rank than you because they can outrun and outgun you. When the only thing to do is to cut your ship's engines and wait for your inevitable death as you can't fight and can't run, then you know something is seriously wrong.The largest issue, however, is unibutton. If you've played any game ported from a console, you'll know what I'm talking about. Some games call it a context button while others call it an action button. I call it a lazy porting button: used for control pads with limited buttons and annoys us PC gamers with keyboards. This button is responsible for your warp and will automatically light up when you can warp... it's also your tractor beam, your speed increase button and hailing button. When you are near cargo, have hails going off and simply just want to go to warp, you might aswell just blow your brains out instead of waiting for the inevitable frustration triggered aneurysm. Devs: this is the PC. I have dozens of buttons which I'm not using, is it really so much to ask that I be able to map different actions to them?The game can feel good though it does get repetitive after a time and the issues are just mind bogglingly dumb. A minor issue (in terms of the game not my hearing) is that the menu sound and music is so much louder than the actualy game that I have to keep turning the volume down when I exit.This game is ok if it's on a sale, you will get some gameplay out of it and I do feel that it's better value for money than Space Pirates and Lego 2. Don't expect it to last, though.			"

												I recommend Rebel Galaxy, but you've got to know what you're getting into.Rebel Galaxy initially has far more personality than many of its peers in the ""randomly generated open world space game"" genre.  Unfortunately, the space cowboy facade wears off pretty quickly and the game still boils down to being the same sort of soulless mechanical grind as every other open world space game. The only thing compelling you to play the game is getting the next bigger ship, until you finally get the biggest one, and then you're left only a bit of a hollow feeling at having wasted so much time doing the same things over, and over...and over.So why the thumbs up in spite of these gripes?  Because it's priced right and I knew that's what I was getting going in.  For what it is, it's quite fun to play; it strips away some of the unnecessary complexity of similar games and lends itself to being played in short bouts - which makes it far more palatable to me than some of these games which require an hour just to make one profitable cargo run (you know which ones I'm talking about...). It scratches an itch for space shootin' without being particularly cumbersome to play. I've had enough fun with it for the price that even if I had stopped playing before getting the biggest ship, I would have been satisfied.Just go in knowing that there's a ""honeymoon"" period with this game that eventually wears away before the raw mechanical nature of it is laid bare and if you start getting bored.  After that, I recommend treating it as a ""filler game"" you play in short bouts between doing other things and you'll enjoy it.I do have a couple specific nitpicks that I will list only in the event that they could be taken into account for future improvement:The soundtrack is great...but it makes me realize why some other space games have ""ambient"" orchestral soundtracks.  The game can easily sustain many, many more hours of gameplay than there's soundtrack to cover and the 10th time you hear the same song, it will start to drive you nuts.  There are simply not enough songs in the game.  You can import your own custom soundtrack and that's good, but requiring a player to go to the effort of cultivating his own soundtrack just to avoid being driven insane by the hearing same steel guitar alt-country song for the 65th time is a problem.Regarding the ship models, it became a little too apparent that some were done via contract work or perhaps even just bought off a content store.  The first few ships were very clearly designed to fit the game.  However, some of the later model ships have designs that don't really gel with the visual design of other ships in the game (even accounting for them coming from different alien races). Some have turrets in spots that don't really make sense for the game's mechanics (which ends up in the turret being fairly useless because it's often blocked by the ship's own geometry), or the broadside fire coming out of parts of the model that don't look like they were designed for that purpose.  I wish every ship in the game was as carefully designed as the starter ships.			"

												I've been a fan and follower of just about every space game out there ever since Star Trek played on the TRS-80 back in 1980. On and off of Steam I've bought and tried most of the Elite-type, x4 style, in cockpit, top-down, you name it... I've tried and played it. Not many have been as fun to play as rewarding and smooth as Rebel Galaxy... in fact I'd say only one other game comes close... But Rebel Galaxy takes my vote for sure!I look forward to seeing if and when this game gets modded, where it can be taken... It'll be a fun ride for sure.If you enjoyed Privateer, Elite, Freelancer, X-Terran Conflict, Wing Commander and similar... You're sure to love Rebel Galaxy. I haven't even left the first star system yet there's SO MUCH to do! I'm in my second ship, but with all the upgrades, addons and captured hardware my tier 2 ship can handle some pretty bad-A ships. I am truly enjoying the experience!! I give it 8 out of 10 stars. Why two stars less? I would have liked to have been able to build my own starbase or home base. And possibly have planetary landing and exploration... Hopefully in future addons or DLC's... who knows. ;) "

A boy has the right to dream......there are endless possibilities stretched out before him.Rebel Galaxy takes the classic free-form, open-world space sim a la Darkstar One, gives it amazing, brutal, fast, exciting combat, adds a strategic economy with stock market-esque line graphs, a bunch of well designed, fun-to-fly ships, pumps in some grungy western blues rock, and then throws you into the middle of your favorite outlaw studded sci-fi show. We're talking Outlaw Star, Firefly, Dark Matter, Battlestar Galactica, etc.I was initially sold on the soundtrack alone (seriously, just watch the first trailer and you'll know what I mean). I thought I would lament the loss of a Z axis in flight/combat, but because of playing on a flat plane, it plays very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag's ship-to-ship combat, and as such it's very smooth, easy to grasp, and fun.Pros:+ Excellent Soundtrack+ If you don't like the soundtrack, or want to add your own flair, the soundtrack can easily be replaced with your own music, separated by category (idle spacefaring, combat, space station), and your own music can be played along with the included soundtrack+ Smooth combat+ Lots of spacecraft+ Well made stock market style economy+ Planetary events add strategic value to trading+ Feels like you're right inside the Outlaw Star or Firefly universe+ Later fights are challenging, but fun+ Warping between planets is very relaxing+ Space is big. Each solar system is pretty massive, so expect to warp a lot+ Inside jokes and references to other sci-fi media is plentifulCons:- A bit grindy, especially early on- Missions are fairly repetetive- Some later fights can be brutal- Losing a big battle means going back to the last station you docked at. Dock often- No piloting small fighter craft8/10 Would soar like a leaf on the wind			"

												REVIEW – REBEL GALAXYIf you’ve ever prayed that Firefly would be turned into an action-packed space sim, just pour yourself a tall glass of bourbon and strap in, pardner. With the crunchiest roadhouse-cowboy soundtrack this side of the ‘verse and a visual feast that can only be described as f---ing majestic, Rebel Galaxy has been lovingly hand-crafted to appease the most deeply rooted spacelust in us all. Gods. Be. Praised.Here’s the story: Your aunt Juno, a semi notorious ne’er-do-well, has vanished under mysterious and potentially dangerous circumstances, leaving you with a junkheap of a ship and a cryptic message. You’re then set loose in the Xanthe star system (the beginner zone) to carve your own path, choose your side(s), and blast through the near and far reaches of space trying to save the old gal from her fate. And that's just the start of it.The solar systems are randomly generated but feel fully realized, with fluctuating economies, random events, and an endless torrent of side quests. The factions are pretty clear – there are “good” guys and “bad” guys, and it’s rare to help someone without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off someone else, and you’re definitely going to be doing that. You’ll make heaps of money, buy bigger ships and WAY bigger guns, and doing lots and lots of killin’ folk, often in self defense.A majority of your time will be spent fighting nasty people and blasting around the systems for your quests, and it can feel grindy sometimes. That said, I managed to spend WAY more time than I expected doing just that without it feeling tiresome. Hell, it took me 13 hours of gameplay before I felt like finishing the story quests in the very first system, and there are 14 systems. The physics are just delicious, the visuals are head-shakingly grand, and the sound design is so good it hurts. It’s all more than enough to make you forget you had a life outside which, frankly, is kinda the point. Rebel Galaxy is heroin wrapped in crack and drowning in whiskey. So, giddyup.How I’d describe it: EVE for introverts.Score: 4 out of 5Why: Gameplay is unbelievably good. Character interactions feel a bit railroaded, but let’s be honest – that’s not why you’re playing. "

												This game makes me think of Firefly (its plot and style) mixed with Borderlands Series with just plain fun Total Space warfare.  Its simple, arcade style controls, and lots of fun.  If you liked X2/3 or and well made space game, you should enjoy this.  Wish they had more of that southern electric guitar music to play.  Goes good with the theme			"

												Definitely a fun ""arcade"" space game and some nice ship models. Start off in a frigate and work your way up to a dreadnought--how can you go wrong? Expect to grind it out but the grind is rewarding as you swap out new ships and better equipment for bigger & badder pirates to destroy. You can trade and mine too, but let's be honest, the fun is in kicking♥♥♥♥♥GREAT soundtrack with the game. Well worth the $20 investment--good for 25-35 hours of enjoyment.			"

												I've played a lot of space simulation RPG's going all the way back to the original Wing Commander and I can honestly say this is the first one in a long time thats held my attention long enough for me to only get two hours of sleep on a work night.Its a great mix of sandboxing and storytelling and largely just makes you continually go....""eh I can do one more mission"" til its way to late for you to pretend you're a responsible adult.As a PC player I can't say I'm a fan of the simplified console controller interface, but...its functional and works great on a PC either way so I can't really knock it other than a simple nitpick in regards to the on screen control layout not really doing much for my immersion levels...which is a minor quibble indeed when you come across a nice little gem of a game like this that costs less than 20 dollars.If you enjoyed anything up to Freelancer, or even if you currently enjoy Elite:Dangerous and would like something a little less full of other people....Rebel Galaxy is a great piece of work for the money.

												Have you ever wanted to sit in the captain’s chair of an all-powerful dreadnought with enough firepower to evaporate a fleet of foes? Then this might just be the game for you.In Rebel Galaxy you take reigns of a huge ship and carve your own path through a randomly generated quadrant of space. You can choose the path of a hero and save those you meet from a vast array of pirates and rogues. Or you can fall prey to greed and debauchery, siding with the Red Devil Cartel and carve your way through every enemy that stands before you.But that being said you could choose to do neither. There is always the option to be a humble miner and strike it rich in one of the vast amounts of asteroid belts and nebulae that litter the universe. Or perhaps the life of a trader is more up your alley, with a huge amount of commodities and a living breathing market place that varies from station to station and can be influenced by every day events the choice is yours.The game looks great, it may not be the most stunning graphics available today but I loved how it looked. The ships have super details models, the stars and planets were a joy to look at. The battle effects were bombastic and colourful. Every shot from my huge broad side barrage lit up the night sky as it ripped through the hull of my enemies. The audio is fantastic too. The music chosen for the sound track really adds to the title; each song filled with a defiance that really gets the heart racing and only adds to the reminiscence of Firefly or so many spaghetti westerns that said screw you to the man. The sounds were great as well, the whirring up to using your warp drive or the blasting sounds of laser-fire as it rips through shields and hull alike. The only let down is some of the voice acting was not stellar, but what’s there is good enough to convey the story.Speaking of which the story serves only one purpose, to convey your ship from one star system to the next. Most of the adventure in this title is not from the main plot but from the tales you form yourself. Taking on a trade mission and getting ambushed in a system that is far beyond your ships abilities, warping in to help a trader being pirated by xeno scum or the joy of stumbling upon a fleet of pirates and having them throw your offer of surrender back in your face and blasting them to dust as punishment. The main plot is not bad by any means but the game is so much more.Now gameplay, there are so many facets that it would be impossible to go through them all. The main game is either menu-based, exploration or combat. The menus are as expected. But the meat of the game is its exploration, so much to see and do and the ship controls fantastically. The one drawback is turning speed; the manoeuvrability of the larger ships is very slow and can make tight turns laborious. Combat on the other hand is snappy and fast and only hindered by turning speed. But since a lot of your turrets autofire you feel like a god when your ship can decimate everything in its path on its own and when finally you bring the broadsides to bear its goodnight to whomever you are aiming at.The ships themselves are fully customizable. From engines to weapons, turrets to warp drives, even the size of your cargo hold, everything can be modified, changed and improved. Starting with the most basic of equipment you soon build a ship Mal Reynolds would be proud to call his own. From the tiniest corvette all the way to the mightiest of destroyers each has its own quirks and I enjoyed playing all of them.This game is phenomenal and will have you enraptured for hours. Some people may feel it’s a little slow to begin with or the combat is a little tricky with slow aiming, but if you can get past all that it’s a real gem and I had a whale of a time with it. Plus at full price it is still cheap I would recommend buying this all day any day sale or no.Have Fun ^_^			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this. A kindred spirit to Wing Commander: Privateer; if you liked that, you'll love this. It was a bit short and a bit shallow, and I'm done with it for now, but I'll likely play it again in a year.Pros Confident aesthetics, ships you are excited to climb into, pretty space Decent ship loadout options to tune performance to your playstyle You can be effective in ships that are not ""top tier"" Randomized missions are fairly diverse Interesting (if somewhat predictable) campaign that resolved sensibly Pretty well-implemented progression keeps the game challenging for a while I don't care for the music, but it's very well done and a lot of folks will love it; it definitely fits the game's vibe Characters and side stories are interesting and well-written Fun - everything there is to do is fun to do Pirating is a thingI don't really have any cons.Mehs I'd have liked more diversity in combat strategy; a big selling point is broadside combat, but other approaches would be nice too More fine-tuning and harder choices for loadouts (like EVE's system) would have made it more interesting Could have been longer Mining and trading were pretty thin At some point you just outgear everything, no matter what you're flying; it ceases to be challenging Some escort missions are inordinately hard, mostly due to glitches Pirating could definitely have used more attentionAbsolutely worth it at full price. No-brainer if on sale.			"

												Bought this game during a down period in my Space Engineers saga (that game is currently being prepared for the planets release and is chock-full of truly annoying bugs) and didn't expect to enjoy it so much. It's no Hearts of Iron III in terms of complexity but, heck, sometimes you just want to watch pretty explosions and feel like a space cowboy, right ? On this front, Rebel Galaxy delivers in spades. It's got more personality than a Hell's Angels clubhouse and the looks of that blonde cheerleader you lusted after in high school. I've read somewhere that it was made by two guys. If that's true, that's pretty amazing. Massive overachievers, they. I bought it about 10 days after release and have yet to encounter any significant bug. Sure, I would have liked a bit more depth in the missions, perhaps some RPG elements, or a touch of strategy but it would be a national politician-level lie to say that I didn't get my twenty bucks' worth of entertainment out of it. Well done devs, you've made me happy.			"

												A space game with lots of great concepts, the only problem seems to be due to the fact that it was mostly done by 2 people. The only problem I've had with this game is that faction reputation scores don't seem to give the effect that I expected them to. For example if I got my reputation upto ""Friendly"" with the militia, I would expect them to be friendly with me when I hail them and so far I got the same response I used to get back when I was still in neutral. Other than that it is a great game, you can ally yourself with citizens and militia or be a pirate shooting up citizen and milita ships. Combat is well done and there's different types of ships and gear that you can fit it with. There's also an option to hire mercenary to fight along with you and there's a nice economy simulation under it all. And finally soundtrack really fits with the game, has space-western vibe to it. In conclusion, get this game you wouldn't regret it.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is rad. It will take up your time, not give it back and you will thank it for its trouble. This game works like this: grind to get money to buy better guns/ships, do a main quest mission, repeat until game is over. Normally I would say that this sucks but RG is different, the grinding is somehow satisfying. The explosions look cool, the sounds are great, the hectic nature of the battles is very well done, the aliens are jerks, it hits all the marks of a very fun sci fi game. The RPG elements are simple, but the battle manouvers will make you think.One complaint: The framerate was unusally slow for the quality of graphics, my Lenovo Y50-70 can max out Battlefront and BF4, but not this?? Not to say that its not a great looking game, but it seems like its less efficient with resources.Note: must be played with an Xbox 360 controller to be enjoyed.I finished the game with a Tyrex Stuville, a Murath ship i think, and Grud was my wingman. It was nifty.			"

												If you liked Darkstar One, you'll almost undoubtedly love Rebel Galaxy. It's not complicated, or too technical, or too vast. After a very minor learning curve as compared to many Space Sims, you'll be deep in the story before you know it. It's just fun. The combat keeps you just busy enough without overwhelming you. The game difficulty doesn't seem to be adjustable, but strangely enough it feels just right. It's not so difficult it's frustrating, nor so easy it's boring. It's just fun. I love Space Sims, but have only ever played a handful that I really, really liked, and this one is now on that list. Why? Because it's not crazy stupid ridiculous. It's just fun.			"

												It's easy to play, challenging to win and robust in its play styles; it is a VERY good space sim. The music is great, the graphics good and nice to look at, and its richness is not diluted by its simplicity. Everyone who likes space games finds things they do and don't like about titles. It's hard to do justice to the vastness of space and keep the game fun. Rebel Galaxy has done a great job. It reminds me of Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and Trigun. The ultimate space cowboy adventure. If only there were some way to add in some gun fights. =)			"

												Absolutely love this game! Haven't had an exploration fix like this since Freelancer.Very common sense controls (once you get used to them or remap them) and easy mapping of objestives make this game a pleasure to play right from the start.One hint, save often which is only possible when leaving space stations (which there are a lot of, most of which are very different with different economies). So far I have about 24hrs in and I've died like 10 times already but discovered something new in the game while doing so, which takes something out of the sting of death a little but not much.Going into combat is also very hectic, just like a real space battle would be. Would suggest hiring a Merc at some point for some of the tougher battles plus try hiring several first out and find the one ""type"" that fights most closely to your style of play. It helps to have somebody who watches your back and is willing to do so (for the money of course). "

												This is my first review in Steam :) I hope it would be helpful for you.I played for 45 hours and I definitely give thumbs up to this game. If you are a fan of Firefly, and if you like Star Trek - Star Wars style space combat, this game is for you. Although not being a masterpiece; the game has a nice atmosphere, wonderful music and sound effects, flashy explosions and lasers, detailed unique ship designs, in short: it has a %85 healthy body and mechanics.Pros & Cons:- The depth of space looks nice, however the colours are mostly vivid mostly and too luminous for space. Though it's less depressing :))- Warp and Jump concepts are very nice. - Thumbs up for weird aliens, their creative languages and weird ships (gets weirder further you play the main mission :) - The game lacks of citizens living wandering around when you visit a station. When you visit a bar, you can only have the bartender and your hired gun, which is so unrealistic. -Diplomacy needs to be worked on some more. And yes, I agree with the other guy: developers need to put a ""reputation"" system inside the game. When a guy destroys 100 capital ships and some 500 fighters, weaker enemies should run away from you on sight, or at least try ;) There is a ""Hail-dialogue"" system in game. Little bit impractical. You can choose to intimidate your enemy which I succeded several times. Still nobody says ""Oh noo! it's the guy who eats destroyers in breakfast! We frakking need to disappear right now!""- After 30 hours repeated side missions decrease the fun. Fortunately the main quest saves it from boredom.-  The turret manual targeting sucks, it's pretty hard to choose your target in real time combat. You can of course ""tab"" and lock your target but I don't like wasting my time when i have 20 meteorites to hit around me (yeah you can do mining and sell the ore you extract)- You have many options to outfit your ship with deflectors, shields, rockets, lasers and such and especially with useful components. The turret's locations are important, nevertheless you can't just drag and drop your weaponry on the ship as you like. You will need to know by trial and error which turret is which and install-uninstall the weapons until you find the right one (I have 8 turrets on my ship for instance).That's it for now :)			"

												Takes the fun/addictive elements of freeform space sims while avoiding the over-complexity of some of these titles (such as the X-series). As usual you start with an underequipped ship and earn money for better weapons/systems, new ships, and even mercenary support if you want it. You can earn money via missions (randomly generated and storyline), trading, mining, piracy or bounty hunting; it's up to you if you want to stay the right side of the law or if you aim to misbehave. It's worth noting that your starting ship is a corvette and the ship classes only get bigger from there on (right up to massive dreadnoughts). Because you're always commanding a large ship, combat is very different from a fighter-focused space sim and as others have pointed out it the 2D movement gives a 'naval battle in space' feel to it (though faster paced); it actually works pretty well, making the battles very fun to play - which is a good thing, because there is a lot of combat in this game.Visually this has a beautiful-looking universe, some spectular space battles and a wide variety of nice ship designs (from Serenity-style rustbuckets to more conventional-looking starships). I like the fact that the different ships cater to different playstyles -  bigger isn't necessarily better as there are other factors like speed, manouverabilty and weapon placement, so instead of a linear progression to the 'best' ship, people will find their own favorite ships along the way.There are some aspects of the game that could do with some improvement such as the scaling of encounters and missions - the actual difficulty of missions doesn't always seem to match the stated risk level. Also it's quite possible to get into fights where the only chance of survival is to run, especially at the beginning of the game; though this is not a bad thing in itself, the fact that the game pops up a combat tutorial note on your first fight (even if you're totally outmatched) could confuse new players into thinking they should always be able to win their first battle. I can see why the single checkpoint-type save is controversial, but personally I'm fine with a single save AS LONG AS there is some backup in case of corrupt saves - fortunately haven't had a corrupted save yet, but would be pretty peeved if this happened after hours of play.The hillbilly rock soundtrack does help create that 'wild frontier' Firefly vibe, but it also starts to get a bit old after about 10 hours - fortunately there is an option to stream your own music - this is a great feature that allows you to select different music sources for different situations (ambient, combat, idle, station etc).Overall this is probably the most enjoyable space game I've played since Freelancer.

												Only played this game for 2 hours at this point but I'm seriously impressed. In terms of space exploration and combat, Rebel Galaxy is simple. You have one horizontal plane. You steer left and right, go faster or slower. Where the game lacks in flight complexity, it makes up for in very fun broadside naval combat, an engaging story and the freedom to make bad decisions. You are free to roam wherever you want and do various things at your leisure. The conversations you have with potential friends and ememies effect the outcome of the interactions. The sound track is AMAZING. Most - if not all conversation so far - is voice acted. Such a fun game.			"

												You all need to disregardd the reviews stating this is just attrition based, and you dont need to maneuver.You also need to disregard the reviews  stating Broadsides don't matter because it's easy to maneuver.You notice both review types are actually opposed. Is it attrition click fest I have better shields and guns I win? or is it maneuver based? If you think it is one or the other, you're like those reviewers, and you've probably played the first hour or 2 at most.This game has tactical and strategic level element to the battles.  You have to know when it's time to dish it out and depend ony our shields, and when it's time to maneuver, when it's time to boost, how to approach a battle from what angle based on the craft they have and so on.Saying that - this is a great game, and thankfully it seems the people who are misinforming others count only for 9% of the reviewers...

My only possible complaint about this game; it can be challenging, but for those of us who eeked our way early through sheer aggressiveness to the Blackgate Dreadnaught with 20 MK6 Neutron Broadsides and just about as many MK6 Particle Lasers and 100,000,000 credits to our name. ;) No mission is ranged any higher than 'Low Risk'.... and I want more stuff to explode in glorious fireballs! So, the only negative thing I have to say... GIVE ME MOAR BOOM! :D			"

												Pretty close to being a really solid game. I'm going to recommend it over all, with the suggestion you pick it up on sale at some point. Pros: -the space combat is pretty fun-the soundtrack is great-fairly robust quest system-good options for making a lot of money regardless if you prefer mining, trading, or combatCons:-Main quest is super short, consisting of about 8 ""go here kill these guys"" missions.-Although there are tons of options for side quests, they get old pretty quickly.-40 hours of play time and everything is done, got a dreadnaught with maxed out gear, mostly special pirate/virilax loot gear, about 30 million creds in the bank on top of that, and just pretty much bored with it. I will miss the soundtrack, though.Just the game itself I'd give it 5/10, but if you can get it on sale for 5-15 bucks it's worth it if you're in to this sort of game.			"

												This game nails that slide-guitar Firefly vibe dead-on and I cannot fully articulate just how happy this makes me!  The ship-upgrading, trading and mission-running conventions are comforting and welcome, though the plane-locked flight model is not what I'd wish for -- I miss being able to fly freely in all directions AND I DEEPLY RESENT THE NPCS WHO CAN FLY ABOVE OR BELOW MY SHIP AT WILL -- but I'm getting used to it.  Same with the  mock-capital-ship ""broadsides"" pew-pew combat: not my preference, but it is at least unique and interesting to figure out.  What Rebel Galaxy lacks, though, it makes up with an overall style that goes surprisingly far to make this game a lot of fun.  The character design (THOSE ALIENS!) & engine graphics are beautiful and the music is SO damn good.  I do not regret getting this game in a $7 Humble Bundle after waiting to get it for a year and a half because I am cheap.  Cool game and I hope there's a sequel because there needs to be more space-cowboy games out there, full stop. "

												So I finally beat the main story and every single minute of it was fun. Early on when I started following this game they said it was a mix of Freelancer/Privateer + AC:Black Flag + Sid Meier's Pirates! + Star Control 2 and that is a very apt description.As a kid I really loved Freelancer. Exploring a large system on my own, outfitting and upgrading my ship, taking missions from various factions, etc. This scratches that itch like no other since Freelancer. While I hope Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen will be able to get there they seem far too focused on the multiplayer experience. If you loved Freelancer and enjoyed AC: Black Flag's combat this is the game for you.Pros: Fun CombatNice story that doesn't over stay it's welcomePlenty of shipsLot's of options for ship customizationCons:Pirate story not as deep as I'd hopedI wish there more varied random events in systems like wormholes "

												If you are looking for a single plane space sim the style of Freelancer, look no further. The initial hour I had into the game was enjoyable, which isn't something I usually say when having to go through learning controls on what feels like a console port to PC.However, the graphics are SOLID, the voice acting and ambiance is SOLID.  I'll update more when I've gone through the game more.			"

												Decent game, Looks great, plays great and is overall fun.  You will say two things while playing this game. #1  Great i just got dropped out of warp again within five feet from the last group of enemies that just dropped me out of warp,#2  I don't understand why the game even bothers to give you options to buy better shields and weps. Enemies get through your shield in seconds and your weps never get through the enemies shields fast enough.  It's annoying to have to constantly having to fix your hull and buy ammo.Like I said, good game overall for a sp game.  It's a shame the developer added more mobs that jump you every five feet instead of a story that works or better combat mechanics.Plus there is little to no replay value for this game, replaying this game gives you nothing new and the story is a one way trip.I would wait until this game is on the 5$ discount rack.   It's not worth the price they are asking.			"

TL;DR: A solid, arcade space privateer game that'll scratch the itch of many a space cowboy out there, complete with excellent music to fit the theme. Fans of space games (or Firefly) may find a charmer right here for a price that wont break your wallet too hard.+ Solid gameplay mechanics and progression that'll keep you busy for hours, having fun being your own space captain. Solid combat (deflector shield = timed block, broadside ship combat), calming (if flashy) mining, and cutthroat trading are all here. Be a Han Solo, or a Boba Fett, or more.+ Quirky singleplayer storyline, but as with an open-space game like this, you can easily ignore it and go your own way. Think Skyrim + Space Cowboy and you're not far off.+ Colorful and unique art direction for environments, ships, and characters that you meet. Ships and weapons have clear design lines they follow. Enemies are color-coded for easy identification. Space is colorful and interesting to look at. Damage on ships is well-rendered, complete with breaches in the hull, burning, and metal skeletal remains in impact holes. Weapons are visually impactful, and can be clearly discerned in the heat of combat.+ Characters you meet have a lot to say, voice-acted too, complete wtih unique alien languages to boot!+ Excellent ""cowboy"" music that sets the mood perfectly, firing at the perfect time. Crescendos with the right track for high-intensity combat. Drops it down to a mellow tule when in station. A forlorn tune for when travelling. Its perfect, and when you dont like it, there's support for inserting your own!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Camera is too zoomed in. Its difficult to keep situational awareness when the camera zooms so far in you cant see your entire ship anymore, let alone whats immediately around it.- Game's graphical fidelity with texture quality is a bit lackluster in places. Character fidelity is serviceable, whilst lip syncing is a bit off.- Space travel and combat is exclusively 2D in nature.- Minor problems here and there (the odd V/O line thats not volume-balanced, odd UI design choices, etc) detract from the game little by little. Take for example the UI display for shields and hull plating. They fade as they take more damage, when it would make more sense for them to work like bars taht decrease in size the more damaged they are to make the information more clear to the player. The default E key is used for far too many things. Default bindings may be a bit off-putting for some folk, like mistaking Secondary Fire (Shift) for Deflectors (Space) in the heat of battle. Very distinct (if not difficulty-spiking) power gaps between upgrades on equipment and ships and enemies in general. Things of that nature.- Default music may not be to the taste of some.- No multiplayer support.			"

												I'd call this a light recommendation. There's a great deal of repetitive game play, but I found that for the price it met exactly what I wanted: a space game with some space fights that made me feel like a space ace. The story-line is intriguing, but there are some stoppages as you have to upgrade your ship as you progress or it will not be powerful enough for the missions. Despite the somewhat repetitive nature, there was a certain appeal to finally getting that new ship and whipping the♥♥♥♥♥of those pirates that took you into hull so many times. Treat this game like it's Gran Turismo, Space Edition, and you'll probably solidly like it as I did. Game is 8/10. EDITED because I forgot to mention, the MUSIC is AWESOME. Totally makes you feel like you're in Firefly. There's only a few different songs, but they are masterfully done and very immersive. Music is 10/10.			"

												I have loved the space game genre since I was 8 years old. The fact that I am recommending this means that out of the 95% of released space sim titles I have played to death, Rebel Galaxy manages to stand out a cut above many of them. I am not even a quarterway finished with the main storyline, yet 10 hours in, the amount of content is quite impressive, and makes gameplay enjoyable to say the least. First and foremost, this is a third person spaceship simulator. There is no empire building or 4X gameplay involved. You primarily fight, trade and explore in Rebel Galaxy, and start off doing the main campaign which you can deviate from at anytime. Of course the campaign has you flying around a little bit to do other things, but fighting is usually involved. Wonderful thing here is though, interactions with NPCs in the campaign and in general allow for non-violent alternatives to do a mission, or, for instance, to handle a pirating attempt or an illegal cargo inspection by system militia. There are about a dozen solar systems in Rebel Galaxy, so you are given some wiggle room to move around. Content such as missions, NPC spawns, and solar system events are randomly generated. There is enough variety to keep things from going stale, and as you get farther away from your starting solar system, more content (ships, equipment, guild allegiances) is available to you.Combat is a bit different in Rebel Galaxy. And your ship's motion is limited to 2D movement only (while fightercraft and the environment objects can have 3D motions and positions). I will seperate this into two parts. Offensive capabilities and Defensive capabilities.Offensive capabilitiesIncludes 1) A primary weapon 2) A secondary weapon 3) Turret systems 4) Mercenaries 5) Deflectors. Primary weapons can be either pulse laser types or beam laser types. You fire broadsides (i.e from the side) at the enemies on either side. Very powerful, and include a small charging time for an auto-aim accuracy bonus. Secondary weapons are either mines or missiles (point & shoot or seeking). Good damage. Turret systems can be either pulse or laser types. You can take control of your turret groups (1 at a time only) and fire at enemies in a 360 degree arc. Critical against fightercraft and provide good sustaining damage against larger craft. Mercenaries are fightercraft/gunships that follow you around for a 1 time fee. They are very durable, are good fodder, and you can only have 1 with you at any time. Deflectors are a sort of temporary shield you can activate which absorb damage. You can also ram enemy ships with them to inflict damage.Defensive capabilities Include 1) Deflectors 2) Shields 3) Armor 4) Hull 5) Engine boosters As mentioned, Deflectors are temporary shields that asborb damage until you run out of charge, in which case you must wait for them to have charge in order to use them. Shields are divided into 4 sections that protect your ship (front, port, starboard, aft) from all damage and collisions. Armor protects your ship's hull. Damage to armor can damage to ship systems. Hull is your powercore. If it goes to 0, you die. Engine boosters can be used to maneuver weapons fire, outrun missiles, outrun foes, and kite enemies.Combat aside, the graphics are very nice and well optimized. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful, it reminds me of Firefly.As with any game, there is a bit of a grind involved to gain credits in order to unlock higher tiered ships and equipment. Best way to go about this is doing a bunch of high paying missions (mission payouts generally increase as your overall strength increases) alongside a storyline mission once in a while. Or however you want. Imo the grind doesn't feel like a grind sometimes. It's pretty fun to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. All in all, I dig it. Combat is different, not shallow. Plenty of content. Good soundtrack. Solid mechanics.  Decent plot. Way to go Double Damage Games. I hope you keep making titles in this genre!			"

												For people too wimpy for Elite Dangerous, and too suspicious of Chris RobertsGreat rock/punk-blues soundtrack that suits the ""wahoo space cowboy firin' mah layzers"" style.Two caveats.There's no up or down (which will be weird at first to anyone who's ever flown anything in any game), you navigate your ship across a flat plane. You can aim your guns up and down, but your ship will only steer left and right; you're flying what amount to capital ships in this game, so its not completely ridiculous logic I suppose, if nothing else it makes aiming your main broadside cannons easier. You can give the AI control over all the rest of your armaments, or you can swap to them manually at any point.  I prefer to let the AI eat away at the small fighters and crap while I focus my roflstomper on the big armored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with giant guns. Because it needs roflstomped. Repeatedly.Second, random asteroids and space debris knock you out of warp.  That's really annyoing because then you have to realign for warp which means moving around the random object you got hung on which is time consuming and it happens frequently; it should be more like Eve, where you do have to align and accelerate into warp speed proper but once your ship begins warp, it passes through solid objects from asteroids to planets. Its a small thing but it gets old really, really fast. There are upgrades for the warp drive but they increase warpspeed rather than improve your align time or reduce the amount of time needed to align; I would much have preferred the latter and just have maximum warp speed determined by ship class, again like in Eve.I beat the story, unlocked all the achievements (legitimately) and still find myself doing stuff in it for short stretches of time, I really enjoyed it.Probably not what you're looking for if you're a fan of either of the games referenced in the beginning though, at the very least if you come into this game looking for one of those games you'll be disappointed; I didn't know what to expect, and I like it!

												WowThis game has blown me away. Everything from the theme down to the actual gameplay. I love the music and the look and feel of the game. Really captures that same theme that things like Firefly managed to capture.My main concern when going into this game was knowing that it didnt have full free range 3d movement. You are basically a boat, on a 2d ocean that spans in all directions. (ie: you cant go up or down like in most space sims). Shortly after playing though I realized something. You arent a space pilot in some action game. You are more like a bridge commander. Piloting and combat are more akin to something from the startrek films than being seating in the pilot seat of an X-wing.  Does this work? Yes, it does. Quite well in fact. I quickly stopped caring that I didnt have full 3d range of movement, and found myself just enjoying the ""flow"" of the game. The music is great btw, really helps bring the game to life.Combat is quick, and very ""Edge of your seat"" once you get past the first couple of tutorial battles. Sometimes you have to run. The game doesnt scale stuff to your level, and you often find yourself in over your head. Escape is a viable tactic and meant to be part of the gameplay. Dont worry though, you wont find yourself running often unless you go charging head first into some space pirate zone.The game actually has a LOT more depth to it than I expected it to. The further I played, the more features I discovered. Its so much more than just a funky space combat simulation game. I personally cant wait to play more, and really start diving in to what the game has to offer. Its got me hooked.My only real gripe is how there isnt an option to pull the camera back some during broadside combat. I feel a bit ""boxed in"", which really hinders my combat awareness of things around me. You can find youself crashing head first into things during broadside combat because your field of view is so limited due to how close you are zoomed in to your ship. They really need to add an option to configure the distance you want the camera to be at, or add a toggle that works similar to the camera view distance in a car racing game.The other nice feature that easily goes over looked, is how well this game performs. No performance issues, no GPU or CPU load issues. Overall its a well optomized game. (it could use a few higher quality textures here and there though)So... overall...Do you like space games?Do you like star trek style combat between big ships?Do you enjoy the backwater, wasteland themed style of Firefly?If so, I highly recommend this game.

Universe feels empty, no particular system is any different than any other. Market system is arbitrarily complex given the total simplicity of the rest of the game, but no effort is made to make the player care about it.			"

												I'm a fan of Space sims, Sid Meier's Pirates!, and Star Trek Online (mainly because of the Space combat and every ten levels unlocked a new ship) I had to get this game, and it's amazing.Pros-Missions are reasonable lengths-captial ship combat is fun -you can customize your weapon sets-Ramming specific deflector shieldsCons-story is very cliche for these type of games (a relative leaves you something and you have to find them and build up, blah)-might feel repetitive (I'm only in my second sector but, mine, defend, escort, kill, trade and treasure hunt cliche for space games)			"

												Best bang for your buck!  Rebel Galaxy is a game set in space were you fight intense enemies while controlling and maintaining your ship,shields,armor, and weapons. It starts out very simple and even helpes you along in understanding everything while also getting you right into the combat and interesting story line. No spoilers from me :o! But with it being under 20$!? And a game that can have you playing for many hours at a time while enjoying every minute of it. I'm telling you now. If you enjoy space, battles of many different types of enemies, and the every so often rescue of someone in trouble or even killing both of them and taking the loot then you must try this game. Best way i say the game is like is an EVE that wont make you pay monthly to play and one where you still have a life since you dont have to spend days or even months to get the ship you want. Its easy to build up your ship or upgrade it.			"

												I love the soundtrack. The combat is good, though it's easy to lose track of what you're shooting at in the larger battles (there's a lock-on option, but too many buttons to press to get there so I never bothered).The trading part is tricky when the date is not displayed and you have to sort of guess the selling price of an item to sell it anywhere since the market price is ever changing and you have no way of knowing what sells how much, and where to sell.Main storyline is simple, good, but simple. And short.Paid full price. Would pay full price again if they ever did another one. Heard that only 2 people made this game. Would like to tell them they did a good job. Hope the next one they make (if they decide to make it) will be even better.			"

												It was pretty fun, the naval combat/broadsides mechanism was cool, and it's a solid 35 hours of gameplay, but it doesn't have tons of replay value and once you've hit endgame content, it stops being particularly difficult. You basically only die at that point if you get completely surrounded, your engines get disabled, and you're outnumbered 25 to 1. Which does happen, but not often. One on one, you'll wreck absolutely every ship in the game without really trying once you're running Mk6 everything.There's still a handful of annoying bugs, but the developer's fixing them very quickly and they're being super-responsive to bug reports.

												tl;dr: If you loved Freelancer, Starpoint Gemini 2, or any of the 2D/top-down ""open world"" space combat/mining/trading games, buy this immediately.I never write reviews, but man, this game. This game hits way out of its weight class. Watch the trailers, listen to the music - the whole soundtrack is that awesome, and they match tracks to gameplay so darn well. The characters, the music, the ships - the whole vibe fits right alongside Firefly or Cowboy Bebop.But how about gameplay?This game is darn near everything that I loved about Freelancer - open choices about alignment, how you wish to accumulate wealth (with net worth being the best equivalent to RPG ""level""), and so many over-the-top, very expensive upgrades available beyond what's needed to ""finish"" the game that's any space grinder's paradise.It only deviates from that mold on three critical points, by order of significance:1) Combat is dramatically different.  This is not, and does not pretend to be, a dogfighting/piloting simulation. There is nothing that approaches ""real"" inertia. You have two axes of freedom (yaw and velocity front-to-back), not six. In that respect, think of it like SPAZ or other 2D space games, but with phenomenal graphics. This game is 2.5D, not 3D.But it works. Combat is less adrenaline-fueled flips and rolls, and more stately dance of large ships, where positioning far outstrips reflexes - half way between something twitchy like Elite: Dangerous and point-and-click orders of EVE Online. Everything you fly is a ""capital ship"" and mostly behaves like one. (That's not to say there aren't plenty of size class upgrades - you could double-park your starting ship in the exhaust ports of some of the larger ones.) This plays more like AC: Black Flag's naval battles, in that your biggest (and manually controlled) weapons are mounted broadside, so this is big ships barrelling up side-by-side to blast the hell out of each other.  In an interesting conceit, fighters are given 3D flight capabilities and can fly over and under you, while capital ships (you and AI) are stuck on a 2D field - 3D flight is there, just for the annoying gnats that you don't fly.So combat can take a while, and it'll feel dull to the adrenaline junkies, but it's just the right mellow level of exciting for the person who finds RPG combat exciting and laments their survival skills in FPS deathmatches against all the coked-up squirrels who make your reflexes look like dial-up latency. (So... me.)2) The world is just plain smaller. Systems are bigger, but there's only about a dozen of them. There aren't a whole lot of factions or terribly interesting power dynamics between factions. But you know what? This wasn't a $50 or $60 game. I felt like there was a totally reasonable, if not Freelancer-scale, level of world available to be for the price tag. Should they ever decide to DLC in more content, I'll be first in line: it would be a better game for it, and completely reasonable to come with an additional price tag, given what the base game sells for.3) No multiplayer (or the accompanying dedicated server). This one's a bummer, as the only thing I like more than this genre is this genre with friends, but that's a big jump in development complexity for a budget title. So it doesn't feel like a glaring omission or a developer shortcoming (and indeed, leaving it out of scope is better than a broken implementation), but I would love to see a Rebel Galaxy 2 with full multiplayer support Freelancer style.Otherwise, this thing is dreamy. Every time I find an annoyance in this game, it's because the level of graphical polish, voice acting, and audio design fool me into thinking I'm playing a big-budget AAA title. Then I remember the price tag, and I'm again floored how hard this game hits for its budget.			"

												this game is decent.  it has pretty good rpg elements with all the ship upgrades.  the combat is a little odd with the broadside weapons, but you get used to it.  the diffculty progression is pretty good as well.  if areas are too hard, upgrading your ship can help you to get through them.  actually, achieving the ships and upgrades were the funnest part of the game for me.   the story line is a little short.  i completed it in about 34 hours.  i could have done that quicker, but i opted to get the biggest ship before completing the final mission.  you can keep playing after you complete the story line, but there really isnt more to acheive or more content to experience.  get it while its on sale. its deffinately worth $10.

												It's like Firefly meets Freelancer. Yes, you cannot move on the vertical axis, but that helps focus the action around your big, lumbering ship. Fights are beautiful and chaotic, punctuated by alerts from your ships friendly AI voice. The missions can be a little repetitive, but it seems like there are lots of different ships to buy, oodles of parts to upgrade, and many different factions to assist or annoy. Overall, a polished and enjoyable game that can make you feel like Admirals Adama or Ackbar.			"

You can always find something to do.The options for this game are great. If you dont like the music, you can just change it. If you want to use a controller, there is PS4/XBOX button prompts you can pick from. I left most of the music untouched, but I changed the combat music to something a little more hard core. This game is worth the fourty hours I put into it and absolutely worth your $20.			"

												It's still on sale for another 30 hours = get it if you need/want a fun game, basically. Well worth the $9.99, entertainment wise. This does not have an indie vibe or feel to me at all. It's very polished looking. The only reason I know it's an ""Indie"" title is because of the other reviews. It's a solid production. Pretty fun so far = If you go into it realizing that for $9.99 you could get a six pack or good beer or a movie ticket for a 2 hours show, the value is apparent. I'm happy with the purchase and I've just scratched the surface. It's not the be-all-end-all, but if you need a new game to jam on till No Man's Skizzle comes out, you're winning if you pick this up for $9.99 = thumbs up			"

												-->Hey there, honest and trusting trader ! Would you like to get your hand on some diamonds? Preety rare stuff...<--Of course, well armed and eyepatch-wearing traveler! Let me get the credits from my secret compartment!-->These are premium diamonds...I expect a fair price, dear lonely and without escort trader...<--Here you go, fair and mighty defender of citizens!-->Wow, that's a really good price. Thanks! Now... please stop your engines and drop your cargo!<--With plea...what?!-->You heard me the first time.<--...I surrender, please don't fire.-->Schmuck. Begone now.Now to the point. At a  pretty low price you will  recive a pretty long free roam game. The combat is 2D with the exception of fighters. It's a mix between space and naval combat (spaceSHIPS, ya know). Incredible beatufil graphics, low system requirements(my gpu burned out so I'm playing this on a GT630 on max settings without AA), very few minor bugs that are crushed by the devs with ultra light speed (I had an issue with my ship, I posted the bug, the dev req. the save, I provided, in 30 min the dev sent a modified save my way and posted that the fix will be in the next patch).If you enjoyed : Starpoint Gemini 2, Space rangers 2, X3, X2, Freelancer, Homeworld, Sins of a solar empire, etc.... aka good quality, gorgeous space games, this is a game that can stand beside them in feeling and level of detail. Also it's f___ing AMAZING that the main team is made out of 2 TWO developers. Incredible. This game is almost AAA quality. First time I see such a great game launched by an indie team.The game is on a niche of it's own. Not many like this, although a little similarity with Starpoint Gemini 2.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS AT FULL PRICE.			"

												So yeah, Not sure what to say here. The game ended so suddenly I wasn't sure how to feel about it. Its fun enough, but very repetitive. I felt like I was mising a large chunk of the game by the end of it. Like there was so much more I could have done. I visited maybe 3-4 of the systems long term, and the rest were either pass through or never even visited. None of it felt needed, or for that matter wanted. The ship progression as well was very pointless by the end. Once you have type 6 armor, shields and deflectors you can use any ship and have pretty much no issue. Take a light Frigate up against an ace super battleship? No problem, they will never get through your shields.I stopped caring about a better ship once I got the McKenley. It pretty much shreaded everything with type 6 neutron beams and mining lasers, but dear god was it slow.All in all - Meh. Its fun, I need a meh button to rate this game with, but for now I will just thumbs up it as it was good enough I felt I got my monies worth.			"

												Very good game in a genre that has some terrible games. If you like an open world , spaceships with some good variety, good combat and not overwhelming to learn and get comfoirtable with then this is your game. Some space games are just very complicated or difficult I liked the fact that the combat was sort of like being in a boat with broadside combat. You dont have to worry about adjusting your height and just worry about direction and distance. You can also do the trading and mining thing to gain power but that gameplay is not for me. Mining is dull in my opinion.It's light on story and background info but that is fine with me. The graphics are good, sound effects good, music excellent, voice acting good but limited. Solid game all around, worth the price. no brainer if on sale. Pick it up.			"

												The game is not very good. There is a lot of interesting stuff happening from the open world missions to some of the RPG dialogue, but the dialog is about the only thing rpg like.  I might keep playing to try the bigger ships, but combat really isn't fun, you sit in your big ship and chase around smaller fighters with your turrets while waiting for an opportunity to broadside the bigger ships.  There will be damage reported to your ship but hard to tell what it actually means, until you blow up.  Flying makes getting between missions a bit of a bore.			"

												I freakinglooooooooovethis game's music.It feels so badass. I can't get bored of it :D----------------------The first assasin's creed I played was Black Flag. I loved that game and played it for hours and hours.It convinced me to get the rest of the series, so I bought one and two. I was about to buy AC3, but then I thought ""pace yourself, dude""Then I was muddling through civilians, looking for a yellow dude.Then I was slowly walking through a city.Then I was riding a horse.Then muddling through crowds again.And then it hit me. It was the ship that was the fun part.This game takes quite a few pointers from that game, but retains enough of its own to feel relatable, but different.Missions are a bit repetitive if all you're doing are bounties, but it changes up when you enter a new system.Now. Two things I really liked about this game were:1- It's not another freaking roguelike, and no permadeath if you didn't save. You'll lose all progress from when you last docked, tho, so keep that in mind. If you can dock, dock.2- Your equipment costs as much when you sell it as when you buy it, so you can swap equipment and experiment without having to fear losing money. Which means that finding a weapon in a crate is always great, no matter if it's usable or not.Anyway. I tend to like more the in-cockpit space shooters, but those have the really annoying tendency to make enemies turn circles with you.Oh yeah. Did I mention that your turrets fire automatically, but can be aimed manually? that's good stuff.Oh man. This music.			"

												It's what the first Starpoint Gemini would have been if it wasn't developed by slav♥♥♥♥♥, but with a spaghetti-western twang to it.This is NOTHING AT ALL LIKE FREELANCER.This game is NOTHING AT ALL LIKE ANYTHING IN ASASSIN\'S CREED.This game is NOTHING LIKE COWBOY BEBOP OR FIREFLY... it just has a couple tracks featuring a guitar --- ooooooooooh that's firefly! ooooooooooooh ride my hype-stick ooooooooooooh space cowboys - no... just no... it's Starpoint Gemini with a country track in the mix.Do not ride people's hype trains, because actual flavors of what people hype up like that simply don't exist.Which all-in-all is very very sad because this game has a lot of good things going for it that stand out on it's own without being lumped into incredibly vauge and generalized references... just don't expect as much as people are claiming is there, because again, it simply isn't. GAMEPLAY:Quick. Don't expect tonnes of hours unless you force yourself to drag the game out.Fun. Really fun - I couldn't put it down for the first few days (then I beat the story and stopped caring because I had the best ship and gear, period)Equally proffitable to trade or fight your way up (I got lucky abnd kept finding clouds of things called ""face of gozu"" so my fight-intended gameplay did turn to occasional crude mining to leap forward in the game FAST)All of the exact flippin' same mechanics from Starpoint Gemini, meaning the whole game takes place on a two-dimensional plane... in space...CONS:Well I honestly hate how much like the first Starpoint Gemini it is. It's often distracting, and I had PTSD-like flashbacks of the most horrible russian voice acting you could possibly imagine...The story is... terribad. I didn't care... I just COULD NOT care about anything that was happening and everyone and their dog all looked like either targets or speed-bumps in my pursuit to become the biggest, baddest mo-fo in space.Only need one possible conversation choice ever: ""Get behind me, meat-pop, and watch how it's done.""I didn't even get interested until, I kid you not, the very very end where the AI you are hauling around starts to actually BE a flippin CHARACTER present in the nearly non-existant plot line. Not enough ships.After the storyine ends, if you have the biggest and best like I did by that time, the game becomes quite literally - pointless. When you DO reach that point, you are so OP, no fleet generated to fight you can take you down unless you get jumped while taking an afk dump.Comparing this to Freelancer is a huge insult to Freelancer and Chris Roberts - whoever does that owes Mr. Roberts an apology. Freelancer is a benchmark standard in space-traders/space-sandboxes... and this DOES NOT meet par with Freelancer on any grounds of reasoning.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY: Because when you get rid of the slimy hype that would otherwise leave you dissappointed in not getting what was so highly promised in praise - it's a kick♥♥♥♥♥space trader that lets you roam around in a rather large sandbox and blow the crap out of nearly everything in sight.It's very simplistic and very easy to learn and master, and is also controller compatable - though KBM is best for this game.Overall I give it 7/10 - best to wait and get it when it's on sale. Cheap.			"

												It has a firefly theme to it (the music especially). Which is awesome.Game plays on a 2D plane. You basically fly around doing missions (basically kill missions, or fly into a bunch of guys and take something and leave while they try to kill you missions). As you fly around you get blockaded by enemies who you have to fly through/around to get back to warp. As you fly around you also run into distress beacons you can go to and either fall into a trap or come to someone's aid while they are getting killed.Basically killing is the only real solution to anything in this game. I think that's it's major weakness.The commodities market is pretty lame. You can only put a few things in your holds and most stores never sell enough of anything to fill your holds to do proper buy/sell trading. And even if they did, it's almost never going to be all of the good stuff with a good price. Otherwise this system could be pretty fun if it was balanced and actually changed with supply/demand. All in all it's fun for a while. Then it gets grindy. Then it gets really grindy. Then you use cheats and give yourself all the money you want. Then you go out and realize there's nothing else to the game and you quit. If you can get this for $5, I'd buy it for some over simplified naval combat in space with the firefly theme to it. But while this game engine is good enough for some pretty awesome gameplay....sadly, it is pretty void of good content.Almost great. "

												THE GOOD:This is a game that is visually beautiful, with great graphics and sound.  For instance, the details on damage your hull takes is, for lack of a better word, gorgeous.  High production values all around.THE BAD:Wow, I just can't get into the gameplay at ALL.  Take all the parts that aren't fun about World of Warcraft, and combine them with all the parts that aren't fun about X3: Reunion.  -Shallow RPG elements.  Shallow dialogue choices.  Shallow, linear plotline buried in a sandbox game.-An ""open world sandbox"" that is mostly empty, and is in TWO dimensions.  (This is a space game.)  -Grinding the same bounty quests over and over for money for upgrades.   -Combat is similar to space battles in Star Trek Online, but shallower, with less strategy and fewer options.  I kept wishing for the officer abilities of STO to give it some variance.-3/4th of the enemy you face are starfighters, which you have to bat away with your turrets. Fighters move in three dimensions; you do not.  To help you hit them, your reticule locks onto them and follows them around.  So you're pretty much just flying in a circle and holding down the fire button.  Against 3/4 of the enemies you face.-Oh, and by the way, you know that cool ""Evil Ways"" song in the preview movie on the store page?  Well, you'll think it's alot less cool when you start playing because that song (in rotation with perhaps two others) is your constant companion as you amble around the universe looking for mobs to grind. THE VERDICT:Dull.  There isn't much more to this game than the combat, and I can tell the combat is supposed to feel a lot more exciting than it does.  When you streamline something to a certain degree, it moves past ""stream-lined"" and ventures into the dangerous realm of ""dumbed-down.""  The combat feels dumbed-down, the trading feels dumbed-down, and the RPG elements feel dumbed-down. After playing for about an hour and a half, all I want to do is reinstall X3 so I can play a game that does all of these elements correctly.  Glad I got this at a discount, but I still wish I could take this purchase back.			"

												Good game for the money with some major drawbacks.Pros:- Great atmosphere- Enjoyable Costumization- Enjoyable Fights but (see cons)- Good difficulty balance- Nice random events but (see cons)- Great soundtrack- Beautiful universe and ship design Cons:-Fights get stale fast and are in terms of tactical depthness pretty bleak after a short while. Enemys get spawned in around you which is a huge letdown. The fighst needed features like e.x. Take cover behind asteroids to avoid incoming fire from enemy, Take cover behind enemy ships to avoid fire. Maybe features like cloaking (you can detect every ship with a simples can, th game needs a system like world of warships), sideway boosts or big space battles with way more ships but a tactical feature to command and order friendly ships to win battles. (stop the game like the scannermode give us a overview and command features)- Market system is to simple after a while and it should add new goods if you get to new systems or have individual goods that you can sell in different systems and more economical possibilitys.- Random events like distress calls or bountys are great but two features get boring pretty fast- Events on planets have a good impact on the econemy features but some events don't effect the prices as much as they should in my opinion. - Rewards for e.x. destroying big battleships or pirate kings are inconsistent and don't scale properly- And last but not least my most important complain:The missions are too similar and there are only a handful of Story missions. The pretext of the Mainstory is good but it feels like the WHOLE CAMPAIGN should be only the FIRST CHAPTER of the whole story unfolding. Everything feels impersonal. You are traveling space for years and you have interaction with 4 notacible Characters in the whole game if you count all mercenarys as one character of interest.I'm aware that this is a fairly small project from a very small developer team but the wasted potential on this game is making my head spin. So for now, as regrettable as it is, I can't wholeheartly recommend for you to buy this game.			"

												This is yet another game where I wish I could give a middle rank, neither a yes or a no, but a ""meh"" rating too, however since the game is cheap, and has very good production values, and is fun for a little while, Ill give it the up vote.Anyway, you can watch some videos to see what kind of game this is about, however, Ill just get into some of my gripes with the game design.Some minor issues that annoy me:1.  Missions are over scripted and in a way are not realistic.  For example, every time you have do a trade-guild mission to ship some specific cagro from point A to B, you will ALWAYS be intercepted.  There is ALWAYs trouble.   Now if this were the only problem, I could overlook this.  The actual problem is that the REAL trade mission is to actually destroy the guys who intercept you.  Case and point, I took a very lucrative delivery mission that took place in  the same system.  It was rated as HIGH risk.   I figued I could run away.  My mission is to deliver something, not kill things?  RIght?  Oh no, quite wrong.   So I am getting close to the station I need to make my delivery to, and as usual, the trap is sprung and a bunch of ships appear from all directions and they pull you out of ""warp"".    So what do I do? I escape, I use my after burners and get enough distance and jump back into warp.  I make it like 5 clicks and the same trap happens again.  I do this 2 more times and each time the trap is reset and sprung again which is just terrible game design.  The only solution is to kill the ambush.  All mission types that are not supposed to be directly about combat workout the same way.2.  You can have missles as weapons, the problem with them is that you do not have a lot of ammo, which makes sense.  However, if you are an NPC, then you have infinite ammo.  I once had a ship that shot waves of missiles the killed my engines.  The didn't do any damage to my ship or shields, but I couldn't move.  It just sat there for like 10 minutes keeping me pinned.  I had to Alt-F4 to recover because if you exit normally, it would save your game and I would have been stuck forever.3.  No quick save.Ok, enough of the small sutff.  Why did I stop playing this game without finishing the main story?  What is the big thing that is wrong with the game design?Basically it is repetivie and boring.  Combat is boring.  Flying around in space warping everwhere is boring.  Each star system is randomly generated, but they are all very generic and you can't really tell the difference other than this sone might have a yellow sun and the other one has a blue sun.   There is nothing to explore or find.  Its all the same, everywhere.Now maybe if you LOVE space games you may get a lot more milage out of it then I did, but after about 20 hours the game felt more like work then fun.			"

												This story is not 30-40 hours to complete -.- takes maybe a max of ten.   I would love to see more difficult missions, currently the ship I am in has no threat to it which would be nice to see if you ever get around to introducing more content.  Overall the game is very pretty but the story is very dry in terms of content.   The ending just feels like a scavanger hunt and the final battle can be won without having to fire a shot of your own.   Overall I love the game but would greatly appreciate some more endgame things to go explore or fights similar in strength to the end boss.  I am recomending it because I love the game to death.			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

Posted: December 20, 2015
												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

The soundtrack is catchy and sounds great. The game can get repetitve but the core conecepts are fun enough to have anyone coming back for more. As an added note since I've seen some reviewers upset by the concept of the game: the game takes place in 3D space but you are fixed to a 2D plane, while this may sound lame for a space shooter it still feels like a lot of fun in its execution.

The voice acting, graphics and game play are all great and help deliver a fun and entertaining game play experience. It's linear and has no up or down movement, but it works and in a time when the industry is all about freedom of movement in games it is not needed in this game and is not missed. You can tell the game has heavily drawn from TV show Firefly. Shiny!			"

												I bought this on a whim yesterday after seeing it available, probably one of the better purchases I've made recently. The gameplay is simple but feels rewarding and the challenges scale well when upgrading and buying new ships and equipment. Story seems to be balanced so far and between side missions, bounties and the occasional mining mission Rebel Galaxy ticks all the right boxes for a fun, 'don't take me serious' space-ship shooter.I would reccomend this to those who like their sci-fi, space shooters and ELITE/EVE: Online (esque) mechanics, albeit in a simplified form.

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a light hearted space sim, borrowing ideas from games such as Sid Mier's Pirates! and others. Graphically styled like Galaxy on Fire and Torchlight, it's a pretty game that runs smoothly other than when using the warp gate (no big issue really, they're used infrequently). Controls work nicely with both mouse/KB or controller. The game offers plenty of ship customisation, do you want to be a ship of the line with massive broadsides? Or perhaps a gunboat bristling with turrets? Maybe you want to long-haul goods across the system? Heaps of options for you to try out.My only real negatives so far;1) Not enough music, the music in the game is AMAZING, but the sound track needs to be a little longer I think2) Stop dropping me out of super-cruise etc when near asteroids etc, if I can visually plot a safe way through a field, then let me. :DSeriously though, this game is amazing value for $18, if you like space sim-lite, this is your game, or just want to blow up ships across the galaxy, look no futher.9/10, definately recomend.

												Definitely fun, I won't lie. It has interesting mechanics until you get to know them, at which time, it can make even the more difficult battles a bit trivial. I also think the mid-game suffers a bit. Running around just to get money in order to rank up weapons, defenses and components was perhaps the most boring part of the game. I did like the story, though and it was fun finishing things up. It's a great game for flying around and shooting down space pirates... or being a space pirate yourself.  :)			"

												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

												After playing several hours of this game I can say without a doubt, Rebel Galaxy is AMAZING. *It's the perfect blend of action packed navel combat with dynamic trade economy. If you thought X was an interesting concept, but though that the gameplay felt like doing spread sheets in a 3D shooting gallery, then look no further, Rebel Galaxy is your game. *The combat is fun and easy to pick up, with its Black Flag style broadside combat, but has alot of depth and strategy aswell. I found that a fast frigate could out do a powerful, lumbering dreadknoght with speed and manuverability, or that using your ship's suppior broadside's range could keep you out of harms way. *The economy is dynamic and interesting but not overly complicated ""cough cough X!"" and scoping out trade roughts in the games massive, proceduraly generated universe was alot of fun.*The style was another big draw with it's awesome southern rock/blues/country soundtrack and it's wild west, bad-side of town vibe. Not to mention, the ship models are fantastic!*The game also has alot of choice for missions and encounters. Do you help the pirates take down the merchant for a haul of loot, or do you take a stand and protect the merchant to increase your reputation with the citizens?*And finnaly, the devs are great. They're helpful and dedicated and constantly patching the game and listening to the communityIn the end, Rebel Galaxy is a terrific, deep space, swashbuckling adventure sure to keep you flyin' for along time.

												Rebel Galaxy looks like an odd game to start with. How many games are there that have you flying around space, buying, selling, mining or stealing? I have played quite a few over the years. Most of them have you moving around in 3 dimensions; after all, space is not flat plane is it? So, why does Rebel Galaxy use two dimensions for you as the player but 3 for many of your opponents? Surely this is silly?Surprisingly I have to say no, it actually works really well. I am around 4 hours into the game now and I must say that I like the battle mechanics and the flight from one part of the system to another is pretty smooth. (Could be a bit quicker possibly but that is just me.So, what is it that I enjoy? Raking your opponent from stem to stern using broadsides in space is cool. This is why the game is on a flat plane. By using your main weapons as broadsides it would not work if you had to roll to bring your guns to bear.The ecomomic system seems to work well, I like the way that when buying or selling you can see the average price in the sector. This will reduce the need for notes or trying to remember how much you paid for nuts and bolts, yes this is a real cargo. I like the idea of cola being illegal btw :-)I think that this is one that I will be playing for some time. It has been on my wish list since its release and in the sale I thought I would go for it. Now, the big question is would I have still enjoyed it at full price? So far I have to say yes I would have. There are loads of missions to do, a storyline to follow or if you just want to blow up asteroids for ore you can. There are loads floating round.You can configure your weaponry easily, with plenty of ships to fly , I haven't seen any dodgy models yet, all looking rather swish.So, go and buy the game if you like flying in space, blowing things up, mining or finding lost relatives. You won't regret it.Should have said about the music. Cant think of ANY game that has more fitting music!			"

You can make choices on how you wanna play; play the bad guy robbing traders, smuggling or you can be the galaxys pious defender or a mix of the two.

												TL;DR: if you're looking for something like Privateer or Freelancer, this game scratches that itch quite nicely.Pros rockin' soundtrack and fantastic sound direction massive capital ships that truly feel badass simple, yet engaging combat system great voiceworkCons original soundtrack is limited, so after a while, the same songs get stuck in your head as you loop them over and over. Fortunately, game allows you to add your own music game is quite grindy, as you need copious amounts of credits to advance tiers of difficulty. Can get repetitive after a while. not true 3D as the Y-axis is fixed like in Freelancer, but you cannot fly up and down at all. Makes the game simpler, but not a true space sim.PS: Get the Radovich.

												I knew I was making a good choice when I decided to put this game on my watch list before release to buy it upon release day and man I was not dissapointed, this game is a great and beautiful alternative to Elite: Dangerous, X: Rebirth, easy to use, straightforward controls, if all you want to do is go about blowing stuff up without grinding through trades for hours on end before you can do so then this is the game to buy! The soundtrack for the game is very relaxing on long journeys, not that the journeys are long to begin with, at least not by the last games mentioned standards and there's no going back and forth to take and complete missions, all you need to do is simply go to a station, pick up a mission and complete it and the money will be automatically rewarded to you without the need for travelling all the way back to the place you picked the mission up from.Here's a pros and cons list for those who want a more straightforward run down.Please note that I haven't ventured further than the beginning system at the time of this review, these are based on what I've experianced so far.PROS:-Great soundtrack.-I can run the game on max settings without lag on a low grade 1GB GPU and a 2.8 dual core CPU-Easy to use controls.-No back and forth missions (aside from the story missions)-Beautiful scenery-AI behaviour for turrets and your wingman (should you choose to hire)-Accurate mission ratings from very low to very high (go into high and very high ranked missions carefully)-Nice balance of strengths and weaknesses between ships and equipmentCONS:-Price jump in higher grade ships and equipment is quite large-high risk missions (which often involves killing multiple ships) rewards the same amount of credits as some bounties which are much easier.-Faction relations don't give much benefit asides from that faction deciding to shoot you or not and allow you to dock at stations.-It's hard to manually target anything that you have to pan the camera to target with turrets (or maybe that's just lack of skill on my part)-While I do like the intention of the mechanic it can get somewhat annoying when you are pulled out of warp drive by an asteroid field on a regular basis because you couldn't see it coming and are suddenly smack in the middle of it after managing to avoid some asterdoids by pure luck and end up having to manually fly through it before you can go into hyper again.

												This game is absolutely a diamond in the rough. It's a great game, and it doesn't limit what you can do. You can be a raider, a lawman, a trader, a smuggler (basically anyone in Firefly), all too a kickass soundtrack. I highly recommend this game.That said, there are some drawbacks. The world feels a bit empty, and out in the wide world, there are really only 3 things you can find: Trader under attack by raiders, raiders waiting for you, or random cops. That sounds like a big drawback, but you're really focusing on the missions you have and the badass ships you're saving up for. t just makes the universe feel less alive.			"

The soundtrack is catchy and sounds great. The game can get repetitve but the core conecepts are fun enough to have anyone coming back for more. As an added note since I've seen some reviewers upset by the concept of the game: the game takes place in 3D space but you are fixed to a 2D plane, while this may sound lame for a space shooter it still feels like a lot of fun in its execution.

The voice acting, graphics and game play are all great and help deliver a fun and entertaining game play experience.

												I bought this on a whim yesterday after seeing it available, probably one of the better purchases I've made recently. The gameplay is simple but feels rewarding and the challenges scale well when upgrading and buying new ships and equipment. Story seems to be balanced so far and between side missions, bounties and the occasional mining mission Rebel Galaxy ticks all the right boxes for a fun, 'don't take me serious' space-ship shooter.I would reccomend this to those who like their sci-fi, space shooters and ELITE/EVE: Online (esque) mechanics, albeit in a simplified form.

You fly a ship (you can upgrade and buy bigger better ships, different classes and styles for different play styles) there isn't a real difficulty, the game is only as hard as you make it. Make money, blow stuff up, do some side missions if you want. Pros:Big maps, lots of exploringRandom events that change aspects of the gameEngaging combatTHE SOUNDTRACKAgain: THE SOUNDTRACK.Lasers and suchPotential replay value (the maps are randomly generated based on star maps)Controller supportCons: Enemy Variety is limited to the area you're inShips are a bit expensive, but they *ARE* spaceships, they're not cheap.You'll spend a lot of time going from place to place, afterall space is a big place. Combat for the ships is limited to 2D (No up and down, strictly left, right, and forward. this does help with using cannonry )No options menu in-gameI am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar!  "

												Pros:+ Interesting single-plane gameplay mechanics especially since most Space games are fully 3D+ Great graphics and smooth running on potato PC+ Customizability of ships+ Features that are well implemented (warping, side quests)Meh:> OK story/plot> OK variability of enemies, not too interesting and didn't require much special tacticsCons:- I didn't feel like there exists much choice in terms of ships as you are forced to go to a heavier/larger/slower class of ships for more armor/firepower since movement plays a more limited role in this game- Lasers are too powerful/accurate without needing much care of aiming/positioning			"

												These guys follow the K.I.S.S. method when they developed this game. You can't go wrong with playing a game this much for $20. Just save yourself the grief and just get it already. If you need to know more about it then read the reviews below but beware that they still don't touch on the charm that this game offers when you play it. Yes the main campaigh gets wrapped up pretty quickly, and it left me wondering if the story will continue on in a sequel game. (I hope it does!)  Although i think it was left open ended depending if the game is popular and profitable enough to do a sequel. ( i hope it does!) Can't you tell how much i enjoyed playing this game? Oh and don't worry about blasting through the story the first go around. I challenge you try it the second time and play as a pirate scum!! That is what makes this game so cool...""replayability"". Cheers!			"

												I am going to make this as simple as possible:PROS* Awesome soundtrack!* It's like Firefly, with aliens...* Lots of ships, lots of gear!* There is a story, but it's not required to enjoy the game!* Combat is fast and furious.* Lots of potential for future content.* Random galaxy with each new character.CONS* It's space, but it's not a 3D experience... wut?* No multiplayer... here's a suggestion: Rebel Galaxy: Empires (MMO)* Travel is very time consuming which means a long grind for good gear.* While the soundtrack is awesome, the limited number of tracks becomes repetitive.* Ship customization/personalization is unavailable (paintjobs)* Combat can be a bit chaotic at times. I find, by the time I get to precise targeting, the battle is over.* No crew or ship boarding. No hijacking of other ships.* It feels empty at times... I have a HUGE ship. Where are my crew? Better crew, better performance?All in all, I am 8 hours into the game and JUST traveled to the second system. It's very easy to get lost in just existing in the galaxy without ever chasing the storyline. RG has incredible potential to be one of those games that I just play when I have nothing else to do. I can jump on, do a few missions, and jump off. I can play one character as a law abiding merchant that helps others and keeps their nose clean, and then start another character to join up with pirates and be a menace to the galaxy. There are many missed opportunities (3D galaxy, multiplayer, crews, explorable stations, actual character creation, etc) but there is a lot of room for them to expand on the game in the future. As it stands currently, it is a game I will use as a time filler when I just want to kick back, relax, and enjoy a stress-free gaming experience.			"

												This is yet another game where I wish I could give a middle rank, neither a yes or a no, but a ""meh"" rating too, however since the game is cheap, and has very good production values, and is fun for a little while, Ill give it the up vote.Anyway, you can watch some videos to see what kind of game this is about, however, Ill just get into some of my gripes with the game design.Some minor issues that annoy me:1.  Missions are over scripted and in a way are not realistic.  For example, every time you have do a trade-guild mission to ship some specific cagro from point A to B, you will ALWAYS be intercepted.  There is ALWAYs trouble.   Now if this were the only problem, I could overlook this.  The actual problem is that the REAL trade mission is to actually destroy the guys who intercept you.  Case and point, I took a very lucrative delivery mission that took place in  the same system.  It was rated as HIGH risk.   I figued I could run away.  My mission is to deliver something, not kill things?  RIght?  Oh no, quite wrong.   So I am getting close to the station I need to make my delivery to, and as usual, the trap is sprung and a bunch of ships appear from all directions and they pull you out of ""warp"".    So what do I do? I escape, I use my after burners and get enough distance and jump back into warp.  I make it like 5 clicks and the same trap happens again.  I do this 2 more times and each time the trap is reset and sprung again which is just terrible game design.  The only solution is to kill the ambush.  All mission types that are not supposed to be directly about combat workout the same way.2.  You can have missles as weapons, the problem with them is that you do not have a lot of ammo, which makes sense.  However, if you are an NPC, then you have infinite ammo.  I once had a ship that shot waves of missiles the killed my engines.  The didn't do any damage to my ship or shields, but I couldn't move.  It just sat there for like 10 minutes keeping me pinned.  I had to Alt-F4 to recover because if you exit normally, it would save your game and I would have been stuck forever.3.  No quick save.Ok, enough of the small sutff.  Why did I stop playing this game without finishing the main story?  What is the big thing that is wrong with the game design?Basically it is repetivie and boring.  Combat is boring.  Flying around in space warping everwhere is boring.  Each star system is randomly generated, but they are all very generic and you can't really tell the difference other than this sone might have a yellow sun and the other one has a blue sun.   There is nothing to explore or find.  Its all the same, everywhere.Now maybe if you LOVE space games you may get a lot more milage out of it then I did, but after about 20 hours the game felt more like work then fun.			"

												Love being a space cowboy in Rebel Galaxy, it just feels good to fly around and fight other ships! Graphics are amazing even on my mid-level system, my jaw dropped when I first loaded up the game. My laptop has a hard time running it though.Great pacing, lots of things to do; explore the solar systems, smuggle cargo between space stations, start fights with space pirates and steal their cargo, sell loot and upgrade your weapons...buy a new ship once you've saved up enough.I also like how you can customize your ship to fit different playstyles, there's no wrong answer, combat always feels intense and rewarding. Outfit long range cannons and missles to snipe opponents from afar, for medium range fightfights use blaster turrets and rockets, or cover your ship in lasers to cut ships apart up close! You also get to pick whether you prefer a huge tank-like ship or a sleek corvette, customize your speed and durability based on your play style. There are no levels, the more money you make the better ships and equipment you can afford, so buy trade items low, stock your hold with valuables, and sell to the buyers offering the most at the commodity markets at the space stations.One other thing I love is the music. Not only does it come with great music by default, you can use your own MP3 collection, and it will change songs for Ambient, Combat, Idle, Menu, and Space Station. So I made folders for each music type, copied songs that fit the mood into the folders, and added those folders to the game's music library. So when I'm cruising through space I can enjoy some low key Beck and Radiohead, but when a fight breaks out the game will start blasting Green Day or the Klaxons!Buy it! Don't even hesitate, don't even worry, don't even give it a second thought.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												Very easy to get into, casual to play, with enough depth to keep you interested and keep coming back for more. I found the game mechanics to make sense, the controls easy enough to figure out with explanations  what controls do what in the menu. This isn't Elite Dangerous or something hardcore and it's not meant to be. As example, to keep the fighting engaging and keep tactics interesting, the game employs an old style sailing ships battling by broadsides method of combat. I've read some reviews noting this as a bad or lazy mechanism... I found it wonderfully engaging and allowing battles to feel epic. I'm able to pick the game up after weeks of not playing and jump right in. Fun times! The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic to boot.			"

												I never write reviews, and I only do so for games that I think are that much fun, that I need to tell everyone!Rebel Galaxy is a weird thing, it combines ""naval"" combat with space ships and quite some options to (role) play the game.The combat, is in one word, different. You fly in 2D space, as the rest of the capital ships do, and only the lighter fighters are able to fly everywhere, but you only fly capital ships.If you want someone to explain on how you should tackle the combat in this game, then dont read this, I think you should totally find that out yourself. There are some really powerfull combinations but almost everything works together if you set it up logically.In ways how to play the game, there are different factions. the Citizens are what the name says, these people just want to live and inhabit most of the stations.The Militia are a military 'police' faction, taking down pirates but also stopping illegal trading.The Merchant Guild and Mercenaries Guild are a thing of their own. The Merchants are traders and specialize in getting cargo through the system. You can join them if you want to focus on trading with stations, because the trading and goods system in this game is quite fleshed out!The Mercenaries supply contracts to you if you join them, also giving you access to better equipment, like most factions do in the game when you join them. They work with and against everyone, its up to you what you choose.Then there are quite alot of Pirate and Raider factions, you'll meet the Red Devils and Double Jack's first, and you can join them if you play your missions right and work against their enemies, though all of them start out hostile to you.There is alot more to tell, but you can find it out for yourself. I still havent beat the main story, as i'm to busy working for my chosen faction, which is alot of fun.If you can get this on sale, defenitely get it, otherwise its still a pretty good deal!			"

												I've only put a few hours into this game so far, and I'm enjoying it immensely. Broadly, Rebel Galaxy reminds me of a mashup of the Assassin's Creed series, World of Warships, and good old Freelancer. The former because the way that the map and locations work (markers and missions within the system map), the second because of the similar broadside naval combat mechanic (which, given the lack of a traversable Z axis [for simplicity's sake] in the game, works surprisingly well), and the latter because...well, you fly around in space and do whatever you want for a career.Rebel Galaxy is very smooth. Everything looks wonderful, the theme music and some of the game's feel are obvious homages to Firefly and Serenity, but the overall experience is pretty fresh. While the exploration and side mission elements of gameplay can get redundant (see Assassin's Creed), the constantly evolving state of your own ship keep things fairly interesting. The difficulty curve can be a little intense. Like AC, this is forgiven somewhat because the game autosaves every time you leave dock, but there are a number of bloody lessons to be learned early on while you learn how to poke around the galaxy without dying with some frequency.Combat mechanics are very nifty. In addition to hired help and the already highlighted broadside combat system, turrets, auxiliary weapons, and various modules help keep combat pretty fresh and interesting. Plus it all looks very pretty, and blowing up pirate capital ships is viscerally satisfying in a way that Eve never accomplished.Very, very recommendable to fans of any of the above listed titles (disparate though they may seem), as long as you dig things in space. A great, sandboxy capital ship combat game that really WORKS, unlike so many halfhearted efforts.			"

												The brief review:What did I do?It took me 27 hours to complete the storyline, and then I took another 2 hours to get into a dreadnought, just to see what it felt like. I played it to complete it, and not to just fly around and experience the ""universe"". The story is bland at best, but it serves as a waypoint reference to guide you. I went the way of the mercenary and did fighting missions almost exclusively. This got.. bland after awhile. I found a method of fighting and stuck to it, simply upgrading the same types of weapons from Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 etc... blandWhat didn't I do?trade. Boring.. How was it?I guess it was SORTA worth the time? I mean it feels like fleet combat with broadsides, and certain weapons are more fun than others. If you like grinding reputation, killing pirates and stuff, this is not a bad game. The soundtrack is brilliant, the graphics are nice, and the overall aesthetic is worth your viewing pleasure. But it is NOT an epic space opera. It's the 2d platforming brother of something like Elite. But that just makes it a good place to start if you're not sure if you're going to like that type of game, since this one does away with all the tedious ""realistic"" parts :)It's a tentative recommendation. Go into this if you want an arcadey space sim with great music.			"

												This story is not 30-40 hours to complete -.- takes maybe a max of ten.   I would love to see more difficult missions, currently the ship I am in has no threat to it which would be nice to see if you ever get around to introducing more content.  Overall the game is very pretty but the story is very dry in terms of content.   The ending just feels like a scavanger hunt and the final battle can be won without having to fire a shot of your own.   Overall I love the game but would greatly appreciate some more endgame things to go explore or fights similar in strength to the end boss.  I am recomending it because I love the game to death.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a light hearted space sim, borrowing ideas from games such as Sid Mier's Pirates! and others. Graphically styled like Galaxy on Fire and Torchlight, it's a pretty game that runs smoothly other than when using the warp gate (no big issue really, they're used infrequently). Controls work nicely with both mouse/KB or controller. The game offers plenty of ship customisation, do you want to be a ship of the line with massive broadsides? Or perhaps a gunboat bristling with turrets? Maybe you want to long-haul goods across the system? Heaps of options for you to try out.My only real negatives so far;1) Not enough music, the music in the game is AMAZING, but the sound track needs to be a little longer I think2) Stop dropping me out of super-cruise etc when near asteroids etc, if I can visually plot a safe way through a field, then let me. :DSeriously though, this game is amazing value for $18, if you like space sim-lite, this is your game, or just want to blow up ships across the galaxy, look no futher.9/10, definately recomend.

It is not a AAA but if they had dumped the money and time into it -- it could have been.It is worth the $20 all day and if it is on sale and you don't buy it as a SciFi fan well then you're just silly.Babylon 5 style ships mixed with a Firefly feel?

Posted: December 20, 2015
												Well, just finished my first game of this, so I figured it was time for a review. So, where to start?Well, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the ""Rasputin"") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.But that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]And of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.Which brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)Your second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.Here's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.However, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.Nevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.As the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.There's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking♥♥♥♥♥♥.. right up until I blow them to smithereens.And speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.Was I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.Then there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade ""Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!""All in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.So yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]			"

												Love being a space cowboy in Rebel Galaxy, it just feels good to fly around and fight other ships! Graphics are amazing even on my mid-level system, my jaw dropped when I first loaded up the game. My laptop has a hard time running it though.Great pacing, lots of things to do; explore the solar systems, smuggle cargo between space stations, start fights with space pirates and steal their cargo, sell loot and upgrade your weapons...buy a new ship once you've saved up enough.I also like how you can customize your ship to fit different playstyles, there's no wrong answer, combat always feels intense and rewarding. Outfit long range cannons and missles to snipe opponents from afar, for medium range fightfights use blaster turrets and rockets, or cover your ship in lasers to cut ships apart up close! You also get to pick whether you prefer a huge tank-like ship or a sleek corvette, customize your speed and durability based on your play style. There are no levels, the more money you make the better ships and equipment you can afford, so buy trade items low, stock your hold with valuables, and sell to the buyers offering the most at the commodity markets at the space stations.One other thing I love is the music. Not only does it come with great music by default, you can use your own MP3 collection, and it will change songs for Ambient, Combat, Idle, Menu, and Space Station. So I made folders for each music type, copied songs that fit the mood into the folders, and added those folders to the game's music library. So when I'm cruising through space I can enjoy some low key Beck and Radiohead, but when a fight breaks out the game will start blasting Green Day or the Klaxons!Buy it! Don't even hesitate, don't even worry, don't even give it a second thought.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a thoroughly enjoyable space RPG-style game.  The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a ""main campaign"" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).If you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized ""universe"" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.8.5/10			"

												The gameplay is nice, graphics are nice, definitly a recommended buy! However, it does seem to be lacking a bit in content after playing it through, as I felt the factions you could choose to side with in the game definitly could have had some more faction specific ships, weapons, engines etc. I understand that the reason for this is that the development team was small and it didnt really bother me in my first playthrough, sadly it did take away some of the replay value.

The atmosphere in the game reminds me of Firefly a lot, reinforced by the number of hostile threats that are encountered.

												Very easy to get into, casual to play, with enough depth to keep you interested and keep coming back for more. I found the game mechanics to make sense, the controls easy enough to figure out with explanations  what controls do what in the menu. This isn't Elite Dangerous or something hardcore and it's not meant to be. As example, to keep the fighting engaging and keep tactics interesting, the game employs an old style sailing ships battling by broadsides method of combat. I've read some reviews noting this as a bad or lazy mechanism... I found it wonderfully engaging and allowing battles to feel epic. I'm able to pick the game up after weeks of not playing and jump right in. Fun times! The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic to boot.			"

												It's not awfully deep, the story and dialogue is flat, you'll have to decide between better ship and better guns, better guns and better engines, better engines and better shields. You'll never feel like mining is worth the time, you'll feel like merchant jobs are all about punishing you for taking merchant jobs, you'll take one escort job before you decide you should NEVER do escort jobs. There are many things about this game you'll wish were better, you'll wish they were better because even though they aren't, you're having a really really really hard time stopping yourself from playing. So much is just good enough in this game to keep you glued start to finish.

												If you were ever a fan of the Escape Velocity franchise you'll fall in love with this game. While it is missing some key elements from games like Escape Velocity such as being able to board and capture vessels to build a small fleet of escort ships it definitely fits the classic bill of running missions out of seedy bars on backwater stations and running those luxery goods from place to place to rake in the dough hand over fist.Soundtrack is heavily influenced by the dark and outlaw country genres of music, predominately by guitarist Blues Saraceno and acts such as The Blue News whichs adds a very heavy credit to it being a premier Space Western. Spend more than five minutes in the game and you'll be wishing you were raiding Space Trains belonging to Space Yankees who sacked the Space South after Sherman's Jump through the Orion Spur.Graphicly it is a decently impressive game that doesn't really fail to impress when it concerns ship, station or other object design and detail... also love burning up in atmospheres of planetary bodies, so gotta watch that hahah... seriously don't fly too close or you'll melt yourself six ways from STS-107.Overall if you want to jump into something that'll suck you in for a couple dozen hours its well worth the purchase for the sound track alone, which you can stand alone play from the game's data files (if you have anything that converts .ogg format)			"

												WOW for a $1.49 on sale this game was well worth the price i paid.Honestly I would of paid full price after playing this game for over 30 hours and I am no where near done yet.The number of turret and broad side weapons is staggering. If your willing to huntdown Pirates and Alien groups to see diffrent wepons or Join Diffrent faction to get them its very rewarding. This game lets you be a complete @$$ if you want to be.Want to go and slaughter Milita and Civilians? Go Ahead.Need to be the hero and save everyone? Feel free.Money your motovation? Become a Trader or Mercenary.Or you can Kill everyone and make EVERY faction mad at you.The quests in game or ""missions"" all pretty much involve some sort of combat even if it is nothing more than you survive long enuff to run away.Combat is the bread and butter of the game with diffrent firing arcs for every ship. Armor, Sheilds, Deflectors, Special comps, Engines, Jumpdrives, there are alot of items in game to modify and change to your liking.I dont want to go into to much detail as exploring and finding out what you like is a big part of the game as well as finding your own play style.With all that being said the one gripe I have is the ""Risk"" lv of each mission can be VERY misleading. I can say Low or very low risk and out of nowhere 4 Dreadnaughts that outgun you so bad that if they look at you youed die can appear.Good Luck.			"

												This is a pretty mellow recommendation. It's a pleasant game for wandering around being the most brutally murderous good samaritan, but doesn't really have much in the way of great exciting moments. The combat is pretty unique, but lacks skillshots or headshot-analogues. The economy (with the mark 1-6 versions of items) is set up such that you can throw down a huge number of credits on upgrading your ship to feel pretty much the same as it did before.It's mostly an improvement on Freelancer though I think, with more nuanced combat, a more lively world, and less time spent docking with trade lanes.

												This game is exactly how a sci-fiction space sandbox game should be in my mind. I believe you will find the same idea if you enjoy Galaxy on Fire series on Android, as this game seems to be even better than that.And I see they put quite some effort to optimize the graphics etc., I have never imagined my lame laptop would have such performance with all the glorious scences in game.Another thing worth mention is that the music. IDK other ppl but hell the original music in the game fits perfect, and you can use your own music as well.There are some minor flaws, like you cannot really rotate your capital ship to the 3rd axis (ie flying upwards or downwards) while other smaller fighter class ships can. But I will take it as unnecessary complexity so basically no downside for this game.			"

												You got problems captain.You just came out of warp. Your screen fills with red icons as criscrossing missile trails and cannon fill your vision. Seems this station is under attack by a rather nasty group of pirates. You can see your turrets taking aim and firing as you aim for the station itself. The system militia seems to be doing well, but the pirates just got reinforcements. Torpedo bombers and enemy frigates are starting to get real close. Too close for your liking. You activate your flak cannons and watch the fighters pull away from you. Unleashing a broadside into a passing enemy frigate, you idly wonder if maybe you should just take that mining laser off of your rear turret. Maybe get another tachyon turret? Your ship shakes violently as a mine slams into your hull, and with growing concern you hear your ship calmly relay the fact that your engines are slowing down. Hitting your deflectors you absorb a few torpedo hits as your shields try their best to recharge with the brief respite you have given them.Best shields in the sytem you had thought to yourself as you happily pressed the buy button after trading all that juicy ore you mined. This situation probably wouldn't have been a big deal, if you hadn't of been ambushed on the way here. Apparently when the mission board said 'deadly ore delivery' they had meant it. That fight with two massive heavy frigates had ripped most of the armor off of your hull. Then your hull had been beaten something fierce. Emerging from that fight with a mere 20% hull integrity had been rough.That was before the distress call. Sure, you could have ignored it, after all in your experience sometimes it was a trap. Yet sometimes it was a trader in need of help. You had come out of warp with all of your weapons singing. The friendly trader barely expressed his grattitude before handing over a handful of credits and jumping to warp. Sure, you could have ignored them and kept on trucking, but that aint you, is it outlaw? Frontier folks gotta stick together.You sigh as you realize you just fired on a militia ship. It was gonna be a while before you could build that rep up. Luckily, the station was in full view, and you hit your boosters and your deflectors to make up the remaining distance.As you dock, you smile as 31,900c goes into your account, and the repair costs of your ship are covered by those alien artifacts you scooped up coming in.You have heard rumors of other galaxies. Starpoint Gemini 2, X3 Terran Conflict, Evochron Mercenary, Freelancer, but word in the space bars is that all of those where missing something. As you replace your flak cannon arrays with EMP grids, you can't help but smile once more.Yeah, you got problems captain, but that's the way you like it.			"

												English is not my primary language, so please, be patient :)Man, I'm not one to write reviews, but hell, this game is FUN !It was a very welcome surprise for me. I've played elite dangerous and other space games around, but nothing as fun as this one. The game awsome, good graphics, fast combat (even inside a capital ship, belive me), great learning curve, easy to play, not a insane number of commands, keyboard/mouse or joystick, great music, you really get the feeling of a space cowboy and pause: Yes PAUSE ! hit esc and everything stops ! You can get a soda, got take a leak, eat some pizza and the game will wait for you ! Want to snan some ships for cargo ? No problem, hit TAB and the game stops letting you scan ships without worring abou hitting something. The progression is also good, the game will give you bether missions based on the configuration of your ship. Bether ships, bether credits for your time. The side missions may seen repetitive, but, as long I'm blasting stuff up, I don't care, ehe. The game has many ships to fly, and even more as NPCs. Also, a good amount of gear for your ship. Main gus, sub guns, turrets, engines, warp drives are just some to name. HINT: A good defence IS A GOOD DEFENCE ! Don't neglect shields, or you will find yourself blowing up more than you like.Final words. Game is solid, for the price, it's a bargain. 8/10 If you're looking for a fun game to pass time, without the big worries of other space sims, go ahead, you will not regret it!			"

Upgrade your weapons, shields and more or save up to buy a whole new ship - anything from a nippy little corvette to a huge and powerful dreadnought.[PROS]* The soundtrack is immense. It's sort of bluesy and grungy, with a definite western feel (think Firefly). The heavy guitar riffs brought a smile to my face more than once during a pitched battle.* The story. Engaging and fun, with just the right amount of grinding side-quests in between.* Active developers. The game is post-launch, but they're still working on it and perfecting things, which is always nice to see.* The graphics. The ships are very detailed in perticular, with artistic and individual designs for each one. None of the 'stock blocky ship 1a' nonsense you get in some games of this ilk. They all have their own distinc look and feel.* Firefly. A lot has been made of the similarities and they are there. Mostly in the asthetic rather than the actual gameplay, but it really feels like that's the universe you are playing in. What's not to love about that!* Freedom. Choose to stay in a fast ship with high maneuverability, or spring for a lumbering dreadnought, armed to the teeth. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow. There really is no perfect choice. You can switch between ships you have bought with no penalty too, which is a great touch.[CONS]* Campaign could be longer. A mid-level ship is more than sufficient to complete the whole thing, so the awesome but expensive top-tier ships don't get a proper airing. However  The campaign ends on a cliff-hanger, so a sequel or expansion might be in the works. * Navigating can get a bit irritating. You drop out of FTL travel when you get close to an asteroid, or any other obstacle and they are everywhere. This would be okay, but you can never see them coming in advance. I got used to it though, since travel times really aren't that long anyway. "

												This game is exactly how a sci-fiction space sandbox game should be in my mind. I believe you will find the same idea if you enjoy Galaxy on Fire series on Android, as this game seems to be even better than that.And I see they put quite some effort to optimize the graphics etc., I have never imagined my lame laptop would have such performance with all the glorious scences in game.Another thing worth mention is that the music. IDK other ppl but hell the original music in the game fits perfect, and you can use your own music as well.There are some minor flaws, like you cannot really rotate your capital ship to the 3rd axis (ie flying upwards or downwards) while other smaller fighter class ships can. But I will take it as unnecessary complexity so basically no downside for this game.			"

												Okay, so as I write this I am currently only at eleven hours of playtime, not a whole lot really. And in the grand scheme of things? I've barely scratched the surface of this game. You're dumped into a solar system, with a few planets and maybe ten-ish? stations to visit and get some random missions from. Cool, great, awesome. Did I mention this is only one solar system out of a galaxy? Sure it's in space, the game isn't really going to be absolutely teeming with life or a huge population, but whenever you find a landmark there's usually some miners, pirates, the Militia, or some traders that are around, and it's up to you how to interpret who is friend, who is foe, and who is prey.Can you be a pirate in this? Absolutely. Can you trade and smuggle illegal materials from different stations? Of course, just be careful of Militia patrols - they're in bigger, and meaner ships than you are to start out with, and they tend to shoot first and ask questions later if you're on the wrong side of the law. And of course you can also play the role of a bounty hunter, chasing after Pirate heads to fuel your bank account and taking up odd jobs to buy a few new guns along the way.You can also be a trader, taking supplies from one station, then going and selling them at another station to make a huge profit. There's a news-feed option in there to let you know what the latest prices are for each station, if you're patient enough. Just look out for the pirates. Or, if you're a wuss, you can just be a miner and shred through astroids with mining lasers, selling the metal ore for profit, and running the hell away from the Pirates who like your cargo, but don't like the work.As far as the combat goes, there's nothing really all that complex about it. You've got Broadside weapons, Turrets, and Secondaries. Broadsides are pretty self explanitory - they're guns mounted in the port and starboard sides of your ship (Left and Right) that are your main ship-killing weapons. What's neat is you can just spray-and-pray with them if you want, or you can charge them up, take aim, and have a well-timed barrage that leads your target so it lands right into their hull. Although if you're point blank, sometimes the spray-and-pray is better for use as a DPS race.Then you have turrets. You can have some pretty simple stuff... missile turrets, laser turrets, beam weaponry, and even some flak guns to take down those pesky fighters and bombers swarming around your poopdeck.And lastly there's Secondaries. Secondaries are essentially up to you, and effect certain places where your craft will be effective. You can put... bigger flak guns, you can put mine launchers, dumb-fire missile launchers, heat-seeker missile launchers, and so on. As far as the story goes? I haven't really gotten that far into it yet, but from what I can tell it's super simple and not really anything that you're gonna get lost on. Find some alien-tech doohickey and then go on an adventure to find out what the heck it is and what it does.Bottom line is this: If you like Starpoint Gemini, but thought the combat and world was exceptionally boring (like I found it to be...)? You'll like this. If you like pretending you're piloting Serenity or the Outlaw Star, you'll like this.You can't take the sky from me.			"

												Reminiscent of the game Privateer. You get dumped into a sand box with a vague mission and a crappy ship. You fight, mine, trade, and explore for money until you can afford better a better ship. Combat is somewhat simplistic. Not a simple point and click but there is some timing and strategy involved just not much. Good game so far.			"

												A 3D swashbuckling space-themed game with clear influence from Sid Meier's Pirates!.  This is not Freelancer or X3 or Privateer.  You can mine all you want, the game will let you, but you'll be broke.  You won't be building a trading empire.  The main idea is to go look for trouble with the right factions and go line up broadsides against their capital ships.  Just go through the main storyline, grind side missions between storyline missions, upgrade your ship, re-outfit it for the right role and go beat up the enemy until the credits roll.  It's a good time and a decent looking game without outrageous system requirements.The game does not take itself terribly seriously either, but it doesn't get too cartoonish.  There aren't really any RPG elements to speak of.  There is a faction reputation system, but it's nothing special.  Most people will be friendly with citizens and militia, and enemies with the various criminal factions.  The game certainly allows for play as a criminal, there are criminal-owned bases in all the systems, etc... but you're better off being friendly with the law for the storyline.  I found the combat to be incredibly fun, and the different weapons and the different classes of enemies require different strategies for effective play, so combat can be deep; not exactly oceanic, but enough to engage someone for at least the length of the storyline.  It's also self-paced, the missions give you an indication of the relative ""risk"" of the mission, so you can grind until the mission is ""low risk"" or challenge yourself by taking ""high risk"" missions.  There is also a warrior race of what look like giant badgers so...			"

												It may not be THE greatest space game I played. But the soundtrack solely was worth the money (well, I bought it on sale, but still).With this great rock music you just feel like a badass on a Harley or in a muscle car. Except you're flying a corvette in space and shooting broadsides like a damn great pirate.Gameplay, graphics etc are all nice too. But I still can't get enough of the feel the music gives you. Especially if you play as a pirate. It makes the game feel VERY unique. Nothing better than having a big rusty ship combatting others with great rock playing.Money well spent.			"

												I was on the fence about a 2D space combat game, but having played it it's a fun game.It has some problems, the control system seems to be based around a gamepad so there are a few limitations on the UI that wouldn't otherwise be there. There are also some curious design decisions like being unable to access your cargohold/factions list/tactical menu etc while docked.There is no RPGesque character development, the only limitation on what ship/equipment you can use seems to be money and to a lesser extent faction.The combat in the game is fun. There is a large variety of equipment available to outfit your ship in order to compliment your playstyle. For instance you can gear your ship up for long range sniping, close range, and even fitting special deflector shields in order to cause extra damage ramming into other ships. In general the combat seems very well thought out.On the other hand the trading and mining feel a bit lacklustre. Mining, even with the ""perfect"" mining setup is haphazard and rarely nets you anywhere near the amount of money combat would in the same amount of time. Trading seems too random in that it's very hard to charge what good will be worth more at any given station. I freely admit though I haven't spent a lot of time trading, so it's very possible that if I invested more time in it I'd understand the system more.I've read complaints about the save system. It's a standard autosave only game, and the autosave only takes place when you dock. This means that if you pick up 3 missions, complete 2 and then die in the 3rd one you'll lose all that progress. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing as you just weigh up the risk and dock if necessary to save.The soundtrack in the game is...interesting. I kind of liked it at first, but it becomes very repetitive after a couple of hours. However, using the launcher you can easily add your own music.In summary this game is definately worth picking up if you enjoy space action games.			"

												Absolutely worth getting if you:- want more casual space mercenary/trader experience similar to brilliant Freelancer- miss Firefly atmosphere- like more groovy variations of country/blues musicHonestly, Rebel Galaxy is probably a mediocre game. Story is there only to justify your next move (but characters are kinda likable). Graphics are nice, but aren't exceptional. Game itself is 2D and combat is really weird/unique. Yet somehow, for me this game was more than just a sum of its parts. Rebel Galaxy is very fun casual game with flat learning curve and cool atmosphere. Don't expect anything exceptional and you'll have 20-30+ of pure fun with nice music and broadside cannonades. Just don't forget to grab a gamepad, controls are designed for it.			"

												This is a pretty mellow recommendation. It's a pleasant game for wandering around being the most brutally murderous good samaritan, but doesn't really have much in the way of great exciting moments. The combat is pretty unique, but lacks skillshots or headshot-analogues. The economy (with the mark 1-6 versions of items) is set up such that you can throw down a huge number of credits on upgrading your ship to feel pretty much the same as it did before.It's mostly an improvement on Freelancer though I think, with more nuanced combat, a more lively world, and less time spent docking with trade lanes.

												WOW for a $1.49 on sale this game was well worth the price i paid.Honestly I would of paid full price after playing this game for over 30 hours and I am no where near done yet.The number of turret and broad side weapons is staggering. If your willing to huntdown Pirates and Alien groups to see diffrent wepons or Join Diffrent faction to get them its very rewarding. This game lets you be a complete @$$ if you want to be.Want to go and slaughter Milita and Civilians? Go Ahead.Need to be the hero and save everyone? Feel free.Money your motovation? Become a Trader or Mercenary.Or you can Kill everyone and make EVERY faction mad at you.The quests in game or ""missions"" all pretty much involve some sort of combat even if it is nothing more than you survive long enuff to run away.Combat is the bread and butter of the game with diffrent firing arcs for every ship. Armor, Sheilds, Deflectors, Special comps, Engines, Jumpdrives, there are alot of items in game to modify and change to your liking.I dont want to go into to much detail as exploring and finding out what you like is a big part of the game as well as finding your own play style.With all that being said the one gripe I have is the ""Risk"" lv of each mission can be VERY misleading. I can say Low or very low risk and out of nowhere 4 Dreadnaughts that outgun you so bad that if they look at you youed die can appear.Good Luck.			"

												I didn't get all that far into this game, but I did really enjoy playing it.The 2D broadside combat takes some getting used to and is a little bit frustrating at times, but overall it's very well executed.

Not that it was bad (it's quite good), and not because you can add your own tracks to it (awesome!), but because it annoyed my family that the game would fade and switch songs to what was happening in game.

												If you were ever a fan of the Escape Velocity franchise you'll fall in love with this game. While it is missing some key elements from games like Escape Velocity such as being able to board and capture vessels to build a small fleet of escort ships it definitely fits the classic bill of running missions out of seedy bars on backwater stations and running those luxery goods from place to place to rake in the dough hand over fist.Soundtrack is heavily influenced by the dark and outlaw country genres of music, predominately by guitarist Blues Saraceno and acts such as The Blue News whichs adds a very heavy credit to it being a premier Space Western. Spend more than five minutes in the game and you'll be wishing you were raiding Space Trains belonging to Space Yankees who sacked the Space South after Sherman's Jump through the Orion Spur.Graphicly it is a decently impressive game that doesn't really fail to impress when it concerns ship, station or other object design and detail... also love burning up in atmospheres of planetary bodies, so gotta watch that hahah... seriously don't fly too close or you'll melt yourself six ways from STS-107.Overall if you want to jump into something that'll suck you in for a couple dozen hours its well worth the purchase for the sound track alone, which you can stand alone play from the game's data files (if you have anything that converts .ogg format)			"

												I am a huge fan of the old FREELANCER game, and this gets pretty close in gameplay, at least closer than anything else in recent memory.I love this game. Has great atmosphere, and is worth it just for the dark and spacey dark country and rock music. More often than not I found myself just enjoying the music this game has.Plenty of ships, plenty to do, and ship loadout customization is very well done. I like that not every battle cannot be won off the bat as enemy levels can vary all over, so pay attention to the mission difficulties. I often found hit-and-run tactics worked well till I got more tanky ships.I love the boradside space battles... Though the one drawback to this mechanic is the whole game is done on a linear plane, meaning you can't fly up or down. The linear plane thing is the only thing I do not like about this game.Controls are spot on too with an Xbox360 controller. I love that I can just turn this game on and rock out and blow stuff up while not needing to be stooped over a keyboard and mouse.For a game that often goes on sale for less than $10 it is worth it for the music alone, and you get a fun game in the process.Did I mention how freaking good the music is?

												Fun and addictive game with a great soundtrack.  Controls are relatively easy to learn and don't require memorizing a playbook of joystick/button combos.  Nice way to kick back, enjoy some dark country tunes, and wind down from a day's work.  You choose your path - hero, criminal, rogue, rebel... maybe a bit of each, rack up contracts and bounties, craft your ship, build your reputation, and make your fortune.  Reminds me of the old Traveller tabletop RPG a bit.			"

												Pros:Incredibly pretty.Kickass soundtrack.Solid storyline.Great gameplay and controls.White-knuckle intensity in combat.Gray morality for almost every interaction with NPCs.Badass spaceships with big guns.Cons:Ammo-based weapons like missiles run out far too fast.Broadside guns are nice, spinal guns would be better in some situations.Songs get a little repetitive after a while.Summary:You will lose SO MUCH SLEEP over this game.F**k Santar.

												Call me utterly surprised. This game came out of no where from me, and if not for a reccomendation from someone I trust I would have never even heard of it. This is a game by a series of devs that know their stuff. The controls are very slick and accessible, the ship piloting is fantastic, and it's the kind of thing that could have had a waffly, generic scifi electronica or trumpet track and instead has some of the most radical rock/country (yes, I am advocating something that is at least in part country, but I mean listen to the trailer people) I've ever heard backing it pretty solidly. That tangles with the interesting strategies for space battles, the system for navigating faction trust and how you can play out numerous missions without even touching the main story. This is an excellent example of emergent gameplay and, while the story to me is really just so much background noise, even the little things characters do and say add to the setting's charm. This is AAA+ to me, amazing and simply made me a fan of this dev in whatever they do.			"

												It's not awfully deep, the story and dialogue is flat, you'll have to decide between better ship and better guns, better guns and better engines, better engines and better shields. You'll never feel like mining is worth the time, you'll feel like merchant jobs are all about punishing you for taking merchant jobs, you'll take one escort job before you decide you should NEVER do escort jobs. There are many things about this game you'll wish were better, you'll wish they were better because even though they aren't, you're having a really really really hard time stopping yourself from playing. So much is just good enough in this game to keep you glued start to finish. You will get your $20 worth and more out of this game and you will write a laundry list of suggestions for RG 2 because you really want RG 2 and you will weep because there never will be an RG 2 because 6 of your friends *want* but have not *bought* Rebel Galaxy. BUY REBEL GALAXY. DO IT NOW. IT'S WORTH IT. HONEST!			"

												I didn't get all that far into this game, but I did really enjoy playing it.The 2D broadside combat takes some getting used to and is a little bit frustrating at times, but overall it's very well executed. It sometimes feels a bit unfair when dealing with fighters that seemingly ignore the dimensional restrictions, and some of the enemy ships just feel impossibly tough, but this could just be my limited understanding of the game.Gearing is pretty fun and the types of systems are sufficiently varied to hold my interest, at least as a game that I poke every now and then.I had to quit playing because of the soundtrack. Not that it was bad (it's quite good), and not because you can add your own tracks to it (awesome!), but because it annoyed my family that the game would fade and switch songs to what was happening in game. That is a neat feature, but I can understand their annoyance with it since they aren't playing.And that brings me to my only real complaint; this game aches for multiplayer support that it will never receive.

												WOW for a $1.49 on sale this game was well worth the price i paid.Honestly I would of paid full price after playing this game for over 30 hours and I am no where near done yet.The number of turret and broad side weapons is staggering. If your willing to huntdown Pirates and Alien groups to see diffrent wepons or Join Diffrent faction to get them its very rewarding. This game lets you be a complete @$$ if you want to be.Want to go and slaughter Milita and Civilians? Go Ahead.Need to be the hero and save everyone? Feel free.Money your motovation? Become a Trader or Mercenary.Or you can Kill everyone and make EVERY faction mad at you.The quests in game or ""missions"" all pretty much involve some sort of combat even if it is nothing more than you survive long enuff to run away.Combat is the bread and butter of the game with diffrent firing arcs for every ship. Armor, Sheilds, Deflectors, Special comps, Engines, Jumpdrives, there are alot of items in game to modify and change to your liking.I dont want to go into to much detail as exploring and finding out what you like is a big part of the game as well as finding your own play style.With all that being said the one gripe I have is the ""Risk"" lv of each mission can be VERY misleading. I can say Low or very low risk and out of nowhere 4 Dreadnaughts that outgun you so bad that if they look at you youed die can appear.Good Luck.			"

												If you're looking for elitist  3D space combat with twitchy impossible combat and hardcore navigation and think it's fun to die trying to dock your ship, don't waste your money.If you want a fun game that's rewarding in small doses or good for an epic gaming weekend, this is it.  But warn your friends and family that they will be seeing less of you for a while....It's a beautifully done space combat/trading/questing game.  You can be a trader, you can be a miner, you can be a pirate, you can be a quester, or most likely you'll find yourself doing a little bit of all of it.  Or a LOT of all of it.I will suggest playing with a controller...I'm a longtime keyboard and mouse guy and I never use a controller for anything.  Thats a big part of why my Nintendo was gifted to my nephew and my xbox hasnt been plugged in for 2 years, but with this game the controller just feels right and works perfectly.Pros: *  It looks 3D, but it's mostly a 2D game, so it simplifies the navigation and combat *  Its very open.  There is a story line to progress through , but you're free to ignore it, or progress at your own pace*  You can fire it up, do a couple of quick quests, and feel like you accomplished something.  * And then a couple more, and then just one more, and then another one.....and 8 hours later you've played a quick game* It autosaves every time you visit a station.  So if your next quest goes horribly wrong, and you die a fiery death, then reload and try again. * If an objective is too hard, there are plenty of options to go make a little money, buy some better armor and weapons, and try it again.  Yet somehow it doesnt feel grindy, it's fun.* After over 30 hours, I still have the music turned on.  I saw one review call it ""Cowboy butt-rock"" - I'm not sure if they meant that as a compliment or an insult, but it kind of fits.  Either way, I like it.* The one time I had a problem, I posted a question on the support forum and got a response in 15 minutesCons* If you're not a fan of the ""Cowboy butt-rock"", turn it off.  The game is still worth it.* The game is so awesome it will inspire you to take time out to write a review, which takes time away from playing the awesome game.* I can't think of any other cons to put here* Really, why are you still reading?  Buy the game already "

												A 3D swashbuckling space-themed game with clear influence from Sid Meier's Pirates!.  This is not Freelancer or X3 or Privateer.  You can mine all you want, the game will let you, but you'll be broke.  You won't be building a trading empire.  The main idea is to go look for trouble with the right factions and go line up broadsides against their capital ships.  Just go through the main storyline, grind side missions between storyline missions, upgrade your ship, re-outfit it for the right role and go beat up the enemy until the credits roll.  It's a good time and a decent looking game without outrageous system requirements.The game does not take itself terribly seriously either, but it doesn't get too cartoonish.  There aren't really any RPG elements to speak of.  There is a faction reputation system, but it's nothing special.  Most people will be friendly with citizens and militia, and enemies with the various criminal factions.  The game certainly allows for play as a criminal, there are criminal-owned bases in all the systems, etc... but you're better off being friendly with the law for the storyline.  I found the combat to be incredibly fun, and the different weapons and the different classes of enemies require different strategies for effective play, so combat can be deep; not exactly oceanic, but enough to engage someone for at least the length of the storyline.  It's also self-paced, the missions give you an indication of the relative ""risk"" of the mission, so you can grind until the mission is ""low risk"" or challenge yourself by taking ""high risk"" missions.  There is also a warrior race of what look like giant badgers so...			"

Except you're flying a corvette in space and shooting broadsides like a damn great pirate.Gameplay, graphics etc are all nice too. But I still can't get enough of the feel the music gives you.

The game is not the fastest playing game and you will have to do sidemissions to upgrade your ship. At the start you get a capital ship which at the moment is the only type of ship (read: corvettes to dreadnaughts). And you are send of with a mission however you can also go explore, trade or be a pirate if you want to.

												Was looking forward to this game since I used to play Privateer as a kid and this game might bring back some of those memories.From a technical perspective I can't recommend this game. Sorry.In 4k it's unplayable with a mouse. The mouse does not work correctly. In 1440p it's better, but the mouse still does not work correctly. Basically the issue is that even though the cursor is visually on a selection the game does not recognize it being there. That means you have to move the mouse around until you find the area of the screen where the game thinks the cursor is in the correct spot. They should just remove the 4k and 1440p options from the settings until this is fixed. If you don't mind playing in 1080p I'm sure you won't have to worry about the mouse issue. I see some people saying how nice the graphics are, but I don't see it. The textures are very ""muddy"" and blurry. Yes, I was in 4k and max settings. Easily was over 100fps so you know it's not a graphic intensive game. Which is probably a good thing for many people. Sound and music seem top notch the little I played the game though. Had to ask for a refund because of the technical issues.			"

												I was suprised. I really like this game. Being both a story driven and, sandbox game that blends very nicely. (IE:Your not forced to do anything, and have all the tools and oportunities of every other AI player from the start.) *almost, there are some races that have improved weaponry and such, but these can be ""obtained"" in various ways. I'm not sure about all unique crafts, but they are not OP so not a real worry.It gives me all the excitment and fun stuff that Elite Dangerous promised(lied about), and has never delilvered.Your actions have an impact in the game in a way that doesn't seem grindy.It feels fun and less like having a second job. *See Elite DangerousI don't have to pay $60.00 a year to play the full game.The controls took me a few mins to figure out, but then I'm using a keyboard and mouse, but after a few mins I was having a blast.I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes space-flight, open-world, scripted or sandbox type play.You can choose to play as the ""good-guys"", ""bad-guys"" or anything in between, or any type of character you want really, AND change your play-style at any point. Various missions give you the oportunity to improve your relations with the different factions regardless of past history.The graphics are terrific.My rating 9.0 out of 10.Having finnished the game; the rating stands. I should lower it a bit due to the unfinished feeling the game leaves you with as pertains to the interface, contant speed bumps, other factions, and weaponry and such. Still I had fun. The modding community has tried to keep this game fresh and fun for those of us who have finnished it. But, without real modding tools, this list is short and creating your own mod is way too much work to be worth the effort atm.Hopefully, the Devs will create something to make the process a bit simplified or the replayability of this game may suffer in the long run.

												Rebel Galaxy is a lot like a shot of cheap whisky in a pretty glass, served in a grungy southern biker bar.  It looks attractive, and it gets the job done, but it has some glaring faults and limitations and can burn like hell going down.  One of the often mentioned features is the sound track, I thought it was pretty cool at first, but after 2 hours I turned down  the music to 10%.  It certainly sets the mood, and establishes Rebel Galaxy as a ""Firefly inspired"" space western.  however it gets repetative, and is intrusive.  After you hear the title song five or six times in a row blasting in your ears, it gets old quick. I am susceptable to ear worms, and it's going to take a few days to get this out of my brain completely.   That isn't a good thing for me. It's not that the songs are bad, by no means, the artist who wrote them is talented, and I like the sound track.  But too much of a good thing can be frustratingly iritating. Other reviewers have done a good job talking about the games features and gameplay style.   comparing it to the ship combat from black flag, and I think that is a spot on comparison.   It really feels like someone wrote a naval combat engine, and halfway through decided to make it a space game instead.  This could literally have been a WWII naval simulator or something and it would have been the same game.   Just with water and islands instead of space and planets. To put it bluntly, this is an Naval combat arcade game with a space skin.  Despite this, the game works, it works stylistically, and the gameplay is satisfying enough to keep you playing. The game is only 20$ full price (I got it for 13$ on sale), and it's worth even full price, but only if you like the genre. Buy this game if:You like the Vibe of Firefly or Serenity. Like Arcade shooters in space. Liked the naval combat of Black flag. Like the standard Trader/Bountyhunter/Pirate/miner kind of space game, and don't mind the emphasis being on combat.Like the gritty southern/blues/country soundtrack.  Like the graphics.Don't mind being locked into a 2d playing field, even when smaller ships can still fly 3d.  All around you. Want to control a whole ship using even just a console controller (works very well). You Like Single Player games. Don't buy the game if:You strongly prefer Simulators/realism to arcade style games. You prefer complex controls, and tactics (you can pretty much phone in tactics in this game). You are tired of the Trade/fight/mine paradigm of space sandbox gaming. You hate any form of country music. You Hated Firefly. You expect a long complex story with tons of twists and turns (I like it so far, and the voice acting and dialogue trees are fun... but it's not Mass Effect for example.). Think a ""2d limited"" space game is too immersion breaking. Prefer multiplayer. Final verdict:  If you like the genre, or can get past the burning in your throat, you will enjoy this offering.  It is a good game to unwind with, the fights satisfying the visuals pleasing. Like that cheap shot of whisky, it may not have the smooth quality of a higher priced drink, but it will still do the job, and if you drink enough of it, you won't even notice the burning in your throat anymore. Unlike that shot of whisky, this shouldn't give you a hangover, and won't ruin your marraige.  Anyway, I have no regrets, it's a fun game, worth the full price unless you fall in the ""don't buy it"" category. ).			"

												A rather small game with huge potential for sequel.- Assassin's Creed ship broadside combat style. Movement in game is 2D (no up or down), feel like battleship rather than spacecraft.- Variable play style. Trader, miner, smuggler, mercenary, assassin, transporter, saboteur or just an a$$hole who blows stuff up for fun.- Factions and Guilds are interesting enough.- Space feels lively and vivid. Soundtrack is sublime.- No in-game purchases bullsh_t.- Dynamic economy&logical system.    *Various events such as famine, tech boom, celebration, invasion etc.   *Intercepting diaplomat ship might result in interplanetary war which you can make profit by selling war supplies or accepting mercenary contracts.   *When famine hits a planet you can sabotage the relief efforts by intercepting supply ships then sell the loots at the planet for greater prices than usual.   *Slave smuggling, drug trafficking, f_uck a planet economy up by hoarding gold.:( I'm a bad person.Bad stuff:- Some features are shortcoming. Usual for a small company dev.- Story and dialogues are rather bland. The game could be A LOT more creative.- Controls can be confusing once in a while.- Not enough weapon choices.- Can be repetitive and grindy.			"

												I'm a bad guy. I really am. And the fact that you can rack up with some of the toughest guys in the game and still beable to manage the story well enough just makes this great. And the diverging missions that offer a real choice in the universe is amazingly interesting. Game play wise its pretty solid, though I do with you had the ability to travel on the Z axis as well, but hey, it makes fighting a bit more of a challenger when you're twice the size of the target. Soundtrack is absolutely amazing. I love the Sci-fi western feel. Makes me think of Firefly meets Freelancer.10/10 would highly recommend.			"

												I've seen some reviews that the battles aren't in three dimensions and that is slightly annoying, but I get why they did it.  Plus, it becomes a non-issue very quickly, as your mercenary (get one ASAP, they last until they die) takes care of a lot of the 3D fighters and the bigger battles have so much going on, the 2D actually helps.  That being said, this is like you're a young Han Solo in the Firefly world.  I'm barely fans of either universe, but this game is a fun ride and for the price, I feel like I got my money's worth.

Posted: January 2, 2016
												Edited and update review here. I wanted to re-review this after seeing how good/bad the game was after you finish the story. I had a very strong positive reaction to my first 15 hours playing, but after you finish the majority of the main story mode, the game is basically over. It wasn't built for a ""sandbox"" experience or anything, as the systems get less and less fun as you move along the main story path. I'll explain that more below, but if you want a one sentence recap: good game, worth twenty bucks for sure, but it has a few glaring problems. First off, I really like this game. Almost every aspect is fun and it isn't often you get good space games on Steam. The price is good, and I do recommend it overall. With that said, there are some major flaws. The first one being the trade and economy system. It's so poorly handled that it's hard to justify it being in the game at all. The only time you will find the market scheme useful in any way is very early in the game, in the first or second systems when you are stuggling to earn credits. The work it takes to get goods and then find the station that is buying high is just way too hard to justify when you start earning $100,000 per mission - let alone when you are getting $1mil per mission later on. The 90k you might make off trading is insignificant. Your time spent grows significantly and the gains never justify it. The whole thing could have been alleviated by having actual up-to-date pricing information available both on the main map and while in a dock, but the developers failed miserably on that. It's true they did implement a (very minimal) scheme that shows you current pricing in each station from the main map, but it only works if you've already visited the station or happen find a message transponder that gives you the information. Even then, the information is only good for a matter of minutes. The game will randomly change the goods and prices in each station, so usually by the time you get enough of the goods to matter, you will never find the right place to sell it unless you get really lucky and accidentally stop at the right station. Couple that with random events like famine, celebration, tech boom, etc., it's like a lottery except the profit is meaningless. There is no logic or reason to the system, no attempt to mimic actual markets in any logical way. The one and only way to make real credits is by doing missions, which are fine and fun, but I think they should have either cut the entire trading system or made it universal and simplified. Instead it's like they started out with a good idea, but lost it halfway through. The other huge issue is the ""proximity stop"" system. Basically, if you come within a certain distance of any other object in the game, you will be instantly halted out of warp. This would be fine and make sense if they tried to limit the amount of debris and roaming hostile fleets, but as the game progresses and you meet more factions, the maps stay the same size. So what you end up with are huge fields of debris from battles needing to share a shrinking amount of space with asteroid fields and huge fleets of enemies wandering around. By the fifth system or so, there are a half dozen factions on each map. Then you have merchants and traders randomly criss-crossing the place on top of it, and they have their own bodyguards with fighter ships. It all adds up to way, way too much crap on the map and fewer and fewer routes you can take just to do simple tasks, like going to turn in a mission or finish a trade.  After the 100th time you get stopped mid-warp just because a piece of debris or friendly merchant came within 400 sm (in-game unit of measurement) of your path, it gets incredibly frustrating.It's also worth noting that the ""escort"" missions are mostly broken at present. They might patch them again, but right now only about 75% of them work as intended. The pathing is poorly coded and there are too many random objects that only confuse the AI even more. Occasionally you will get a big piece of ship debris and it will cause the AI's ship you are escorting to start moving forwards and backwards, over and over, in a loop. You can abandon missions at any time, so when it does break, it's easy enough to just forget it and move on.So, those are my main frustrations. Otherwise this is a great game and is easily the best space game on Steam right now. It's definitely better than Elite Dangerous, plus it's only twenty bucks. I got this on sale for $13, and for that price, it's a major bargain. If you are looking for trade simulation or a long-term sandbox mode you can play in after the (approximately) 25 hour storymode is over, this might not be the best game for that. I got over 30 hours out of it and that was definitely worth $20 to me, but your mileage may vary.			"

												2.5D game with good looks and great gameplay. Even though you can skip the story completely it guarantees you at least 20 hours of gameplay just to finish the story mode, thus the ships and upgrades you can work your way to buy.As many other ""space sims"" out there you can spend time mining, trading, doing mercenary work and questing. It's all about finding what's best for you. There are ships to fit your needs and you can always improve them. Reminds me a lot of Endless Sky and Freelancer but with better graphics and fancy effects.The soundtrack leaves me speechless and the game gives you the ability to add your own songs into the soundtrack so you can listen to your own music while playing. Realism is not the main factor here but this game sure is really fun! 10/10, waiting for a faction revamp DLC.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a rather 2D depiction of space travel and combat with limited gameplay options. However, the game is nice looking and the slow grind to earn money makes upgrading your ship feel great. Getting larger and larger ships as the game progresses feels good but the grind is almost too repetitive. There is also a market that seems a little out of place for the ""space cowboy"" vibe this game usually has. The main campaign is short lived and feels rather pointless by the end. All in all this is a good game to play if you just want to play something mindlessly. A good pick up if its on sale. Fun but not memorable.			"

												Made by two guys, and you can really see where that is obvious. Lots of cutbacks. For example a male cruiser pilot will suddenly turn female on the comms and ai is shared a lot, meaning a pirate will get interdicted by friendly merchants guild ships who have the exact same ships and exact same all-female captains as the miltia does. Lots of shared and samey stuff.Nevertheless, you can also see where those savings went. Very few bugs, cool aesthetic and with the awesome feature to add your own music even for different situations. This is a super easy to learn, fun space shmup where all to a surprisingly kicking vanilla soundtrack (seriously, check it out on YT if you like space westerns) The gameplay is a little repetitive, but getting bigger and bigger ships is just so satisfying.For this price? I haven't had this much fun in ages. Hope for an improved sequel someday. 7/10.			"

												Classic Naval Broadside Cannon Combat IN SPACE!This game is a ton of fun, from the moment you start you literally can do anything you want. Whether it be bounty hunting, mining, protecting, exploring. Everything is right there, right away. It's simple with it being on a flat plane (meaning you can't fly up and down, instead you go left, right, and straight). Surprisingly it doesn't take to much away from the game. Combat is fast paced and their is a varity of ships to face, from small fighters to capital ships. Some of your weapons crush small fighters but won't even scratch the paint job against the capital ships. There is plenty of upgrades for your ships and the best part is when you buy a new ship, you don't have to rebuy everything as it swaps out the ship but keeps the equipment and automatically sells the old ship (so if you're a tad short on money it'll do an exchange where it sells your ship first then buys the new ship making it pretty seemless to purchase new things). The sounds are pretty good in the game, I really can't complain. Especially when you hit warp. The voice acting is above average for a game of this production size.All in all, if you like space, I'd have to recommend this game. I got this game when it was $9.99 and to be honest, it would be worth it at $20.00 hands down.			"

There are plenty of spacesims where you can hull contraband to get this type of gameplay if youre looking for it.

												There is something incredibly satisfying in aligning your ship alongside another and unleashing every single broadside cannon you have. In combination with the incredible music giving every fight you take a Wild West spin; you truly are on the lawless outskirts of space. You start with nothing and climb all the way to the top in any way you want. Trader, Miner, Mercenary, Pirate. Just be careful who you make enemies with, anything goes in this game.On the subject of trading, Rebel Galaxy contains a simple yet effective trading system with market values that will change in response to local events. Discover trade routes from station to station, capitalise on resource shortages, a station currently being blockaded will be in desperate need of supplies.When you feel strong enough, use a jump gate to travel to one of the many other systems. Make sure you are prepared though; higher risk brings higher reward but you won’t be smiling facing a Dreadnought class ship armed to the teeth. This game stands out as one of its quirks is that it is locked on a 2D plane, honestly I think this brings its benefits. You're at the helm of a capital ship, you wouldn't be doing amazing tricks. It also simplifies the controls, meaning you can focus less on keeping the ship level and more on the actual fight. Just listen to the soundtrack, it completes this game.

												In rebel galaxy you will find yourself on the edges of civilised space, space stations placed anywhere from the hollowed out husk of a mighty asteroid to in orbit around colossal gas giants will be a sight for sore eyes as you pilot your ship into the awaiting docks, the repair bay will offer you a chance to repair the fractured hull, weapons ranging from ionised bursts of plasma to mighty missle batteries having punched through the shield and torn through the hull damaging systems as well as your own weapons, handing over an adequate sum of currency to the shipwright. You may choose to offload cargo, either acquired via the mission board (cargo needs to get around somehow), trade with a cargo vessel you pulled out of the fire as pirates attempted to 'appropriate' its cargo or from the ruined husks of the pirate vessels themselves (maybe even the trader too if you're so inclined)Maybe you're looking for a job? or perhaps to finish one, handing over the agreed upon cargo for a sum of credits, hitting up the mission board to pick out a slew of quests to keep yourself busy as you trek across the system taking on a notorious pirate here, guarding a mining outpost there or perhaps assisting the militia forces take on a pirate convoy, headed by a mighty command ship; there are no shortage of things people want done.And after all that there's the bar, where you could chat up the tender, asking for news he might be partial to, whether it be as simple as an excalation of pirate activity in the sector, or perhaps that one of the stations in the system are going through some rough times, that being said no one pays more for food than those who need it and where there is demand, there is supply, but whether or not you're the one to supply said goods is up to you.Or perhaps you're looking for bounties? Slip the barkeep a couple hunded credits and suddenly you've got the locations to a few people someone out there wants dead, and are willing to pay for it.At the bar you might also meet a merc, spend a couple thousand on a good pilot to watch your back, this section of the galaxy is after all 'mostly' lawless space.Your visit done, you return to your ship, maybe spend a few thousand credits on an enhanced engine, thicker hull plating or better weapons, maybe even a few new tools to help you along the way, making your weapons deadlier, your aim sharper and those pirate scum a little less threatening.Whether you want to take to the stars as space trader extraordinare, feared bounty hunter, humble asteroid miner or parhaps cutthroat pirate, (Perhaps a mix of all four?) Rebel Galaxy can certainly accomodate.{Serious stuff out of the way, I caught a pirate group harassing a salvage crew harvesting the wreck of a giant (at least 12 times the size of my current ship) capital vessel (which you can TOTALLY get later) caught in the midst of a minefield, I noticed a cluster of mines near the enemy vessel on and ended up taking a shot at the explosives, which like a chain reaction of epic preportions exploded (As 'explosives' tend to do) taking out the pirate in a single shot, moments like that is what this game provides, if any of this review sounds like something you'd enjoy than I wholeheartedly recommend Rebel Galaxy.}			"

												This game is ridiculously good. It has a wonderful soundtrack, beautiful graphics, good voice acting, and really fun missions. I've become immersed in the world and have done a massive amount of side missions, because even though the side missions aren't part of the story, they are a wonderful part of the game and massively fun to do. The combat is also sometimes really intense and sometimes it is better to run than to fight. You have the choice to do whichever you wish as long as you get the job done. It is a nice game and I highly suggest you buy it. :)			"

												This game fills a void in the market: accessible (arcadey) freelancer-esque open-world space game. That was a mouthful.I'm completely enamoured with this game right now. It has fun naval-style combat (complete with broadside cannons), upgrades to buy, ships to save up for, and space pirates to blow up. It feels good, it looks good, and it's a boat load of fun.However, I'm worried that the game's content will come up a bit thin. The missions can get repetitive very quickly, and there is a lot of repetitive action going on with a very thin reward and upgrade structure. I'm only 7 or so hours in, so time will tell if the depth opens up later on.I hope the devs continue to build on to this and flesh it out in the future. As it is, it's a good game. But It could be a lot better too. "

												Intial thoughts and ramblings from a browncoat...  Well played, sir, well played...  While brief, the intro has all the feel of a Firefly episode.  It gets straight to the point in a no frills sort of way.  Definitely hits the nostalgia right between the eyes.  The music genre and selection is a nice touch.  I am enjoying the story line so far.  The credit grind outside the story line can get a little tedious after a while, but if pays to have a 500k credit nest egg when you leave the first sector.  These aren't your Han Solo type of characters that you are working with in the storyline...  More like the type that Jabba feeds to the sarlaac.  Even the good guys are more of a shade of grey.  Outside of you (depending on your game play,) I have yet to encounter one white knight in the story.The chat option selected does not appear to have any bearing on the storyline.  You still go to all the same story line misisons.  (Even the AAA titles have yet to get this figured out, so I am not going to knock this game for it.)The controls are a bit different than what I am used to, but seem easy enough to adapt to.  Can't tell you how many times I have absent mindedly fired missiles when I was first starting out.  The militia don't like it when you do that.For those new to the game like I am, I suggest immediately running off the beaten path and trade between the stations.  Mining isn't all that practical, but the Mk2 Mining laser makes a great anti fighter platform.  You will need the credits for much needed upgrades.  Only buy stuff with red list prices and sell in places where the price turns green.  Taking missions off of the terminal always has a welcoming party near or at the end point waiting to kill you.  You can hire one wingman to bump up your overall firepower.  Freelancer players will take to this game very quickly.  This game rewards caution.  If you charge blindly into a situation you will get smoked.  Sure you can configure your ship to knife fight, but a handful of ships will still mug you if you are not careful.  I found upgrading your engines, booster, shields, armor, and weapons in that order was the best option at increasing your survival rate.Friendly fire isn't.  The AI ships will go after each other.  If you get between them both sides will shoot you.  If you find yourself looking at a militia destroyer parking itself between you and a pirate, stop firing at the pirate.  You will only end up shooting the militia destroyer, lose massive rep with the militia, and all the militia in the area will start shooting at you.  Your starting corvette is barely able to fight its way out of wet paper sack at the beginning of the game.  Rep plays a part in this game.  Outside the obvious rep for merchants, criminals, and militia, it is hard to tell how rep really plays out in this game.  Join a guild if you want to get your hands on unique ship hulls.  Getting the criminal factions to like you is harder than you think.  Missions from the stations are the easiest to gain rep, but even that is difficult if you are trying to avoid♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off.  (Yea, you got the criminals to like you.  Now the militia hates your guts...  and they have the strongest ships and in greater numbers in the starting sector.)Right out of the gate, I see a a couple of obvious areas needing improvement.1: The multi-function of the 'E' key can be a bit annoying at times.  You are trying to tractor an item and accidently engage the warp drive because you were out of tractor range.  Docking with stations can run into this problem as well.2: The lack of full 360 degree flight seems a bit odd in this day and age of fully capable space sims.  Those with the expectation of free flight along all axis will by put off by this.  It would be nice if they open up the y axis.  Your enemies and asteroids get to use the y axis, but you don't.  The station placement can cause problems when you leave the area.  Found myself autodocking when I just wanted to leave to the next station.  Probably my biggest gripe of the game so far.3: If you aren't aware of the tutorial help section, the pop up hints and help tend to come up in a manner of oh now you tell me.I will add to this as I rack up more playing time.  At any rate, it is a fun game for less than $20.			"

												2.5D game with good looks and great gameplay. Even though you can skip the story completely it guarantees you at least 20 hours of gameplay just to finish the story mode, thus the ships and upgrades you can work your way to buy.As many other ""space sims"" out there you can spend time mining, trading, doing mercenary work and questing. It's all about finding what's best for you. There are ships to fit your needs and you can always improve them. Reminds me a lot of Endless Sky and Freelancer but with better graphics and fancy effects.The soundtrack leaves me speechless and the game gives you the ability to add your own songs into the soundtrack so you can listen to your own music while playing. Realism is not the main factor here but this game sure is really fun! 10/10, waiting for a faction revamp DLC.			"

												So I bought this game on a drunken whim because I really really really liked the music, here's me first couple hours with it:>Start out as a humble smuggler, mostly sticking to commodities and mining, money is flowing, the booze does too.>No Idea what the heck is happening around me, explosions and lasers bloody everywhere, but I somehow keep coming out more or less unscathed. Must be Liquor Luck.>Getting a taste for higher-tier ships, need more money badly, but don't wanna resort to illegal activites.>Couple more hours of drinking and smuggling.>Regular goods just don't cut it anymore, so out the window morals go, let's become a drug trafficking, war-mongering space slaver. Heck yeah.>Am I flying two ships now or is it the booze?>Feeling invincible with my new bomb♥♥♥♥♥combate frigate.>Haven't died so far, game seems to always just create the illusion of danger.>Keeping that in mind, I tell a milia warship with heavy escort to go suck some cold space, anticipating nothing to happen because of comfort zone game design.>Getting blown to smithereens before I can say ""Skazzer"".10/10 Traded my Live Organs for some more Greel Whiskey.Side note: As of this review I've been playing this game without break (13.5 hrs).Thanks Double Damage.

												Short : its like elite-freelancer with more soul (firefly like) on 2D plane with different combat mechanics.Overall i realy like the game, below in points:1-Very nice mood. Its really got that Firefly mood. Teh galaxy is alive, plenty of events that affect the game (for example a holiday wiht gifts custom on a planet means certain items will have very high price etc ), you can get tips from bartendes, hire mercenraies, help traders under attack and get rewards from them etc. I liked Elite but tough beatifull, it felt a bit sterile and souless to me. Here i love it,The music is quite unusual for this type of game, inmstead of electronic trance-ambient you got hard rocking blues. I love it, tough if you dont dig rock/blues might a problem.2- Open end game. Follow the story or just take missions, bounty hunt trade, whatever you like. Plenty of ships and upgrades.3-Ship control is unusual. It looks 3d but in truth is a 2d plane.You got a third person view , Eve online like, but you must aim in combat.4-Combat: its quite unusual and initially i was disspointed by it , i yearned for full 3d and standard cockpit view. But at some point something clicked  and i began to really like it.Its broadside based,  you can aslo control turrets.5- The graphics are nice, and i ahvent run into many bugs (i think i crashed once)If you are past Privateer/Elite/Freelancer fan, i think you should enjoy it very much, tough i recommend wathing vids to see the unusual ship control/combat in action.

												The game has it's annoyances and it's definitely not perfect, but I enjoyed it. People keep talking Freelancer this and Freelancer that, but it reminds of the original Privateer, which is a personal favorite of mine. Again, it's not perfect and it's grindy. You can read all the problems in other people's reviews. I wish there was more to it and more to come, which means I like it. It takes me back to the days when I was playing the old DOS version of Privateer. If that's your jam and you don't mind wasting some time grinding then this works.			"

												Disclosure: I received the key from the devs a few days before release.Pros:-Amazing interface that works perfectly with both Mouse+Keyboard and gamepads.-Easy to follow Video+text tutorials simmilar to those in Deus Ex Human revolution.-Addictive combat on a 2D plane but with a twist: fighters and gunships evade fire in 3D, which opens up more room for specialized weapons. (and the developers capitalized on that fact)-Everything is voiceacted. And it's good :)-Progression is slow but steady. It will take you dozens of hours to get the best ship & gear but since you constantly advance a weapon turret here and a subsystem there it will feel a lot less grindy.-Progression is completely open and the campaign reacts to your behaviour (so, if you choose to be a pirate it just works!)-You can mix your on audio files to the soundtrack collection and even differentiate Combat, Station, Ambient and other types of music usage.Cons:-I would have really loved this to be a $40+ title with even more ships, factions and better skyboxes. (then again, I was convinced this game would be $30 AT LEAST, so it's still amazing)-I wish it had multiplayer			"

												It's Freelancer (A Flawed gem that I spent uncountable hours playing back in the day), only better thought out (and you fly Capital ships), lots of Firefly injected into it's veins, and Yes, Blues Saraceno belting out some tunes. That's a reccomendation folks!For those who have never played Freelancer:  In a nutshell, Freelancer was an open ended Space Combat/Economic sim made back in 2003, It was pretty much about making money, legally or illegally and exploring the universe. The cool thing about it is that you had different factions that reacted differently to what you did, for example, raiding cargo ships makes you unpopular with Police and Corporations, while Bounty Hunting made you unpopular with Criminals. (Also for those complaining about you moving in ""2D only"" Lets be honest, ""Up and down"" axis was purpouseflully not really used much in Freelancer either)			"

												Enemy levels up when you add items to your ship. This breaks the game.There is no point in getting a better ship or better weapons and items if the battles are just the same anyway.I had to find this out the hard way when I installed some systems that made the value of my ship go up. And then the enemies everywhere instantly got better weapon. Because that doesn't break immersion right?You can basically control the enemy difficulty by NOT putting stuff on your ship.It's a real shame too because everything else in this game is great.			"

												Combat is shallow, boring, repetitive and easy. The progression for the equipment curve is bizarre, everything almost doubles with the upgraded versions (weapon damage, shields etc.) Feels weird equipping your first next level equipment that basically obseletes your other weaponryTrading UI is a pain to use to find the information you want. Tractoring specific items is also an issue.The trading is made more interesting with random events affecting prices one way or the other. It was fun for a while running embargo blockades for the big $$.In this game an asteroid field is 5 rocks and a tin can, a nebula is a few puffs of smoke. All that really changes is the system backgrounds.All the stations are basically the same. There's not much personality in this game.Hailing system is half-done e.g. hail someone emitting a distress signal, and they'll tell you they don't need any help with anything, until you close your distance a certain amount.Someone offers to give up in a fight, and you reject it? Can't push them for more credits, or even take their original offer.You are free to warp in any direction, but you will be pulled out of warp near any object and don't have any direct control over your speed (fields and other environments are probably so small in size and barebones, so you don't get caught in them warping)This leaves all the systems without much structure. If you want to go to a station across the map, just point your ship and go. Maybe you'll warp right through a miniature junk field without hitting anything and get a 20 credit exploration bonus (equipment is in the thousands, I don't know why this is a thing?)Another fun feature with warp is occasionally you'll want to catch a special ship/s that comes up on the system map. You warp to them, and the game will match your warps so you're in formation, instead of letting you blast past and cancel their warp.Also, game says ""warp cancelled by stellar mass"" every time you're pulled out of warp, regardless of what caused it. Come on guys.If you're after something like Freelancer or even something like Pirates! I wouldn't bother			"

												Fresh and simple, this game manages to create the feeling of an enormous, dynamic Freelancer-style sandbox with fantastically simple arcade-style controls.  Easily one of the most intuitive games I've ever played, and one of the prettiest (and in light of that, one of the best optimised too - running far better than games with lower requirements and looking better than some with higher requirements too).  This game feels a lot like Diablo II, perhaps unsurprisingly since those games are amongst the staggering pedigree of the team of TWO core developers.   The two games on Steam that seem closest to it in aesthetics and playstyle would be, I think, Starpoint Gemini 2 and Drifter.  I've got both and after 1 hour on Rebel Galaxy I already know I'm going to spend much more time on this than the other two.  It is far simpler to pick up and have fun with than Starpoint Gemini 2 - a real sense of instant fun and adventure - and it's significantly more polished and deep than Drifter, as well as being much prettier.My only gripe with the game is that all the action takes place in a plane as opposed to having real 3D movement.  You can't pitch your ship up or down.  Hardly game-breaking, and I suppose it's true that the vast majority of real star systems are organised in a plane, but they are far from 2-dimensional from the point of view of a human space-ship!Don't expect an X-series experience.  This game is much closer to classics like Freelancer and Tachyon: The Fringe.  It's not shallow, but it's certainly not ""spreadsheets in space"" either.			"

												I bought this in a previous 50% sale and would say that at this price it is definitely worth it, however after having now played it for 30+ hours (and finding it hard to put it down each time) I think I would have paid full price too!As many reviews have already stated this game is like the love child of Sid Meier's Pirates and Freelancer, it's neither one or the other but has emulated some of the features from both games and merged these into an interesting hybrid. The 2D naval style fighting makes it less complicated than a 3D counterpart but don\'t let that fool you that it's less of a challenge. The variety of ships, weapons and modules give it enough diversity to keep you playing for that next upgrade but without bombarding you with sheets of complicated stats. The soundtrack isn't going to be everyone\'s taste but I think it's awesome and really suits the pace of the game.Yes it's a bit clichéd, the main story is short and it's quite simplified compared to others in the genre but that's the beauty of it - it isn't trying to copy a successful franchise and then failing miserably; it has it's own spin on space rpg that's different whilst being familiar at the same time.Edit: Removed typos caused by mobile app			"

												A short learning curve, but the games throws you into the action fast in a universe where you can't count on everthing you run into to be 'in your league'. After getting smoked A LOT, I learned how to judge fights quickly and get away if I stepped in something too deep. Looking forward to seeing if the trade system gets deep, but just as a shooter it's great.First, it's 2D space, if that isn't obvious from the videos- but there's good reason for it. INstead of traditional 'chase them and try to shoot their♥♥♥♥♥ style dogfighting, it's battleship style broadside combat with an interesting fighter/gunnery system where your turrets can be set to auto or manually controlled as needed.Loving this game. Recommend a gamepad, I use an Xbox 360 controller. Tons of fun with it, and the controls are well mapped (although I find myself constantly forgetting about where to find what I need between the Start menu and Y meu)			"

												The simplest way to describe it is Naval Space Western Game.You travel around in outer space, doing missions, fighting space pirates, buying and selling stuffs from planet to planet. But I won't call this space sim in the sense of freelancer or X series! You actually only travel in one plane. there's no vertical movement. And you're not flying a dinky fighter. You're flying something bigger than that, a frigate or gunship at least. Which fight with broadsides. Why? Because space is an ocean. It's Naval Space.Why western? Because it's a space western game as well. Just check the trailer and absorb the music and aesthetics.In other word, weird but cool game.			"

												Charming, if limited, arcade game written by the creator of Torchlight.Whilst it really isn't anything special, Rebel Galaxy enjoys a level of charm not often seen in the modern gaming world. From the sci-fi western setting to the naval-esque space combat, Rebel Galaxy takes a lot of smart-but-simple game mechanics and throws them together in one thoroughly enjoyable and deceptivel moreish space romp.Whilst it will feel familiar to both fans of games such as the X series as well as hardened ARPG players, both will see where the limits shine: from the limited dimensions of space combat to the under-developed item metagame, Rebel Galaxy is very much a jack of many (if not all) trades, but a master of none.

												Wasn't paid for my review.  Let's get that out there in the open.  *pushes beer under his bed with his feet, all slick-like*AHEMThe game is a prettier, more entertaining version of Space Rangers.  You can choose to slay pirates, trade comodities, or mine your way into a larger, faster, more powerful ship all pimped out with the latest murder gadgets ranging from flak guns to missle turrets.  Broadside firing is a nice plus in the middle of battle while all the other guns are auto targeting.  Lots and lots of fun.Pros:+Lots of upgrades+Lots of stuff to explore/hack/kill+Space is beautiful and makes me wee nips perky+Tons of missions+Lots of ship variations (Though I'm limited on what I can see this early in)+Battles need finger dex and quick reflexes when against more powerful ships (I'm assuming controller is easier)+Character models are pretty cool+Warp auto disables when you get to target, so no need for timed disengages+Customize firing/targeting for auto-turrets as you move into a good firing position for broadside+Battles can be rather long, but hella enjoyable when you beat out capital ships with crappy weapons/armor+Love the western-rock music vibeCons:-Missions are the samethings over and over-Autosaving only kicks in when you dock, so DOCK OFTEN or exit to force autosave-Warps disengaging due to pirate ambushes are no bueno early in game-Warps disengaging in mine fields is no bueno-Warps disengaging in electrical storms is no bueno-Warps disengaging in astroid belts is no bueno-Auto plotting courses would be nifty-Dev is buying reviews with early access codes all illuminati-like-Didn't come with beerI give the game 5 Landsharks out of a 6 pack			"

												I really want to like this game because I love the whole Firefly thing it has going on. There are definitely things to like about it, but it ultimately is just a very boring space sim with a kinda lousy battle system IMO.Turn-ons:+Firefly!+Soundtrack is great!+NPCs are marvelous!Turn-offs:--The broadside combat. I played the game for 3+ hours and fought a fair number of battles against pirates in that time. I even upgraded to better weapons and different types of weapons. But the combat just never started to feel good. Broadside combat is great with sea vessels because they are both sea vessels. But in this game your ship is confined to a flat plane while enemy ships are flying loops over you and under you as you try to lock onto them. It's more like trying to use a sluggish wooden sailing ship to engage in broadside combat with a bunch of airplanes and submarines. I'm not saying that it's impossible or anything, but I did find it really irritating and it did not start to get better.--It is very empty and boring. It has all of the things that space sims normally have, such as trading and merc missions and ships parts that can be upgraded and so on. But I put in several hours into this game and I spent most of that time staring at the butt of a ship flying in a straight line toward a mission destination. I seriously just set the controller down on my desk, folded my hands, and watched a picture of a space ship. For minutes. MINUTES ON END. I found out that I could upgrade all of my engines and boosters etc to get some more speed out of the ship, and I was feeling very positive about that at first, but then I realized I was STILL pretty much spending most of my time staring at the butt of a ship flying in a straight line. So much yawn.--The game seems heavily skewed toward playing as muscle. If you tend to lean a little more pacifist/trader in space sims, then this game does not seem very friendly towards those types. When I first started running missions, I initially was only accepting missions that the game explicitly labeled as VERY LOW RISK, which were usually just trading missions that asked me to go pick something up and bring it back or transport some cargo from A to B. But EVERY SINGLE ONE of these missions resulted in a scripted ambush attack from multiple pirate ships. Literally every time. So there's not really any point accepting the missions that pass themselves off as the pacifist types because this game shoves you into combat literally every time. Every mission is a combat mission. Always. Without fail. Or so this was my experience.--But did I mention how incredibly boring it is? This was really the thing that made me stop playing the most. Most of my time spent playing this game I did not feel like I was playing a game. I felt like I was staring at the butt of a ship that was doing nothing.And then it occurred to me that I could be playing a game that felt like doing things. So I'm done with it.I love the whole Firefly thing, and apparently lots of people think the game is just great, but man... I could not stay awake while playing this thing.			"

Product received for free
												Rebel Galaxy is a very casual space pilot ""simulator"", all combat is really handled in 2D and mostly resembles sea battles (broadside artillery, all ships except fighters manouver on the same ""height"") so if you're looking for a serious space-sim it's not for you.Gameplay consists of main storyline broken up by (a lot) of generated sidequests which get a bit boring after a while since there's only a few types (search and destroy, delivery, defend target, pick up object). Since main story quickly ramps up in difficulty you'll be grinding these quite a lot. Apart from sidequests you can also play as a trader, buying low and selling high, a miner selling resources found in asteroids, pirate hunter looking for bounties or a pirate hunting civillian ships.As you progress you will upgrade your ship with new weapons, shields and additional equipment, every once in a while buying a new ship.Pros:+ Enjoyable space combat (if you dont mind the sea battles feel).+ Plenty of ships/upgrades to work towards.+ Decent voice-acting (somewhat repetetive lines from enemies).+ Multiple ways to progress.+ Great musicCons:- Requires a lot of grinding sidequests to progress.- Not much depth or variety beyond the basics.

It feels like a rushed college project where the devs just wanted to get it turned in and get their passing grade.The lack of content, the lack of everything in this game makes it a grindfest and a pretty boring one at that. Seriously you could buy this game, play the 3 hours and 59min and get your refund, because the next 25+ hours are the exact same thing.Missions are ""Go here and kill everything"" - No real strategy involved other than don't get overrun. You can kite for days.Ship upgrades lack diversity.There's nothing else to do. You fly around galaxies that all feel the same, going from point A to point B, mining and trade are simplistic time wasters that try to add complexity but fails. "

												It seems ""Freelancer"" and ""Starfleet Command"" had a love child, then let ""Darkstar One"" raise it.  Everything about this game's vision makes me think it might be the chosen one.The arcade style exicution, lack of ship management options, and aparent focus on ""ACTION!!"" combat to the detriment of what makes a big ship space sim so engrosing make me second guess it's deification.For the momment it still holds my attention regardless of how shallow the combat has to be to sell to throngs of people in the mass marketing age (believe me, I get it, you don't want to make customers feel stupid.

												Not only is this game inspired by one of the single greatest television shows ever made, Firefly, but it also is one of the single greatest games ever made. It's combat mechanics are normal, yes, but they still feel new. If your playing on a mouse and keyboard, I highly recomend that you get some sort of controller. Trust me, the game gets at least 80% better with the smooth movements of a controller's anolog sticks.Other aspects of epicness include its BADASS style. the graphics, gameplay, and ESPECIALLY music compliment this games similarity to Firefly. The only difference being that there are aliens, its rock type music instead of pure country, and the combat is space based, as opposed to firefly's ground based combat.Speaking of music, it's amazing. It may have been made before this game came out, but its almost as if it was MADE for this thing. (link:

Rebel Galaxy: Fun but not Deep or WideShort version:Arcadey 3rd person space shooter.Simple plot with no twists or choices.Entertaining but repetitive combat system.Very basic ship customization.Context:I had just finished playing through Skyrim, a one-and-done game, and was looking for something completely different. Small scope, not fantasy, but a better role-playing experience. Because face it: trying to role play in Skyrim is just silly. What I found in Rebel Galaxy was a refreshing change of pace with no commitments.Experience:Starting out it really reminded me of Privateer crossed with Earth & Beyond. Loved the former and wanted to love the latter. I tried to role play (I wanted to be a bloodthirsty pirate) but the pirates weren't welcoming and money was tight so I went with Merchant and Mercenary after my first save game corrupted. For a little while I tried to get into the ""events"" and trading but the simple math of the game finally proved itself out. Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. Kill, kill, kill. Mission, mission, mission. Click through the conversation trees because nothing they're saying matters a bit. Oh, final mission done.The music is really good at first - setting your mind in the ""Firefly"" wild west mentality. Then it gets a little repetitive. Rather like the same 6-8 talking heads. I never got bored enough to switch to custom music and I did find myself humming some of the tunes at work.Gameplay:For a few hours the non-combat mechanics are worth exploring. Mine some asteroids. Jump from station to station moving commodities. Shop the mercenaries. Experience the array of 6-8 mission types. It didn't take long to get a handle on deciding what's worth it in risk vs. reward - factoring in time, of course. These mechanics quickly lose relevance.Combat mechanics are pretty simple. Load your ship with the best turrets you can (in a variety that suits you), a broadside that you can maneuver well enough to bring to bear, and over-level your shields and hull first. Roll into the fight and sweep them if you can. Run away if you can't.One small gripe is the extremely shallow pool that is the ship customization. The hull I was in never really seemed special (it's just ports, turrets, and cargo space). And I felt just as effective in my tier-6 armed Destroyer as I was in my tier-6 armed Dreadnaught. But, with the system as simple as it was, I enjoyed not needing a spreadsheet or helper tool to deck out my ride.And my big gripe that kills this game for replayability: no choices. I ran a straight line from beginning to end with some grinding (a lot, really, in the early game). No impact. No changes. The galaxy just rolls along without the events making any real impact or change. The story is alright but predictable. I was relieved when I saw the end of it.One and done.

												The best way to describe this game, I think, is to imagine a simplified Freelancer that doesn't take itself nearly as seriously. It has this sort of disjointed western-slash-Caribbean pirate theme to it that works brilliantly in its favor, lending a much needed injection of comic-book stylization to the genre of space trade & combat sim. The voice acting is good enough not to be grating or distracting, which is great. What's a little less great (but maybe not by a lot) is the two-dimensional flight. Again, simplified. A 6DOF shooter, this is not. If you can do naval combat, you will probably do fine here. To me, this makes the game feel a little strange, not being able to fly up or down in space. But not a deal breaker. The soundtrack is very fun and unique, but some of the tracks end up sounding a little same-y after a few hours. Gameplay pacing moves about the same as Freelancer, so if you enjoyed that title, you will probably feel justified in spending full price on this one. If you're expecting a fast-paced space shooter, maybe wait until it goes on sale.			"

												I'll Start off by saying the soundtrack is the best part, even if the number of tracks is rather limited the style and feel is great. They fit the lone horse/desperado theme really well and enhance the battles quite a bit. You can even load your own playlist and cruise around to your own tunes if you so choose.The gameplay itself is fun. Combat is slightly confusing at first until you make it through a few battles. then you realise that for the most part your craft is pretty automated and all you have to worry about are your big cannons. You can control the smaller turrets and missles if you want, but it's hardly necessary. To that end, the battles do tend to get a little repetative after a while.Finally, and this may be the only real negative, the missions quickly turn in to ""Start at point A, get to point B, blow ships up, return to point A, get money."" So it's rather repetative. I will say that I'm still not very far in the game at all (even after 11hrs. Lots of side missions), so this could very well change. I'll update my review if it does.All-in-all the game looks great, sounds great, and feels great. It gets a little grind-y, but it's still fun. Definitely worth the $20 price-tag.			"

												So far from my limited playtime, I can already tell it will be one of those ""I'm only playing it because I am bored"" type of games. Right from the get-go the menu does not use the mouse (it has some in-game menu use, but it is very buggy)...obvious console port. Overall I would say just wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.Gunplay: 4/10It is very annoying to shoot enemies with your broadside cannons because they lock on to targets, so you are not really aiming. Same with the turret and missiles. Sometimes the aiming redicle will lock up when trying to aim due to it trying to stick on to a different enemy. The gunplay just isn't fun.Graphics: 8/10The game looks nice, but at first glance it seems much older than 2015. Still, good or bad graphics don't determine a game's quality. Story: 7/10The story line is neat, but right from the start it gets predictable. Also, most missions are ""Hey, you! Go run over there and shoot something for me, thanks."" You go do the mission, return, and then do it all over again. Also, all stations are the same (not externally or main characters, but the generic character models and interior is all the same).			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a space trading and combat simulator that reminds me of Freelancer, but with bigger ships. In this game, you are a guy who gets a message from his Aunt Juno to take her old ship and fly to some station a long way from home to meet her. And guess what? She's not there. The story isn't as much the highest point of the game, but the gameplay and the galaxy you explore are phenominal. Gameplay is based around trading or fighting to upgrade or replace your ship in order to meet the increasing difficulty that comes with each new sector. While you might think you're pretty strong in your big, bada$$ ship with lasers and cannons galore that rips apart other ships like they're made of thin paper, every new sector you go to will smack you down and force you to realize that there are people out there that will eat you for breakfast, spit you out, and do it again for lunch. This spike in difficulty keeps the game fresh, as you don't get to feel like a demigod for very long, and if you want to stay feeling like a demigod, you have to actually work for it. The learning curve takes a while to get used to, but once you learn the basics, the game really opens up as you explore and fight your way through the galaxy fighting for pirates and outcasts for the good of the people, or robbing merchants and fighting the military because you can. Or, you can do what some AI who has downloaded inself into your ship's computer tells you to do and help it regain its memory.Overall, I give this a 9/10 for a extreamly challenging and sometimes punishing experience, and for bringing a fresh perspective to the world of space combat and trading sims. Now I have to go back to wondering how I will blow up that Dreadnought looming in the distance... and now I'm dead because missiles and lazers.			"

												After careful consideration, I can't recommend this game as it stands. It has a lot of potential, but due to various bugs and imbalances it fails to live up to that potential. The system it uses to classify mission difficulties is spotty (some very high risk missions are easy, while some low risk missions are very difficult). Escort missions are extremely buggy: escorts path back and forth regularly, they have almost no armor and NPCs don't have aggro tables AFAIK, if you engage personal warp for even a moment you immediately fail the escort. Some missions have you kill another faction's ships with no warning, so it's tricky to farm faction rep when a mercenary guild mission for 15 rep might have you killing merchant guild ships and losing 30 rep with them. On top this, it's extremely grindy. Get to a system, buy modules that are ~50% stronger than the ones you entered the system with, move to the next system since all the content in that system is obsolete now. Aside from the story, it's the same missions grinded over and over. ""Go here and kill these two groups of enemies"" ""Escort this trade prince to that station"" ""Take this cargo from point A to point B"". Honestly, this feels like a game that someone worked long and hard on, but then 80% of the way in they decided they needed to wrap it up ASAP and filled the last 20% with hollow, paper mache content. For the first 10 hours or so it was fun, but once you realize that it's just going to be the same recycled grind over and over it leaves you with a sinking feeling of ""why am I still doing this?""

												Followed this game during it's development and was intrigued by it's take on a navel-style broad side combat. I know some might want verticle access for combat but honestly, this game doesn't need it. If you're familiar with the ship combat in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag then you'll know exactly how this game plays. The game is packed full of side quests, your classic fetch, eliminate, gather and escort. Several factions exist and many are joinable, some at war with one another so there is a sense of choice but it's not very deep. There's plenty of freedom, being a pirate is entirely possible but expect resistence.The sound for this game is great, from the mechanical vibrations, rising whurrs and powerful sounding blasts, it all feels very appropriate to the space exploration theme. With a very firefly esque feel to the music, you get that space-cowboy feeling right off the bat. There's an option to add your own easily, if you prefer as well.People looking for an extremely rich story and lore, incredibly complex combat mechanics and deep reputation based faction reputation systems might be a little disappointed, Rebel Galaxy certainly has these things but they're light. Overall, this a great 20 hour game with outstanding sound, combat and just enough exploration and progress to keep you going to the end. I wish there was a little more to story and lore but overall, I can't explain. If you can grab it on sale, totally worth it.			"

												Shallow.On the surface this game is fantastic. I want to love it. The soundtrack makes you feel like a space cowboy right at the main menu. The designs manage to sell you on this gritty space society without feeling messy or cluttered. The gameplay premiss seems like a fresh twist on a working concept... and here things fall apart.It has an interesting idea of broadside combat in a freelancer type space sim, but it fails to achieve either. Whatever there is to master in this game is mastered in under an hour, and it basically comes down to ""have bigger guns and better shields"". Any fancy manouvers will only give the enemy time to recharge their shields or let them turn their undamaged sides towards you. Just fly up and hammer them harder while your turrets autoshoot any fighters. After that you just repeat the same interactions over and over to earn cash towards upgrades that add +stat% . You can feel safe taking any mission that has a danger rating you've dealt with before, because they scale with you and nothing ever changes.Even more dissapointing is the fact that there is virtually no point or reason to fight or do missions as it's slow and tedious, forcing you to cover large distances of empty space. Just find the trade route that is currently most profitable per minute and fly it back and forth until it drains to make atleast 10x in an hour what you could have gotten from missions during the same time. This way you'll never make enemies either!Also, dont buy anything but cargo or cargospace boosts.♥♥♥♥♥♥is super expensive and serves no point. You basically don't have to fight ever if your goal is to become the biggest bad♥♥♥♥♥in space. Some light shields and an engine will do fine! Any investments in your ship will just take money away from buying up expensive cargo. Then, when you made all the money there is to make from trade runs where you interact with absolutely no one... buy the most expensive♥♥♥♥♥♥you can find. Voila! You are now the best at this game and nothing can hurt you!The best part? Maybe you got a bit eager and there was more money to be made? Bigger ships to be found? Better guns? And now all you trading captial is gone? NO PROBLEM! Just sell all your ship parts AT COST and become a peacful trader again. You could just do this at any point when you wanted to actually kill something. You never have to feel invested in anything! Choices have no consequence or impact. Life is great in space! Except for all that emptyness and boredom you will feel. They really captured that part... "

												I'm addicted.........That being said. This game is AWESOME. I'd of reviewed it sooner cause I instantly fell in love, but I've been unable to peel my eyes away. Every free minute I get on the PC, I'm playing this.It's a great semi-casual game that compares a lot to FTL in it's rougeness, and as far as combat and missions go it seems to take a lot away from EVE Online. There are other comparisons but these stand out the most. The missions and combat have managed to keep me just on my toes enough every time I start to open my mouth to say ""This is getting repetitive."" I get put in my place by some new tactic a higher level enemy is using. There is a bit of story line to the game, but It's there more to keep your compass from spinning as you progress than it to make the game linear. You could play for hours and hours and never touch the main mission and not get bored.I really can't think of much bad to say about this game. One downside that comes to mind is warp times can seem a bit long after you've been doing a lot of hopping around, but it's really not so bad as there are ways to negate it. Also, aiming with turrets at small targets can be a nuisance if they start maneuvering above or below you.Other than, a well spent 20 bucks. I've paid $40+ for a lot less entertaining crapware. If you enjoy Spacey, shiny thing. Get this damn game! You won't regret it.			"

												Not only is this game inspired by one of the single greatest television shows ever made, Firefly, but it also is one of the single greatest games ever made. It's combat mechanics are normal, yes, but they still feel new. If your playing on a mouse and keyboard, I highly recomend that you get some sort of controller. Trust me, the game gets at least 80% better with the smooth movements of a controller's anolog sticks.Other aspects of epicness include its BADASS style. the graphics, gameplay, and ESPECIALLY music compliment this games similarity to Firefly. The only difference being that there are aliens, its rock type music instead of pure country, and the combat is space based, as opposed to firefly's ground based combat.Speaking of music, it's amazing. It may have been made before this game came out, but its almost as if it was MADE for this thing. (link:

												I bought the game hoping it would be like freelancer only improved. I was disappointed.This game has a ton of potential but the storyline is horrendously under-developed, there are just 3 mission templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort) which makes the game feel repetitive and much of a grind after about 5 hours into the game.The different game areas are largely the same, each area/star system is just a slightly different layout with a random number of stations and varied difficulty zone rating.The mining and trading mechanics of this game just plain suck which really forces you to only do missions. The game really needs some sort of crafting feature for mining and/or trading to be worth the hassle.This is such a shame because the game has so much potential to be everything freelancer was. But instead all we got was a super cut down version of freelancer with updated graphics.			"

												Boring and buggy as hell. You are going to die a lot, and it's not because the little fighters have more firepower than you, but because of atmosphere that will destroy your ship in the middle of space, or some 20 clicks from a moon, yes a moon, smaller than your ship, and destroys you with its atmosphere. Or because of Militia suddenly turning on you and killing you with 20 ships as soon as you've completed the mission to help them rid of pirates, etc... etc...It is a nicely presented game with noobish bugs and ideas. Also the game was designed for a console and it plays like this on the PC too. Pretty annoying! The camera which is changing view randomly as it feels the need, and not letting you decide what you want to see on the screen is a hell to work with. The story is boring, the missions are repetitive, and all of the same sort. You basically almost have to fight or run, no matter what mission is it. The guilds are just an extension of the mission system, and nothing else. All in all, this game, if expanded upon, would be great, but it looks like it's unfinished, with development cut short before major features were added.			"

												It looked fun at first, but I got sick of it very quickly. The manually targeted weapon that your ship has is utterly useless compared to the autoaiming laser turrets you can get - or even the mining laser. Missiles are completely useless. Buying the best available shield is relatively cheap and makes you basicly invulnerable in 80% of the encounters, while the other 20% swarm you with so much enemies that no equipment will save you anyway. The threat assesment that is given with each mission is completely unrelated to reality too - that random swarm that kills you can just as well come from a low risk mission (or it may be an independent random spawn close to the mission location).The autosave feature in this game is the worst - it only saves when you dock. It is really annoying to have to dock all the time instead of doing 4-5 missions at once, just because of the risk that some encouter would be too hard. No manual saves.There was also one random ""save compression error"" followed by a crash that returned me 2 docks back.			"

												I'll Start off by saying the soundtrack is the best part, even if the number of tracks is rather limited the style and feel is great. They fit the lone horse/desperado theme really well and enhance the battles quite a bit. You can even load your own playlist and cruise around to your own tunes if you so choose.The gameplay itself is fun. Combat is slightly confusing at first until you make it through a few battles. then you realise that for the most part your craft is pretty automated and all you have to worry about are your big cannons. You can control the smaller turrets and missles if you want, but it's hardly necessary. To that end, the battles do tend to get a little repetative after a while.Finally, and this may be the only real negative, the missions quickly turn in to ""Start at point A, get to point B, blow ships up, return to point A, get money."" So it's rather repetative. I will say that I'm still not very far in the game at all (even after 11hrs. Lots of side missions), so this could very well change. I'll update my review if it does.All-in-all the game looks great, sounds great, and feels great. It gets a little grind-y, but it's still fun. Definitely worth the $20 price-tag.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a space trading and combat simulator that reminds me of Freelancer, but with bigger ships. In this game, you are a guy who gets a message from his Aunt Juno to take her old ship and fly to some station a long way from home to meet her. And guess what? She's not there. The story isn't as much the highest point of the game, but the gameplay and the galaxy you explore are phenominal. Gameplay is based around trading or fighting to upgrade or replace your ship in order to meet the increasing difficulty that comes with each new sector. While you might think you're pretty strong in your big, bada$$ ship with lasers and cannons galore that rips apart other ships like they're made of thin paper, every new sector you go to will smack you down and force you to realize that there are people out there that will eat you for breakfast, spit you out, and do it again for lunch. This spike in difficulty keeps the game fresh, as you don't get to feel like a demigod for very long, and if you want to stay feeling like a demigod, you have to actually work for it. The learning curve takes a while to get used to, but once you learn the basics, the game really opens up as you explore and fight your way through the galaxy fighting for pirates and outcasts for the good of the people, or robbing merchants and fighting the military because you can. Or, you can do what some AI who has downloaded inself into your ship's computer tells you to do and help it regain its memory.Overall, I give this a 9/10 for a extreamly challenging and sometimes punishing experience, and for bringing a fresh perspective to the world of space combat and trading sims. Now I have to go back to wondering how I will blow up that Dreadnought looming in the distance... and now I'm dead because missiles and lazers.			"

												Action games set in space tend to, at least from my point of view, fall into two categories; simulation heavy or too arcadey. As someone with an interest in space games, I’ve been after a game that falls somewhere in the middle of this spectrum while leaning towards the arcadey side, but such a balance is a pipe dream. Having pages of complex mechanics takes away the fun and asks me to resemble more of an actual space captain, but having too little makes me feel like I’m not in a space opera and more of a space spaghetti western. Rebel Galaxy may lean strongly on the arcade side of the spectrum, but for all of its options and customization choices when it comes to kitting out your ship, the strategy and tactical demand is downright non-existent, leaving my time in space feeling very lacking.Rebel Galaxy feels more like space cowboys rather than a wide, expansive space opera, and the soundtrack certainly helps bring that out. While other action games in space tend to play with 3D movement or have overhead tactical views, Rebel Galaxy has capital ships locked to a 2D axis while smaller gunships and fighters can buzz around in 3D. This may sound bizarre, but the combat has been built around this fact; it’s set up naval-style, as if ships were set on an ocean and not in space. The main source of firepower for both enemies and yourself will be the broadside cannons, side-mounted weaponry that can be charged up for better efficiency and accuracy. This results in capital ships jockeying for better position to unload their broadsides into opposition without receiving counter-fire of their own since a fully charged broadside volley will inflict heavy damage on shields and armor, nevermind tear gunships asunder. Your ship can also be equipped with turrets, secondary weapons like missiles or flak, and of course a variety of components and defensive measures which you will need if you want to survive later sectors. Combat will generally involve a handful of capital ships accompanied by a variety of fighters versus yourself, with the former also firing at you with their broadsides and whatever else they have. Your main strategy will likely be wiping out the fighters first before slipping behind capital ships to avoid their broadside fire - In fact this will likely be your only strategy through the whole entire game, unfortunately. Even with an assortment of different weapon types (lasers, energy launchers, mines, EMP, shield leechers, etc), buzzing in behind a ship to avoid being lit up by their main cannons can be a sure fire tactic if you can avoid other ships, although later on capital ships get incredible defensive upgrades that take a long time to whittle down. Ships have four stages of defense: Deflectors which can be drained to negate damage, shields that protect the armor plating on one of four sides of the ship, and finally the hull which is a ship’s ‘health’. While the combat is lacking in terms of strategy and tactics, the frantic nature of large skirmishes never fails to be great fun to take part in regardless of if it’s just you and a hired mercenary or if it’s happening upon the local militia coming to blows with pirates. The fun is typically drained however when you encounter a fleet of fighters on their own who will swarm you in moments, spamming turret and missile fire that drain your defenses faster than you can blink, or when you warp to a new sector only to discover that the enemies there make short work of your defenses and you have to warp back in order to upgrade.Speaking of upgrades, that’s where the vast majority of your money will be invested in - Better ways of blowing up people and better ways of keeping from blowing up. The archetypes to space game activities are combat, trade, mining, and missions, and these are all means of getting credits in Rebel Galaxy, although mining is a low payoff time-sink more than anything else. Destroying ships can result in dropped cargo or storage containers (glorified space treasure chests) full of loot, or a bounty reward if that ship is a wanted target. Cargo can be sold to traders or at stations through a simplified market system that fluctuates depending on activity in that sector, like armed conflicts requiring militaristic equipment or famine requiring foodstuffs to be delivered. Some enemy encounters will merit no reward whatsoever, ending up being a waste of deployable ammunition or money for repairs, but you can scan enemy ships to see if they’re carrying anything of value, you can just warp away when at a safe distance if they’re not (unless your engines are sabotaged by certain enemies). Missions will generally be the highest payout for credits, ranging from seek and destroy to cargo delivery, but near the final acts of the game upgrades and new ships cost an incredible amount. Near my final few hours I’d have to run two or three missions before being able to even consider trading my old turrets up for a better model, and even then the upgrade in damage isn’t all that spectacular. The most noticeable changes come in the form of your defenses, and as mentioned these are requirements regardless of the size and speed of your ship. Most of the time you’ll be saving up for a new warp drive since basic flight is far too slow, but even coming relatively close to any ships, asteroids or debris will pull your ship out of warp, often forcing you to boost through the location until you can safely activate warp again. This makes getting around needlessly annoying unless you plan a specific route to avoid any locations, but later on enemies can disrupt your warp out of nowhere to initiate combat even if your route is between safely accessible stations.There is a story to Rebel Galaxy and it’s serviceable at best, unsavory types are after an alien artifact, and your character needs to find out more about it. The story has you hopping from mission to mission which takes you to other sectors where the danger and rewards grow. The jump in difficulty tends to come from enemy ships being sturdier and harder hitting rather than the mission objectives themselves becoming more complicated and involved. It leaves the game feeling incredibly repetitive, which would be tolerable if the basic strategy for encounters wasn’t so simple and blunt. I did finish the game and even enjoyed myself for a majority of the time, but eventually the game became more of a dutiful march than an active desire to develop greater strategies in battle or examine the market closely to maximize my trading profits or to take on distant missions that require jumping to other sectors. With combat being the forefront of Rebel Galaxy’s campaign, most of its brains and staying power tends to fall flat. Any hopes of having a fleet of your own ships is also kneecapped since you’re restricted to one mercenary at a time, and despite being able to command them via pausing the game and scrolling down a menu (which is clunky and poorly executed), they tend to have a death wish and won’t get out of dodge when in danger - Namely when flying into a barrage of cannon fire instead of taking a safer route of attack.Rebel Galaxy may not have ended up scratching the space game itch I’ve been after, but it did give me around 33 hours of entertainment, with most of that being from side missions. It’s difficult for me to recommend the game unless you’re someone who is after a space game that leans heavily towards action and arcade-style gameplay with a lesser focus on the simulation side of things, but even then after multiple hours the gameplay begins to lack tactical value after using the same old silly routine of getting behind large ships and dumping all your weaponry into their backside. If more depth had been applied to the combat than I would give a definitive yes, but Rebel Galaxy ends up feeling far too simple-minded and dull in the end.			"

												This is a FUN game. Very Fun!   I keep looking for the single ultimate magic answer for my space game hunger.  The more games I try, the more clear it becomes: there is no answer - there are many different answers, each answering in a slightly different way.. and some answer better than others.  Rebel Galaxy is one Very Good answer!  I may not yet have spent quite as much time in this game as in some of my other favorites (X3AP, Rebirth, Evochron, Starsector, Endless Sky, SPG2, Freelancer, iWar2) - but I have enjoyed every single minute of it!  Its fun and refreshing and easy to sink your teeth into, and has a great space swashbuckler feel to it.  Rebel Galaxy is a great game and I happily recommend it.  There's also something to be said for the modesty of it - a great value that kinda flies under the radar, and doesn't seem to get the applause it deserves.  Other reviews and the description will give you a pretty good idea what it's about.  I just wanted to give a quick thumbs-up, as I've been meaning to for about a year.  The idea of Freelancer + Firefly gives a good general sense of gameplay and theme.  At first I was reluctant due to the 'flat space' nature of it, but it turns out it just feels right - and fresh, and fun.  Anyway - if there's (hopefully!) any DLC or a RG2, I'll be all over it, instantly, no questions asked.  Not many games have earned that kind of trust!  Well done Dev's, thanks for a Fun game - and I really hope you have more of this yet to come in the not too distant future!			"

												While the story is pretty barebones, the combat and the music is where this game is at. I've now spent 18 hours roaming the galaxy, and while I can understand people saying it's repetitive, I really enjoy the space-trucking, Jim-Raynor-space-combow feel to this game. Some people compare it to Assassins Creed 4's naval combat (that games single strengh, IMO), and while this is certainly a obvious comparison, I actually think that the combat in this game is better, as there are multiple types of weapons for different situations.I got this on a 33% sale, but I would easily recommend this game at full price.EDIT: after 34 hours, I feel I can say with certainty that I'm done with the game. I finished the last mission, and while I still could max out the biggest, most badass ship out there, I'm not compelled to do so. All in all a good game by it's own, and when you factor in the relatively low entry price, it's a no-brainer.			"

												This game represents everything that's right about games.A couple of guys named Erich Schaefer and Travis Baldree put this thing together. Between the two of them, they've had a hand in Fate, Mythos, Diablo II, and Torchlight. If you liked those games, and have played Freelancer or the little known Escape Velocity, this game should be an instant buy. Even if you haven't played space based ARPGs, you should buy this game.Why? It feels good to play, and everything in the game is secondary to it feeling good to play. That's how it represents everything that's right about games: it focuses on playing as being the critical element. The controls, sounds, and looks of the game come together to make it feel like you're playing something that's meant, designed, and created to be played, above all else. What really drives the game is the desire to kill things and become space rich, so you can kill stronger things and become even more space rich. It's the drive to kill, loot, and kill and loot even more that keeps the player going.If you're into narrative heavy games, then you probably should pass on this. The story is campy, and not something that you'll remember for crazy plot twists or complex drama. But it's just interesting enough to keep you moving forward.Rebel Galaxy has some sim-lite features, though not especially fleshed out. A player can disrupt a trade convoy, which keeps supplies low and prices high at a station. Or they can break through a blockade, and exploit the need for supplies to work towards becoming space rich.Looking forward, this game provides a solid foundation for further features to be developed. I think this has a lot of potential to become an even better game, with deeper complexities driving the sim-lite features.Really though, if you played and loved kill & loot driven games like Diablo II & Torchlight, or especially if you have played Freelancer or Escape Velocity... you need to buy this.

												TL;DRIf you like economics / 2D naval style combat / challenge, get this game.It's worth more than you're paying.Pros:This game feels highly polished for the ~$20 price tag.Economics function quite well, are not random, and you can earn Credits fairly quickly once you see the patterns. (i.e. if there's a Militia Embargo on an outpost, bring it military style products for a nice profit)The ships are interesting and specialized. You feel accomplished when you get the next awesome ship and throw some killer components on it.Computer requirements are well within reach for most PC gamers.^>It feels very optimized and lag is infrequent.The graphics aren't comparable to BF4 but, it's a very pretty game.The story, though not entirely compelling at first, is well written as are the characters for their minimalistic impact on the game.There's been ZERO glitching. That's just fantastic.Cons:Difficulty may seem overwhelming at first but, you'll quickly understand the importance of picking your battles and what upgrades are needed. Until you learn to broadside properly, high-range turrets will be your best friend.I can't really think of any others at the moment. I've been having a really good time. :)Suggestions:Co-op Play would be EPIC in larger scale confrontations.When on the Commodity Window make a sortable LIST of the other outposts you've visited and their pricing instead of the slow ""here's the price at this location"" rotation. I've spent far too much time just sitting in my chair waiting for the outpost i want to see prices for pop up without having to go back into space and look at it on my map.The distance between the sides of your ship and stellar masses when trying to warp is too great. Front space is wonderful but, if i can turn my Radovich completely sideways and not hit what made my warp stop that's a problem.Also, a question to the Devs;Did a few members of your team REALLY enjoy ""Armada"" for the Dreamcast? Because this feels like what that game should have been. I loved that game when it came out and put far too much time into it and this feels heavily influenced by it.Comp specs:AMD FX-6300 OC'd to 4.5GHzRadeon R9 280 OC'd to 280x specsUltra setting, Full Screen, 1080p = 140FPS most of the time.

It has loads of depth, great dialogue, awesome graphics and an amazing soundtrack that makes me feel like am part of the firefly TV show! I fell in love with the title and am really hooked on it. From upgrading your ships weapons, armour, parts and more to grabbing new and more powerful ships to entering huge fire fights that are insanely awesome to partake in. I couldn't recommend Rebel Galaxy more!Check out a little more here -

												So far from my limited playtime, I can already tell it will be one of those ""I'm only playing it because I am bored"" type of games. Right from the get-go the menu does not use the mouse (it has some in-game menu use, but it is very buggy)...obvious console port. Overall I would say just wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.Gunplay: 4/10It is very annoying to shoot enemies with your broadside cannons because they lock on to targets, so you are not really aiming. Same with the turret and missiles. Sometimes the aiming redicle will lock up when trying to aim due to it trying to stick on to a different enemy. The gunplay just isn't fun.Graphics: 8/10The game looks nice, but at first glance it seems much older than 2015. Still, good or bad graphics don't determine a game's quality. Story: 7/10The story line is neat, but right from the start it gets predictable. Also, most missions are ""Hey, you! Go run over there and shoot something for me, thanks."" You go do the mission, return, and then do it all over again. Also, all stations are the same (not externally or main characters, but the generic character models and interior is all the same).			"

Cool immersion that way+Dropped outta warp, destroyed some aliens with a full broadside rapidly, messily slapped all over their ship. 10/10-No 3D movement, you move on a flat plane (side to side)...

												Followed this game during it's development and was intrigued by it's take on a navel-style broad side combat. I know some might want verticle access for combat but honestly, this game doesn't need it. If you're familiar with the ship combat in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag then you'll know exactly how this game plays. The game is packed full of side quests, your classic fetch, eliminate, gather and escort. Several factions exist and many are joinable, some at war with one another so there is a sense of choice but it's not very deep. There's plenty of freedom, being a pirate is entirely possible but expect resistence.The sound for this game is great, from the mechanical vibrations, rising whurrs and powerful sounding blasts, it all feels very appropriate to the space exploration theme. With a very firefly esque feel to the music, you get that space-cowboy feeling right off the bat. There's an option to add your own easily, if you prefer as well.People looking for an extremely rich story and lore, incredibly complex combat mechanics and deep reputation based faction reputation systems might be a little disappointed, Rebel Galaxy certainly has these things but they're light. Overall, this a great 20 hour game with outstanding sound, combat and just enough exploration and progress to keep you going to the end. I wish there was a little more to story and lore but overall, I can't explain. If you can grab it on sale, totally worth it.			"

												After careful consideration, I can't recommend this game as it stands. It has a lot of potential, but due to various bugs and imbalances it fails to live up to that potential. The system it uses to classify mission difficulties is spotty (some very high risk missions are easy, while some low risk missions are very difficult). Escort missions are extremely buggy: escorts path back and forth regularly, they have almost no armor and NPCs don't have aggro tables AFAIK, if you engage personal warp for even a moment you immediately fail the escort. Some missions have you kill another faction's ships with no warning, so it's tricky to farm faction rep when a mercenary guild mission for 15 rep might have you killing merchant guild ships and losing 30 rep with them. On top this, it's extremely grindy. Get to a system, buy modules that are ~50% stronger than the ones you entered the system with, move to the next system since all the content in that system is obsolete now. Aside from the story, it's the same missions grinded over and over. ""Go here and kill these two groups of enemies"" ""Escort this trade prince to that station"" ""Take this cargo from point A to point B"". Honestly, this feels like a game that someone worked long and hard on, but then 80% of the way in they decided they needed to wrap it up ASAP and filled the last 20% with hollow, paper mache content. For the first 10 hours or so it was fun, but once you realize that it's just going to be the same recycled grind over and over it leaves you with a sinking feeling of ""why am I still doing this?""

												Everything from the sound, to the graphics, to the combat action, is fantastic.  This game is exactly what I wanted in a fast action space combat game.  I've played it for over 14 hours so far and still have not finished the main story.  I bought it the week it came out.  I thought it was totally worth the buy at full price and I'm one of those poor guys who buys pretty much everything on sale.  I hope they add DLC and Trading Cards.  I love this game!			"

												Shallow.On the surface this game is fantastic. I want to love it. The soundtrack makes you feel like a space cowboy right at the main menu. The designs manage to sell you on this gritty space society without feeling messy or cluttered. The gameplay premiss seems like a fresh twist on a working concept... and here things fall apart.It has an interesting idea of broadside combat in a freelancer type space sim, but it fails to achieve either. Whatever there is to master in this game is mastered in under an hour, and it basically comes down to ""have bigger guns and better shields"". Any fancy manouvers will only give the enemy time to recharge their shields or let them turn their undamaged sides towards you. Just fly up and hammer them harder while your turrets autoshoot any fighters. After that you just repeat the same interactions over and over to earn cash towards upgrades that add +stat% . You can feel safe taking any mission that has a danger rating you've dealt with before, because they scale with you and nothing ever changes.Even more dissapointing is the fact that there is virtually no point or reason to fight or do missions as it's slow and tedious, forcing you to cover large distances of empty space. Just find the trade route that is currently most profitable per minute and fly it back and forth until it drains to make atleast 10x in an hour what you could have gotten from missions during the same time. This way you'll never make enemies either!Also, dont buy anything but cargo or cargospace boosts.♥♥♥♥♥♥is super expensive and serves no point. You basically don't have to fight ever if your goal is to become the biggest bad♥♥♥♥♥in space. Some light shields and an engine will do fine! Any investments in your ship will just take money away from buying up expensive cargo. Then, when you made all the money there is to make from trade runs where you interact with absolutely no one... buy the most expensive♥♥♥♥♥♥you can find. Voila! You are now the best at this game and nothing can hurt you!The best part? Maybe you got a bit eager and there was more money to be made? Bigger ships to be found? Better guns? And now all you trading captial is gone? NO PROBLEM! Just sell all your ship parts AT COST and become a peacful trader again. You could just do this at any point when you wanted to actually kill something. You never have to feel invested in anything! Choices have no consequence or impact. Life is great in space! Except for all that emptyness and boredom you will feel. They really captured that part... "

												This game represents everything that's right about games.A couple of guys named Erich Schaefer and Travis Baldree put this thing together. Between the two of them, they've had a hand in Fate, Mythos, Diablo II, and Torchlight. If you liked those games, and have played Freelancer or the little known Escape Velocity, this game should be an instant buy. Even if you haven't played space based ARPGs, you should buy this game.Why? It feels good to play, and everything in the game is secondary to it feeling good to play. That's how it represents everything that's right about games: it focuses on playing as being the critical element. The controls, sounds, and looks of the game come together to make it feel like you're playing something that's meant, designed, and created to be played, above all else. What really drives the game is the desire to kill things and become space rich, so you can kill stronger things and become even more space rich. It's the drive to kill, loot, and kill and loot even more that keeps the player going.If you're into narrative heavy games, then you probably should pass on this. The story is campy, and not something that you'll remember for crazy plot twists or complex drama. But it's just interesting enough to keep you moving forward.Rebel Galaxy has some sim-lite features, though not especially fleshed out. A player can disrupt a trade convoy, which keeps supplies low and prices high at a station. Or they can break through a blockade, and exploit the need for supplies to work towards becoming space rich.Looking forward, this game provides a solid foundation for further features to be developed. I think this has a lot of potential to become an even better game, with deeper complexities driving the sim-lite features.Really though, if you played and loved kill & loot driven games like Diablo II & Torchlight, or especially if you have played Freelancer or Escape Velocity... you need to buy this.

												The only good thing about this game is: Space, Good Graphics, Good Soundtrack.  The issue I have is that there is no depth /complexity.  I'm not looking for a x3 or eve. Just something higher grade then freelancer.  Another issue I had was that your stuck on a I guess you would call it 2d plane while everything else around you is doing barrle rolls and going up and down.  Just sucked the immersion out of the game for me.   Thats my two cents.			"

												TL;DRIf you like economics / 2D naval style combat / challenge, get this game.It's worth more than you're paying.Pros:This game feels highly polished for the ~$20 price tag.Economics function quite well, are not random, and you can earn Credits fairly quickly once you see the patterns. (i.e. if there's a Militia Embargo on an outpost, bring it military style products for a nice profit)The ships are interesting and specialized. You feel accomplished when you get the next awesome ship and throw some killer components on it.Computer requirements are well within reach for most PC gamers.^>It feels very optimized and lag is infrequent.The graphics aren't comparable to BF4 but, it's a very pretty game.The story, though not entirely compelling at first, is well written as are the characters for their minimalistic impact on the game.There's been ZERO glitching. That's just fantastic.Cons:Difficulty may seem overwhelming at first but, you'll quickly understand the importance of picking your battles and what upgrades are needed. Until you learn to broadside properly, high-range turrets will be your best friend.I can't really think of any others at the moment. I've been having a really good time. :)Suggestions:Co-op Play would be EPIC in larger scale confrontations.When on the Commodity Window make a sortable LIST of the other outposts you've visited and their pricing instead of the slow ""here's the price at this location"" rotation. I've spent far too much time just sitting in my chair waiting for the outpost i want to see prices for pop up without having to go back into space and look at it on my map.The distance between the sides of your ship and stellar masses when trying to warp is too great. Front space is wonderful but, if i can turn my Radovich completely sideways and not hit what made my warp stop that's a problem.Also, a question to the Devs;Did a few members of your team REALLY enjoy ""Armada"" for the Dreamcast? Because this feels like what that game should have been. I loved that game when it came out and put far too much time into it and this feels heavily influenced by it.Comp specs:AMD FX-6300 OC'd to 4.5GHzRadeon R9 280 OC'd to 280x specsUltra setting, Full Screen, 1080p = 140FPS most of the time.

												Absolutely dripping with fun this one.  No micro management or in-depth colony baby sitting dragging you down.Another rarity hit's steam, rarity being, a 100% fun game at a bargain price, you don't see one of those every day.This one is a little like Templar battleforce when it comes to looks.  It doesn't look much in the screen shots and videos, but once in the actual game it looks pretty good.  But, this is not a looker, this is a player, and it's one of those; one of those that eats away at you day until it's gone.This is a GEM there is no doubt about that.			"

												Such a fun game. Compared to other space titles around at the time, Elite, Star Citizen, Star Conflict, No Man's Sky, and a host of others surfacing and submerging, this game stands out first to me the fact that it's single player. Shock horror. If you can get over that, it's fantastic.     I can't stress enough what a masterpiece the devs have done as far as software goes. Produced in a ridiculously short time, by the guys that brought us diablo, and then torchlight. Install's 2Gb, and run's so smooth even on a low end laptop. Has controller support, also (personally i love the controller controls on this title, well thought out, the commands are simple enough to just get stuck in). The controls overall aren't gratuitously complex. There aren't as many menus to cycle through as other games, and this doesn't feel like a bad thing, or that you're missing things. The combat is great fun. Winning or losing, it just FEELS good, with an awesome soundtrack to accompany it. Basically, in my view, while i enjoy say, elite, for a long term, ""sim"", this is arcade. It's pick up and play, blast a few minutes out and achieve something. It doesn't have so much replayability for me personally, but for the 1 playthrough alone, it was worth every penny. While writing this i genuinely am getting a hankering to play it again some time, so, i guess it has some replayability factor afterall. I'm not sure what else is important in a review.... it's smooth as hell to play, bug free (i'm aware that of course there'll be bugs these days in most titles, but i haven't found any thing i'd call a bug. The forums are well maintained and there's few bug reports from people with competant brain cells, if any, that haven't been addressed and long fixed. There will always be a vocal few that want to run across a open room in a shooter, towards an enemy sniper, head on, without jinking, get shot in the head, and complain that the sniper rifle is OP, and game breaking. Welcome to the internet. It's bug free, fun to play, great soundtrack, cheap game even when not on offer, looks great on not so great machines. Cons? Can't play with friends. Oh well, they'd only mess things up.			"

												This game was fun for about a day, then the ""side missions"" became incredibly repetiative and boring, and the combat pretty much the same.  For anyone that is comparing, I felt the same about Sid Meyer's Pirates, some of my friends loved that game, but I thought it got boring really fast.  At least in Sid Meyers, you get to get off your boat and do other things, in this game you are just flying around the galaxy doing odd jobs trying to upgrade your ship so that you can fly around faster and do more odd jobs, etc etc.  Space themed dungeon crawl?

												The game is basically meditation (flying) punctuated by spur of the moment naval-broadside combat (your capital ship versus pirates). The core narrative and the bartenders (talk to them at each station) breathe life into the game. The music while flying around at warp speed has been a really relaxing experience (something I rarely want from a game, but it works here).Also: I\'ve seen a lot of people trying to make Firefly references and I can tell you this game has nothing to do with Firefly aside from the space cowboy music and that you happen to be a captain of your own ship. There\'s nothing in the galaxy or story that is similar and you won\'t have a big crew of interesting people (which is what made Firefly the show that it is).Play the game for what it is: space trading with naval broadside combat. If that sounds interesting, I think you\'ll find your money well spent (especially if you pick it up on sale).			"

												A space fighter/flight game is an itch that has gone unscratched for a very long time and for a very simple reason; They’re not terribly user friendly to start with. They're mostly varying flavors of spreadsheets and menus.Rebel Galaxy avoids this problem by... not being a very complicated game. It’s stuck on a single flight platform which completely omits the need for severe flight tactics, and is instead comparable to Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag’s style of naval combat, down to the similarly used “Broadside” cannons. After that, it’s a matter of strategically placing some of your turrets as they autofire at your enemies while you control one, usually some type of rapidfire thing to cut through your enemies.Enemy ships, usually the small fighters, tend to have access to the 3D plane which is not as much of a problem as you might expect as it usually just means you need to plan your position to open fire. Again, your guns can shoot them depending on placement.Meanwhile it has a sort of MMO-like questing style of clearing enemies, shipping goods, defending traders, as well as a story mode. I actually have a lot of fun just ignoring the main quest (As you do), running around making ALL the money, upgrading my ship, and having a giggle when my main quest’s risk rating reads “Very Low”.As an aside; The music is wonderful and it took considerable resistance not to name my ship “Serenity”. It’s got a couple hours of full length (~3 minute) songs that will change in space stations or open battles which helps mix it up a bit.If I had a complaint, it’s probably that there’s not too much to do mid flight. Mid transit, there’s not a lot of popups when you’re fighting thousands of whatever-unit-of-distance it’s using. It amounts to three things interrupting your warp speed: Distress Signals, Ambushes, and Asteroid Fields/Nebulas. Beyond those, you might want to stop to play some piracy and raid trading convoys that go between space stations, which manipulates the market for you to take advantage of. I just wish there was more to do when I'm aiming for an objective that's tens of thousands of whatever-unit-of-distances away.Ultimately, it’s nice to find a space game that I can be moderately good at. Everything is put together pretty well, and while some may call it too simple; I find it works in the game's favor. Space games these days feel the need to overcomplicate themselves, and Rebel Galaxy avoids that.			"

												Love it.I've played it for quite a while now, and I love what they have done with the atmosphere and the battles. If there was an expansion, I would definitely buy it, as I just completed the main story. I am going to play more, try other storylines, perhaps try a bit of trading and even a bit of piracy.So, the parts with potential for improvements:I wish there were more setting for the stupid mercenary ship, such as ""protect me, don't go running off on your own to die"". That's not really a big deal though, I can always get more mercenaries, they don't seem to understand that it is certain death to sign up with me.The missions have no deadline, such as there is in Elite Dangerous, and that means there is also no real rush. If you have accepted a mission, you can probably wait until next year before you complete it, no matter what the description says.So, I would like more rush, and more stories to complete. And perhaps a reason to get out of my destroyer and into something bigger.			"

												Its not so much a space sim as an ARPG with space ships. But trading, mining, bounty hunting, piracy and even faction relations are all here. Sure, it takes place on a 2D plane, but the broadside combat more than makes up for that.Customize your ship. Buy new ships. Chat with shady aliens. Run from the law or side with it.

												Such a fun game. Compared to other space titles around at the time, Elite, Star Citizen, Star Conflict, No Man's Sky, and a host of others surfacing and submerging, this game stands out first to me the fact that it's single player. Shock horror. If you can get over that, it's fantastic.     I can't stress enough what a masterpiece the devs have done as far as software goes. Produced in a ridiculously short time, by the guys that brought us diablo, and then torchlight. Install's 2Gb, and run's so smooth even on a low end laptop. Has controller support, also (personally i love the controller controls on this title, well thought out, the commands are simple enough to just get stuck in). The controls overall aren't gratuitously complex. There aren't as many menus to cycle through as other games, and this doesn't feel like a bad thing, or that you're missing things. The combat is great fun. Winning or losing, it just FEELS good, with an awesome soundtrack to accompany it. Basically, in my view, while i enjoy say, elite, for a long term, ""sim"", this is arcade. It's pick up and play, blast a few minutes out and achieve something. It doesn't have so much replayability for me personally, but for the 1 playthrough alone, it was worth every penny. While writing this i genuinely am getting a hankering to play it again some time, so, i guess it has some replayability factor afterall. I'm not sure what else is important in a review.... it's smooth as hell to play, bug free (i'm aware that of course there'll be bugs these days in most titles, but i haven't found any thing i'd call a bug. The forums are well maintained and there's few bug reports from people with competant brain cells, if any, that haven't been addressed and long fixed. There will always be a vocal few that want to run across a open room in a shooter, towards an enemy sniper, head on, without jinking, get shot in the head, and complain that the sniper rifle is OP, and game breaking. Welcome to the internet. It's bug free, fun to play, great soundtrack, cheap game even when not on offer, looks great on not so great machines. Cons? Can't play with friends. Oh well, they'd only mess things up.			"

												This game was fun for about a day, then the ""side missions"" became incredibly repetiative and boring, and the combat pretty much the same.  For anyone that is comparing, I felt the same about Sid Meyer's Pirates, some of my friends loved that game, but I thought it got boring really fast.  At least in Sid Meyers, you get to get off your boat and do other things, in this game you are just flying around the galaxy doing odd jobs trying to upgrade your ship so that you can fly around faster and do more odd jobs, etc etc.  Space themed dungeon crawl?

												A space privateer like game where you can only fly in 2D? So disappointing, also the main story is very generic and bland and very very very similar to Freelancer, and while these games are meant to be grindy so you can buy a better ship and better gear, the missions you perform to get said funds are incredibly repetitive and become very dull. The visuals of the game ARE nice and the soundtrack is amazing, but that still doesn't save this game from being mediocre at best.			"

												If this game felt any more like Firefly it would be Firefly!The game is brightly colored, beautiful to look at, sounds great, and has an enjoyable soundtrack.  All of which come together to give you that feeling of a western in space.You can make your way by trading, scavenging, performing missions, bounty hunting, and what we have all come here for really..... FIGHTING! All so you can afford that next ship upgrade.  But maybe you should save your credits for that bigger ship with the extra firepower and a slightly bigger cargo bay.All in all this is a fun game that gave me nearly 40 hours of gameplay just on the story and some sidequests alone, and if I wanted to there are still more things I could buy and more ships I could upgrade to because the game doesn't finish when the storyline does.

I was a little concerned about the 2d playing plane, however it's not even an issue, and hardly noticeable really. Frankly, the battles are so chaotic sometimes, it would be near impossible to manage in 3d space. The graphics are great, a solid performer, bug free, good voice acting, interesting characters, good mission variety, and many different ways to play.Good stuff here, and the price can't be beat for such a rich title. Well worth the money. 9/10			"

												Oh my, what fun!So I read the reviews with people saying this game is like a mix of Freelancer, Firefly and Assassins Creed IV (the naval combat sections) and I guess those are pretty good comparison.The game certainly has the Freelancer vibe, with an open universe, optional story-line, combat, trading, rep/guild affiliation etc.The Firefly comparisons I think stem mainly from the music, but given you are flying a large vessel (not a smaller fighter) you do feel like you are captaining a ship with crew. and yes, you can 'aim to misbehave'Combat and travel is strictly 2D, but before you judge that too harshly, it plays our like ship combat from AC IV, with broadside combat being the order of the day. And it WORKS!It actually reminds me of the animated movie Treasure Planet a bit. Oh yeah, I am totally now a space pirate! Controller support is well implemented and I don't need to touch my keyboard to play (other than to hit 'play').Just shy of 2 hours in and barely scratched the surface, but based on what I have seen so far, this game could charge at least double the current price and still be good value.Recommended.

												Awesome game. It's pretty easy and gives you freedom to explore the world. Reminded me of Freelancer despite having a completely different combat system and being in 2D (you don't have a Z axis to move).You start with a basic ship and weapons, enough to finish some quests and start upgrading your equipment. As you advance the storyline and get more cash, you can start to buy better weapons or get a new ship, which gives you the ability to equip better gear so you can take on more dangerous enemies.The music really goes well with the gameplay, it also let's you add custom music in case it becomes repetitive.

												If you're gonna get this game you should really know what you're getting in to. The combat could be fun for some, but to me it's dull, unintuitive and lacks depth of any kind. It's not about skill it's all about your gear.The missions are uninspiring and feel like quests in MMOs, that would've been fine if not for the fact that this is a single player gane and I expect more from it.The story wasn't too gripping at first but there might be some people who are really interested by it.The travelling is boring and takes waaaaaaay too long.The soundtrack is good though so I give it a plus there, the voice acting is also good and there seems to be put in a lot of effort there.Do your research before buying the game, this is a very unique game... For good or bad (With my taste it's bad bu tI can see where others find the appeal).All in all I'd say this is a very niche game, but if you're looking for a star citizen or elite dangerous type of game this is not it.

												Double Damage does a great job of putting solid combat and a addictive upgrade system into a solid space sim.. Rebel Galaxy is not dificult to get into, it doesnt take 20 different controls to fly the ship, just a controller. Not to mention the soundtrack is just awesome, cant remember the last time I actuly went out and got the music to a game! So my verdict is this is a solid game and you will have a blast playing it.Want to see it in action or check out some of the 21 different ships you can fly then follow this link to my channnel where I have full coverage:https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRevPlays "

												You've played Freelancer, right? That's the comparison you'll hear the most often. Take Freelancer, make it prettier, remove actual free flying and exploration, muddy the PC port waters with a UI that isn't really comfortable away from a gamepad, and tack on an atrocious blues/country rock soundtrack choking on its own distortion. That's Rebel Galaxy. I get the feeling they wanted to make a naval combat game, but decided spaceships were cooler than boats, and set it in space instead. It helps to imagine the entire gameplay area as a giant, flat, invisible ocean, and you're just floating on the surface -- planets and bases are nothing but islands to stop at or maneuver around. Other ships can go above or below or around you, but you're stuck on the surface, plunking away with broadside guns and the occasional turret. Homeworld's map screen alone has more maneuverability options than this entire game.Gameplay-wise, you just do the typical Freelancer things: Visit space stations, accept jobs to improve/diminish faction reputation, occasionally pick up a plot-related mission, collect resources, trade commodities, earn money, upgrade your ship, wash, rinse, repeat.Mercifully, the music can be disabled.

 20€ for some dry bones As far as i know, it was the devs first game ever, developed by a single guy. So i guess 99% of development time was spent into the graphics.The game has a big world. Big and really empty. Rarely you´l find a convoy or pirates, thats it.Trading system is basic. VERY basic.Battles are 2D. In Space. No joke. And basic. Lock target, charge shot for some seconds, fire. Assasins Creed 4 made more fun.Theres no boarding. No killing shields or engines. You can only target the ship directly or some additional turrets, if its one of the bigger ones.Story is also basic. Nothing impressive. Found someone on the forums who finished it in 13 hours.All in all, the game is nothing but grinding the same missions all over again until you can afford gear for the next area, then its grinding again.As you can figure, once the short story is done, thats it. Nothing more to do. Not that you need to, but you also couldnt even be a pirate afterwards, cause theres no booty in empty universe. Just very rare miners or freighters, whic you cant board, that drop one or two units of cargo after getting destroyed.And during all that time you hear nothing but that sh*tty rock-soundtrack. Thank god you can replace it with custom sounds. CONCLUSION: Nice foundation made out of expensive, snow-white marble. Too bad construction stopped right here and the house was never build.			"

												First and foremost I'm not a paid reviewer/streamer/critic or any of that. I was blessed enough to receive a key for free eventhough I will buy multiple copies of this for my family/friends. Just being upfront about it but I played in the beta and pre-release so my review is coming from all my experience with the game. Now onto the review. Ever since the rlease of Freelancer on PC way back in 2000, I have been aching for a new space sim experience. If your like me and also have that itch then look no further. This game has pirating/trading/looting/mining/space battles.... a whole slew of things you can do in the sandbox that they have created for you. There are several systems or galaxies in which you traverse and have jump gates to connect them. Each system has its own factions with which to either befriend or destroy. You have a main story but also space stations with side missions along with the included Trading/Mining/Mercenary guilds which also provide missions. These three factions also provide unique ships, weapons, shields, and other things to outfit your ship. The combat is likened to naval style (think Assassins Creed Black Flag ship battles) and its set on a 2d plane. The art style, ship design, space backdrops are all top notch. The audio is also one thing that is a step above. The soundtrack alone warrants a look at this game. It gives the feel of a space fairing outlaw lol. Think Firefly, Han Solo, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star vibe. The sounds of the weapons firing gives a sense of real power and gurth behind each barrage launched from your broadside cannons. The best sound to me is when your FTL drive spools up and then hits warp.This game has been on my radar for some time now as my top 5 most anticipated games of 2015. I knew that Travis and Erich who left Runic Games to establish Double Damage wouldn't let me down. If you have any interest, what are you waiting for help these two Devs out by purchasing this amazing experience! I know I will be purchasing copies for my friends and family and for only 20$ US you can't beat that deal. The price for value is one of the best of 2015 alone. Do your self a favor and play it.			"

												I have a relatively high end systemi7 6700kgtx 970 gaming16gb vengence ddr4Can't play on DX11 due to constant crashes, can't play it on the highest setting or in non windowed due to crashes.That aside, there is no  save feature, cannot warp away when in combat even though there is no warp disruption in this game, from what I have seen. Beacause of that, it is very easy to get killed since the game auto drops you from warp when things get in your way unlike any other game ever. The story line is taking absolutely FOREVER to progress in and frankly it is not very interesting at that. I was very excited about this game and all the posative reviews, but it let me down big time.			"

												Do not buy this game for PC, not worth the buy. The controls are horrible and the gameplay is extremely repetitious and boring. The only two cool things about this game is the marketplace and the fact you can control huge ships. The storyline is horrible. If you want a game like this, but is older but has a great story, buy ""tachyon, the fringe"" can't beat Bruce Campbell and the fighting system is way way better. You can also go X3. A great game graphically and is robust and open world. If you ever enjoyed playing Eve Online, you will like X3			"

												Hours 0-2: What's with this ridiculous 2D battle system?Hours 3-4: Okay, I'm getting the hang of it, but the music is really repetitive.Hours 5-6: This is pretty fun. Controls take some getting used to. Odd design choice, but I can dig it. Gorgeous!Hours 7-8: Alright, now we're getting somewhere. Guild membership, a couple new ships, winning tougher battles. Let's hit that next star system. Can't wait to see what it looks like. Hopefully some new tunes too.Hour 9: Every mission available in second star system rated as ""Very Difficult"" and higher; every mission available in first star system rated as easy. Same repetitive butt-rock sountrack in the second star system, and one star system looks the same as the next.Verdict: Never played a space game that felt less like space than this one. Really sorry I bought it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, it is almost good. I got this after reading the Freelancer comparisons, but this game is not even close to it, it doesnt have the combat dynamism as it is naval based combat instead of fighter ships, nor the story pacing which helps improve your vessel before main missions, its more of go on playing until you get into a snafu.I specially don't like the combat, to me it feels grindy instead of tense and fun, there's no going up or down, it is a 2D flight system while some enemies have the freedom to move into the third dimension and even though it may fit the naval combat system, it feels weird.It has to be said that it is a great game to have been developed by a two man team, but it falls short of what one may expect after a Freelancer comparison, sadly it is kind of misleading and a video about the combat system would help clear things up.If you like Freelacer type games and think you may like the naval combat system a la ACIII+ ship combats, you should at least try this. I'd say it is a good game, just not for me...At least I enjoyed the music XD (it actually is very fitting).(I may update the review if I end up playing more (I still want to like the game))			"

												The controls are wonky, the game does a very bad job of informing you whats importiant and what the guns go in which slots and what  you currently have equiped. In most missions rather you or the enemies are unkillable juggernauts, its also annoying that you can do some bounties before you get the bounty and when you do get the bounty there is nobody there to kill so you just wasted 400 credits for usless information. Its also crappy to have a ship combat game were you are bound to an axis and cannot dogfight while the enemies can fly around you shooting you. The AI for your guns should also be better, it makes sense that if 2 of your turrets can auto fire than all of the turrests should be able to auto fire.The game does do a very good job with its music and thematic choices but there is no point in dragging yourself through the lame combat to explore the world.

												I've had more fun in the first five hours of playing this game than I have had in a long time. Combining elements from many beloved titels across genres, Rebel Galaxy is what you're looking for. It's 2D approach to space combat leaves your focusing on tactical options and attacks instead of trying to orient yourself constantly like in other games such as Elite: Dangerous. Thatisn't to be said that movement can't be still be a challenge. When you add in the need to manage weapon types against mixed engagements -- which are almost always the case. In these clashes you will face one or several other capital ships and a wide variety of fighter and gunship craft. The former come in a nice mix -- you don't know if the next capital ship you are going to run into will be an up close brawler or a ranged homing missle boat. The sub-capital ships although substatially lower defenses still provide pressure on the player. In swarms fighters can effectively dodge in and out of turret arcs if they aren't focused on. Gunships, on the other hand, pack a punch in a small size. A group of these gunships can be as dangerous as some campital ships.I speak of the wide range of encounters the player can have but the variety doesn't end there. Consider the different armerments that any one ship can use. Will you use a long range anti-captial ship guns paired with swarm missle launchers or will you choose some beefy in-your-face anti-capitals paired with several flak turrets? The number of combinations doens't end there. Each turret location on your ship can be outfitted with a different type of turret. If you sesired, you could put to gether a kitchen-sink styple ship!Beyond the mechanics of combat Rebel Galaxy also gives you the freedom to choose the type of contracts you take on. If you are able to plan ahead you can take several missions and set up a somewhat efficent flight path. The mission types tend to fall into a few different catagories; courier, defense, elimitatie, dead drop (recovery), or collection. Although mission fall into these catagories as a rule, the way each unfolds is randomly generated to keep you on your toes. If jumping mission to mission isn't your thing or you just want a break, you can also do some margin trading or mining.The tradeing consists of transporting goods between locations in hopes of turning a profit. This seems simple, but a host of factors will influence your success or failure. The way time works in Rebel Galaxy has what seem like short warps between locations to having passed several days. This leads to a an amount of uncertainy of a fluctuating market shortly after you've left. Random events will also add a little spice to the mix. These events allow you to swoop in and pick up goods when they are over-saturated or drop your goods into a starving market. Ships in Rebel Galaxy also have a fairly limited cargo hold. So, no running around the system with vast amounts of cargo in your hold just waiting for the opportunity to offload it onto a waitting market.The difficulty that Rebel Galaxy provides is a welcome change to the modern status quo. Rather than needing to set a arbitrary difficulty setting you need simply get yourself in hot water by approaching a mission or location that's rated ""Risk: High"". This nice little warning suggests what you'll find will be a distinct challenge no matter your tactics or fit. At noumerous times during my play, I found myself feeling quite the force to be rekoned with. After rolling through enimies and dispatching them in a short time I presumred I was the big man in the system. Then I was ambushed in mid warp. I thought to myself, 'I've been killing everything iwth no problem; this area is probably too easy for my current skill."" I was so wrong. The three capital ships and a  few squadrons of gunships ensured that my growing ego was quite deflated. Although I could have, after being ppulled from warp, turned and ran to safety, I instead engaged foolishly and committed to a fight I couldn't win.To sum it up, if you enjoy space combat sims like Freespace, Elite:Dangerous, ando thers this game will provide a refreshing spin on the favorite genre. As you challenge yourself with different play styles and different engagements you will be rewarded with the uncertainty of your success while being excited to try again after your ship explodes. For a standard price of $20, I would buy this game twice. Enjoy.			"

			Views: 190		

			This game is available here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/290300 MASSIVE THANKS TO THE DEV'S FOR THE STEAM REVIEW COPY!		

One of the best space adventures I've played in 2015.... don't miss this gem of a game. Rebel Galaxy is a swashbuckling space adventure, with action-packed combat, exploration, discovery, trade, and “negotiation” with the outlandish denizens at the edge of the known universe. As the commander of an immensely powerful star destroyer, you’ll battle pirates, explore anomalies, befriend aliens, scavenge battle wreckage, mine asteroids, and discover artifacts. Choose your path as a roguish do-gooder, crafty space-trader or power-hungry privateer – or maybe a little of each! Buy larger and more powerful craft with your hard-earned credits, and outfit them with a variety of wicked weapons and defenses. Set in a galaxy of fantastic sights, and secrets to be found, Rebel Galaxy is above all a space epic of adventure, exploration, and combat. The edge of the universe is a pretty dangerous place, so watch your back. - Highly Recommended!			"

												This game was a really, really awesome seeming Naval Combat Simulator, but I unfortunately went into it looking for a more conventional space ship simulator. My bad, honestly, it really does seem like a great game, I just don\'t enjoy naval combat sims very much. I have a lot of trouble with the broad sides combat in them. This is good at that, it\'s just weird to be in space but basically move and fight as a boat.So, just to be clear, this is a boat game, but the boats and setting are spaceship-themed. Naval combat. Not a ship flying game. Sorry devs, you made a darn good looking this kinda game. Buy it if you like ship-to-ship naval combat (no boarding, it\'s in space).			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game. The first time I saw it, I thought ""This looks so cool, must be hell of a lot of fun"". The atmosphere, the particals, the spaceship battles, etc. When I bought it during the summer sale, it was one of the first game (of the 10 that I bought) that I installed, just to get disappointed. The game didn't launch for me. So I uninstalled it. I later upgraded my OSX (yes, I am on Mac) for Smite and decided, why don't give it a second try? So I reinstalled it, and launched the game again. It froze on the Titlescreen. I had to restart my PC, then it finally worked and I dove right into it...The first thing I noticed was the music. It fits the game/theme perfectly, some sort of ""Space Rock"". It's the kind of music you would expect Han Solo to listen to whilest flying. The rythem is good, quality is good and the feeling is even better. I think the best thing in this game is the music (@Devs why don't publish the Soundtrack?).My first 30mins with the game where not enjoyable. My camera was moving around like a drunk guy on a unicycle. I couldn't get ride of the feeling that mouse accelerations was on. I looked under controles, and the only option I saw was to turn down mouse sensitivity. After that it worked a bit better, was still frustrating though. I enjoyed the dialogues a lot too, the characters where what you expected, a bit clichée but still really fitting into the game. Your choices concerning responses are not amazing, but they give you a bit of choices, which added a nice little touch, which isn't useful, but I still considere well placed in the game.And finaly, I came to the combat. Hell did it look cool, and hell did it play♥♥♥♥♥♥ After I died the first time, not knowing how to use my weapons properly, I closed the game and played something else. I was so frustrated. I later tryed again, giving the game 3 trys to convince me that the combat was fun. For me it never felt fun.The biggest problems I encountered where the camera. The placement is awkward at best, and it can ruin everything. I sometimes couldn't even see where I shot because the camera backed down behind the ship, whilst I was aiming. And moving it back up again, well, now it goes way overbord and I ca't see the enemy ship properly.Another aspect is the free movement in combat. You and other heavy ships are limited to a 2D combat field, whilst small fighters can fly all around you. That wouldn't be a problem, if you didn't have to fly, fight and try not to ram something at the same time.To break it down: You will ram into things if you focuse on the combat aspect, and you will not fight well if you focuse on the flying aspect. The auto aiming of your beta canons it terrible. It locks you onto someone and you shoot. But if you have locked onto someone, you won't be able to aim at someone else. I would have liked to get a fonction where I can aim freely, and then press a button and that locks my aim onto that target I'm aiming at currently. Another problem with that auto-lockon is that your camera moves with the target. I had small fighters circleing around me, spinning my camera like crazy, making it impossible to fly properly.My last, but not unimportant problem with combat is, that enemies fly away. But you are in free space, so they can fly where they want. So you have to concentrate on fighting them, and following them around, which to me, somebody uncapable of multitasking is too much of a challenge.To summe it up, I really liked the music, fantastic. The dialogue is not really useful, but a nice touch. However, the combat system ruined it for me, to such an extend that I don't feel the need to continue. I know I didn't even play 3hs, but the combat is so frustrating to me, that I will probably not continue, as I play for fun, not to be more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off after then before (and yes, I'm not one of those oldschool elitsts that have to play every game for the challenge, I play them for fun).So do I recommend this game. No, not really. I do recomment the soundtrack. And if you can multitask, otherwise, stay away. But who am I kidding, I'm a stranger on the internet, that hasn't even finished the game.If you can, and have a friend who has the game, try it, see if it's for you, and then buy. For me this game was really disappointing, not because it's beyond bad, just because I came in with expectations that where not reached.			"

												The Rebel Alliance needs your help because its a trap.Its a good little game, you can lesson to its rock & roll soundtrack or add your own music. Which is a nice touch because you can put the music in different genders like: Main menu, battle/combat, Idle, in-station, and ect. Its like Elite: Dangerous but in a lifter way. Also 3rd-preson.

												An awesome concoction of naval-style  combat, exploration and♥♥♥♥♥kicking fun. I must say it was a great game, and is still one of my favorites. Pros:- Pretty good graphics and optimized performance- actually good voice-acting- Space depicted as it should - a great realm of exploration, pirates, space rocks- You can kill almost everything including Main Quest NPCs (except space stations)- The♥♥♥♥♥kicking ACDC style, swash-buckling music when you are in combat is so fitting. Great Music. Yup- All round fun especially done by a small indie company- rock'n'rolling with music and reasonably good combat system (can be repetitive though)Cons:- Rather limited choice of weapons, utilities and upgrades- warping can be a somewhat pain especially when you played too many fetch quests so that you can rank up your allegiances- Campaign was a little short- Side missions can be seriously repetitive, but at least the music and steam-rolling fights help elevate thatOverall:Great Indie game at a great price! - rewarding experience for exploration and well optimized combat systemReplay? Yes, if there are expansionsRecommend? Definitely			"

												Third person perspective with an arcade feel. Truly a great game that will give you over 100 hours of enjoyment.Tons of ships to unlock and upgrade, and engaging combat and NPC conversations that feel like they mean something.The soundtrack for this game is second to none. You will feel like a true \""space cowboy\"" after a few minutes.The combat in this game is engaging, you pilot your ship and aim with broadside bombardments that shred enemies. Overcoming overwhelming odds is something you will be looking for, and doing so successfully will usually yield you some sweet rewards.For the price you cannot beat this game. If you enjoyed any space games in the past, this is absolutely a must have.			"

												Great game. Reminds me of the assassin creed black flag ship combat combined with freelancer. The story is pretty weak but the tall ship combat combined with lots of upgrades makes it a fun time. The soundtrack is an amazing firefly-esq western score.A couple downsides:-Nothing really to do after 20 hours (maybe 30 hours for achievement completionists)-No real reason to explore (no secret gates that I could find like freelancer)-Biggest issue: No crew interactions or upgradable crew. This would be a fantastic improvement.-Some balancing issues (minor)Overall, I recommend. Especially for $10-20.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is an amazing game if you enjoy space games. Although it is quite enjoyable, it has several major flaws.Although I played the game for 20+ hours, the game story line is extremely short and only last this long because of the grind required to progress. The game feels a little bit like a free to play where you are constantly gated and required to upgrade your ship, weapon and defenses before being able to progress.Here are my opinions on the game.Pros:Enjoyable combat systemInteresting storyNice progression systemGood musicCombat SFX are very goodCons:Very limited character voicesOnly 1 portrait per raceRadio static communication SFX is terribleStory is extremely shortGame requires a lot of grindingVery very limited choices on actions and discussionMerchant and mercenary guild discussions are extremely plain, the progression of ranks do not unlock anything discussion wise.I have mixed opinions on these:You can finish the game with MK5 gear with ease.MK6 is just bonus to farm for which will remove any challenge from the gameIn the end, I loved playing rebel galaxy, and I streongly recommend it. I personally bought the game when it was 33% off.If you enjoy these types of space games, do get it. Its just a shame that the game had soo much potential and ended up being so much less than it could have been.			"

												If you enjoy space sims I wouldn't worry much about the people complaining about grinding, this game is an amazing  arcade capital ship battler. Just doing a few battles for fun every once in a while will earn you T6 equipment for your ship and you should easily have a dreadnaught by the campaign's end if you save up. If you have ADHD and the attention span of a goldfish I might avoid the genre in general.			"

												Game was fine... til started corrupting my monitors then my save file. At first I had no problems, then the other day it started acting up, my monitors would go black and stay that way if I happened to alt tab, forcing me to hard reboot. Then tonight all other monitors but the one the game itself was on would go black while the game was still running. If I quit the game the monitor it was on would also go black, forcing me to hard reboot. The 3rd time this happened, my save was corrupted, taking me all the way back to a save from the first 10 minuets of playing, I had several hours/days of play time completely lost. Have now lost total interest in playing this game ever again. I have tons of other games none of which gave this type of problem.			"

												TLDR:  If you have even a marginal interest in space themed combat/exploration, go buy this now.This game has all the fun of exploring, mining, combat, story, with none of the fiddly bits you tend to get in space themed games.  There are a ton of really smart, quality of life, user friendly design choices made by the developer, and it makes playing the game just plain fun.Once you get past the learning stage, which doesn't actually take long, and figure out how to fight and gear your ship, this game has a serious 'just one more mission' vibe.  You will lose hours to this that you thought were minutes. This game has a real charm to it, highly recommended.  Well worth full price, and then some.  Get it now, you won't be sorry.			"

The equipment is varied enough that there is some variety and entertainment is trying out various ships and builds, and the game features broadside main guns, turrets, and dumbfire slots on every ship.Pros:Fun arcade mechanicsDecent amount of ships and equipmentCons:Can get very repetativeTrade and mining mechanics are dull			"

												A very enjoyable, even if a bit short and light on content side space combat sim/exploration game.Pros:+ Fun and often surprisingly complex combat, with decent weapon variety and high emphasis on manouvering+ A lot of ships to choose with often real trade-offs (firepower vs manouverability) and a decent amount of customization.+ Short, but enjoyable story+ Unique climate, with voice-acting and sountrack properly supporting the ""Wild West"" vibe.+ A universe full of random stuff happening+ Nice looking and well optimized graphicsCons:- Short main story- Somewhat generic and repetetive side missions- Not that much content - in my playtime I've bought the strongest ship with best modules and basicly saw everything the game has to offer- No endgame or super-rare stuff worth finding- Trade and mining are somewhat limited, there is no industrial aspect in the game like in Elite: Dangerous or X3This game definitly turned out to be much better than it had any right to be. If you're looking for a somewhat casual space sim that will give you an engaging universe and freedom to choose your own style of playing, look no further. It won't last forver, but will give you 20-30 hours of very solid experience.I just hope they will come up with some expansion packs or a sequel that will expand on the formula. They have most of the basics done right, giving the player some far-reaching goals, like conquering stations and building an industrial empire would make it absolutely awesome.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun game, that get's repetitive in the later parts.I really enjoyed most of my time with the game, it doesn't have much variety though. There are not many different quest types and it feels like the music loops through the same few songs over and over. These things are no problems in the beginning. I had a blast just trucking through space, retrieving and delivering cargo to different stations, outrunning or shooting bandits, earn money and upgrade you ship. Once I was ready to leave the first system I realized it doesn't really change.It doesn't help that you have to do the ""grinding"", side missions between the main story to earn money, to buy better parts for you ship or a different ship altogether so you can survive against higher level enemies.I have an alright tolerance for this but got fed up after about 30h and just wanted to finish the game. It's possible I spend to much time in the first system(s) and maybe could have been more efficient to go to different systems earlier for more lucrative quests. Your mileage may vary.If that isn't a problem for you, this is the perfect game for you!			"

												It's been a long time since I found a good successor to Elite, Privateer and Privateer II... Freelancer wasn't bad but it was a bit more linear than I like... kinda forced you through the storyline when you would rather just explore the area a bit before moving on.   Very happy I found this title.  Easily the best ""Privateer"" style Space Opera game I've found in a decade!  Far better than Freelancer.  Just a lot of fun and so many ways to play.  It's single player only but that suits me just fine.  Every time I've tried one of these that had multiplayer, including Freelancer, the single player quality suffered for it. The missions are fun.  The story line is intriguing and the voice work is pretty impressive for such a small group of voice actors.  12 hours in and I've only just begun the story.  Really enjoying this title. "

												Fun indie/open world/action RPG set in space.  Any old gamers who remember Escape Velocity series will enjoy this, as will any fans of Firefly who want be an independent captain operating on the fringes of legality in the vein of Malcolm Reynolds.The combat is good, but I did find it became tedious after a while.  The main quest will become challenging if you don't take on side quests but none of them are particularly interesting (""Fly to X system and deliver cargo"" or ""Destroy pirates at Y coordinates for a bounty""), just repetitive radiant missions.  Nor did I find the main quest story particularly compelling, and I wish the roleplaying element and world-building were stronger.  The ship models available for upgrade also felt a bit constrained, although the amount of customization for equipment is outstanding.The soundtrack really makes the game, reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop at its best.

												What a BLAST!!! Want to know how Han Solo felt? give this game a whirl. Bang for the buck this is an awesome deal! t is part space sim, part arcade game. At first I was disappointed that there seems to be no vertical axis, only horizontal. That after a while seems to not matter so much. It seems to be pretty large and very beautiful. I havent even left the first galaxy yet...hopefully there will be expansions as things go along. In the mean time there is plenty to do...trade, smuggle get into MANY fights. Upgrade your ship, get a new one...visit strange new places and interact with alien races... Some will be disatisfied there is not the depth of a sim...it DOES lean towards the arcade side...still...that to me isn't a huge deal. There are plenty of in depthe starship simmulations. This has just enough of it and the fun or the arcadish feel. THEN there is the music! AWESOME! very blues rockish, gets you right in the mood to BE that Han Solo character or be your own Scruffy Nerfherder! This was supposed to release on PS4 and I had been waiting, but no date...So I bought it...a couple of days later, what do you know...they released it  there as well. So I have 2 copies! Its good enough and really cheap enough for me to not mind so much.  I very much reccomend this game!			"

												I give it a cautious thumbs up. If you enjoyed the naval combat in Assasin's Creed: Black Flag, get ready for that exact same experience except with better music and laser beams.Pro's:Excellent soundtrack and if you get tired of it, the game makes it really easy to swap in your own at start up.Combat is simple, but can be challenging at times depending what sort of mess you fly into.The ship design is interesting and the different weight classes make each class pilot differently enough to keep them distinct. That said, it'd be nice to have a few more ships to choose from or mod support so we can make our own.Con's:Eventually the whole game gets repetitive. The music repeats after a bit, the systems start to look the same with the only real difference being the color of the core and the enemies are more or less interchangeable as far as faction goes.Characters are forgettable and the story won't suck you in, but for $20 bucks you knew there was going to be a trade off and the narrative is it.If you can't wait to play Star Citizen and Elite:Dangerous seems to complicated and in depth or requires too much patience, than this might be your cup of tea. You could do worse for $20 dollars (20 tacos at taco bell?). If you catch it on sale for $10 or less, I'd say go for it without reservation, at full price you might want to ask yourself what else that $20 could buy you.If the game ever gets mod support then buy it without hesitation and see what kind of hijinks you can get up to.

												Five Word Review: Love me some space fighting.Favorite Thing: Buying a new ship.+ The combat is fun. Simple, but fun+ Nice selection of ships and weapons+ Simple though decent story+ Built in no-UI screenshot feature!- Space is big, I get it, but travel is slow with lots of forced stops along the way.- Very grindy to get the cash for those upgrades.Playtime: 15h (got tired of the grind after 10h)Enjoyment: 8/10			"

												k, ive got about 5 hours. The game to me is simple and fun, just complicated enough. If you picked up elite dangerous and were stumped by the learning curve, then RG is a good buy, I got it on sale for 10 bucks.its 2d,  which is brilliant for keeping space exploration/combat a bit less dizzying.  i recommend it for the non hardcore, more arcadey types.

												Worth it. Decent graphics, fun game play, easy mechanics. A great game for those times you just don't feel like being 'on' or slayin'. Turn up the Clutch, grab a pint, and throw on a space helmet and eye patch. It's as close to a space pirate I'll ever be.			"

												Love the game. If you played Freelancer back in the day this game has alot of similarities. You can play the campaign at your leisure. In fact the game is very much like an rpg in that you have to ""level up"". Buy better ships and accessories. The controls are easy to learn and the capital ship combat is fun if a bit fast paced for larger ships. It's unfortunate you can't fly in a true 3D space like in freespace but I soon forgot about it and was sucked into the gameplay and universe.It's hard to believe that this is an indie game. Freespace is still the standard for mouse driven space action games. But until Microsoft decides to release it to steam or gog, this game will most certainly scratch that itch. Definitely worth a play if you are a fan of Privateer, Elite, or Freespace.			"

												It's been a long time since I found a good successor to Elite, Privateer and Privateer II... Freelancer wasn't bad but it was a bit more linear than I like... kinda forced you through the storyline when you would rather just explore the area a bit before moving on.   Very happy I found this title.  Easily the best ""Privateer"" style Space Opera game I've found in a decade!  Far better than Freelancer.  Just a lot of fun and so many ways to play.  It's single player only but that suits me just fine.  Every time I've tried one of these that had multiplayer, including Freelancer, the single player quality suffered for it. The missions are fun.  The story line is intriguing and the voice work is pretty impressive for such a small group of voice actors.  12 hours in and I've only just begun the story.  Really enjoying this title. "

												Very good 2D space sim, love the cinematic effects and all that. Only have a few gripes with it right now but im guessing they will be fixed1) The mouse. I dont know how exactly to explain it, but when you move the mouse, the mouse keeps moving for a second after you stop moving it. 2) Performance. I had a review of this up earlier complaining about it and a dev told me to make sure the correct card was being used which i did, and it still is...bleh. Somebody said it might have a data leak, so if that was fixed and it was optimized a bit, that might help.3) The turret. Whenever i go into precision aiming, the gun wiggles up and down and shoots randomly.Even with these complaints, ill give this game a 7/10. If they are fixed id say 8.5/10			"

												Great game, lots of respect for DD studios considering this is the first title i've ever seen by them and i'm pretty sure at this point that they're a brand new startup. I really loved playing this but I really couldn't finish it. It's a cool combat based simulator with some interesting twists, but it's about as deep and diverse as a DOS game. Ever played hyperspeed? this is hyperspeed II. While the ship and bttle controls are fluid, simple and realistic without being too easy, it's a game you play for 20 mintues then you're done. the missions are mind-numbing after a few rounds and the story is mediocre at best. *SPOILER ALERT* - - - I can appreciate the whole ""secret, unknown and very powerful alien race"" idea, and the ""Undiscovered AI linked to an acient race"" one too, but putting the two together is just lazy, and so is the incredibly UN-intimidating superrace. The first time they appeared I took a bat to their whole squadron with a poorly equipped scarab, and now i've lost all interest in seeing where they're going - - - *END SPOILER*Buy it if it goes under $5, because that's about all it's worth. Very good attempt and a pretty cool game if it was programmed as someone's pet project to get them out of their desk job, but if this were a major title this review would be very unkind.			"

												Like Sid Meier's Pirates in space.  (Though I haven't completed it yet.)Pros:Great graphics.  All the fancy post-effect stuff from AAA titles.  Very cool ship design, from concept to greebling.  And lots of them, too.A surprising amount of ships to buy and play with.  You can trade to a different hull anywhere it's sold, just so long as you have enough money.  You get full price for your trade-in.  Which means you can tradeout your hull for a mission than trade it back.Interesting ship components with meaningful effect on gameplay, diverse weapons.  No one weapon setup is optimum for all situations.  Ships range in size from small corvette's to large dreadnaughts, but everything still has a role to play.  (Tradeoffs between size and power vs. agility and speed.)Excellant economy, trading, and mission based shipping.  Easy trading.  The market value of goods on a planet is auto updated each time you visit it.  Very exciting too, what with scripted rebel and pirate attacks during shipping missions.  And roaming pirates and rebels you can run into just trading on your own.  You definately must keep your ship well outfitted for tougher shipping missions.  Lots of money to be made!Missions of all types vary in difficulty according to your current ship and rig, but you can see a dynamic difficulty rating before accepting it.  Easier missions are always available, if you find yourself up against a wall.Lots of things to buy and upgrade for your ship, or tradeout for an alternate rig to complete missions.  Different races sometimes require different tactics. Cons:There are a few vague ratings and descriptions for ships and components.  But you can usually find the info you need on the Community Hub.Relatively small galaxy compared to more hardcore (and expensive) space trading sims.TL:DRA casual naval game set in space.  The focus is on fun, and zappy pastel deathrays.  Space looks pretty, which is important if you have to spend alot of time staring into the starry depths.  Trade is better than viable, it's an important way to advance and upgrade your ship.  And anything that isn't clear in game is usually on the Hub.I hope they make a sequel!			"

												I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys arcade-like space-themed combat.

The equipment is varied enough that there is some variety and entertainment is trying out various ships and builds, and the game features broadside main guns, turrets, and dumbfire slots on every ship.Pros:Fun arcade mechanicsDecent amount of ships and equipmentCons:Can get very repetativeTrade and mining mechanics are dull			"

												3rd person view of what is essentially a tabletop game.  (You can steer left or right, but not up or down.  It's not ""space,"" the whole game exists on one flat disc surrounded by  a space background.)Text flash tutorials don't really do a good job of explaining what you need to do, or what you should expect from combat.  That being said, combat (once you get the hang of it) is really well done despite being on the previously mentioned flat surface.Extremely imbalanced difficulty levels may discourage some players.  Each solar system, including the first one, starts off very difficult.  Avoid fights, do some cargo hauling missions to upgrade your ship before attempting combat or progressing the story.The story starts pretty shallow, towards the middle it stays shallow, and it ends shallow.Once you get the hang of the combat in this game, and if you're ok grinding cargo hauling missions from place to place - it's a lot of fun.  Objectively I don't think it's a very well polished game, but it's definitely worth the ten bucks on Steam Sale if you're a big sci-fi fan, and only if you're a big sci fi fan.Hitting recommend because subjectively I'd rank it between 5/10 and 6/10			"

												This game is right on the brink of not recommending. In the end, it comes down to one thing: This game is really just about going from A to B and shooting badguys along the way. There is not enough depth, not enough immersion.. the gameplay simply doesn't have enough oomph to keep the game interesting. It's fixable though. Give us more meaningful story, more character, more depth. The core gameplay is fun.			"

												Firefly with aliens is a good description for this little gem. But with more guns and missles and aliens heh. I like the combat broadside ships blasting away at each other. Decide how you tackle your missions, rob, trade, or be a ""nice guy"" hah. Mining is boring don't bother it's about the combat and how you decide to deal with the npcs. Bribe you way out of a situation or charge ahead and blow them out of the sky.Side with factions or do your own thing. Top notch sound track, side missions are really just reused but the main plot is good. Large space to explore, but the travel can get a bit long. Overall if you like spaceships buy it.			"

												Without trying to be in-depth I just state first that the game is a must for every blues, blues-rock, heavy-blues fan with a knack for sci-fi.  Atmosphere is unique, with western-like feeling in a ""trashy-space"" environment.  Gameplay is casual and entertaining with simple yet immersive paths from piracy to commerce, rounds out the RPG aspect.   Coding is smooth: runs perfectly on an average hardware while still looking great.  Story is good enough not to be lackluster, dialogues are humorous.   Ship customization could be deeper, yet wouldn't call it shallow.  DO NOT, ever play the game after a few beers more than enough, no matter how awesome is the soundtrack! The game has a fairly good auto-saving system, yet if you pass out while travelling with warp speed, getting back to the actual game will take quite some time after you manage to recover.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008259682/screenshot/353895963664216939 "

												Fun indie/open world/action RPG set in space.  Any old gamers who remember Escape Velocity series will enjoy this, as will any fans of Firefly who want be an independent captain operating on the fringes of legality in the vein of Malcolm Reynolds.The combat is good, but I did find it became tedious after a while.  The main quest will become challenging if you don't take on side quests but none of them are particularly interesting (""Fly to X system and deliver cargo"" or ""Destroy pirates at Y coordinates for a bounty""), just repetitive radiant missions.  Nor did I find the main quest story particularly compelling, and I wish the roleplaying element and world-building were stronger.  The ship models available for upgrade also felt a bit constrained, although the amount of customization for equipment is outstanding.The soundtrack really makes the game, reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop at its best.

												A very enjoyable, even if a bit short and light on content side space combat sim/exploration game.Pros:+ Fun and often surprisingly complex combat, with decent weapon variety and high emphasis on manouvering+ A lot of ships to choose with often real trade-offs (firepower vs manouverability) and a decent amount of customization.+ Short, but enjoyable story+ Unique climate, with voice-acting and sountrack properly supporting the ""Wild West"" vibe.+ A universe full of random stuff happening+ Nice looking and well optimized graphicsCons:- Short main story- Somewhat generic and repetetive side missions- Not that much content - in my playtime I've bought the strongest ship with best modules and basicly saw everything the game has to offer- No endgame or super-rare stuff worth finding- Trade and mining are somewhat limited, there is no industrial aspect in the game like in Elite: Dangerous or X3This game definitly turned out to be much better than it had any right to be. If you're looking for a somewhat casual space sim that will give you an engaging universe and freedom to choose your own style of playing, look no further. It won't last forver, but will give you 20-30 hours of very solid experience.I just hope they will come up with some expansion packs or a sequel that will expand on the formula. They have most of the basics done right, giving the player some far-reaching goals, like conquering stations and building an industrial empire would make it absolutely awesome.			"

												Really enjoyed this game.  I'm a huge Firefly fan, with the style, game mechanics and awesome rock soundtrack, it comes very close.  I love the different approaches you can take, the interesting storylines and exploration.Awesome game!  I'd like to see more random events and character development/story.			"

												Like Sid Meier's Pirates in space.  (Though I haven't completed it yet.)Pros:Great graphics.  All the fancy post-effect stuff from AAA titles.  Very cool ship design, from concept to greebling.  And lots of them, too.A surprising amount of ships to buy and play with.  You can trade to a different hull anywhere it's sold, just so long as you have enough money.  You get full price for your trade-in.  Which means you can tradeout your hull for a mission than trade it back.Interesting ship components with meaningful effect on gameplay, diverse weapons.  No one weapon setup is optimum for all situations.  Ships range in size from small corvette's to large dreadnaughts, but everything still has a role to play.  (Tradeoffs between size and power vs. agility and speed.)Excellant economy, trading, and mission based shipping.  Easy trading.  The market value of goods on a planet is auto updated each time you visit it.  Very exciting too, what with scripted rebel and pirate attacks during shipping missions.  And roaming pirates and rebels you can run into just trading on your own.  You definately must keep your ship well outfitted for tougher shipping missions.  Lots of money to be made!Missions of all types vary in difficulty according to your current ship and rig, but you can see a dynamic difficulty rating before accepting it.  Easier missions are always available, if you find yourself up against a wall.Lots of things to buy and upgrade for your ship, or tradeout for an alternate rig to complete missions.  Different races sometimes require different tactics. Cons:There are a few vague ratings and descriptions for ships and components.  But you can usually find the info you need on the Community Hub.Relatively small galaxy compared to more hardcore (and expensive) space trading sims.TL:DRA casual naval game set in space.  The focus is on fun, and zappy pastel deathrays.  Space looks pretty, which is important if you have to spend alot of time staring into the starry depths.  Trade is better than viable, it's an important way to advance and upgrade your ship.  And anything that isn't clear in game is usually on the Hub.I hope they make a sequel!			"

												I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys arcade-like space-themed combat.  The player pilots various capital ships that are locked into a 2D plane, so if 3D space combat is your thing you probably won't enjoy this one.  The equipment is varied enough that there is some variety and entertainment is trying out various ships and builds, and the game features broadside main guns, turrets, and dumbfire slots on every ship.Pros:Fun arcade mechanicsDecent amount of ships and equipmentCons:Can get very repetativeTrade and mining mechanics are dull			"

												3rd person view of what is essentially a tabletop game.  (You can steer left or right, but not up or down.  It's not ""space,"" the whole game exists on one flat disc surrounded by  a space background.)Text flash tutorials don't really do a good job of explaining what you need to do, or what you should expect from combat.  That being said, combat (once you get the hang of it) is really well done despite being on the previously mentioned flat surface.Extremely imbalanced difficulty levels may discourage some players.  Each solar system, including the first one, starts off very difficult.  Avoid fights, do some cargo hauling missions to upgrade your ship before attempting combat or progressing the story.The story starts pretty shallow, towards the middle it stays shallow, and it ends shallow.Once you get the hang of the combat in this game, and if you're ok grinding cargo hauling missions from place to place - it's a lot of fun.  Objectively I don't think it's a very well polished game, but it's definitely worth the ten bucks on Steam Sale if you're a big sci-fi fan, and only if you're a big sci fi fan.Hitting recommend because subjectively I'd rank it between 5/10 and 6/10			"

												Fast, fun captital ship combat bound to a 2d plane just like Black Flag.  Procedurally generated universe that is different each time you play.  Great music, fantastic visuals.  Tons of upgrades and new ships to buy.  A surprisingly well-realized trading system that makes you money without being easily exploited.This game is 99% combat, and combat is a blast.  It's fun.  You're thinking, ""I need to grind out 2 million credits for that new engine"" and then you look at the clock and three hours have passed, you've made 5 million credits in bounties, and you didn't even notice because it was so engaging.

												This game is right on the brink of not recommending. In the end, it comes down to one thing: This game is really just about going from A to B and shooting badguys along the way. There is not enough depth, not enough immersion.. the gameplay simply doesn't have enough oomph to keep the game interesting. It's fixable though. Give us more meaningful story, more character, more depth. The core gameplay is fun.			"

												Firefly with aliens is a good description for this little gem. But with more guns and missles and aliens heh. I like the combat broadside ships blasting away at each other. Decide how you tackle your missions, rob, trade, or be a ""nice guy"" hah. Mining is boring don't bother it's about the combat and how you decide to deal with the npcs. Bribe you way out of a situation or charge ahead and blow them out of the sky.Side with factions or do your own thing. Top notch sound track, side missions are really just reused but the main plot is good. Large space to explore, but the travel can get a bit long. Overall if you like spaceships buy it.			"

												Very good 2D space sim, love the cinematic effects and all that. Only have a few gripes with it right now but im guessing they will be fixed1) The mouse. I dont know how exactly to explain it, but when you move the mouse, the mouse keeps moving for a second after you stop moving it. 2) Performance. I had a review of this up earlier complaining about it and a dev told me to make sure the correct card was being used which i did, and it still is...bleh. Somebody said it might have a data leak, so if that was fixed and it was optimized a bit, that might help.3) The turret. Whenever i go into precision aiming, the gun wiggles up and down and shoots randomly.Even with these complaints, ill give this game a 7/10. If they are fixed id say 8.5/10			"

												This game is Grindy, ok. But grinding in this game is SO MUCH FUN.you take command of a capital ship here, and engage with broadside type of engagement. The plane is 2D (game is 3D but you cannot go up or down), its not bad.Game is vissibly ported from Console, however, PC version doesn't seem to have any downsides than sometimes tricky controlls. At least on my rig.Music and setting is great. You end up in 'Western like cowboy rouge sector, with only your ship to count on. It gives you a great feel about dangers of space. Will you answer this distress beacon? It might be a trap !Faction system is also good, however they could merge citizents and militia to one faction, otherwise, you might have funny situations where merchants hate you cause you pirate them, but Navy still likes you. Well, that might not be a downside but dunno.Fighting with enemies is pure satisfaction. You get to kill ships in dozens, broadside or not (turrets&missiles are available)Simply get this game if you like capital ship solo-like west gun blazing game.			"

												I'm in two minds about this game.My greatest concern is the way it was ported to PC.  Firstly flying in a limited 2D plane of motion.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more freedom.  Secondly is the context-sensitive button and that practically everything is mapped to 'qweasd,' making both combat and UI awkward.  It is impossible to use a joystick.However I'll still give it a thumbs up because I played the buggery out of Freelancer, which has a similar feel but the battles are 1,000% more hardcore.  Sick slide guitar soundtrack, too!  Someone cross this game with Dreadnought, please!!			"

												The game gets boring pretty quick. It starts out fun, but it turns in to a terrible grind real quick. After awhile you are forced to take on the same missions over and over just to get enough cash to upgrade. Even then, the upgrades don't offer much variety. It's mostly going from MK I to MK II to MK III etc...After that, it's more grinding for more cash. The missions aren't even all that fun or memorable.The combat doesn't even require a whole heck of a lot of tactics, especially since the game only allows movement on 1 plane in what should be a 3d world (outer space and all that).It's a good game if it were cheap, but I wouldn't spend more than 5 space bucks.

												Do you like Firefly? Do you like flying around in a ship and blowing stuff up? Then buy this game.Play as a pirate, smuggler, merchant, miner, mercenary, soldier or any combination you like!The story is nothing to write home about, but this is mostly a space sandbox anyway. The game itself is absolutely gorgeous and an incredible pleasure to play. There are many different ship types to play around with and different weapon combinations to keep you interested for a good while. The little dinky tugboat you start out with isn't much, but it won't take you too long to throw some bigger guns on it and start slugging it out with the bigger ships.Ship flight is arcade-style and takes place in faux-3D space: that is to say smaller ships like fighters and bombers (which you don't pilot) fly around in 3D, but the bigger ships, from corvettes to dreadnaughts, stay on a 2D plane. Ships have turrets and you can pick up a hireable strike-craft to help you out, but most of the firepower is concentrated in naval-style broadside weaponry.Difficulty is mostly linear and is determined by the tier of your equipment, not the size of your ship, so you're not forced to play a huge, sluggish battleship if you don't want to (or don't want to save up for it.) Some people have complained about the ""risk estimate"" for certain missions being a little inaccurate, but I haven't really had any issues with it provided I upgrade my equipment properly and am not afraid to bug out when the going gets tough.Default soundtrack is great - a pleasureable selection of hard rock music that fits the tone of the game. You can add your own music, or replace the whole soundtrack altogether if you want. Controls are smooth, with the occasional futzing required with overlapping cargo containers (protip: use your targetting scanner to lock onto the container you want.) Graphics are absolutely stunning and the sound effects are top notch.Definitely worth picking up this gem!			"

												this game was great.  lots of action.  The ship designs were really unique and cool.  The colors and special effects are really nice too.  Its way more of an arcade space game,  not very simulation.  Thats what i like about it.  You pretty much spend more time fighting and blowing up ships than doing anything else.  Really fun to play			"

												Fun space game.  Similar to Freelancer with fewer systems and bigger ships.+Great audio and visuals.  The ships all look nice and have options.+Living universe.  You can save or attack miners and traders.  You encounter pirates fighting militia or other pirates.+Open sandbox, do what you want.  Campaign is optional.  About 60-70 hours of play for campaign and all achievements.-Campaign is short.  No vertical movement.  I have only minor complaints.Overall, great space game.

												Things I absolutely love about Rebel Galaxy:1. Broadside Combat2. 4x (light) Space Sim with tight controls on a controller3. Excellent graphics, gameplay, and a decient story4. Impressive amount of content for the asking price.Things I absolutely despise about Rebel Galaxy:1. Scaled EnemiesReally this is the only thing keeping me from recommending the game. It has so much going for it, but the deeper I got into the game, the more it gave me this overwelming hatered of grinding for gear and ships that perform the same since the enemies will automatically get harder. I felt like I will never beat Rebel Galaxy and it would only allow me to finish it... at some point, and that makes Rebel Galaxy feel like a waste of time.You don't even realize that this is a problem until it is too late and now you have to ""game the system"" in order to play it the way it wants you to.2. Saving at portsThis last point would not anger me so much if the game didn't have Scaled Enemies. "

												This game is Grindy, ok. But grinding in this game is SO MUCH FUN.you take command of a capital ship here, and engage with broadside type of engagement. The plane is 2D (game is 3D but you cannot go up or down), its not bad.Game is vissibly ported from Console, however, PC version doesn't seem to have any downsides than sometimes tricky controlls. At least on my rig.Music and setting is great. You end up in 'Western like cowboy rouge sector, with only your ship to count on. It gives you a great feel about dangers of space. Will you answer this distress beacon? It might be a trap !Faction system is also good, however they could merge citizents and militia to one faction, otherwise, you might have funny situations where merchants hate you cause you pirate them, but Navy still likes you. Well, that might not be a downside but dunno.Fighting with enemies is pure satisfaction. You get to kill ships in dozens, broadside or not (turrets&missiles are available)Simply get this game if you like capital ship solo-like west gun blazing game.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun expansive space game that sacrifices complete freedom and dogfighting to bring something completely new to the table, which is fun and uniquePros: -Areas feel big and look wonderful-Awesome music which adds a bit of a Mad Max feel (my opinion)-Ship combat which reminds strongly combat in pirate games (hence swashbuckling adventure) which requires maneuvering to let shields recover or attack another angle of the enemy that's more vulnerable and using ""deflectors"" to absorb damage in an emergency-Fully voice acted with only a few quircky lines and many alien dialects-huge variety of weapons and defence mechanisms to choose from which can change gameplay, especially the ""broadside"" weapons-Possibility to either be lawful or piraty which will make some outposts hate you and others accept you-Trade or fight and/or join certain factions which have unique ships or items-You can engage Warp at almost any point and do not have to travel to some gate unless you go to a different starsystem-An interesting story around your Aunt and a certain object she uncovered...Cons:-You are limited to a 2D Plane, same as for the big enemy ships but not the fighters. Can feel limiting, ESPECIALLY when you have something thats below you, like an asteroid you want to laser to get to the goodies inside but your turret is on top so you have to maneuver in a way so that it reaches-Combat most of the time is just firing broadside weapons, managing your other turrets in combat is not viable-The camera is almost impossible to control unless you switch to broadsides. Game knows this and hints at it but it can take some getting used to especially during mining-Nearly EVERYTHING is automated. Meaning, for example, that if you want to engage ""Warp"" you have to wait for the game to give you the go ahead after you travelled for x distance. And retrieving a specific piece of cargo between many is really hard to do.-Controller is, as far as I can see, required.-The ""Warp"" will not get you to your destination immediately so you can sit back and wait until you arrive. Many time you have to almost drift out of the way of nebulas and asteroid fields. Its  easy to dodge but it can get annoying. If this makes the warping more interesting or annoying is up for debate. (I personally do not mind TOO much but I would want to sit back and let the game take me there without me doing anything sometimes)Overall: I like this game a lot. I played Freelancer and loved the heck out of that game too. And I noticed that even though you were not restricted to a 2d plane and it was dogfighting and not ship to ship combat in that game, I get a similar vibe from this game too.You DEFINITELY get your moneys worth.

												Now this game is solid FUN! Period! I'm an emotional gamer so for me what makes or breaks a game is the FEELING a game emotes. It does not have to be perfect next gen graphics, or super solid gameplay, or the most original story ever. If it feels right and gives enjoyement then it's a success for me. Now obviously all previously mentioned things add up to the overall feel of a game. However they are like spice and are not the sole source of the 'magic' of a game. The cornerstone needs to be set right with a game or the whole building will start sinking crooked. For me this elusive thing in games is the feeling they magically either have or don't have. Take this game for example. It does not have award winning graphics or plot or even character development. It does not have a particularly interesting story and the game makes no pretentions of it either. This game is not trying to be serious about itself and that my friends is what made a movie called tremors such a great fun flick in it's time. Solid practical effects, avoiding tongue in cheek direction or story for that matter is what made that movie have a great FEEL to it. Same here. By looking on this game's merits on paper by all means this should be a flop, but it's completely and utterly the opposite! This is why people betting on money and calculating companies trying to bank a bazillion of whatever currency they can get a hold of, will never see the light of day how to make a good solid fun entertainment! All I can say is, try this game out if you are a person like me and care for the overall feeling of a gameplay experience. The good thing this game has on paper is it's soundtrack :D Perfect campy fun in a great way! However no game is perfect and hardly is this title here. This game is EASY to get into, but after awhile it becomes a grindtastic repetitive romp with not so good AI. Beware of these things if you are easily turned off. It did not turn me off so much because the overall easiness and feeling the game churns out kept me at it enjoying getting better ships and weaponry. I am a casual gamer and I appreciate when a game is this accessible. However of course it would be great if this game had more depth and polish into it as it progresses or the main quest line is exhausted. The devs could maybe make DLC for this title? Anyway I'm certainly looking for a sequel that tackles more with this titles shortcomings. I loved freelancer and was immediately at home with this one. Besides freelancer was not so much more complex gameplaywise as this one is. Fond memories tend to get golden in time. I liked this one, so maybe give it a cautious try if you liked freelancer..			"

												Damn fun space sim. Don't expect the best character models, voice acting, or story...but that's not why you're here. Wanna be a space pirate? Wanna roam the galaxy in your ship, blow stuff up, and make money? This is the game. That said: - I'd love to be able to actually pirate a ship. If you manage to disable vs. destory (ala EV NOVA), then you could board the craft and have a chance to loot it OR take the ship over completely. Use it as your ship, or as an escort in your fleet. I would never stop playing this game.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a very entertaining adventure space 'simulator'.  More adventure than Elite Dangerous and easier to jump into for a quick session.  Many aspects of the game are similar to Elite Dangerous, but in RG you only move in two demensions instead of all three.  But the 2 dimensions of movement is implemented in a way that doesn't leave me missing the 3rd dimension.  A bit more arcade than a space simulator, but you don't have to worry about dealing with the real-size of space and how long it takes to navigate it as you do in Elite D. (but that's one of the things I often enjoy about Elite!).Well worth the price and I can see myself getting many hours of enjoyment from this game!			"

												This is the game I've been looking for since Freelancer. Combat takes place on capital ships, so don't expect to be pulling off sweet manuevres or Luke in the Death Star trench stuff. The whole premise of the game is that you're looking for pieces of a puzzle first introduced by your enigmatic aunt, along the way you undertake missions and♥♥♥♥♥♥off all the pirates in the sector to the point you can't dock anywhere any more. I came to this off the back of Elite Dangerous, and have been completely satisfied. High risk missions pay more money (hauling huge munitions cargos into the middle of a siege is immensly rewarding), and you have full freedom to do whatever you want and explore the galaxy. Combat is usually pretty fluid, though learning to balance your weapons and deflectors takes a little practice, and the broadside based combat may not be everyone's cup of tea.			"

												If you like the idea of EVE / Elite:Dangerous but tried playing both and thought... I can't be arsed. Then play this instead.Basically it's like an Indie Freelancer, this would be the closest game you could compare it to. Yes it is not a 'space simulator' but what it does give you is turrets that you can just give targeting orders to... which i think is awesome and a suedo tactical battle if you use the scan function to effectively pause the game and think out a strategy. I have played this game for several hours and have many more hours of gameplay left. Mining is... well mining but it has been done quite well. Battles are fun but it is a bit of a 'I have bigger guns and better shields' fight more than anything. Trading actually works!Basically if you enjoyed Freelancer buy this, if you are drawn to 'Elite' type games but ultimately you've tried things like X, Elite:D and EVE and just couldn't be bothered with the time investment and complication then buy this. If you like to wear a long brown jacket and insist that your girlfriend calls you Mal... buy this.I personally would just plain recommend you buy this!9/10 - Could be more variation with stations and objects. Music is great but repetitive. Wish I could have a fleet not just one ship.			"

												Massively under-rated game. Basically, this is a much more approachable version of Elite: Dangerous and the X:Rebirth series. Those games are more of a project, whereas Rebel Galaxy is more of an actual game.One thing to realize about the game is that there is no z axis, which means that you don't go up and down. Yes, the fighters are going to swarm around you from all angles, but you don't aim your broadsides up and down... the computer does the up and down for you. The broadsides take a little getting used to, but once you do you'll be blasting fools in no time.Super highly recommended			"

If all that does not sell you go look up the sound track and listen to it ... ""I'm Captian Reynold and if you've got a job don't much care what it is.""			"

												A more casual space game that instanlty made me think of Firefly, the music helps with that, which is amazing. It feels very much like a sea game in its dynamics only allowing movement in the 2D and fireing with broadsides, but the game is not brought down by this but enhanced. I have only had an hour with the game so far but first impressions are great, with a well presented main story, as well as random encounters I can tell I am going to enjoy this game. I'm a sucker for any space game but this one puts a different spin on the genre, definetly for any space enthusiast.			"

												If you like the idea of EVE / Elite:Dangerous but tried playing both and thought... I can't be arsed. Then play this instead.Basically it's like an Indie Freelancer, this would be the closest game you could compare it to. Yes it is not a 'space simulator' but what it does give you is turrets that you can just give targeting orders to... which i think is awesome and a suedo tactical battle if you use the scan function to effectively pause the game and think out a strategy. I have played this game for several hours and have many more hours of gameplay left. Mining is... well mining but it has been done quite well. Battles are fun but it is a bit of a 'I have bigger guns and better shields' fight more than anything. Trading actually works!Basically if you enjoyed Freelancer buy this, if you are drawn to 'Elite' type games but ultimately you've tried things like X, Elite:D and EVE and just couldn't be bothered with the time investment and complication then buy this. If you like to wear a long brown jacket and insist that your girlfriend calls you Mal... buy this.I personally would just plain recommend you buy this!9/10 - Could be more variation with stations and objects. Music is great but repetitive. Wish I could have a fleet not just one ship.			"

												Massively under-rated game. Basically, this is a much more approachable version of Elite: Dangerous and the X:Rebirth series. Those games are more of a project, whereas Rebel Galaxy is more of an actual game.One thing to realize about the game is that there is no z axis, which means that you don't go up and down. Yes, the fighters are going to swarm around you from all angles, but you don't aim your broadsides up and down... the computer does the up and down for you. The broadsides take a little getting used to, but once you do you'll be blasting fools in no time.Super highly recommended			"

												Only just starting, but that game so far is super catchy. Had to take a break from overwatch to play this and witcher 3. The music is really sweet and fits the whole adventure theme of the game. My first battle outside of the tutorial I got stomped though fighting 3 ships which was kind of annoying although I did escape wihtout dying by some miracle and warping to tthe awesome sountrack. Combat is broadside style in the spirit of AC:3/4 and is quite fun. Looking forward to really diving in but didnt want people to miss the 50% off sale. Refunded SPAZ 2 for this lol			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a fun expansive space game that sacrifices complete freedom and dogfighting to bring something completely new to the table, which is fun and uniquePros: -Areas feel big and look wonderful-Awesome music which adds a bit of a Mad Max feel (my opinion)-Ship combat which reminds strongly combat in pirate games (hence swashbuckling adventure) which requires maneuvering to let shields recover or attack another angle of the enemy that's more vulnerable and using ""deflectors"" to absorb damage in an emergency-Fully voice acted with only a few quircky lines and many alien dialects-huge variety of weapons and defence mechanisms to choose from which can change gameplay, especially the ""broadside"" weapons-Possibility to either be lawful or piraty which will make some outposts hate you and others accept you-Trade or fight and/or join certain factions which have unique ships or items-You can engage Warp at almost any point and do not have to travel to some gate unless you go to a different starsystem-An interesting story around your Aunt and a certain object she uncovered...Cons:-You are limited to a 2D Plane, same as for the big enemy ships but not the fighters. Can feel limiting, ESPECIALLY when you have something thats below you, like an asteroid you want to laser to get to the goodies inside but your turret is on top so you have to maneuver in a way so that it reaches-Combat most of the time is just firing broadside weapons, managing your other turrets in combat is not viable-The camera is almost impossible to control unless you switch to broadsides. Game knows this and hints at it but it can take some getting used to especially during mining-Nearly EVERYTHING is automated. Meaning, for example, that if you want to engage ""Warp"" you have to wait for the game to give you the go ahead after you travelled for x distance. And retrieving a specific piece of cargo between many is really hard to do.-Controller is, as far as I can see, required.-The ""Warp"" will not get you to your destination immediately so you can sit back and wait until you arrive. Many time you have to almost drift out of the way of nebulas and asteroid fields. Its  easy to dodge but it can get annoying. If this makes the warping more interesting or annoying is up for debate. (I personally do not mind TOO much but I would want to sit back and let the game take me there without me doing anything sometimes)Overall: I like this game a lot. I played Freelancer and loved the heck out of that game too. And I noticed that even though you were not restricted to a 2d plane and it was dogfighting and not ship to ship combat in that game, I get a similar vibe from this game too.You DEFINITELY get your moneys worth.

												Now this game is solid FUN! Period! I'm an emotional gamer so for me what makes or breaks a game is the FEELING a game emotes. It does not have to be perfect next gen graphics, or super solid gameplay, or the most original story ever. If it feels right and gives enjoyement then it's a success for me. Now obviously all previously mentioned things add up to the overall feel of a game. However they are like spice and are not the sole source of the 'magic' of a game. The cornerstone needs to be set right with a game or the whole building will start sinking crooked. For me this elusive thing in games is the feeling they magically either have or don't have. Take this game for example. It does not have award winning graphics or plot or even character development. It does not have a particularly interesting story and the game makes no pretentions of it either. This game is not trying to be serious about itself and that my friends is what made a movie called tremors such a great fun flick in it's time. Solid practical effects, avoiding tongue in cheek direction or story for that matter is what made that movie have a great FEEL to it. Same here. By looking on this game's merits on paper by all means this should be a flop, but it's completely and utterly the opposite! This is why people betting on money and calculating companies trying to bank a bazillion of whatever currency they can get a hold of, will never see the light of day how to make a good solid fun entertainment! All I can say is, try this game out if you are a person like me and care for the overall feeling of a gameplay experience. The good thing this game has on paper is it's soundtrack :D Perfect campy fun in a great way! However no game is perfect and hardly is this title here. This game is EASY to get into, but after awhile it becomes a grindtastic repetitive romp with not so good AI. Beware of these things if you are easily turned off. It did not turn me off so much because the overall easiness and feeling the game churns out kept me at it enjoying getting better ships and weaponry. I am a casual gamer and I appreciate when a game is this accessible. However of course it would be great if this game had more depth and polish into it as it progresses or the main quest line is exhausted. The devs could maybe make DLC for this title? Anyway I'm certainly looking for a sequel that tackles more with this titles shortcomings. I loved freelancer and was immediately at home with this one. Besides freelancer was not so much more complex gameplaywise as this one is. Fond memories tend to get golden in time. I liked this one, so maybe give it a cautious try if you liked freelancer..			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a very entertaining adventure space 'simulator'.  More adventure than Elite Dangerous and easier to jump into for a quick session.  Many aspects of the game are similar to Elite Dangerous, but in RG you only move in two demensions instead of all three.  But the 2 dimensions of movement is implemented in a way that doesn't leave me missing the 3rd dimension.  A bit more arcade than a space simulator, but you don't have to worry about dealing with the real-size of space and how long it takes to navigate it as you do in Elite D. (but that's one of the things I often enjoy about Elite!).Well worth the price and I can see myself getting many hours of enjoyment from this game!			"

												I'm sure someone has already said something like this, but it's sort of like playing a game version of that television show Firefly (or that movie Serenity).It's fun, but I read elsewhere that it's really not 3-dimensional, it's like... 2.5-dimensional. That aspect is a little peculiar, but doesn't really affect anything in the long run.It's fun. When I have more time, I look forward to playing it. Teachers always have free time in the summer!			"

												Overall a really good, polished game.  The mechanics and controls are simple enough to master, but equipment is varied enough to pose interesting choices.  The story is not a bad one, and you do get options at certain points to do things your own way.You probably won't play through more than once, but I felt satisfied that one enjoyable playthrough was worth the price of the game.

												This is a very well made game. An almost Freelancer style game with simple mechanics that make learning quick and fun. The missions you take can be legal or illegal - bounty hunter, merchant, smuggler, miner, thief, and so forth. Combat is satisfying and engaging, though a bit over the top at times and occasionally downright impossible until you have had further equipment upgrades. Once purchased though, the difficulty lowers.The commodity system was great! This was one of the most satisfying games for being a merchant I've ever played. Watch for starvation and run them food from an agrarian planet. Take water from one system that is rich in it to a more barren system and earn 200% or more than what you bought it for. Took a little getting use to, and I still don't understand it all, but the overall mechanic is satisfying once you get an idea of it.My only gripe is it needs more content. After the main story is over, you have the biggest Dreadnaugh, and you are fully upgraded, doing missions is a little pointless. The devs should open it up for modding. More ships, weapons, equipment, systems, etc., etc., and this game would be more than a hoot.Definitely worth the $20. The game is great and a definite recommend, even if it's for a few story runs only.			"

												Now this game is solid FUN! Period! I'm an emotional gamer so for me what makes or breaks a game is the FEELING a game emotes. It does not have to be perfect next gen graphics, or super solid gameplay, or the most original story ever. If it feels right and gives enjoyement then it's a success for me. Now obviously all previously mentioned things add up to the overall feel of a game. However they are like spice and are not the sole source of the 'magic' of a game. The cornerstone needs to be set right with a game or the whole building will start sinking crooked. For me this elusive thing in games is the feeling they magically either have or don't have. Take this game for example. It does not have award winning graphics or plot or even character development. It does not have a particularly interesting story and the game makes no pretentions of it either. This game is not trying to be serious about itself and that my friends is what made a movie called tremors such a great fun flick in it's time. Solid practical effects, avoiding tongue in cheek direction or story for that matter is what made that movie have a great FEEL to it. Same here. By looking on this game's merits on paper by all means this should be a flop, but it's completely and utterly the opposite! This is why people betting on money and calculating companies trying to bank a bazillion of whatever currency they can get a hold of, will never see the light of day how to make a good solid fun entertainment! All I can say is, try this game out if you are a person like me and care for the overall feeling of a gameplay experience. The good thing this game has on paper is it's soundtrack :D Perfect campy fun in a great way! However no game is perfect and hardly is this title here. This game is EASY to get into, but after awhile it becomes a grindtastic repetitive romp with not so good AI. Beware of these things if you are easily turned off. It did not turn me off so much because the overall easiness and feeling the game churns out kept me at it enjoying getting better ships and weaponry. I am a casual gamer and I appreciate when a game is this accessible. However of course it would be great if this game had more depth and polish into it as it progresses or the main quest line is exhausted. The devs could maybe make DLC for this title? Anyway I'm certainly looking for a sequel that tackles more with this titles shortcomings. I loved freelancer and was immediately at home with this one. Besides freelancer was not so much more complex gameplaywise as this one is. Fond memories tend to get golden in time. I liked this one, so maybe give it a cautious try if you liked freelancer..			"

												Damn fun space sim. Don't expect the best character models, voice acting, or story...but that's not why you're here. Wanna be a space pirate? Wanna roam the galaxy in your ship, blow stuff up, and make money? This is the game. That said: - I'd love to be able to actually pirate a ship. If you manage to disable vs. destory (ala EV NOVA), then you could board the craft and have a chance to loot it OR take the ship over completely. Use it as your ship, or as an escort in your fleet. I would never stop playing this game.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a very entertaining adventure space 'simulator'.  More adventure than Elite Dangerous and easier to jump into for a quick session.  Many aspects of the game are similar to Elite Dangerous, but in RG you only move in two demensions instead of all three.  But the 2 dimensions of movement is implemented in a way that doesn't leave me missing the 3rd dimension.  A bit more arcade than a space simulator, but you don't have to worry about dealing with the real-size of space and how long it takes to navigate it as you do in Elite D. (but that's one of the things I often enjoy about Elite!).Well worth the price and I can see myself getting many hours of enjoyment from this game!			"

												Rebel Galaxy was initialy hard to play, the controls felt wierd and until I got my settings right the framerate wasn't great, but after fixing the settings and about two hours this became one of the best games I have ever played. Top five for sure. Basicly think of what it would be like if Empire at War's space battles weren't RTS, or if Battle Star Galactica Online wasn't for wallet warriors and wasn't unbalanced. The locked plane and broadside combat keeps the game simple and exciting and totally un-clunky, although sometimes the menus can be a bit difficult.The ship designs are great too, especially the underated Sorcerer dreadnought (my personal favorite ship, by far) although sometimes the AI targeting gets confused due to the ship's geometry, which was fixed with the sorcerer for the main part but makes the McKinley my least favorite ship so far.Aliens in this game also have good design by being Lovecraftian fish people or rad badger dudes and they all feel Star Wars inspired and combined with the hailing system also add a sort of Star Trek feel.Overall, the game is initially daunting and difficult to get used to, but after you've given it a chance it is absolutely great.

												This game likes to stretch itself out. Normally i don't mind a game that takes me a long time to complete. I like feeling as if i got my money's worth. Good games (like Witcher 3) do this by giving you hours upon hours of enjoyable content and interesting plot. Rebel Galaxy stretches itself out by creating a vast emptiness between everypoint and making your speed very very slow. I get it, it's space, there is supposed to be an emptiness, vast distances between places. So what's the point of giving me a warp drive (one that no matter how much you upgrade still seems slow as hell) if it's still going to take me two minutes to reach anywhere i want to go, and that's only if i'm lucky enough to not get stopped by a group of pirates or an asteroid field. I've spent 17 hours playing this game, the majority of it was spent in transit. All the tension this game gave me was not from space battles or plot development, but instead the worry of wether or not i would reach the next objective anytime soon.If you want to pretend to be a space trucker hauling cargo for days on end, just to afford better gear to slowly move the story forward. then this game is for you.If you're looking for fun, and excitement, look elsewhere.

												A game without any need for a player. You make no decisions- just follow a waypoint indicator to the next mission. You don't aim, your weapons autoaim and some of them autofire. There is no terrain, occassional asteroids dot the map but they don't effect combat much. Every set of enemies feels identical - there is no variety whatsoever. The game is played strictly on a 2d plane. The only tactic I ever had to use was kite enemies from long range if I was overwhelmed (which was very rare).  Weapon variety is low and upgrade progression is linear. The music quickly becomes dull, mostly twangy country music. Not a lot of variety. The graphics are nice and ships show damage decalls when hit. There is a big variety in ship size and appearance. It would be nice if a ship 10 times my own ship's size was intimidating at all I guess.Perhaps most telling is the components present in the game. There's a lot of opportunity here, perhaps there could be a part that doubles your speed and halves your shields. Instead all of them give marginal benefits to your ship (like a 10% increase in turning speed). These components are all expensive, requiring more than a dozen missions of farming to get. The entire game is a grind with no need for a player. Why couldn't you find something for me to do Rebel Galaxy?			"

												The lack of autosave after completing missions makes playing this game tedious and obnoxious. There's no way to run a string of missions and save in between each finished mission. You either have to dock at a space station, which could be very far away, or you have to exit and then restart the game. Why this game saves on exit but allows absolutely no other means to manually save this game is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and play a different game that won't constantly rollback all of your progress.			"

A few good moments strung together with lots of crappy travelling around (I would love to hear the designer's view as to why asteroid fields stop warp speed.... seriously. It sucks). Samey missions, more travelling, and more than a few ropey balancing issues (you often get whacked as the step ups between enemy levelling is steep. It's not a big deal.. it just means, yup.. more travelling.).  Overall, it's not the new sliced bread, or Freelancer or Elite, or.. You know, actually, it's just a ok-ish game.

												First game in 11 years on Steam that I've requested a refund.Contrary to what you may read from the starry-eyed youngsters spamming out blue thumbs, this is not a scion of Privateer.  This is a fourth generation knock-off of Privateer designed for the ADD crowd.  The combat is simplistic, mindless, and confusing.  The map scale is tiny.  The... well, if you loved Privateer, you know where I'm headed here.On the bright side, the developers do understand something that most designers of modern free-form space combat/trading games often miss entirely:  Privateer was a huge success because of its atmosphere and ""you are there"" feeling.  They nailed that part.  Too bad the rest of it sucks skunk sacs.Rather than spend cash on this thing, just give it to Chris Roberts to work on his latest game.

												Naval style combat is good and fun, and it works... if you have a top down view. Unfortunately with Rebel Galaxy it's not a top down view and you can't ever seen where you are aiming or where the enemy ship is. So you never get a hit, you always miss. And by the time you realise you wasted money buying this game, your ship isn't a ship anymore, it's space debris. So fun! Not. Simple design mechanics are overlooked by the developer of this game. They clearly didn't test the game before they went into it and are trying to break even before anyone who doesn't own the game yet realises it's too hard to succeed for a casual game to be fun.			"

Also seeing negative for limited ships. I've seen at lease 20. There are special rep ships and different ships in higher level zones so there seems to be plenty of variation there.I will say that the side missions are starting to get a bit grindy. There are about 12-15 different variations sometimes with a bit of extra flavor like ""Destroy damaged pirate frigate, reports say port broadside batteries are down""			"

												Runtime Error. a new game of 10-20 minutes from double damage. in this game, if you can, you will encounter subpar voice recording; a map system that you cannot search because consoles don't have keyboards; and random game crashes [in existance since release] that affect a lot of people.seriously, this game crashes for tons of people; you get a runtime error and your graphics drivers crash. but before that happens you'll enounter voiceovers that buzz from low quality microphones, others that echo from being recorded in rooms with little, to none, sound baffeling. you may even get to use the poorly ported games map system which leaves tons to be desired from.got problems? well double damage is so poor they have no forum, so clicking on any links steam provides won't take you anywhere so you'll have to search google and find their page which redirects you to steam after it redirects you from double damages unexistant studio page(yaye for godaddy placeholders). you will find that the dev mostly engaged in futile redirections for your issue, and sure enough, failed to fix the issues probably because his little nestegg was designed to farm consoles for a quick buck and he has no real skill at diagnosing the problem; indeed the game doesn't even file error reports.i'm sure loads of you will have no problem, you'll most likely neg my review; but i can't recomend a game i can't play for more then 20 minutes, one that only saves in stations, one with poor quality sound, an epic level of underdesign(freelancer, yeah, right), and one in which the dev obviously is another indy wallet farm. there is plenty of games from active developers, i'm just going to get a refund. but if you're feeling lucky, go ahead.

												There is one part of this game that is so frustrating it forces me to not reccommend it. The escort quests. Their randomized nature means that your route can, and occasionally will lead through the thickest part of an asteroid field or a massive battlefield of dreadnaughts. What was supposed to be a simple mission can become insanely difficult or mind-numbingly tedious as you have to slaughter your way through monsters or slowly atomize mountains. Ugh.			"

												The control scheme and game mechanics for combat and controls are very cumbersome.  This game is not a first person simulator but forces your camera view to behave like one.    You can't exactly lock your camera to a top down view  and still hope to actually do any fighting at the same time since it is heavily dependant on your camera to be swerving around to the sides of the ship to enable attacking/aiming/shooting.The 'rpg' adventure aspect is very shallow/empty.  It's just one big fetch/delivery/grind with no depth to the world.			"

												So I've had this game for a couple of days and have a dozen hours on it or so and my overal impression is 'meh' with a side of 'boring'.I found the start of the game very infuriating, the controls didn't work on a laptop (although they were fine when I reconfigured them). But combat is still a pain, many of the actions you can perform while flying demand the camera to be facing a certain direction and you can't steer you're ship while simultaneously aiming a broadside. But that's kind of OK, it just means that the game is aimed at beginers of this genre. It does do somethings well, like having shields and armour go down on different parts of the ship independently. Would be nice if they could also be upgraded independently.Which brings me to my biggest gripe about the game. Upgrading your ship is dull. You have only a handful of options per part, which then go from Mk1 to Mk2 to Mk3, etc... Doesn't feel like an accomplishment to have my top speed under boost increase by 10%. Add to that that every battle feels the same (unless there are some unseen possible tactics I haven't come across) and the world is bland.Basically, when ever I played this game only one thought crossed my mind ""Why am I not playing X3: Terran Conflict ?"". It's not a perfect game by far, but it has all the depth that Rebel Galaxy lacks. It's not that it's a bad game, it just isn't interesting enough for me to make it fun. Perhaps the plot could have rescued it, but after 10h it is also boring and repetitive "

												The vast majority of reviews are quite decieving for this game, in that they paint a picture for this game that makes it seem like more than it really is.The 2D naval combat and the camera that's way too close makes the game feel extremely small and claustrophobic and makes combat a nuisance at best, and on top of the terrible camera, the heavy amounts of aim assist make it very dull, tracking your shots hardly matters since your shots effectively home in on the target so long as you're in range and have charged your broadside shots and the turrets are literally an autolock and fire themselves when you're in broadside mode.The controls and functionality are very off-putting as well, this game was very obviously made for consoles and wasn't properly ported to PC, there are no options in game, only a settings launcher that pops up before you enter the game so if you want to change anything at all you have to restart the game before you can. Keyboard and mouse controls feel pretty slip and slide too.Finally there's all the comparisons to Freelancer I want to put to bed.I played Freelancer for hours, probably hundreds of hours, I absolutely ADORED Freelancer, it was the ideal space sim for a plebian like me, nice and simple and really pretty while still feeling like it's in space.This however is no Freelancer.The combat is way too basic, the movement is way too restricted, the world is far too claustrophobic. Everythings packed and squeezed into this tiny 2D space where the concept of up and down are alien to the player character.Sorry Freelancer fans, you're gonna have to keep going without.Overall this game's pretty naff.It should have been a Naval game.

												Even biying this game at discount price, I cannot see the reason for this game. Can you get a refund because the gameplay is terrible?Your vessel is limited to movement in 2D, howeer, your cnnonn fire, your enemies and otherr objects occupy a 3D space. This might not be so bad except the camera is extremely poor and seems to mostly cater for your 2D plane.Also, what the heck is this broadside nonesene? It might make sense in open space, but getting attacked in an asteroid belt, trying to use broad sides seems to involve crashing into obstacles. Stupid!Talking of being attacked, warping to low risk missions at the start seems to often involve running into enemies far superior to yourself. If you cannot escape, you are screwed. This is even more annoying when you have just completed a crappy mission.Talking of crappy missions, they are mostly that, crappy. Fly to point A, destroy stuff, job done. In the beginning, there seems to be very little variety to these missions. Maybe the odd colletion job, more yawn...All the positive reviews seem to come from players whi have played this a number of hours, while the opposite seems true for the negative ones? Is it the intro \ early game which is so poor? I will try to give it some more time.			"

												A shallow main story coupled with repetative side missions make this game a stinker. Side mission types: take this here, take this guy here, kill that guy there. Bigger ships just get more turrets, broadsides, and nigh useless, expensive and selectable components. A small corvette feels the same as a giant cruiser. There is about 15 different weapons with more expensive ""Mk"" versions offering slightly higher damage or cooldown buffs as the game progresses (Blaster Mk.1, Blaster Mk.2 ... ad nauseum). You get stuck on story missions due to enemy difficulty; go grind so you can do the next main mission. Repeat. The limited ship customization, boring weapon choices, and repetative tasks make this game a snoozefest. There may be life out there in a galaxy far, far away, but it isn't this one. grindfest/10			"

												Fun game, awesome concept thats been executed very well.Only issue I have with this game is the random difficulty jumps. I am still in the starting area moving between super easy quests in my little ship that im proud of. All of a sudden I get dropped out of light speed next to 3 MASSIVE ships with 10 fighters each. I die in about 30secs. I cant run away because you cant go into lightspeed with enemies around so you just get shot to pieces. The game goes back to main menu and you load in your last save which will be the last space station you visited. That could be 5mins prior or like the 5th time for me 30mins prior.There is no way to avoid these random encounters they have been happening all over the place for me. I dont mind too much its just really time consuming doing the same section over and over again.			"

												This game scratched an itch in me that I didn't really know was there until I played it. It isn't your traditional fare, and the game streamlines the experience of being a space captain. That said it plays like Firefly meets Pirates of the Caribbean. If you never have enjoyed playing games where you line up broadsides and enjoy the sweet victory as your enemy crumples under your withering fire...you might not like this game. If you do, and you like your universe dipped in hard whisky with plenty of grit on the side this game might be just your thing.The Good:Ship combat is fast and furious, with most engagements and missions being over in a couple of minutes. Swarms of fighters, dancing beam weapons, and volleys of missiles light up the fights; all coming at you and maybe the poor sap you hired to protect you. Meanwhile you use a deflector (timed extra shield), main shields, and your armor to protect the innards of your ship while trying to line up a broadside as your turrets pick away at your opponent's shields. Because once someone is down to armor, it doesn't take that long before they are nothing be space dust.Trading, while simple, is still deep enough to enjoy. There is also mining, bounty hunting, distress calls (and ambushes), dead drop missions, and more to enjoy. You can spend hours alone in the first system building up reputation and your ship before stepping out into the wider galaxy...and you just might.The Bad:As much fun as the combat can be, it sometimes falls a little heavily on your gear as to whether you can engage in that fight or not. Thankfully the game does a good job of tracking the threat level as to your chances of pulling off the fight or whether you need to pass or run away. Which even with a medium frigate all in top gear for the first system I'm finding I'm doing more running then fighting...yet. Mission boards also give you a threat level when you take them so you know you aren't walking into a complete curb stomp, but you will feel the sting of defeat if you don't pay attention and especially if you aren't willing to run away until your ship and equipment is more up to the task.The other issue some might take is that this is all on a 2-D plane. So you don't go up or down with your ship, however fighters and objectives such an mine-able asteroids can be go/be off this plane. Turrets can handle these threats, but only if they can fire in that arc. As I discovered in mining however, you might need more then one of the expensive mining lasers to reach an asteroid depending on the turret placement and ship. They have a decent reach and make excellent short range beam weapons, but mining can be a pain and for as much investment you have to put into your ship to set it up to do right that can lead to some frustration.The Ugly:Unfortunately the game doesn't feel like it's fleshed out ship wise. There are 21 ships you can supposedly fly over the course of the game, and about half of those will be available to you from the start, a few more unlocked by leaving the first system, and a handful unlocked by faction reputation. It would have been nice to see some heavy armored and fast gunships, or some lighter armored glass cannons. There is a class of ship called 'strike craft' which seems to drop off by the end of the first system. The fighting can also get a little formulaic over time. I find running while my turrets pick off the fighters before engaging the larger ships to be the best road to success. Trading also can be a pain until you stumble upon the transponder that allows you to see the commodities of stations across the map without having to first dock at them.Verdict:If you enjoy broadsides and want a new type of scenario for your space faring adventures, this game might be just what you are looking for. If being a captain of a capital class ship isn't your cup of tea, then you still might want to pick it up on a sale. I recommend even at full price.			"

												I really wanted to like Rebel Galaxy. Being a Space trader? Check. Decent graphics? Check. Mostly voiced characters? Surprise Check. And there seems to be a pretty good game in there. BUT...I was not able to play the game due to the clunky ""Broadside""/action sequences. I would have liked an option to turn on an A.I. ""Gun crew"" to handle all combat as an RPG player. Even the Broadside. As it turned out, after I bought Rebel Galaxy, Steam had a ""similar game"" recommendation at the bottom.  It is a free game that was more of what I was looking for playstyle-wise. So now I play that and Rebel Galaxy sits untouched. I rate it 2 stars out of five for potential I was not able to tap.	 "

												Probably the closest thing to a Firefly game we'll probably get. One of the most remarkable things is how much freedom you have. Wanna be a roaming lawbringer helping traders and the local Militia? You can do that. Wanna be a smuggler sneaking contraband under the nose of the local authorities. Go right ahead! Hell, do you wanna make money shrewdly analyzing market prices system wide and raking in the profit. Then take it its yours! Granted you will sometimes run across enemies that can spank you from here to the end of the galaxy and have to run and to be honest I'm just fine with that. It makes you feel like you're really part of this larger galaxy, you're not the end all be all, just another spacer wandering the galaxy. See you later space cowboy.P.S- That soundtrack is baller as hell.			"

												Does not start on Mac OS Mavericks. Many people who do not want to upgrade to Mac OS ElCapitan for valid reasons have reported about this problem since early October 2015 and until now, 8 months later, this is not fixed. There are some hacks in some forums that helped some people but not all of them (including me). This is really bad service, as the problem seems to be quite simple to fix from the producers' side (make their launcher start in full screen without using the most fancy ElCapitan methods to do so). It is just about the launcher, not the game itself. This should be a simple task. However, without the launcher to set the game options, the game itself starts only in not-playable configuration. A catch-22 for the end user who has paid money for playing it. So, thumbs down from my side.			"

												I really wanted to like Rebel Galaxy. Being a Space trader? Check. Decent graphics? Check. Mostly voiced characters? Surprise Check. And there seems to be a pretty good game in there. BUT...I was not able to play the game due to the clunky ""Broadside""/action sequences. I would have liked an option to turn on an A.I. ""Gun crew"" to handle all combat as an RPG player. Even the Broadside. As it turned out, after I bought Rebel Galaxy, Steam had a ""similar game"" recommendation at the bottom.  It is a free game that was more of what I was looking for playstyle-wise. So now I play that and Rebel Galaxy sits untouched. I rate it 2 stars out of five for potential I was not able to tap.	 "

												Flew halfway across the galaxy.Fought four different battles.Found some loot.Then this piece of junk crashes and wipes my progress all the way back to the last space station.Thankyouverymuch, take your pseudo-rougelike system and shove it.And yes I know you can force a save by exiting to main menu. So if it IS possible to force a save, why not just add an option to save on demand? Either have the cajones to have a real rougelike system that does not allow forcing a save in any way, shape or form, or don't waste my time.Until the save system is fixed, this game is worth maybe $0.99 at most.

												Probably the closest thing to a Firefly game we'll probably get. One of the most remarkable things is how much freedom you have. Wanna be a roaming lawbringer helping traders and the local Militia? You can do that. Wanna be a smuggler sneaking contraband under the nose of the local authorities. Go right ahead! Hell, do you wanna make money shrewdly analyzing market prices system wide and raking in the profit. Then take it its yours! Granted you will sometimes run across enemies that can spank you from here to the end of the galaxy and have to run and to be honest I'm just fine with that. It makes you feel like you're really part of this larger galaxy, you're not the end all be all, just another spacer wandering the galaxy. See you later space cowboy.P.S- That soundtrack is baller as hell.			"

												I am searching for a space exploration game with story and hart. this is not it.First of it does not launch from Steam, had to find the app on the computer, the game starts but loads within a window, no way to enter full screen. I would compare this to VoidExpanse with better graphics and worse controls. Same level of story and interesting characters, that is to say not so much.How do I jettison cargo, how do I buy mining equipment? I have no idea. The interface just seems clunky and difficult.     Nice graphics does not do it for me, their has to be a compelling reason for being in this universe, worlds to explore, alien encounters, technology to mess around with. I’m not seeing it. When I’m fighting I do not feel in control of what is happening, all I see is sparkly lights. Sometimes I win easily and sometimes I loos within minutes, I have no idea why.I’ve played Escape Velocity 1996 and Escape Velocity Nova 2002 and I had more fun with that then this, because it had a OK story. 20 years later we have the bare bones of a story in Rebel Galaxy and no reason for me to continue playing.

												I could not get down with this game at all.Even though it's set in an alien world in space, the developers decided the best music option would be country music.This is possibly the most unfitting thing I have ever heard of, so immediately muted the music and went onto playing the game.I then noticed the interface is clearly optimised for consoles. When speaking to someone, his dialogue will take up the entire screen form left to right in ENORMOUS font. It is very tedious to read if you're on a desktop PC as opposed to playing on a Console on a tv far away from you. Most other UI is fine, but the conversations are horribly designed for desktop viewing when close to the screen.My biggest gripe, this game is a space game that is in 2d. You literally can not fly up or down. This is actually the most silly thing I can imagine. I am a programmer, and I can tell you right now it's not difficult to make a ship go in any direction, this just means they made an incredibly linear galaxy made on a piece of paper. The entire galaxy, instead of endless and amazing, is now flat.			"

												Mixed feelings about this one. As a mouse-and-keyboard PC gamer, the consolification of the interface and ship combat feels awful. The zoom is weird, the interface manipulation is weird, all the usual problems you'd expect on the interface of a console port.On the other hand, the game evokes strong memories of Freelancer and even Freespace (god those beam weapons are gorgeous). It remains to be seen if the latter can overpower the former for me, and it also remains to be seen whether the game's interface will ever be de-consolified for the proper PC interface. As it stands right now, I just can't overlook the way the game handles.			"

												First mission, with tutorials - controls: E/Q for engines up/down, W/S for speed boost/brake, A/D for turning left/right. So how do you change your pitch? You don't. That's right, this space sim is completely 2D. Everything is in the same plane - tars, planets, stations, ships. You can't even roll your ship. That's because combat is ""naval"" style - with broadsides! With the freedom of 3-dimensional space and with the technological possibilities of a spacefaring civilization, the best solution is to fire your guns from the sides of your ship, in the general direction of the enemy. Like sailships.Why didn't you make an actual sailship game? If you wanted alines, you could have made it in a fantasy setting, rather than Caribean, but your battle mechanics would make sense. Here, they just suck.Also, what good is my sensor system? I can scan other ships for cargo and battle strenght, but only after I'm so close that they actually attack. So scan that ship, see that it's too powerful, take a wide detour? Not happening. This is not a space simulation. Don't know what it is and don't want to know.			"

												Does not start on Mac OS Mavericks. Many people who do not want to upgrade to Mac OS ElCapitan for valid reasons have reported about this problem since early October 2015 and until now, 8 months later, this is not fixed. There are some hacks in some forums that helped some people but not all of them (including me). This is really bad service, as the problem seems to be quite simple to fix from the producers' side (make their launcher start in full screen without using the most fancy ElCapitan methods to do so). It is just about the launcher, not the game itself. This should be a simple task. However, without the launcher to set the game options, the game itself starts only in not-playable configuration. A catch-22 for the end user who has paid money for playing it. So, thumbs down from my side.			"

												I am actually surprised that a low buget game like Rebel Galaxy can have so much content in one go. Trading, Pirating, Distress calls, Even random events that affect the local markets or station access. The world is yours to toy with but you still need to pay attention to what is going on. You dont want to slam straight into a space station where there is a invasion going down. (Unless you are planning on clearing it up of course)The combat is different that in other space oriented games. As you are flying Capital grade ships you cant fly UP or DOWN. Sounds bad but hang on. Fact is you dont need to. With some work your ship becomes a flying fortress. With plasma !BROADSIDES! and enough turrets on it to wipe out a fleet.As for valuing defense and offence its your call. Personally i like being up close so i took some fast acting cannons for close quarters. More damage, less range. The game is FULL of tradeoffs when it comes to arnament. So you need to pick your method carefully. Personally i HIGHLY recommend this game to any game progression enthusiasts with a limited budget. The game is cheap, VERY long if you want to play all the way, and there are enough tactics and explosions around for a great experience. 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

												This game is everything I had hoped Elite Dangerous would be. Structurally, both games are very similar: you hop round the galaxy trading, mining, exploring, bounty-hunting and doing various missions, all the while earning credits so you can upgrade your ship and equipment. The main difference being this game removes all the tedium that ED insists you go through repeatedly and infinitely. Elite's station docking was fun for an hour or two, but after the 1000th dock, you just wish they'd just remove it...Rebel Galaxy removes this and you just insta-dock! Elite's 5 minutes with absolutely NOTHING to do while you warp to another station was never fun, and RG condenses this to a 10-30 second jump where you actually have some dodging and janking to do. Design decisions like this might make RG a more casual game than ED, but for me it also makes it 1000% more playable.This brings us to the combat. Purists will frown on Rebel Galaxy for it's 2-D implementation of space versus Elite's glorious 3D, but at the end of the day the combat is arcadey in both games, and RG's combat simply manages to be much more FUN. And certainly more epic. 30+ ship battles while you blast fighters with your short range turrets, broadside their capital ships and unleash homing missiles at everything else are far more epic than anyting Elite managed to throw my way.So my final description is that Rebel Galaxy is Elite with all the tedium removed, an actual story added, way better missions, and with considerably more fun combat. Which is what I've wanted in a space game since I racked up hundreds of hours of the original Elite on my Spectrum sometime back in the 1980s.TLDR: 8/10* this game is everything Elite Dangerous should have been* I would give this game 9/10 but for one annoying feature....you cannot view the local station map while docked. This means that you cannot easily plan the best cargo to buy or the best missions to take because you cannot see the optimum routes around the sector without seeing that local map. It's a quality of life thing that proves more frustrating than it might sound. If they fix that, this is a solid 9/10.			"

												This game is everything I had hoped Elite Dangerous would be. Structurally, both games are very similar: you hop round the galaxy trading, mining, exploring, bounty-hunting and doing various missions, all the while earning credits so you can upgrade your ship and equipment. The main difference being this game removes all the tedium that ED insists you go through repeatedly and infinitely. Elite's station docking was fun for an hour or two, but after the 1000th dock, you just wish they'd just remove it...Rebel Galaxy removes this and you just insta-dock! Elite's 5 minutes with absolutely NOTHING to do while you warp to another station was never fun, and RG condenses this to a 10-30 second jump where you actually have some dodging and janking to do. Design decisions like this might make RG a more casual game than ED, but for me it also makes it 1000% more playable.This brings us to the combat. Purists will frown on Rebel Galaxy for it's 2-D implementation of space versus Elite's glorious 3D, but at the end of the day the combat is arcadey in both games, and RG's combat simply manages to be much more FUN. And certainly more epic. 30+ ship battles while you blast fighters with your short range turrets, broadside their capital ships and unleash homing missiles at everything else are far more epic than anyting Elite managed to throw my way.So my final description is that Rebel Galaxy is Elite with all the tedium removed, an actual story added, way better missions, and with considerably more fun combat. Which is what I've wanted in a space game since I racked up hundreds of hours of the original Elite on my Spectrum sometime back in the 1980s.TLDR: 8/10* this game is everything Elite Dangerous should have been* I would give this game 9/10 but for one annoying feature....you cannot view the local station map while docked. This means that you cannot easily plan the best cargo to buy or the best missions to take because you cannot see the optimum routes around the sector without seeing that local map. It's a quality of life thing that proves more frustrating than it might sound. If they fix that, this is a solid 9/10.			"

												This game blow X-rebirth out of the water, there is not much to say. The game is a bit like Elite, but more accessible in a good way and more action, that reminds me of the good old game Pirates, where you have to use the broadside for canons. If just Egosoft could make a game like this, but more simular to X3 Albion Prelude I would be in heaven.			"

												Never asked for a refund before, and I usually avoid giving bad reviews.The game itself is not bad, I've played for one hour and realized the rpg potencial on it...But I couldn't stand the ships controls and navigation.It hurts my head to fly through space and not being able to move vertically or do a barrel roll.Worse, having your enemies flying around you, why the hell I can't do that?I understand the idea of the ship working like a vessel, maybe if the game was set up in a weird steampunk ocean world or something it would be amazing.But it's space, it should feel free and limitless. It feels clunky and awkward instead.General interface for that map is weird too, the radar, locking on targets, dodging asteroids...If you don't mind these problems, give it a go.			"

												This is a game that starts out incredible and quickly becomes repetitive and boring. The more I played it the less I enjoyed it. I was immediately pulled in with a fantastic soundtrack and interesting gameplay. However I realized very rapidly that the bit I got at the start was basically all there was. There's retrieval, protection, and shipping and those are your main mission types. You can mine for some ore to trade and you can buy low and sell high based on random events in the system you're in. It very quickly feels hollow because who cares if planet z is having problems so they need more of y item that you can buy elsewhere. None of it matters at the end, the issues resolve regardless of what you do. The main quest seems interesting enough but the quests are the same ""blow up the bads retrieve mystic object"" nonsense that the side quests are.Overall an interesting idea but not deep enough.			"

												I\'m only posting this review because this game is on sale. So far, I love this game and intened to pour hours into it. It\'s my favorite space game I\'ve found yet. It\'s just fun to play. The combat is challenging, yet interesting, The soundtrack is great, but I wish they had added more songs with more variety. Sometimes I feel like I\'m on a five song loop. Still, a great game and more than worth the sale price. I would even recommend it for regular price. That\'s what I paid, and even though it went on sale a few days later I still feel I got plenty of game for the amount. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy if you buy.			"

												2d space combat?  What a joke... 3 dimensions are always better than 2.  Graphics are pretty iffy... controls are even worse.  Combat is slow and painful.  And to top it all off you spend alot of time just fly around. Game balance is all kinds of bad...  I have an ammo limit, but the enemy has unlimited missiles, ya that's real fair... it takes so long to kill larger ships that they can easily throw 30-50x more missiles at you then u can at them all because of a stupid ammo limit...  I'm not sure what's the point in having shields, they get torn to  shreds within seconds of jumping in, but the enemie's hold firm, and if I hear the ship ai say force shields down one more time...  And to top it all off the most effective weapons in the game are the turrets that auto fire for you making any agency you bring to the game as a human player mute!!!The music is great, and it's like 80% of the reason i got this game, it was all fire fly esq, but the game play and it's mechanics are just so bad... This game reminds me of all the time i wasted grinding away at eve online, it's just a plain waste of time to play this game.			"

												The game starts out as a kind of Southern Rock response to Firefly - which sounds awesome! If you like space sims with a variety of play options, you may enjoy this. I gave it a thumbs down for two reasons.First, everything is a grind. Getting a ship strong enough to compete and survive beyond the first sector costs millions of credits. You'll spend hours of gameplay chasing bigger ships, which do not seem to significantly change or develop play. Missions, trading, mining, piracy, pirate hunting... it's all the same thing over and over again. The story is alright, but not good enough to warrant a game that is all grind.The main reason I gave it a thumbs down is that there's a line in one of the main songs that loops over and over again that is EXTREMELY sexist (talking about a woman who is a ""sleaze"" and not worth a man's time). It's really gross that they decided to include something like that in an otherwise ok space sim.			"

												--Additional update---I just finished the main storyline. What a fantastic game!!! It's been a long time since I have played a game that hits that special spot of enjoyment that makes me just want to keep playing. I love this game...--UDATE--Having finally made it to the second system, I can say that I am absolutely pleased with this game. The next sector has bigger and better ships, weapons, and modules to fit with. I also went into the third sector and saw that the ships get even larger, with even better gear. Unfortunately, I was totally unprepared for how much herder that new system was, so I had to go back.Man! This game is awesome!I haven't played it for a very long time, but what I have played, I certainly like. The ships all feel different, the progression feels substantial, and getting new weapons and systems for each ship makes everything feel a lot more visceral. One of my favourite things about the game is that you can fit up your ship with some new gear and truly feel a difference in power, making you feel like a real space bad@ss. Certainly worth the asking price, in my books.			"

												4/10Seriously, just get a Scarab, keep your turrets maxed out, and outmaneuver or out gun every ship in the game. It's just as combat effective as bigger ships, and much cheaper, since you don't pay a mint to replace 10 turrets whose coverage doesnt even let them fire.Pro:ShinyQuite controllable with mouse and keyboard once you get used to itVery SimpleCon:..Excessively simpleNo replayability due to every 'randomly generated' system being the same, with the same 7 factions, ships, stationsShort campaign with no feeling of resolution or urgency due to functioning as normal combat missions, only with voiceovers.Vastly underdelivers due to excessive positive reviews here.I'd say buy this game if you really want a playable space game, but frankly, you're going to get 6 hours in and say, ""Is this IT?!"" like I did. Maybe less.			"

												This is a wonderful open-world space game with a lot to offer, but my hours are low and I'm giving it a thumbs-down because I just can't get past the horrid UI.The UI for this game is very obviously designed for consoles and not for PC, but even after plugging in a controller and trying it that way, I found myself getting frustrated.  Some things that I don't like, roughly in order of most irritating:Waiting for information to cycle.  When looking at commodities, whether on the commodities screen or on the map, instead of having a scrollable list, pages/lines will cycle every 4 seconds or so.  This creates a) a lot of waiting and b) you can't stop the cycle when your item comes up and actually read it.All scrolling lists and menus move one item at a time.  You can still select something with the mouse if it's on the screen, though, assuming you can see it or figure out what it is while it's grayed out.No way to display the sector map while docked.No way to create multiple waypoints, meaning you can't plan out routes that navigate around hostiles or asteroid belts.No way to zoom your camera in/out, resulting in a lot of screen space always being occupied by your (albeit gorgeous) ship.No speed indicator on the HUD, for you or your targets.If the UI gets fixed, I'll likely dump countless hours into this game and come back and rewrite my review, but until then, I can only say that it feels like a really clunky console port.

 Interested in No Man's Sky? Dissapointed in No Man's Sky? Just get Rebel Galaxy.  It has pretty much everything that that game has, but it also has a lot more. Here's a list of features: More world types (Sand, gas, etc... Can't land on 'em though) Large battlesA jobs boardShip renaming, Distress signals, Mercenaries, Bigger ships, Exploration bonuses Unique factions Faction affiliation, Randomly generated worlds You can be a trader, mercenary, pirate, soldier, miner, etc... You can actually negotiate your way out of battles! Space looks lovely, and the lighting and sound design is epic. Battles are absolute chaos, but awesome.  And all this paired with some great music! Whilst it is singleplayer, and is on a 2D plane (with 3D models, think Assassins Creed Black Flag Ships), it is much better than this game. You can travel across multiple star systems (not a whole galaxies, sadly), and each planet is randomly generated. Each planet has their own specialities (Mining, war-like, trading, prison planet(!), etc... Some are gas planets, some are barren, etc...You can't land on them, but that is pretty much my only gripe with this game. I bought this before I heard of No Man's Sky, so I was not dissapointed. But the game is still pretty as f###Raiding a trade ship can actually ruin the prices of a planet's economy, which you can then exploit. Selling munitions at a planet that is at war can get you more profit. There are multiple factions. Pirates, civilians, the militia, the mafia/crime bosses, or just be a merc! Small note to Angry Joe: You can scan any ship you want, see their race, freight, ship name, etc... ;) Also, it's 20 F###### DOLLARS.﻿  "

												This game is ok,  but after just 57 hrs play time iv run out of things to do.  The game map is small the ship choices and weapons very few.... I'd not recommend this game as a freelancer alternative.  It was a fun 57hrs play time to max out the best ship/weapons after that the game is easy mode with little point to repeat missions and no more story line to keep one interested.			"

												Excellent potential, but the save system is hands down the worst implementation of saves i have experienced.  Without the ability to manually save the game, if you make a single mistake and getting into deep trouble and the system auto-saves you in that state, your game is ruined and you have to restart.  I played for nearly two hours and lost everything because a red marauder team caught me and I couldn't escape.  A no win scenario that effectively destroys your save game isn't a 'challenge', its a game killer.  I refuse to devote more time to a game that doesn't give you the ability to protect your progress with a manual save option.  Until then, this is a game wiating to frustrate you to the point you uninstall it.			"

												I understood this game wouldn't have the real kind of depth I was looking for, but felt it would be good enough as a simple time killer.  I like the 2D plane naval style battles.  What I don't like is not owning multiple ships with different setups.  Mining is really more complicated than it should be for this type of game.  If my mining laser is on the bottom of the ship, good luck hitting an asteroid above your ship.  Scanning for asteroids gives no information of what you are mining for and as far as I can tell there is no item that does.  Certain weapons seemingly fire through your ship even though vision is blocked.  Really it's not a terrible game, but it's not a particularly good one.  Galaxy On Fire has more depth than this game.  The combat is good and interesting, the story is good and even the voice acting is good.  Graphics are fine.  Some small details were missed and the game was dumbed down more than it needed to be.  If you are looking for something really simple, then this game is for you.  It's on Galaxy On Fire's level.  If you are the type who likes the X Series or was into Eve Online and you were looking for something kind of in between in the single player realm, you will be slightly disappointed.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  Reading other reviews and watching videos reminded me of Escape Velocity: Nova, a great Ambrosia game from oh so long ago.  I thought that this game could capture the same magica that game possesed but with the updated flare of almost 20 years of gaming advances.Unfortunatly, I was wrong.Combat in Rebel Galaxy feels dry, leaving you endlessly flying in circles trying to keep fighters on screen.  Capital ship combat, while entertaining for the first 20 minutes, comes down to trying to land as many broadsides as possible which, once again, leads to flying in circles.The 2-d movement that was great in a top down space trading game like Escape Velocity is restrictive and unnatural.  At no point could I suspend my disbelief and imagine that I was piloting a space ship.  Any sense of immersion is ruined by this element.With all that said the game isn't bad looking and the price is pretty low.  That might be enough to make this game an enjoy able experience for some but it didn't make it worth it for me.			"

												(Review based on preview copy provided by developers)Rebel Galaxy is a Space Opera with some pretty legendary names behind its creation, and it definitely shows. There's no question that it's worth the asking price of $20 USD - though it does have its pros and cons worth considering if it's the perfect fit for you, as well as some gameplay aspects some people will enjoy more than others.----Important Notes:- This game involves trading, mining, and most of all - combat. - Combat is based on Naval combat, not standard 6-degree space combat, you will be using broadside cannons, ramming, and turrets for your capital ship on a horizontal plane (non capital ships use the full 6 degrees of freedom, but you don't get to fly those :P). This leads to interesting, yet still very satisfying, combat.- You have access to a lot of control with your ship, a lot of choices, including what tools you employ and how your weapons behave in battle - and they definitely have an impact on how you play.-You also have the ability to toy with alliances and factions, to change the system (improving/destroying your relations with different factions changes how you play the game)- Combat, either through Bounties, Missions, or Random Encounters will be your fastest way to gather resources and progress - though Trading/Mining are definitely still somewhat viable options.----Pros:- Good visuals, with satisfying explosions, weapon fire, etc. And visible damage on your ship.- Amazing audio assets (and the ability to customize the audio if you want). Voice Acting is ""good"", not stellar, but the explosions, music, etc. are insanely well chosen.- Combat caters to both the casual captain and the aggressive player ( you can hang out on the fringe of battles, letting the automated turrets do the work, or you can dive in ramming/blasting with your broadsides, while ducking and dodging through swarms of bullets)- Solid story, while it won't win any awards, it's on par with Blizzard storylines ( ""Okay"" campaign story, Great universe )- Lots of freedom of choice... and travel. Aided by procedural generation of the sectors - so no 2 playthroughs are the same.- Fairly well optimized (sad that I have to note this, but compared to a lot of other games with similar visual fidelity lately - this one barely taxes my system at max settings)----Cons:- Can get repetative after a while (go to point a, Kill stuff, get money, repeat) - but this tends to happen after the 10-20 hour mark for me. It does follow a formula similar to Diablo/Torchlight/etc. in that regard. - Can be slow paced at times, especially when a mission spawns more than 5000-6000 sm away, there is no fast travel within a sector, and while warp is fine for medium length trips, you will sometimes run into the issue of ""staring at the back of your ship twiddling your thumbs"". - ""Out of Game"" options menu... each time you launch you have the choice of changing the options, but you can't really change them in-game - so you might be restarting a few times to find the settings perfect for you.----Works well with a controller or mouse & keyboard, despite their recommendations.

												[HUGE VALUE - Buy This Game!] To relate this to another game - It's like that new Mad Max game [Sandbox Game with Huge Amounts of Sidemissions along with a Story to Push the Game Forward] - but in space and with naval combat. Your ship has turrets - one on the port side which you typically wanna aim with and the rest automatically shoot at what you want them to shoot at. The game is way big and you'll find yourself grinding missions and being immersed in the experience. Devs have worked really hard at making this the best game it can possibly be. Give them some of your money and your time. You won't be disappointed.			"

												The game balance is all kinds of drunk. The side missions, of which you'll do a whole load, have Risk estimates next to them. These estimates are entirely useless. You can get face melted in a Normal, and never even notice your shields getting touched in a Very High. The power boost between gear levels is also really large, more than 50% boost usually. This means you're going to get melted often when heading into a new area whilst you try to scrape together the money to make your ship competitive. This power difference pretty much kills the immersion as well. Why are two systems, right next door to each other, at such differences in weapon tech? Why doesn't a single ship from the high area go to the low area and just take over? They'd be completely untouchable?			"

												I was hoping for Mount and Blade meets Firefly. What I got was neither. This game has so much potential, but is hugley hurt by a number of things.(If you're wondering why my play time is so low its because I plan to get a refund and because the glaring problems are obvious from the start.)Firstly the thing I noticed first that bugged me was that, you ARE LOCKED TO A SINGLE PLANE OF MOVEMENT!(sounds small but it is SO annoying) Now if this were top down, this wouldnt be a problem, but the view is thrid person, making it painfully obvious how limited you are. What makes it worse is that other ships (including those you fight) can fly freely, making combat confusing and disorienting.Second, the graphics, nice enough at first (tough not at all cutting edge) but the problem there isn't poorly done graphics, it's OVERDONE graphics, I am being entirley honest when I say that the lens flare/ lighting effects during (one dimensional)'flight' actually HURT to look at.And finally, parts of it just feel....off. Little things, like a cramped UI in stations with loads of wasted space, or dialogues with characters (which are admittedley quite nicley done) feeling far too zoomed in and with no ability to use the keyboard for dialouge choices (up, down, enter or even 1,2 and 3).It's a nice idea that wasn't done badly, but its just not quite 'right' to play. I cant honestley recommend it.			"

												Space exploration game. It's like a super dumbed down Elite: Dangerous, which would be amazing EXCEPT combat is impossibly frustrating. Why? The whole combat system is based on side cannons, like a pirate ship in space. Only thing is, you cant move in a 3D space. Not so bad, except for your enemies can. Still not the worst, seems like it's ok, until you realize you can't aim your side cannons up or down. So the whole time, if you have unguided cannons, you're missing. You get 3 hits on a guy, deplete their shields, and then they fly below you. You can't aim at them, your turrets miss majority of the time, and by the time you can hit them again their shields are refilled. Awful combat system, making the game so frustrating that large fights become impossible.			"

												I quit the game right before being destroyed, just to save a few seconds and avoid the respawn at last checkpoint. But it autosaved there.So now my save game only goes to a place where I get blown up, and can't escape.I think it's telling of my feelings about the game that I kinda decided, ""oh, well, I guess that's the last time I play this game."" and shrugged my shoulders.I was 37 hours into that game. I'm sure when I was younger I would have burned down the developers. But really, my apathy towards never being able to play that game again probably is as harsh a burn as I'm capable of delivering at this point.The first dozen or so times you do each mission are fun. Then it's just endless grinding. I'm not going to ever play this game again, because I'd have to start a new game, which would be a ton of grinding to get to where I was, which was a part of the game that involved grinding. I think the price is fair, but I can't say that it's actually worth all the time required to beat it. If you play it for a dozen or more hours and have a good time, just stop when you don't like it any more. It will not change or get better.			"

												I just got this game and after a massive 1.3hrs of playtime I had to talk about it....The game is great if you like 2d combat and driving, I say driving because to use the word flying implies the ability to 'fly' up or down.If you want this game find someone who has it ask them to let you try it out then decide if you want it.  I assumed since the game showed other objects flying around your ship as your guns shot at them, that YOU would be able to fly around as well(also since your in a SPACESHIP!!!!).  Instead it feels like im driving a car or truck.With all that said I will rush through the storyline quests unless i decide that i want to play some SpaceForce Rogue Universe even with all its issues atleast you feel like your in space.

												While it might win you over with a Firefly-esque vibe, Rebel Galaxy is a lot rougher than one would think. Customizing your ship and engaging in space combat sounds cool at first, but it is shallow and unintuitive. The non existent story and lacking presentation doesn't help matters either.

The only way i can get in damage is if im right next to it and just spamming broadsides. The groups they fly in are just too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpowered. There are tons of fighters attacking you in this group and you can't kill any of them. This actually sucks to me because you are just a sitting duck that is poking the enemy.			"

												Bought it. Don't have time to play it. Tested it. An hour later, still playing. Must... stop... playing.The combat seems fun, plenty to do and see.  Will probably disable the music next time I start, nothing wrong with it, just a bit repetative, but it does set the mood.In all, reminds me a bit of Starfleet Command, Firefly, Homeworld and Elite:Dangerous.  I can say that it's well worth the price just from my first hour. I'll try and remember to update this review when I make some more progress.			"

												I just got this game and after a massive 1.3hrs of playtime I had to talk about it....The game is great if you like 2d combat and driving, I say driving because to use the word flying implies the ability to 'fly' up or down.If you want this game find someone who has it ask them to let you try it out then decide if you want it.  I assumed since the game showed other objects flying around your ship as your guns shot at them, that YOU would be able to fly around as well(also since your in a SPACESHIP!!!!).  Instead it feels like im driving a car or truck.With all that said I will rush through the storyline quests unless i decide that i want to play some SpaceForce Rogue Universe even with all its issues atleast you feel like your in space.

												Awful, brutally hard, no help, long winded and boring space on a single axis. I've tried preparing a weapons stack for each mission, enemy makes it up. I've tried just mining for ore to make money to upgrade, I get shot up by fighters every time I try to return to a base. Camera controls are so bad. You have no idea what's happening as barrage after barrage is landing on you. Everytime you die you lose everything, NO ♥♥♥♥ING SAVESThe soundtrack is fantastic, but that's the only good thing about it. Utterly hate this game.  "

												Just a few minutes into the game and i'm telling ya, its so worth it.I love almost everything about this game. The soundtrack is dope, the voice acting is fitting, the controls are good enough. Though nothing beats the combat style in this game. Classic naval style combat! First hostile ship i ran into felt a few volleys of my broadsides and he legged it, though not before letting his puny shields and deflectors soak some of it up. And i was like, ""Wow, really?"" as i finished him with a few scatter laser shots. Heh, good times.Makes me wonder how 2 blokes managed to come up with something like this. It would take a helluva lot of effort to come up with this, even for the big time developer companies. Its quite astonishing that they managed it, enough to make me feel like i should pay for the full price of this game.So far, i haven't found anything bad about this game. So as for now, i'll give it a 10/10.Also, get the soundtrack once it comes out, if you want. Just think of it as a gesture of gratitude for the developers.			"

												I only played this game for a bit .......it only took that long to realize it just was not for me . Music : It's GREAT.Artstyle : Good .Sound Effects : Nice. So at this point you are asking  "" Ok ..BAKURETSA.... wtf is the deal then? "" . The deal breaker for me is the absolute CRAP control scheme .HOW do you make a space game like this ........and put it on a FLAT plane .NO 360 freedom of space movement . It feels like you are sliding a toy car on a glass table . That and the wanna be Assassins Creed Black flag naval action that does not translate well IN SPACE.Maybe you will like it if what I mentioned does not bother you . But I expected better and was let down ....  "

You can choose to do the story line or some of it (which i recommend) or you can go be the space trucker you always wanted to be! You can explore the whole map and do all the side quests before doing the story. But the music does get a bit repetitive.			"

												I've logged 34 hours into the game as of writing this review.The game has been nothing short of an exceptional experience. From the very moment you start the game, you get a good sense of what you're getting into. The music sets the tone to this sort of grungy, rockabilly space Western. It's full of character has a good sense of ""space"". All this despite playing like a sort of ""World of Warships meets Elite: Dangerous"" hybrid between space exploration and naval combat. I highly recommend buying this game.Pros:Full controller support (including optional Playstation layout).Tight Mouse&Keyboard controls.Very pretty graphics and effects.Visible modular ship damage.Many graphics settings in the launcher.Superb soundtrack.Optional custom soundtrack to replace OR supplement the original soundtrack.Fluid combat mechanics.More lasers than I sometimes know what to do with.Unique and lively NPC interactions.Moderate learning curve.VERY attentive and responsive developers constantly patching reported issues.Cons:Enemy dialogue is sometimes repetitive.No vertical travel (2D movement only).Objects (like Cargo) sometimes block docking or other actions.Slaves (Cargo) have no clear way to be saved other than forfeiting to Militia (-4 rep penalty).Single-player only (for now).

												Game is fun, but limited. This game is Sid Meier's Pirates LITE. You have no major interaction with any factions, and can not partake in major game map changing ways. It's essentially the combat of Sid Meier's in Space, with nothing close to SMP's metagame. It's the very definition of shallow. Everything will one way or another end up with a blaster in your face. You want to trade or mine? Good luck. You'll be needing a good turret.Ultimately I don't recommend this game despite the fact that I know a lot of people may enjoy it. I respect it's sea-naval intentions, but I just am TOO much of a fan of proper scifi stuff and not arcade based games to enjoy this.My ideal Scifi games are along the lines of Nexus, and Homeworld. I find this to be very simplistic, to it's own detriment because it gets CLUSMY quickly with combat. It's not hard to stay oriented, but it is HARDER than it should be. Camera + controls (really, gamepad optimal, who are you kidding) + enemies + lack of distinct options controlling your own weapons makes this game a hassle. Added on top of it, that it's a big ol'grind fest in a single player game, and you lose my interest quickly.That said, there aren't a lot of good scifi options these days, so a lot of people will find the 20$ entry fee to be acceptable for the amount of entertainment within.

												Save your money..... worst of the space sim group.PROSCool music and easy to navigate, ship upgrade path straight forward. Overall game had promise, until...CONSTERRIBLE combat broadside junk aiming mechanic, ruins the game play. It takes literally forever to hit anything with the lazy aiming system. Hold right mouse until you get a yellow path to aim, left to fire.  Misses everytime or does little damage. I really can't say enough bad things about how poorly thought out this part of the game is. Funny, that most of the game is about combat interactions and this part failed so badly. It's a shame because otherwise it seemed unique, but is unplayable due to this frustrating design idea. Sailing ships in space, no thanks!Overall a waste of $20The solid reviews must be rigged from devs. Too bad Steam doesn't give refunds on this trash indie stuff. Fix your broken core mechanic and allow weapons to hit something and maybe the game could work.Starpoint Gemini 2 is 1000x times more playable.			"

												The game is pretty fun but lacks much content to be a $17.99 game. There needs to be more complexity with ships, turrets, etc. Large annoyances include being pulled out of warp when coming into contact with unavoidable things like asteroids. I havnt put much time into the game but from first impressions these are my thoughts. I think the game should have been released as an alpha game due to the lack of content. What is put together now is bug free but there isnt much here. One example is that in all 6 hours i played I saw maybe 3 unique avatar/voices of enemy ships. There are a total of 3 turrets for broadside, 6 if you include the 2nd tier which is the exact same just more speed and damage. Id be happy to pay 17.99 for a game with alot of content but this seems like a sub $10 game in its current form.			"

												I should have trusted the reviews that stated the combat in this game was horrible, as it is.  I love the music, the idea of reliving Privateer, etc.  However, the game is nothing more than go from point A to point B and back and fighting as if you are in a ocean vessel in the 1800s.  It seems the developers are much like human race from centuries ago in that they think the world (in this case space) is flat.Let me download the music as a soundtrack and at least the money would have been worth while.  Short of that, this was a lesson in reading and believing reviews.			"

												This game starts with a fantastic promise: Getting something between Wing Comander Privateer and X³. The first impression is great, the graphics are impressive, the cut scenes / chats with characters appropriate. Only the fact that a Flight Stick is not supported seems to be a little bit sad.Then you start to manouver your ship for the first time you realize there is something broken. Checking the Settings turns out: This game is a 2 dimensional space shoter.The idea of space is to have 3 dimensions but here there is only a third dimension for the blow-flies. What distroys any immersion from this point on is, that there is no reasonable explanation for this 2D-space-fake. Why?			"

												Not a bad game, but not all that fun.The controls are just okay, if a bit messy. M&KB works but feel lacking. I honestly don't feel in control of my ship a lot of the time. The music is pretty annoying. And for me, being restricted to a 2d plane, sucked all of the fun out of it.All said and done, its similar to Starport Gemini 2, which I think is better to the point where it was hard to justify having them both.

												OS X review below:--Game is nice, especially soundtrack – sets the mood perfectly and is very pleasant to listen to.There is however a major problem on OS X – XBox controller is not supported. Game controls and menus are clearly optimized for gamepads, but mouse look is laggy and has too much inertia. Lining up broadsided are a pain (inertia is OK with analog sticks, with mouse it is annoying as hell), turret control is just horrible (see above).FOV could be wider (or adjustable) – your ship taking 1/4 of screen at all times is very annoying, especially on ultrawide screens. And it's not pretty on big screen, textures are console-quality and look muddy.P.S. Regarding gameplay – warp! It is boooooring. You undock, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. You fight, you win, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. Rinse, repeat.I won't recommend this game to Mac users – game is designed for gamepad, gamepad is not supported.			"

												Disappointing to say the least, basically its similar to Eve but without any p2p or pvp. Very vanilla economy. Super generic quests, you can literally have multiple instances of the same quest. You can go ratting. You can go mining. Would not recommend going trading. Single pane (no up/ down) essentially no 3d movement in a space game??? Why???  Pretty I'll give it that. Broadsides are nice but its gimmicky. Sound track is good but it is a short soundtrack. So after the first hour or less you will hear the same songs again and again and again. Pointless. Targeting sucks. to interact with anything you have to get pretty darn close which is just dumb. Travel between quests takes too long, you can upgrade your travel speed but it’s still pretty darn slow.  I want to like it but meh boring...			"

												This game evolves from games like Star Flight, Star Fleet and Freelancer with the interface and game play being most like Freelancer(almost a re-write).  I liked Freelancer and must've played through 3 or 4 times.   The graphics and UI from this game most resemble Freelancer.For me the whole broadside pirate style of battling is confusing enough that this game likely has not much time left on my hard drive.  No story line to speak of, no character developement, same 4 options to get a mission on each planet/station/location.  I can live with everything except the battle perspective issue, it would've been much better to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥pit view of battle like other flying games.  It would also be nice of while flying around you could choose between first and third person views.  Also annoying game play plot issues like can't pick up debris cargo withpout a tractor beam but you have to run earand missions to earn enough to get one, should be part of the base ship configuration, same with weapons, start with nothing being the target for every bandit who wants to shoot you down.Had I played a demo of this game I would not have purchased.  I wish I had gotten the new Defender instead of this game.			"

												""Fighting in Rebel Galaxy is naval style, meaning you fight with your broadsides.""Yep, sounds about right. Because in the distant future weapons are so incredible advanced that they absolutely can NOT be mounted on the front. And that's so much fun I immediately requested a refund.What the hell guys, as if anybody would ever complain about having some action and fun in a game. Just what happened to the whole Descent / Freespace / Forsaken genre? Nowadays we have such great graphics, the technology, the processor power, so many potential and possibilities, and developers decide to throw everything over board and make something like THIS?Wow. Just wow.			"

												This game is great, the music is AMAZING and the graphics and universe are top-notch.It would be my pick for GOTY if it wasn't flat plane.That means that it's nothing like the gameplay of Freelancer and Privateer (like they're advertising) and is closer to Starpoint Gemini 1 and Ring Runner.Both mediocre games :(So, while $20 is a great price point, the fact that it has no TILT, PITCH or YAW, means I'm getting a refund, and if you loved Freelancer, you'll get one too.

												I had high hopes for this game but as it stands I can not recommend it.  Everything from a lack of ships, lack of things to do, lack of deep combat bog this game down from greatness.   What it does and how it does it,  it does very well,  but it just doesn't push any particular aspect far enough.  Further, while I found the soundtrack nice at first, it wears very quickly. It really doesn't sound like a space sim or futuristic at all and I struggle to understand why they chose the musicians to begin with when it doesn't gel with the rest of the game. Very greatful Steam offers refunds.			"

												I wanted to like this game; it seemed like a throwback to Escape Velocity. But there are two audio issues the kept me from being able to enjoy the game:1) There is a constant popping sound coming from the game. It stopped in menus, but was otherwise constant.2) The music is AWFUL. It is painful to listen to. If done subtly, it could have given the game a Firefly, space western vibe. Instead, it's akin to being agressively poked in the ear by a Alan Jackson wannabe's demo tape.			"

It feels like someone had an interesting idea for a game and perhaps pulled together a working prototype of a concept and then proceeded to paste minimal elements of a game around it. Menus, models, story... all seriously lacking.The space physics don't feel good at all. You can bounce your ship into things and well.... and nothing, it just bounces off. I don't mind that it is on a 2D plane but the models for ships, asteroids, space stations... all look like they were made 10 years ago.And the story is awful. really really awful. Again, it feels like the bare minimal to move the player forward into... something. I would like to say these feels like beta but that would be too generous. This feels like a early access alpha build. shame.			"

												Disliked that there is no manual or much of a tutorial in the game so good luck with all the controls.  I learned in the forums after a kind soul let me know that there are videos/links to videos in the game if you press esc/start button and look for them in the menus there.   Never would have thought that the equivalent of the manual? i guess would be in the menu.Most of everyone else was busy saying the equivalent of 'man up', so not the greatest community if you are looking for any kind of help.The game might be fun but you will have to put up with non-intuitive controls until the developers improve them or actually give more information to the players.  So at this point the game seems more to be in EA state rather than released state.  I say EA because games in those states are the ones that I expect with no manual/minimal explanation of controls when control scheme is not intuitive.Also becareful since some of the reviews mention that it reminds them of other games space games like freelancer/(insert awesome space game) but they fail to mention that the game movement/combat is in 2D like Starpoint Gemini.So TLDR; Gamble: might be good but be warned that controls aren't the best and community not the most helpful.  This game is more like an enhanced Starpoint Gemini.Edit:The review mentions community as since the 'tutorial' to basic keys is lacking then it means that the users have to rely on 'community'. On the plus side though the developers seem to be good though so there is a future.CONS:- Controls not all intuitive- Tutorial, according to other players you have to play > 15mins before you actually get to it.- Aweful community (don't expect help from 90% of it and have a thick hide when asking).- Universe is 2D like Starpoint Gemini (some people like this so if you are ok with it then you good).PRO:- Devs seem to nice and involved so a few weeks or months the game might become much better.- Possible gem in the future, so maybe hold out until later.

												I almost didn't buy this because I read that space was 2D.  That turned out to be the best feature.  It makes the combat ridiculouly fun.  The music got me looking into the credits to find the groups.  The only problem I have is that you can run through the story line and max out on technology very quickly.  Still, GREAT game.  A+ for music, A- for gameplay, B for story line, C for the rather limited sandbox universe.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is pretty addicting but is painfully short.  My first, and likely only, run through was brief.  You don't need to max out your ship and equipment to beat the game.  It's nice that anything you buy you sell for the exact same amount.  This really means you can try out everything without consquence.  But because of that there is no real need to play through more than once.I had considered going again just to try out being a pirate but the main story just wasn't interesting enough.  The side missions are a grind for money and they aren't that fun.  You either can win a fight or there is no way to win it  till you get a better ship or equipment.The economy is pretty easy to figure out and that can allow for you to earn money way to fast for the game to be a challenge.  I'm glad I played it but I'd be pretty mad if I had paid more than $10, which I didn't.Wait for a sale.			"

												Anyone that's played (or even remembers) Escape Velocity will probably enjoy this game.Rebel Galaxy is a fun space combat/trading/mining/exploration game, giving you a lot of ways to earn money and kick♥♥♥♥♥ The ship piloting controls are on a 2d plane, which may seem frustrating to some, but it's honestly a great decision. It makes the more chaotic battles easier to approach, letting the game throw more and more fighter and other small craft, backed up by larger frigates and destroyers.Story isn't bad so far, but isn't exactly groundbreaking either. More of an excuse to drive the plot along for the sake of the number of smaller side-missions around.Special mention has to be given to the soundtrack. Most games I play have me turning off the background music because I want to focus on the combat audio, but the western/southern old-timey music gives a perfect frontier feeling to the game. The SFX are great as well.Not a perfect game. At best, I'd give it an 8/10 (with 5/10 being average, damn it), and given the $20 price point it's more than worth it. But it's still an excellent first showing from a new developer. Really look forward to seeing what they do in the future.			"

												I had been undecided about buying this game, because on one hand I love space-games, and on the other I hate 2D games (especially in space) and that I the idea of flying on a 2D plane within 3D space doesn’t appeal to me. I watched some videos and thought it would be worth a try, after all space RPG’s are not too common. I found the game to be quite entertaining, although not very immersive. After getting some decent upgrades it also wasn’t very challenging. The spaceship components did not feel like they had enough variety in them. Sooner or later you will end up going to the overpowered beam turrets. The game-play is still fun and the graphics are good considering the game’s 2D limitations. The dialogue scenes offer nice visuals which was a great addition. The main story felt somewhat short, and written for a younger audience.On a scale out of 10:Graphics: 8Story: 6Immersion: 6Gameplay: 7			"

												9/10Fantastic space fairing action.The trailers caught my attention with nice colourful space battles some time ago, but nothing prepared me for how fun this game was. I went in cautiously as it breaks one of main rules for space battling games, thou shall not restrict motion to a 2D plane, but I needn't have worried.  Combat is fast and tactical and full to the brim with laser beams and tracer fire and trailing missiles while surrounded by explosions, while you're led along either by your own need (to gain bigger ships and guns) or the story that lies within.The story was reasonably interesting and lifted up by some surprisingly competent voice acting but woefully under developed, but with this game's price point it would be daft to expect more than what was already crammed in, I just lamented that one of the characters in game was not pushed more to the front along side the player in a MasterChief / Cortana style relationship. Graphically the game takes its own style and runs with it, with some of the ship designs varying from interesting to inspired, though I would've liked to have seen more of the fighters and gunships. With player control being restricted to larger ships (frigates up to drednaughts) there was a missed oppurtunity for building a squadron of fighter level craft to follow you about. Perhaps that's something the developers could investigate for DLC or a sequel.This game was a surprise in terms of quality. If you want a space game in the vein of Elite that makes with the action and less with the simulation, you will find a home here for some time. The 40 hours I've spent with this title will attest to that.			"

												It has been a long time since I was addicted to a game like I am to this. I've played a lot of space simulator type games since I first discovered the genre in the legendary game: Freelancer - all have fallen short of my expectations. This game however is the anomaly - the one that given enough time and attention could very well rival it one day in my opinion.The biggest problem I originally had with this game is the fact you can only move on a 2d plane - I've gotten used to it and it isn't a big deal - it is part of the charm now. The other issue that I've found is with mining - it doesn't seem to be very profitable - though I've not tried it much since the starting system, I was always getting worthless materials with a few valuables mixed in. Trading was vastly more profitable and completing mission reasonably better - this means I never mine, which I find ashame as it could be interesting if it were more profitable.Sometimes I think the danger levels given in some missions is a tad ""off"" so to speak - doing a delivery of cargo mission with an ""average"" to ""below average"" rating and getting ambushed by what seems dozens of enemies - them ripping through my ship in seconds and dampening my engines so I can't escape or dictate the fight - after you've run a few of those types of mission, you expect it and are maneurvering and ready for it - isn't such a big deal then.On the plus side - the music, it fits so perfectly, I'd like more tracks but the ones they have are really good. I like the fact I'm not forced to go down the main story line, I'm off in different systems doing different mission and buying bigger ships - that is the freedom I expect (but sometimes don't get) in open world games. Combat is fun, the broadsides and turrets seem to be equally useful. The progression is great - though I find it a tad odd I can equip level 5 (which is what I'm up to) turrets/shields/engine etc on the smaller ships - surely they have to use more power or something? Meh doesn't really matter. All in all I'm very happy I bought this game and don't see myself stopping for awhile.			"

												Have not put this game down since purchase. I'm not a fan of single player games, I prefer co-op, MMO etc but this game has absolutely taken me in! It has everything, great sound track, beautiful looks, amazing re-playability. You can make money running missions, hunting pirates, mining or buying and selling commodities. If you want to micro-manage every single shot fired from your awesome ship you can, or you can take control of a single specific weapon (EG: broadsides) and let the AI target and fire the others, without feeling like you are not doing justice to that particular firing solution.If you are even just 1% interest in this game buy it. If you're not interested buy it, this is game you dont know you need until you play it.			"

												Just think Firefly + Cowboy Bebop = Rebel Galaxy.Didn't know what all to expect when watching the trailers, so I thought ""What the hell, I'll give it a shot.""  Then I gave it another...and another...and another, and before I was done, pirate fleets were torn asunder and floating lifeless in the cold, empty void of space.Overall:+ Put in close to 12 hours so far and still in the first system.  In many AAA-titles released these days (I'm looking at you CoD), the main part of campaigns can be completed in 5-20 hours, depending on how much content there is.  For a $20 game to beat out $60 games is a damn shame. It shows that bigger studios often care too much about profit, and not enough on a great experience like they used to.+ Sometimes takes on that addictive ""just one more mission"" quality+ Tight, responsive controls+ Again, for $20, the AI can be surprisingly good+ Like many have said, it's not a space sim, which, for me at least, was a good selling point.  No need for ultra-realism after seeing pretty pew-pew lasers and lots, and LOTS of explosions.+/- The soundtrack can be kind of a mixed bag.  It isn't terrible by any means, but after hearing the same 6-7 songs repeated over and over again in some sequences, I disabled the music in the settings and began listening to music downloaded from YouTube.  Yet if the developor can periodically update the game with new tracks, it'd be an added bonus. + Got to name my ship the Cowboy Bebop10/10 - See ya later space cowboy!			"

												Great game, especially for the money. Enough RPG elements with ship upgrades and lots of ships to choose from. First, there are some negatives: the late game doesn't offer much in the way of excitement, one you have the best gear, there isn't much that puts up a challenge anymore. It's fun to feel godlike when firing 20 broadside cannons and killing ships that used to give you trouble in a couple of shots. This wears out pretty quickly though and I find myself wishing they would throw more at me to match the level of my ship. Once the storyline is finished I don't feel there is a lot of replayability, there's no real ""other"" way to play the game except as maybe an outlaw, which will severely limit the number of stations you can visit and missions you can take. The positives, I think, far outweigh the negatives. As I said above there are plenty of fun customization options available to you and each battle needs to be approached with tactics in mind: lots of fighters?  Stay back and let your turrets work and fire some well-aimed broadsides. Big badass dreadnaughts? Take down their shields and get in close so you don't have to charge your cannons up and take them down fast. I haven't played a game with this much value for dollar in a long time, not being able to travel on the X axis isn't a bother as the game still feels big. Worth the $!			"

												It's good. Really, it is. It's not, however, amazing. The short: The storyline is... cursory, at best. The game would lose virtually nothing if it weren't there at all. There are some annoyances in missions and travelling, and you need to be comfortable with the need to grind for gear, but all in all it's a very enjoyable space shooter.The long:As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, there's an almost consistent misrepresentation of the mission risk. Low? It could be, then again you could also barely make it out with an inch of hull left. Other times you end up against a ship you literally do not have the damage output to even touch the shields on. High? It could be. It could also be a milk run. It just doesn't make any sense.You do learn to recognize them, though. Some mission types seem straight forward, but will always end with you having to deliver something to a station that's under siege. Skip those. Escort missions are a pain, as in pretty much all games, Fancy waiting 2-3 minutes while your ship lines itself up for the escort? Fancy doing that numerous times as the journey is interrupted along the way? How about inside an asteroid field, where your ship keeps getting stuck on rocks, adding another few minutes. At first, I learned this was a perfect time to go fetch something to drink. Or check email. Or read a page or two of a book. Later, I learned to just save my sanity and skip them. Eventually I did learn a set of mission types I could reliably predict the difficulty of, and I just stuck with those and ignored everything else.There's a fair amount of travelling required, which is to be expected. Space is big, after all. What isn't fine is how often your travels are interrupted. There are countless asteroid and junk fields littered about, and odds are you'll be pulled out of warp a handful of times on most journeys. Which means you then need to crawl along to the edge before you can get back up to speed. If you pay attention you can spot some of them and go around. Not going in a straight line from one place to the next, also seems to help. Then there are the random enemy encounters, which have the same effect of slowing you down. You can spend time fighting them (if they are ship types and numbers you can handle), for loot worth next to nothing most of the time, or turn your tail and boost out of there. In most cases that'll have you on your way again in 30 seconds or so.So why the heck am I recommending it? I guess I must really like spaceships. And lasers. I had great fun, despite the above mentioned drawbacks. Enough so that I put 40 hours into it. After finishing the story, I kept going until I had the best ship fully upgraded. I then went back in a few more times to just fly around enjoying being invincible. For entertainment value, it was a bargain for the price.			"

												This game is great fun!The graphics are really well done, without it being particularly strenuous on your system. The game play is sound, offering an augmented version of a space flight sim that primarily uses 'broad-siding' as its main form of combat. There is a fair amount of progression to be had in the game upgrading ships and weapons. Even when you get to the point of maxing out your character, you will still find it a challenge taking down the end game enemies. The soundtrack is also awesome!You can easily put between 30 to 40 hours in a single play through, and because of the faction reward system you will have a quite a different experience choosing an opposing path.The only negative I can think of is that is heavily optimised for a controller/gamepad. *sigh* You can try with a keyboard and mouse, but you will find the experience a little skittish!Overall, I can thoroughly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a semi-casual space adventure!

												This game was a huge surprise for me, and I only ended up getting it after watching a favorite streamer of mine play it for an hour or so. For me, this game is like the perfect marriage of complex space battle/trading games like Freelancer and old simple quest-based space games like Solar Winds. I was able to easily start playing this and get a grasp for how to survive and have a blast within a couple hours. I was originally turned off by the fact that you are pretty much on a 2D plane and it isn't full 3D navigation, but the game hides it well during battles and it really makes it a lot easier to figure out exactly what is going on in any situation without needing the added complexity of a 3rd dimension. It took me awhile to get used to the limited information provided by the HUD, but I definitely enjoy the fact that my screen isn't cluttered with useless information all the time. If you have bandwidth restrictions, this game is a surprisingly small download, and the soundtrack is fantastic and really makes you feel like a Space Cowboy. Two thumbs up!			"

												A game that plays kind of like Wing Commander Privateer with a naval battle twist can't be wrong, you get the Mercenaries guild, the merchands guild and who knows maybe some alien stuff.Very entertaining, sometimes a bit grindy but hey, getting expensive gear and ships is not cheap, the main quest is quite interesting to follow also and when the mercenaries guild chick calls you, just say yes!Battles are very interesting and you can get the most of your tactics if you choose your turret slots wisely. Also there can be many different battle tactics depending on the choice of weaponry you use, laser, projectile, mines, etc.Mining is a bit rudimentary but still it plays well, I usually don't go mining on purpose unless I found about a juicy spot.I have spent quite a few hours and I have many more ahead (just visited 4 systems).If you like space battles and if you liked Wing Commander Privateer, just buy it.

												ok, i got this game on sale, and was it worth it? yea, absolutly, hell, its worth the 20 bucks. now im going to be honest and im pretty sure alot of you who have not bought this gem yet will agree, it was, at least for me, almost a turn off when i found out it was a 2d kinda game, and i dont mean graphicaly obviously, no i mean in the movement of your ship, that alone almost made me not want to try it. but man, am i glad i did, this game is amazing on so many levels, so good infact that im going to buy it again when it comes to consoles. first, the music! oh man, the in game music is so damn fitting and amazing, i will be honest, im not sure exactly what type of genre it fits into, but its sorta like a blues rock kinda hybrid, but its really well done and it fits the game, but if for whatever reason you dont like it, or just want to listen to your own music, there is an option to do that when you start the game. here is a youtube link to a song from the game (not my video)

												Picked up this game while it was on sale, I probably wouldn't have bought it full price. I definitely would've missed out. This game is easily work 20 bucks, but if it's on sale definitely grab it. It kinda feels like if you mixed Firefly and Star Wars. The atmosphere and music screams Firefly, but the space battles definitely feel like Star Wars. I've only put 5 hours into at this point but I can easily see myself sinking over 40 with repeat playthroughs. The soundtrack is awesome but I do think it might get repetetive after a while, but the devs have it set up where you can play your own music through the game. Or you can play pandora in the background like everybody else. It's kind of a bummer that you can't fly up and down, only side to side. It's kind of good though, the devs did it to keep the learning curve for flight low so you can focus on shooting in battles. The actively changing trade markets at the different ports was a really nice touch. You can literally do almost whatever you want. Wanna be a space miner? Go for it. Wanna be a pirate and attack the innocent? Do it big. Wanna be boring and just play the story? Waste your money. The game isn't too hard to pick up and beat, but it's not a cakewalk either. You don't have your hand held in this game, if offers tips but doesn't stop you from running into high level pirates if you're not careful. That being said, it isn't too hard to earn money and upgrade your ship or buy a new one. Overall, I highly reccomend this game to anybody that's ever wanted to pilot their own space ship.			"

												Perhaps the most enjoyable space game I have played.  The combat has a simple enough premise, yet the various options for weapon customization leave the player with a lot of interesting choices to make.  The difficulty seems spot on to me.  It's important to build out your ship carefully and plan how you want to attack.  Done correctly, most battles are challenging and engaging enough to keep me interested without making me feel like my crew are doing all the work for me.			"

												It's a 20 dollar game. So set your expectations accordingly.Meaning, expect it to be fun, but don't expect it to be everything under the sun either.At first glance, this is fairly typical open universe spaceship game where you get to fly, fight, trade, and maybe actually bother with the storyline (which is a fairly typical ""your aunt left you a spaceship, a mysterious device, now meet her at some space staion. Oh look, surprise, she didn't show up and you need to try to find her.............. or ignore the whacky old goat and make some money"").So far, a few hours in, not a lot of tediousness, although I do wish warp were a little faster. The danger in open universe games is that you can end up spending more time moving around than actually doing. Maybe that's real life, but this is a game.The broadside approach to combat is a nice take. That said, main turrets on AI control seem to do most of the work, my main job is piloting and making sure incoming fire doesn't whittle one set of shields down.As pretty much expected for a game with a small team building it, the AI is a bit brute force. ""Hard"" tends to be ""overwhelm"" you with either quantity or bricks you can't really hurt but have the big guns to hurt you. On the other hand, fighters can be easily kited and once an enemy gets hurt, they'll tend to try to run in a straight line, making it easy for you to focus on a single shield.			"

												I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves space games, whether you like to mine some asteroids, go bounty hunting or do some trading, this game has loads of fun for you. Graphics are beautiful on my mid-2012 MacBook Pro, that music gets you going and is easily turned off if that's your thing.  The only technical issues I had was to tweak the graphics settings down a little to help frame rate, restart the game after 3+ hours of gaming to fix the sound playback issues, and some Steam achievements not unlocking properly; nothing major and easily overcome for the most part.Trading is challenging, resources are scarce and requires you to carry multiple different items to fill your cargo holds, which you will need to partially unload/load at various points to do a full trade route.  There is money to be made, although progress is slower than fighting.  If you don't like fighting, its probably the easiest path.  If you get attacked, you always have the option to jettison some cargo and be on your way; you will make good friends with the pirates too!Mining is usually relaxing and uneventful, but you still have to be on the lookout for that surprise attack.  As with trading, progress is a bit slower than fighting,Talking about fighting, its definitely a lot more about strategy and positioning that it would be about flying skills.  In large fights, you find a way to pull a few ships away from the cluster, blow them to bits and repeat.  You control the position of your ship on a large 2-d plane, there is no such thing as a barrel roll so you probably don't have to worry about getting sick.  Aiming can be challenging when controlling the turrets yourself, so you might want to man the missile launchers or side ports cannons.Comes highly recommended, just make sure you check the difficulty levels of the mission before accepting them or even progressing through the story line or you will feel the heat when your ship core explode!

												Easily the best money I have spent this year. Totally took me by surprise what a fantastic , well-made game this is & deserves your attention. I must confess to thinking this was going to be another dull space sim........Couldn't have been more wrong. Think of it as a cross-hybrid Freelancer / Elite Dangerous (arcade mode). Sandbox style / campaign pathway that allows you to decide your character style. Pirate-hunter, trader, bounty-hunter, miner, mercenary in an open universe that changes on each playthrough. Staggering how good this is from a small studio. Here is one developer I won't make the same mistake of ignoring in the future.9/10 near perfect.			"

												I originally gave this game an abysmal review. It was actually one of the most read reviews, I even got a reply from the developer. I decided that since I loved his other games, I was going to give this one another go, and thankfully my save issues were gone, however then I ran into an issue with a story mission that wouldn't let me progress.Pros- The graphics are nice. The game runs even on older computers easily. There are lots of factions you can join to do different missions and gain unique stuff. Cons- Lots of bugs. The combat isn't 3d. Although you have the oppurtunity to try out various weapons, unless you take very specific weapons (missiles, missiles, missiles... you get the picture), combat will be tough. If you run out of missiles, well the mission is over for you, let yourself die and start over. LOTS of GRINDING. I wont say don't buy this game, only that it should still be listed as a beta so people understand it needs further development.			"

												I like the graphics and physics ..  Flying my ship makes me feel like a space captain again.  Some encounters are hostile, .. no problem..  we'll power up our weapons and prove our superiority (hopefully our ship upgrades are sufficient).I like the world's and galaxy .. the starting map opens up other maps ..  Not just one map .. there are more.  Makes you feel like you can go somewhere and explore, and find wealth and better technology.I like the many options of ships available and choices of various ""engines, weapons, shields, and more"".Though I could have used mining to earn money for ship upgrades, I chose to trade goods because of my play style.Beautiful graphics during batle and no ""Frames Per Second"" problems, considering I play on an outdated dell core 2 duo & Radeon 6750 pcie video card installed.The Negative:  There is a grind ""hard work / many hours"" to earn money, and/or progress with the game.  Some methods earn money better than others, keep in mind.A good game for $20 U.S dollars, but many improvements and content will be needed to reach a $40 U.S. dollar value.			"

												My advice: play this game, give it a try.It realy reminds me of ""Privateer"" an old game just coming after Wing commander. Its a nice feeling you can trade, you can do bonty hunting, you can help the militia or can even help traders that are in trouble. Thats quite fun.In the beginning i found it wired to fly and shoot with almost 90° difference. Broadsides shooting the main weapons during fight. But ok, after some time its easy to handle cause the aiming help does work quite good. All the fights feel quite balanced. This is one of the biggest advantages. Broadsides fighting realy mad fun! :) The only thing realy annoying is doing escort missions. Cause the warp flight is disturbed by masses like asteroids there are so often breaks and realignments during escort flight that just makes no fun at all.I have an old graficscard and played with DirectX9 but the space looked quite nice with all that particles. Not the best but ok for that game.you have different levels and different weapons you can try and use with weapons ports in your ship. you can buy ships bigger and bigger with more cargo space and more weapons ports. you can have special equipment. its all quite nice you can play arount with your ships spec.The music i didnt like, but you can have internet radio. With good music the space traveling realy makes fun!The missions are.. always similar, thats a bit boring but quite ok, cause the urge to play comes from ship customization. :)There are standard conversions with traders and the like, they could have been removed. they seem unreal and always equal. but  ok..Finally: You have many solar systems you can go and trade and do missions and that for a good game price. So thumb up for this game! :)			"

												This game was incredible.  For all that have attempted to capture the feel of Privateer, this is the only game I have felt really come close.  Best game I've played all year.  The only complaint was the best kind... that I finished the storyline but still wanted more.   But considering it was only $20, I feel I defintitely got my money's worth.   Better than most AAA titles at three times the price.Also, while I don't usually care about music in my games, the soundtrack here was excellent, and really added something to it.			"

												Take AC: Black Flag naval combat... Make it 10x better, stick it in space and add a wicked soundtrack, you have Rebel Galaxy. The combat is action packed, the ship customization system is awesome, it is easy to pickup & play and most of all, if you like the idea of naval combat, it will keep you entertained for a while.The only major drawback is the game is short. The main story line felt short, majority of my playing time was spent on collecting credit through side missions. Another minor drawback was the amount of customization. The way you upgraded the ships was awesome (buying/selling prices were equal, you could easily upgrade or downgrade between ships) however, there are only a limited type of weaponry to choose from.None the less, besides these drawbacks, if you enjoy space & naval combat, this game will give you a good fix. Personally I've spent 60 hours playing and enjoyed it.			"

												Absolutely great fun, especially for $20. I'm a huge fan of the old space sims like Privateer and Freelancer, and this is the first game in years to really replicate the feeling they gave me. I think part of it has to do with its fun ''space truckers' aesthetic, but it helps that it's also fast-paced and arcadey, as well as beautiful.Also, the fact that things are locked to a 2D plane really isn't a problem. There's plenty of room for tactical positioning, and it makes the broadsides on your ship useful and interesting. If you simply cannot stomach the thought of a space sim without full 3D flight, then give it a pass, but c'mon - open yourself to new things!			"

												This is a great game and tkaes hours to completely play through it.For 20 bucks I would say that this game is worth the cost and should get a best value award for the content that it brings to the table for the cost.To sum the game up you are a called in by your Aunt to go to the nastiest part of the galaxy and you have to fend for yourself. You find a relic that you repair and eventually you collect parts to repair the AI's memory. The AI then decides to sacrifice itself for the greater good and that's how the storyline rolls.As for the game play you'll find yourself warping throughout space fighting all types of spaceships and different situations which I found really fun to do.The game has a high difficulty curve so be warned, this game isn't for those really really casual gamers and is geared more towards those who can think on their feet and react quickly to different situations. If you need to remember to press your scanning key which is TAB by default to freeze the game and analyze the situation.I did 2 play throughs of the game one as a good guy and one as a bad guy. Both were pretty satisfying but it is really hard to be a bad guy. The storyline gears you toward being a good guy and to earn bad guy rep to actually enter their ports takes a long time. In the meantime you have to not♥♥♥♥♥♥off the civilians otherwise you'll have no ports that you can call your home and all you'll meet there is your end. No worries though missions will help keep your rep up so that shouldn't happen unless you get reckless.The game also does not limit you in what you want to do. I skipped the storyline and worked my way towards the endgame before coming back to complete it. By the time I finished the storyline on my first run through I already had a blackgate that was decked out with MK 5 pulse turrets that decimated anything that strayed within their range of fire. On the second play through I bought a quick ship (the Icarus) and rushed towards the end game areas and did adrenaline rush dead drop missions for hundreds of thousands of credits to reach the end game faster which felt really satisfying to do.Overall I loved the graphics of the game, it has a good soundtrack which you can make your own custom soundtrack as well, and the sound quality of the game is great as well. The only thing I am waiting on now to see if they will release DLC for the game or make a second sequel to the game which I will be more than happy to buy. If you like flying spaceships then give this game a try I promise that it will be worth your money.			"

												Just think Firefly + Cowboy Bebop = Rebel Galaxy.Didn't know what all to expect when watching the trailers, so I thought ""What the hell, I'll give it a shot.""  Then I gave it another...and another...and another, and before I was done, pirate fleets were torn asunder and floating lifeless in the cold, empty void of space.Overall:+ Put in close to 12 hours so far and still in the first system.  In many AAA-titles released these days (I'm looking at you CoD), the main part of campaigns can be completed in 5-20 hours, depending on how much content there is.  For a $20 game to beat out $60 games is a damn shame. It shows that bigger studios often care too much about profit, and not enough on a great experience like they used to.+ Sometimes takes on that addictive ""just one more mission"" quality+ Tight, responsive controls+ Again, for $20, the AI can be surprisingly good+ Like many have said, it's not a space sim, which, for me at least, was a good selling point.  No need for ultra-realism after seeing pretty pew-pew lasers and lots, and LOTS of explosions.+/- The soundtrack can be kind of a mixed bag.  It isn't terrible by any means, but after hearing the same 6-7 songs repeated over and over again in some sequences, I disabled the music in the settings and began listening to music downloaded from YouTube.  Yet if the developor can periodically update the game with new tracks, it'd be an added bonus. + Got to name my ship the Cowboy Bebop10/10 - See ya later space cowboy!			"

I will warn you that it gets grindy at times but its nothing to hard. I was able to log 45+ hours just with trying to finish up the story. It's just one of those endless games where you can still play side missions infinitly. It even is able to through in some allusions to some famous si-fi movies. Plus the little humor and the AMAZING sound track (which can be messed with and added to) makes for a great game.I just hope theres another one coming sooner rather then later.			"

												If you are a fan of ""Star Trek"" ish combat (a.k.a. dealing with shield facings,hull damage, and broadsides) then this is the game for you. I have spend over 35 hours and not even that far into the main game because of how fun it is. It is ""repetitive"" sure, but that's like saying Mario is repetitive because he is always jumping and running. The game IS a little ""mainstream"" and simpified, which could turn hard core PC gamers off, but if you are interested in a space combat/trading type game and have not experienced more in-depth games of that genre, than this is a perfect game to get your feet wet.10 out of 10, would buy again.

It has an engaging story line, the ability to conduct trade, choose loyalty to different factions through missions, great graphics, and a nice variety of ships. I was certainly not expecting a game of this quality for the price point.Some people might think this game repetitive, in that the frequent combat might be, but learning new fighting styles by changing up your weapons types keeps things fresh. It is derivitive, games like this have existed before, but it has a nice user interface and I know that I'll get more than my money's worth of enjoyment from it.AGAIN: snatch this game up, especially for the $20 I paid!Cheers			"

												Rebel Galaxy is a great game that has plenty of good balance to it, though granted I had to remind myself it wasn’t Freelancer* with all its similarities. With the constant reminder that your piloting a 2 dimensional ship through 3 dimensional space that makes use of primary functions for broad fire tactic’s while combatting fighter vessels that can fly in any direction was easy to notice the uniqueness Rebel Galaxy Possess in standing out from the rest of the space games to hit the market. One thing that would keep me engaged as a Gamer is the really good work with the Music Que’s between combat and Station Menu navigation. Yes you still get the option to customize your own music to the game, but speaking as an Audio Editor, there was some really good work into allowing the music to que into the combat scene’s. The music is so good that I even had the pleasure to find the list posted by Travis Baldree on the dev’s website Sound Track List**. Granted I enjoy my gameplay and found myself wanting a bit more in the way of controls, but I constantly found the fact of the simplified combat and turret options in ship to ship combat well simplified. I partly wished I could have been able to explore the stations or board the ships that constantly threatened me to get sucked into space, so as only to just see that I could do it, but still we wouldn’t have had such a well-planned out 2 Dimensional controlled 3D Space Combat game. Pro’s:•	Short but worthwhile story•	Simplified Ship controls•	Great Music Selections•	Persistent Markets when selling commodities – even gives a history on the price of the item, and system average for the entire System you’re in.•	Great Map Design and navigation assistance though lacks a little in cross coordination with other implemented features of the game.Con’s:•	Not Exactly Merchant Friendly: Always a hassle trying to find a price for a single item between all known locations that buy and sell commodities of a certain type. Would have like an option that allowed seeing at a quick list of last known prices at all stations for a single commodity.•	Stellar Mass often times stopping warp while not even in the way of the travel.•	Not all ships are available, can’t truly pilot a fighter or gunship.•	Not able to change direction up or down to evade Stellar mass in a direct collision course•	Not able to properly map Cone of angles for the turret systems being applied to the ships. (Kinda handy when attempting to do mining to know where the laser fire can reach.)•	Limitation to the Components that can be installed on all ships.•	Not able to easily pull up the map when needing to make a quick reference to a station or asteroid mining location when getting info or finding merchandise while in space.•	Limited to a single Mercenary Hire, can’t recruit an armada of Mercenaries.

												Easy to play controls, not a true space sim so some will hate it but some will love it. Looks great and runs well even on a slow♥♥♥♥♥4 year old rig with a GTX 560. Worth a shot if you want a fun simple open galaxy space combat and mining game.			"

												If you are a fan of ""Star Trek"" ish combat (a.k.a. dealing with shield facings,hull damage, and broadsides) then this is the game for you. I have spend over 35 hours and not even that far into the main game because of how fun it is. It is ""repetitive"" sure, but that's like saying Mario is repetitive because he is always jumping and running. The game IS a little ""mainstream"" and simpified, which could turn hard core PC gamers off, but if you are interested in a space combat/trading type game and have not experienced more in-depth games of that genre, than this is a perfect game to get your feet wet.10 out of 10, would buy again.

												Highly addictive game. Although there is a bit of grinding needed to get all the best stuff, there is a huge variety of ways to go about it.You can be a trader, go mining, work for different factions, or just go and shoot bad guys.Combat can be a bit tricky at times, I found the broadside hard to work at first until I realised they are not really for shooting down fighters, and you can switch to turrets to kill them. Once you start fighting bigger ships, the broadsides come in very handy.Some of the storyline missions can be a bit tedious, especially the escort ones, but all the other stuff is just too much fun for this to annoy me for long.

												So this wil be the first time i will be writting a review so bear with me. The combat in thisgame is pretty good for a spacecombat game, i particularly like the fact that they try to not make it overcomplicated, Then there is just the feeeling of freedom that you get. You get to go anywhere you want at any point. The feeling of vastness of space is also beautifully achieved, without making the travel times to long. The game has a lot of ships to updrage to and a lot of upgrades for these ships. The story could be better, but that is not what this game is about anyway. The combat system is excellent. There is great music and athmosphere within the game.Now for some of the negatives, the most glaring thing that i am missing is an experience system either for the crew or the captain. This could have created another interesting dimension to the game. Also the fact that you cannot assemble a fleet isquite disapointing, (you can hire a mecenary but only one at a time). All in all this game is one of the more enjoyable games i have played lately and i would definetly recommend it for everyone.			"

												This game is just great. you wanna be a ""cop"" do it, you want to be a pirate do it, you want to be kinda in the mid ♥♥♥♥ing do it.now into the game the controls for keyboard and mouse are great you dont have to stretch your hand around to do anything so the default controls are fine and you dont have to worry about them right off the bat you can go right into learning the game. the gameplay is really fun, in the first star system your fights wont be that long they will be over kinda fast wether you die or not but when you get past there and start getting 150k missions and start running into dreadnoughts some fights can go on for what seems like a long time. for story i cant say to much im not far into it at all but from what i have seen the story is fun it will prob get alot more serious along the way. and they dont feel repetative your side missions do to a point. note at the time of me wrighting this i have only played 21hrsif i would have to rate the game off what i have seen so far i would put it at an 8 or 8.5/10			"

												This is pretty much the space game I always wanted to play.  Not overly complicated with way too many systems to learn, just having fun flying around a beautiful galaxy, trading materials, destroying space pirates, and listening to an awesome Firely-esque soundtrack! The game takes place on a 2D plane, with an emphasis on broadside combat, but the option for other forms of attack such as turrets, lasers, mines, etc. exists.  Basically, if you've ever played Assassin's Creed IV, the game plays very similarly to the boat sailing and combat, only more responsive and more entertaining.  There are 21 ships available to purchase and fly, as well as many items for customizing them, including weapons, defense, and more!Pros:-Runs perfectly with little to no slowdown.-Beautiful graphics with plenty of options to change.-Great music, with an easy option to add your own music in a number of areas, such as battle music, ambient music, etc.-Big universe.  While not nearly as big as other space games out there, it's still plenty big.  I've played six hours so far and haven't even left the first galaxy that you start in, and there seems to be at least 10+ to explore.-Price: $18 at launch ($20 later) is a steal for this game.  It runs smoother and I haven't encountered any bugs so far, which is more than I can say for many of the AAA games that I've payed $60 for recently.-Most importantly: FUN! Cons: -One of the only cons I would say is that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of a damage model for ships.  If you ship is severely damaged, you may see a few minor explosions and fire going on around it, but you aren't missing any chunks of your ship or anything like that.  Pretty minor in the long run when compared with all the pros.-Possible con is that many of the side missions are similar, so you could get burned out after a while.  The positive is that you can do the story missions which offer a bit more variety, or take a break and play something else for a while!-Not really a con, but you can only save when you dock at a space station, which can be a bit annoying if you need to leave suddenly, but there are plenty of space stations, usually less than a minute away, and the game offers an easy option to find the nearest space station.Overall, if you're looking for a fun game with a cheap price, look no further than Rebel Galaxy.

												Fantastic game. I'm a big space sim fan, but this hits the spot in the most simple ways. Yes, it's not true 3D, but once you start having a blast with this title you won't notice the 2D plane. It's very similar to an old favorite ""Pirates!"". If you've played that game, you'll know how addicting it can be at times. The devs seem incredibly genuine and the game is much deeper and more strategic than first glance. As a PC player, I'm enjoying playing with a more XBOX controller; it's very intuitive and relaxing. I really hope the devs continue to support and expand on this game.			"

I had no problems downloading, installing, saving, or loading the game whatsoever usually that is where STEAM totally screws its customers.

												If you are looking for a new Freelancer, this is as close as it can get. Of course, the broadside combat and the 2D space navigation is a bit strange at first, but after you got your first new ship and finished a few missions, the gameplay flow really steps in.Yes, it is a bit grindy between the story missions, but so was Freelancer. Also, you can simply ignore the whole storyline if you want and just go out there and fight or trade for the milita, merchant guild, mercenary guild or the pirates of course.For this low-end price, it is well worth the money!

												The nice graphics, cool effects, solid story and an awesome soundtrack make up a great atmosphere. Combining a the great atmosphere with a fun combat system with some random systems and a premade storyline, and you get a very fun game.There are elements of ARPG with being able to tweak your ship setup, which alter the way you do combat. All the ships looks cool.The game systems has some depth that you can use to your advantage, as an example I saw some people complain that debris can break your warping speed. But you can actually evade some of them by going around them, or even just shift to the side slightly if you are quick and skilled enough.Combat is fun while not being to difficult to learn. Some people will not like that its not full 3d combat with HOTAS support like Elite Dangerous. I don't mind this as it looks like this isn't aimed to be space flight sim game.I'm at 2nd system and has played ca. 18 hours. Been distracted quite a few times with some trading and mining.EDIT: The game runs SUPER smooth on my i5+nvidia 560. 3 years old system.TLDR; Great atmosphere, solid story, fun gameplay. Yes, you should play it. :)9/10			"

												I enjoy the game a lot and really appreciate the work the developers have put in post release (Two patches in the two days it's been out).While Linux is not supported (though the developer has mentioned it's a possibility, someday) between patches and trial and error it's pretty stable through Wine and runs wonderfully. The game is extremely scalable, looking great on my Intel HD 4500 work PC and my GTX460 PC at home.The game is a lot of fun as well. If you want Freelancer or Freespace's dogfights and 3D twisting through space combat this may not do it for you, but if you want cruisers and capital ships larger than city blocks to pull along side each other and let off a broadside volley while your flak cannons evaporate fighters buzzing around you this is it.

												If your a fan of the t.v series ""Firefly"", you will adore this game. Space meets the wild west of america. You can pretty much play however you want to really, either as a pirate, a merc, a bounty hunter, a trader, a do-gooder, a member of the system milita or anything else that comes to mind. Factions are present in the game and you can change your relations with the vast amount of them. The milita, citizens, red devil cartel and others are the major ""players"". There is a lot of replay-ability in this game and each playthrough offers a lot to do. Any valuable free time?, prepare for it to simply cease existing.There are quite the variety of ships to choose form each with their own playstyle and role in combat, ranging from corvettes to huge dreadnaughts bristling with firepower. Also, RAMMING SPEED! is completley viable when you get the right deflector shield. >:DIn terms of preformance, the game is pretty well optimized and I havent experienced any FPS drops nor crashes or glitches in the game so far. The only real issue is with the set up for the graphics being done out side of the game before launch. Other than that the game has rebindable keys for those wanting to change their keyboard set up and is also usable with a game pad as well.Finally lets get some of the ""meh"" points out of the way: 1) such as only being a 2D plain which really isnt to much of a problem (unless your a 3D space I WANNA GO EVERYWHERE fanatic) but a 3D plain would be nice but the game still works great with just 2D, and 2) being only a singleplayer experience which is great but the concept of playing with friends in co-op or being in a large server with many others effecting the world of rebel galaxy together. The possabilites are pretty big. Think player made factions and guilds fighting wars for resources or player made pirate groups raiding player escorted relief convoys that will effect economys in the game and the major factions relations and standing in the world.Overall I would very much recomend this game to anybody who is a fan of si-fi and or western drama with its beautiful world and fun gameplay with a large choice of options and intense ship on ship combat.I hope to see you all out there in this mad galaxy my fellow starship captains! for profit! for reputation! and for being the greatest badasses that this galaxy's ever seen!

												Needs polish but I can forgive its sins since it was only $20.  Great space cowboy soundtrack, graphics, gameplay.  Yadda yadda.What rustles my jimmies though is that it suffers from escort mission hell; something I'd hoped gaming had put behind it a long time ago.  Escort quests are quite simply, broken.  Slow, tedious and prone to utter disfunction.  Escorts will charge the nearest enemy capital ship and hump its broadside.  To proceed, you must endure the synchronized lumbering of both ships as they sluggishly array themselves for a joint warp jump constantly broken by dozens of random junk gravity wells and meaningless random hostile encounters.  More synchronized lumbering, jump, stop, fight/lumber some more, ad infinitum.  THEN you might not EVER reach your destination anyway as the pathing seems to bug out; I had one escort mission start/stop over 15 times before it broke entirely, seperating me from the escort mid jump and causing a mission failure on what felt like a half hour pain test.  A shame that the broken escort quest system was pushed out the door.  The whole sync-jump thing needs to go.  Have the damn escort follow YOU, not the other way around.And upon first installation I had some random crash-your-pc bug going on.  A suggestion from the dev to turn on the vsync and swith the render engine to dx9 seemed to fix it though.  Kudos to the dev for quickly helping people in the forums with tech problems.If it was a $60 game, I'd be angry.  I'm more forgiving of a budget title, especially since the rest of the game really is very nice, even the characters in the space stations and voice work.  Found amusement in just listening to the wierd animated alien jabber they came up with for some species rather than just clicking through it.  Despite my griping I have truly enjoyed my time with Rebel Galaxy and look forward to finishing it.  Better than many $60 titles I've picked up in my time.			"

												An awesome Space game where you can choose your destiny by choosing to be a trader; pirate; bounty hunter or any combonation thereof. The graphics are amazing; and the gameply is fun; it reminds me a lot of Sid Meier's Pirates! but in space. There are plenty of missions to do and you will need to pick up quite a few of these to build out your ship before proceeding along the story line. This game provides a pretty wide space to explore; I'm only 10 hours in; but the areas are quite vast with plenty of random encounters. There are also several factions that you will gain and lose reputation based off the choices you make in dialog and missions. The only thing that was disappointing was that this is not a 3D game; meaning that navigation is encompassed within a 2d field. The voice acting is good and the graphics are well synched to the voices. All in all this was def worth the money I paid for it and I'm looking fwd to see how the game unfolds and will probably setup another game to become a pirate just to try out that aspect of things. This is great space sandbox game!!			"

It's just one of those endless games where you can still play side missions infinitly. It even is able to through in some allusions to some famous si-fi movies. Plus the little humor and the AMAZING sound track (which can be messed with and added to) makes for a great game.I just hope theres another one coming sooner rather then later.			"

												A fantastic title if you're looking for a robust starship sim. You select your craft from a wealth of options that range from a speedy corvette-class vessel to a dreadnought bristling with a dozen turrets. Combat is reminiscent of naval warfare, where you try to position yourself to blast your foes with powerful broadside weaponry and the options for arming yourself are truly staggering. You can arm your ship with particle beams, mines, flak cannons, missiles, anti-matter cannons, pulse turrets... there's an option for every playstyle and you can sink hours into perfecting your unique ship.There's a wealth of content to be had but the downside is that a lot of it can grow repetitive. Upgrades for your ship don't come cheap and as difficulty spikes can be quite jarring you'll find yourself doing a lot of the same basic missions over and over again to get yourself up to snuff. The mechanics themselves are a joy, though, which really helps to ease this shortcoming and the moment to moment opportunities for profit allow you to choose between piracy, mercenary activity or just plain honest trade.All in all, if you're looking for a space sim that will spoil you for choice, Rebel Galaxy is the game for you.

												Start with a crappy ship and some story missions in a randomly generated galaxy, and then do whatever you feel like to upgrade and then replace your ride. Mining/Bounty hunting/Piracy/Trading/Mercenary contracts, all the staples of this genre are available. And unlike in Elite: Dangerous, they actually work!Movement is on a 2d plane only, no barrel rolling or anything. This means combat is somewhat like with ships on water, with broadsides. There's a bunch more stuff going on, with point defense and deflectors to absorb damage and pointing the side that still has armor/shields towards the enemyIt's fun and the price is fair.			"

												Rebel galaxay is alot of fun out of the gate, very low learning curve but plenty of depth. Trading, hey you wanna run between star sytems and trade you can do that. Minning wanna mine some resources sure you can do that to (but rarely super valuable) then sell it to traders you pass by or stations. Play as a guardian angel and protect mining tugs, or other militia ships, maybe come across a distress beacon and save a merchant in need. Play as a pirate and destroy the minning tugs, or merchants, take there loot and prosper.the biggest beef i have with this game is the story feels a bit short and shallow. Fetch missions after fetch missions. But if you enjoy space games or naval combat this is a great buy for $20.			"

												What a fun game! Let me get to the point: Its a standard ""shoot, trade, do missions"" space game in the spirit of privateer. It does not have much depth, not more than standard games of this genre but the combat feeling is amazing! Run into 20 enemy frigates and rip them apart using your automated turrets - PRICELESS! Yes combat is not demading at all, just turn the side your want to expose towards enemy fire and wait for the shield to recharge, but the feeling is great. Its a fun game that is very well worth the money I spent on it. Some will complain that it lacks real 3D feel since there is up or down, it all happens in a single plain, but I don't mind it much. Instant fun in a genre I love, a genre that seriously lacks games lately. Have fun:)And I almost forgot to add: Great soundtrack! Makes me feel like a true space cowboy!			"

												This game hits the perfect sweet spot of being deep enough to really sink your teeth into, without being too complex to throw off the average user. The space fighting is in 2 dimensions, but I think the gameplay is better for it as the AI responds in realistic ways. Travel times are not overly long, and unexpected events (eg distress signals) happen just often enough to keep things interesting. Overall, this game is an amazingly immersive space based rpg.			"

												Great ""simple"" space sim in the tradition of Freelancer and the like.  I honestly enjoy the game greatly, and have been wanting something like it o come along for a very long time.  Its very ""sandbox"" in feel, and very ""free form"" in the choices you have to advance your character.  Both of the mentioned features are ones I look for and love in a game.Honestly, if they made expansion packs with more stories, more ships, more star systems to explore, and just plain MORE stuff, I would happily continue to hand them money.As many have said, the game is a little ""shallow"".  But, honestly, I think that is because the developers are only getting started; and have yet to show us what they can really do with the (hopefully crosses fingers) Rebel Galaxy franchise.This is a great start to what I hope becomes a epic series of expansions, DLCs, and hopefully additional titles down the road.

												now, i only have 9 hours on record but still, let me tell about a mission i did.first i accepted a mission wich said that i was given 15 units of gold ingots and was to deliver them to a station in another system. now my first thought was, hmm it says very hight risk in red text. but since it was a deliver mission i thought again, how hard can that be while i start wondering about why it says it very high risk. i jump to the system and activate warp and setting course for the station. as i approach i start to really wonder and gets nervous of why it says very high risk. when i was 900 sm (distance in the game) away from the station. i was suddenly dragged out of warp and in the matter of 2 seconds lasers rockets and scatter turrets was firing at my ship. in panic i activate my deflector, it wears of after 1 second due to how much damage it can take. then i try to escape. but as i try that, i see 3 fregates infront of me and when i looked all around it was 4 other fregates all around in circle. again in super panic i started button mashing the space button to activate my deflector. then the computer says: system critical. and 2 seconds later. my ship exploded. i spawned at the last station i was docked at. i then spent 4-5 hours on getting uppgrades a new ship, new weapons, new turrets and getting rich in another way. when i saw in my mission log i found the same mission and there it said. risk: low. then i decided to try again. they stopped me again, but i was like: hahaha they cannot penetrate my shields. and then i started killing them one after one. it was a 6 minute intense battle. in the end. i was very happy and was avable to deliver thoose gold ingots.10/10 would go for full revenge agian with lasers MOHAHAHAHAsorry for the long post, so here, take a banana :D			"

												 This is a MUST BUY if your into space trading asteroid mining and deep ship customization. The graphics are truly stunning  and the ships are amazingly detailed. You won't be short for things to do in the universe either. Take on jobs for different factions  which will affect your alignment and will determine if your ambushed by one of their destroyers and swarms of fighters.Risk is rewarded with your purchase of upgraded weapons and if you earn enough and save up you'll get that new ship youve been drooling over. The galaxy is teaming with ramdomized loot ripe for the picking and rare items that will fetch you big money at the nearest station or wherever they pay the biggest price for it.Asteroids and ships blow up in immensley satisfying ways you feel the impact of the 8 or 14 laser turrets you mounted on your ship. Is your ship a quick and nimble fighter capable of slowly wearing down your opponets shields? Or a gigantic war machine capable of harvesting enemy ships  for their cargo and bounties!I have a hard time believing this is only 19 US dollars its worth triple that in content alone go and buy it now!

												good game, some problems it doesnt have much replay value. they show you a lot of sectors on the sector map and first map you think that each map will be like a new level but after first area the rest of the game sends you into pretty much all the other areas for a short time. they have some awesome looking huge ships with a ton of guns worth a butt load of money but by the time you have the money to purchase them the games done leaving you with pick up escort and some attack side missions, at the same time you dont really even need the big ships you can beat the game with the third ship fairly easy. they say you have ability to choose factions and that may be true but from my play you have people already hostile and the good guys with no way of really becoming a bad guy unless you hammer out pirate/raider w/e side missions non stop for a long time to get them to like you. i would buy this game again if i had to but would definitely wait for a sale. hopefully they update the game to give it some more content. i never review so sorry if its written bad			"

												If you're like me, you might have looked at this and said, ""Hmm, could this be like EVE Online?"" The answer is yes and no. While it certainly is easier to pick up than EVE, there are some aspects that could really use more explaining, such as ""If I switch weapons, does that mean the AI will handle my broadsides while I plink away on turrets?"" It also can be rather difficult to concentrate on aiming boardsides, piloting, keeping an eye on shields, and trying to figure out if you should break off your current target and take on the guy plinking you from ""behind"" your camera. A scrollable camera would be quite helpful for that, or a larger HUD radar. Despite that, it's been rather interesting so far.			"

												This game is beautiful, has an excellent soundtrack, and the game play is fun and addictive. The  decision to use a single plane battleship style combat was genius.

												I only have about an hour into this game, but I am falling in love.  It has a very similar atmosphere as Firefly, the western in space vibe, which is great.  It looks good, it has very intuitive controls, interesting combat, and plus, who doesn't love a good space adventure?  My only criticism would be that its weird to be in a space sim and be locked to a single plane, but perhaps a full 360 playfield would be overwhelming...or something?

												Okay, so I just finished the main quest and feel like I'm ready to give my 2 cents. First impressions are good! Great soundtrack, the early space battles have a nice intuitive rock-scissor-paper-feel (probably got them in the wrong order). Mid-game, I'm kind of grinding for credits. I need so and so many million to reach tier 6-weapons and to maybe fight the big battles and come out on top. I don't know if I made it too easy, but I went for the fast ""Barracuda"" so I could out-maneuver and out-run my enemies and then pick the fighters of off in bite-size chunks and move in to the ""blind spots"" of the capital ships and just wear them down with ma lazers..  Where was I.. yes the grind! It came to a point where my strategy was sound, but I still didn't feel ready to further the main quest. Lots of grinding later I had my weapons and went in to the much to short late-game and now I'm the hero. And still don't feel like I care about my aunt! I mean, for a game that has the plot-hook, that I want to find my aunt and help her, then they should have focused more on the story-line and flesh out the characters of the game. Most of the missions where fun the first 25 times I did them, except for the escort missions, they NEVER became any fun. While you're in the middle of fighting capital ships and fighters, your escort-buddy up and killed himself. Poor form! The funniest side mission was when a discreet gentleman needed my assistance to reacquire lost items. When I get to the pick up, the cargo is pin-up monthly magazines! The gentleman was shipping dirty magazines and suddenly I understand why I was under oath not to tell his wife. Those kind of quirky side-missions makes me smile. I don't know who that man is, but I instantly like both him and his wife and I'm curious about their relationship and his business enterprise. It's like the developers have good story-writers but they are put on writing up side-missions instead of making sure the follow-through for the main story is solid. If you want 10+ hours of fun, go get it! If you another 10 hours of grind look no further! It's good enough game and I give it my dubious thumbs up. =)			"

												I enjoy it because I enjoy space games like this, and that's why I recommend it. If, from the trailers, gameplay videos, whatever, you think you won't like it, don't get it. It's a lot of grinding, with a poor, unengaging story. But there's a lot to be said for making your own stories, even if you have to make up a lot of it yourself and the game provides very little to support that.The gameplay's pretty fun (though it's basically a sea/navy battle in space on one plane) in my opinion. The options and variety of weapons, shields, etc. are nice, though it would be nice to be able to customize your ship to make it more ""yours"".Overall 7.5/10 for being a solid game, but doing little to distinguish itself from the crowd of other space games. Also grinding. ♥♥♥♥ing grinding.			"

												Negatives:- Lack of innovation. This is a copy of the (working) Wing Commander Privateer formula, albeit in two dimensions.- Balance issues when it comes to weapon choice.- Minor progression spiking issues. For example, there are times when you find one salvage item that is worth more than your next 10 entire missions.- Lack of end game. Basically once you have Mark 6 shields and pulse turrets the game is over.- The decision to make this a 2D game makes little sense to me. It takes away from the astrobatics experience and simplifies gameplay.- Some tedious game mechanics with warp travel. Finding an asteroid belt with some salvage seems meant to be a nice surprise, but in reality it's just annoying because it drops you out of warp and the only salvages (as far as I know) which give high-credit equipment rather than commodities are the ones you take off of ships. The number of times I had to veer just to the right or left of an asteroid and use thrusters to get back into a safe state to use warp drive was far too many.Positives:- Provides good value for $20, especially if you are a huge fan of the series' that it takes from (Privateer, Dark Star One).- Stable. No real performance issues.I know the negatives list is longer than the positives, but I would still recommend the game if you are a space exploration fan just looking for a remake of Privateer without the daunting depth of X3.

												Okay, this is a great game, ive got a fair few hours into it and am far from being bored. However, the game has a lot of things which need to be fixed:- The difficulty system, please oh please fix the difficulty system. For those of you that don't know, when you accept a mission the game tells you how difficult it is based on your ship, which is great. Except it's horrifically broken right now, i have absolutely dominated ""hard difficulty"" missions and been absolutely rekt on easy difficulty missions, the system, to put it plainly, is pointless in it's current state-Fighter class ships, they are supposed to be these little craft which acompany larger ships to help them in fights. However some missions you get only fighter class ships, and they are hilariously overpowered. In a fight of me vs 7 normal sized ships(roughly my own ships size) i can win if i use tactics, a bit of luck and a lot of guns. But in a me vs 7 fighter class ships? Heck no, i get dominated like a david and goliath fight. Let's not forget that these are supposed to be small, relatively weak ships which fight you AS WELL AS regular ship, it makes some parts of the game completely impossible, such as a mission i went on recently. The mission was simple- destroy a chrono relay and any response squad you encounter. The relay was easy, the response squad? 30 fighter ships surrounding my ships on every single direction. They closed in and there was no way to get through them without ramming through one part of the blockgade they had formed, which i did and i was unsurprised to find my shields and hull drop faster than call of duty's sales. Basically the message is this- NERF THE FIGHTERS FOR MY SANITY'S SAKE PLEASE I CAN'T GO THROUGH ANOTHER FIGHT LIKE THAT-lastly, mercenaries randomly dying is a problem, i'll warp from a civilian base and suddenly the mercenary death sound will play and it will give me the message ""your mercenary, sparrow, has ejected"" this glitch costs me 30,000 credits every time i get it so i would be very grateful if you could fix itThose are the only major issues i've found so far, other than that, an amazing space game with huge potential			"

Who wants to wait 3yrs and pay nearly 100mil for a game that never comes out...hint hint Star Citizen? given a choice between 3-4 years of promises of the perfect game which if it does come out is a let down due to all the hype...or a dirty efficent, less than perfect but has heart game which comes out early and exceeds expectations all for 20 dollars...well....that in my tiny oppinion is the game for me.GO GET THIS GAME....!its only 20 bucks made by two firefly fans...no way to loose.

												9/10Fantastic space fairing action.The trailers caught my attention with nice colourful space battles some time ago, but nothing prepared me for how fun this game was. I went in cautiously as it breaks one of main rules for space battling games, thou shall not restrict motion to a 2D plane, but I needn't have worried.  Combat is fast and tactical and full to the brim with laser beams and tracer fire and trailing missiles while surrounded by explosions, while you're led along either by your own need (to gain bigger ships and guns) or the story that lies within.The story was reasonably interesting and lifted up by some surprisingly competent voice acting but woefully under developed, but with this game's price point it would be daft to expect more than what was already crammed in, I just lamented that one of the characters in game was not pushed more to the front along side the player in a MasterChief / Cortana style relationship. Graphically the game takes its own style and runs with it, with some of the ship designs varying from interesting to inspired, though I would've liked to have seen more of the fighters and gunships. With player control being restricted to larger ships (frigates up to drednaughts) there was a missed oppurtunity for building a squadron of fighter level craft to follow you about. Perhaps that's something the developers could investigate for DLC or a sequel.This game was a surprise in terms of quality. If you want a space game in the vein of Elite that makes with the action and less with the simulation, you will find a home here for some time. The 40 hours I've spent with this title will attest to that.			"

												I have long been a fan of Freelancer to the point I have spent years lementing the fact that my system no longer supports it. I have played more games then I can honestly count, here I have found some thing of that long lost love. This game gives yopu a huge freedom of movement and choice, an interesting story where you actually effect some of the outcomes, not to mention addicting combat. One of the best parts is taking on random jobs as a no-name Merc trying to build up your ship and reputation. Just when you think your ship is bad♥♥♥♥♥ and your a king of the stars you find out that the Galaxy is a much bigger place then you first realized and that you are little more then a fly in space. Don't be discouraged because this is part of what makes this game amazing, it evolves, it challanges you, it makes you work for what you want without just coddling you like so many games. The learning curve isn't too extreme but starting out you will find sooner then later that you need to make money if you want to survive and it gives you a number of options to achieve this ranging from saving beligured stations, rescue Merchants who are on the short end of luck, There are also the Merchant and Mercenary guilds that give you a huge oppurtunity to expand your reach with jobs, equipment and ships. All the while you have to decide which side of the law you are on. Are you a Pirate? Smuggler? A devil may care merc, or a hero, or are you some kind of mix between. If you want a game that is strangely addicting, well made, with a good sound track (honestly the best I have ever heard) It is like Firefly meets Freelancer. If that doesn't impress you then you have no soul, if it does, strap in for one hell of an inter-stellar ride.			"

												Very Fun Game!  I am not a hardcore space simulation player but this game is a lot of fun for my casual playing style.  I get to play a few hours here and there during the week and this was well worth the 20 bucks.  Good soundtrack, good graphics, plenty of content.  You do have to grind missions to upgrade ships and weapons but it is still fun to do and not that time consuming. Also had fun reading up on which weapon combos are better for capitol ships vs. fighters.  Made the game so much more enjoyable after researching that.			"

												I finished the storyline just recently and it was fun! Thank you to the developers for such a great time! I had my friends sit to my left and my right while during the final storyline battle, then there was a giant explosion and they all said ""Woah!"" at the same time. It was epic. I'm now shopping for similar games to enjoy what this genre has to offer, and I'll definitely play more Rebel Galaxy when the developers come back with more for me to do in the universe they've created.

												If you've ever played an old Ambrosia Software game called Ev Nova, and you loved it like I did despite a large amount of tedium involved; then this is undoubtedly a breath of fresh life into a classic of my childhood and you should most certainly play this game.While the dialogue and narrative is less detailed than that of Ev Nova it more than makes up for it by improving tenfold on what gameplay was lacking from Nova (not all that hard since it's so old, granted). If you don't know Ev Nova that's fine because this game is fantastic without comparison to its conceptual predecessor.Solid 8.5/10 (Only losing points because I think the narrative could be richer)			"

												After playing the game a bit longer I have to unfourtunately change my review score. The reason is that there isn't really much to the game except doing same type of missions over and over or follow the rather uninteresting and lacklustre story. So you can get maybe 20-30 hours of fun gaming out of this but after that it gets repetetive and boring.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is a beautiful space opera with story and open world elements. The combat is fun and engaging and there are tons of ships to upgrade too. However I feel the game gets a bit repetetive after a while but still well worth buying. However one would wonder what kind of game would be made if this game, with awesome graphics, was combined with Beyond Sol, which has innovative and fun gameplay but mediocrea graphics.			"

												This game is really fun.  I'm not sure it has a tremendous amount of replay value, but I really like it.  I've been looking for something similar to MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries for years and this is pretty close, just in space.  You are essentially a rogue captain on a journey to learn what happened to your sister.  This is the main story, but there are a lot of side quests and events to do.  Trade runs, save people, attack rival factions, quests, attack militia, contraband, etc..  I like being able to upgrade my ship, as well as, the armaments of this ship.Also, hands down, this game has one of the best sound tracks ever.  Look it up on YouTube... a lot of really good songs.

												Okay, this is a great game, ive got a fair few hours into it and am far from being bored. However, the game has a lot of things which need to be fixed:- The difficulty system, please oh please fix the difficulty system. For those of you that don't know, when you accept a mission the game tells you how difficult it is based on your ship, which is great. Except it's horrifically broken right now, i have absolutely dominated ""hard difficulty"" missions and been absolutely rekt on easy difficulty missions, the system, to put it plainly, is pointless in it's current state-Fighter class ships, they are supposed to be these little craft which acompany larger ships to help them in fights. However some missions you get only fighter class ships, and they are hilariously overpowered. In a fight of me vs 7 normal sized ships(roughly my own ships size) i can win if i use tactics, a bit of luck and a lot of guns. But in a me vs 7 fighter class ships? Heck no, i get dominated like a david and goliath fight. Let's not forget that these are supposed to be small, relatively weak ships which fight you AS WELL AS regular ship, it makes some parts of the game completely impossible, such as a mission i went on recently. The mission was simple- destroy a chrono relay and any response squad you encounter. The relay was easy, the response squad? 30 fighter ships surrounding my ships on every single direction. They closed in and there was no way to get through them without ramming through one part of the blockgade they had formed, which i did and i was unsurprised to find my shields and hull drop faster than call of duty's sales. Basically the message is this- NERF THE FIGHTERS FOR MY SANITY'S SAKE PLEASE I CAN'T GO THROUGH ANOTHER FIGHT LIKE THAT-lastly, mercenaries randomly dying is a problem, i'll warp from a civilian base and suddenly the mercenary death sound will play and it will give me the message ""your mercenary, sparrow, has ejected"" this glitch costs me 30,000 credits every time i get it so i would be very grateful if you could fix itThose are the only major issues i've found so far, other than that, an amazing space game with huge potential			"

												I believe I've put enough time into this game to warrant a fair review. On a personal note, this is the only game in my library where I've had to think really hard about giving it a thumbs up or down.What is it: imagine a sid meiers pirates in space. Its open world, with emphasis on combat. You fly into two dimensional space combat and shoot your broadside cannons into your opponent. I'm not praising or condemning this mechanic, its just the way it is. You can trade, but in the most simple sense of the word, the game tells you which resources are too highly priced/ lowly priced in each station. If you cannot complete the next required story mission, the only thing you can do is to go grind for more credits to upgrade until you can.Pros- SimpleCons- Too simpleThe lightspeed travelling is really annoying, I've spent probably more than half my ingame time travelling from A to B and you automatically drop out of ""warp"" if you encounter something. So you have to sit there listening to a very limited soundtrack waiting an average of about a minute till you reach your destination, trying to avoid asteroid fields etc. Longest warp time has been around 2 minutes, you get where you need to go, blow someone up and spend 2 minutes warping back.I didnt make it past the second world by the time I decided to stop playing (so I can only give information relevant up to that point in the game). Your main source of damage against big ships are your broadsides and missiles, this requires no planning or skill. Fire as much and as fast as you can and hope they blow up first. If you blow up first, dont retry, you will die again, there is no strategy to change. Upgrade one module on your ship (shield, broadside, turret) go back and you'll win. Rinse and repeat. Dont get me wrong the first hour is a blast but when you realise that you've experienced 90% of the game already, its pretty demoralising - and I'm not one to sit there to finish grinding it through till the end just for the sake of completion (though it took me a while to come to that conclusion).

												This is the best game I've played in the very narrow mouse-driven/space-shoter genre. It's most similar to Firefly-meets-Freelancer and it's just as cool as that sounds. It also has a sweet soundtrack which will admittedly get annoying by the time you beat the same. Still appreciated every time you have to warp or fight, though. Definitely a must-play for fans of the genre.			"

												I had a really great time playing this game. It seems strange at first and I thought there's something wrong with my set up because I couldn't pitch forward or pull up. I investigated and realized that the game only plays like a battleship in space. You turn left and right but you don't pull up or pitch forward. I almost decided to ask for my money back but I decided to give it a few more minutes of playtime and realized I was really having a lot of fun. The graphics are awesome and the battles are great. You have main broadside cannons that are forward and rearward 90° from the side of your ship, and then small cannons mounted in various places that automatically fire at fighters. You can take control of the small cannons but you have so much going on it's better just to control the broadside cannons to take out the big ships you're fighting while you let the small cannons work independently on the fighters.There is definitely strategy that you need to use in this game. You'll find yourself suddenly surrounded and if you don't get out fast you'll be pounded to space junk. I recommend the long burning sub light thrusters. They managed to get me out of most tight spots. Make sure you always buy the newest shields, broadsides, and thrusters that are being offered as fast as you can.To sum it up, whenever I spend $17.99 and get 80 hours worth of fun, I figure I'm doing pretty dang good! It's totally worth the money!			"

												Needs polish but I can forgive its sins since it was only $20.  Great space cowboy soundtrack, graphics, gameplay.  Yadda yadda.What rustles my jimmies though is that it suffers from escort mission hell; something I'd hoped gaming had put behind it a long time ago.  Escort quests are quite simply, broken.  Slow, tedious and prone to utter disfunction.  Escorts will charge the nearest enemy capital ship and hump its broadside.  To proceed, you must endure the synchronized lumbering of both ships as they sluggishly array themselves for a joint warp jump constantly broken by dozens of random junk gravity wells and meaningless random hostile encounters.  More synchronized lumbering, jump, stop, fight/lumber some more, ad infinitum.  THEN you might not EVER reach your destination anyway as the pathing seems to bug out; I had one escort mission start/stop over 15 times before it broke entirely, seperating me from the escort mid jump and causing a mission failure on what felt like a half hour pain test.  A shame that the broken escort quest system was pushed out the door.  The whole sync-jump thing needs to go.  Have the damn escort follow YOU, not the other way around.And upon first installation I had some random crash-your-pc bug going on.  A suggestion from the dev to turn on the vsync and swith the render engine to dx9 seemed to fix it though.  Kudos to the dev for quickly helping people in the forums with tech problems.If it was a $60 game, I'd be angry.  I'm more forgiving of a budget title, especially since the rest of the game really is very nice, even the characters in the space stations and voice work.  Found amusement in just listening to the wierd animated alien jabber they came up with for some species rather than just clicking through it.  Despite my griping I have truly enjoyed my time with Rebel Galaxy and look forward to finishing it.  Better than many $60 titles I've picked up in my time.			"

												The broadside combat, along with sectors on shields really kept me engaged. Sound and visuals are spot on. There was enough ship variety to always have me looking forward. Weapon variety would be ok, if beam weapons were balanced.Just finished the story section, I will be playing through again. Which is something I rarely do.Few Quality of Life issues when I tried to focus on being a trader.-The information on an entire systems commodities are never in an easy to read, accessible screen; on the map it's in a small alternating area per planet, and in the market it's a slow scroll per item.-Would have also liked a 'market scanner/update' subsystem option, to keep all prices up to date without revisiting planets.-Also needs an option to immediately end conversations with the roaming merchants. Was like 3 extra dialogue options to exit after I'd traded.			"

												It's good. Really, it is. It's not, however, amazing. The short: The storyline is... cursory, at best. The game would lose virtually nothing if it weren't there at all. There are some annoyances in missions and travelling, and you need to be comfortable with the need to grind for gear, but all in all it's a very enjoyable space shooter.The long:As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, there's an almost consistent misrepresentation of the mission risk. Low? It could be, then again you could also barely make it out with an inch of hull left. Other times you end up against a ship you literally do not have the damage output to even touch the shields on. High? It could be. It could also be a milk run. It just doesn't make any sense.You do learn to recognize them, though. Some mission types seem straight forward, but will always end with you having to deliver something to a station that's under siege. Skip those. Escort missions are a pain, as in pretty much all games, Fancy waiting 2-3 minutes while your ship lines itself up for the escort? Fancy doing that numerous times as the journey is interrupted along the way? How about inside an asteroid field, where your ship keeps getting stuck on rocks, adding another few minutes. At first, I learned this was a perfect time to go fetch something to drink. Or check email. Or read a page or two of a book. Later, I learned to just save my sanity and skip them. Eventually I did learn a set of mission types I could reliably predict the difficulty of, and I just stuck with those and ignored everything else.There's a fair amount of travelling required, which is to be expected. Space is big, after all. What isn't fine is how often your travels are interrupted. There are countless asteroid and junk fields littered about, and odds are you'll be pulled out of warp a handful of times on most journeys. Which means you then need to crawl along to the edge before you can get back up to speed. If you pay attention you can spot some of them and go around. Not going in a straight line from one place to the next, also seems to help. Then there are the random enemy encounters, which have the same effect of slowing you down. You can spend time fighting them (if they are ship types and numbers you can handle), for loot worth next to nothing most of the time, or turn your tail and boost out of there. In most cases that'll have you on your way again in 30 seconds or so.So why the heck am I recommending it? I guess I must really like spaceships. And lasers. I had great fun, despite the above mentioned drawbacks. Enough so that I put 40 hours into it. After finishing the story, I kept going until I had the best ship fully upgraded. I then went back in a few more times to just fly around enjoying being invincible. For entertainment value, it was a bargain for the price.			"

												Its a great game if you want to fly around galaxy doing missions and upgrading your ship. Random generated content is good. For some it may become repetative after a while as its all about credits and upgrading your ship. Of course, complexity is there in selecting the right ship for your play style/number of weapons and types (it gets more complex as you get to select additional ""addon components"" or imporvements).There is an ever changing economy, and reflects well that sometimetimes offloading you cargo i.e. selling will become difficult. Opportunities galore in respect to observing economy issues such as war or economy rush system situaltions.There is also a story to follow (your long lost aunt). It a well made shoe in to get you to travel to other systems.Overall, the game is feature reach and broadside sink ship like fighting (depends on which ship you may have to which boradside capability you may have) is fun.But I must admit it gets repetative, it has to be like this in order to keep you playing. Think of it as a game you can jump in for few hours now and then, it is not on par with MMOs, its single player space adventure game.This is reflected in the cost as well, a good price for a title like this (its a good thing).I recommend it, and now that windows version has custom music option (hope OSX will get the same), you can load you favourite tune(s) in the game.:-)			"

												If you are a fan of ""Star Trek"" ish combat (a.k.a. dealing with shield facings,hull damage, and broadsides) then this is the game for you. I have spend over 35 hours and not even that far into the main game because of how fun it is. It is ""repetitive"" sure, but that's like saying Mario is repetitive because he is always jumping and running. The game IS a little ""mainstream"" and simpified, which could turn hard core PC gamers off, but if you are interested in a space combat/trading type game and have not experienced more in-depth games of that genre, than this is a perfect game to get your feet wet.10 out of 10, would buy again.

												If you could merge the playstyle, the weapons, the combat, explosions and warp of this game with eve-online you would have the perfect Sandbox MMO.  This game pretty much gave me everything eve couldn't; which is total immerision, a sick soundtrack, and made me feel like I was in real combat.  Not just sitting their with automated missles that never hit.  Didn't have to worry about drained power core just watching my shields/hull and knowing when to deflect.If this game ever has an MMO spin off I'm sold.Would play 100 + hours again. 10/10			"

												I wouldn't say this game is for everyone since the gameplay can be rather repetitive. You start off in an old tin can of a ship with weak weaponry and work your way up.Combat is the best way to make money. Dialogue in both story and NPC interactions is a little shallow. Money pretty much determines your success in this game. Soundtrack is great, and if you don't like it you can always customize it to whatever you like before you launch the game. (Used Tiberian Sun original soundtracks for mine). The battles in this game can become quite the vibrant light show with lasers, cannon fire, missiles, and explosions everywhere. Every time you start a new game, it's a new sector map of stars. NPC's and events you encounter are all procedurally generated.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would be some kind of 3X game, I could not be more wrong. This game is extremely boring, boring combat, boring npc's even the highly praised soundtrack gets boring after a few hours of playing. They tried copying the assassins creed 4 navel combat, and on paper is sounds like a great idea, but in practice it just does not hold up.   There is a lot of traveling from A to B, normally in a space game you just autopilot to a determined destination, but here you cannot. The autotravel is constantly interrupted by every damn little rock, container or nearby enemy ship, and then you have to navigate around it before you can initiate fast travel again.Quests are reparative and boring, pickup this, kill those bandits, transport that. There is virtually no spaceship customization, and getting a new space ship does not feel any different from the previous one you just had except for the look.If you are looking for a spacesim or 3X game this is not for you.

												This is one of the best space sims on the market. The arcade feel and core story make it feel more cenematic and less technical than say Elite: Dangerous. The gameplay is fun and engaging though like most games it can get repetitive. The soundtrack may be what makes this game as great as it is. If you are a fan of Firefly you'll notice similarities instantly. For me this was a positive factor that quickly immersed me into the world.

												Rogue Galaxy is a Pirates!-esque open world in which you pilot a ship, hauling goods, mining ore, and shooting foes. Featuring some snazzy graphics, a pretty robust combat system, and a cool and evolving world, you can reasonably expect to get 10 hours of extremely engaging gameplay out of the game before you get bored and attempt to race through the campaign.This doesn't have the same depth and feature richness of top end $60 retail products, and it wont last as long as your average Bethesda or Ubisoft open world (it's no Skyrim-in-space), but given that it's like $20, it's a solid buy.

												Rebel Galaxy is a space game set out to be the next “freelancer” a pretty lofty goal. They failed.Not to say the game is entirely bad. It’s got pretty 2005 graphics a great soundtrack and decent ship upgrades. But when you get down to it, It’s a shallow sort of game.


YouTube™ Video: Rebel Galaxy Video Review The video game sucks. 

			Views: 135		

			Rebel Galaxy is a space game set out to be the next “freelancer” a pretty lofty goal. They failed. Not to say the game is entirely bad. It’s got pretty graphics and a great soundtrack.		

 It feels as if they outsourced the game to India, asked for a pirate sim and got a space game with a Wild Wild West theme. The game tries so hard to fit all these roles and just falls flat. I believe it would have been a fantastic game had they made a few changes.For weapons you have variations of turrets and Navel Style broadside cannons. They wildly shoot unless you hold L2 for a focused aim. The turrets auto aim and take out smaller targets. Autonomy is a nice thing.What I will say though, is the game has a lot of depth in ship configurations despite being pretty shallow and simplistic. It’s like the best of IOS games ported to a PC. (hint: IOS/mobile games mostly suck due to microtransactions)Essentially the game plays itself. you steer the ship, everything else is done for you. Now granted you are in a bigger than average ship, but it’s also a game. I want to actually feel like I’m doing something beyond controlling the direction.			"

												Take AC: Black Flag naval combat... Make it 10x better, stick it in space and add a wicked soundtrack, you have Rebel Galaxy. The combat is action packed, the ship customization system is awesome, it is easy to pickup & play and most of all, if you like the idea of naval combat, it will keep you entertained for a while.The only major drawback is the game is short. The main story line felt short, majority of my playing time was spent on collecting credit through side missions. Another minor drawback was the amount of customization. The way you upgraded the ships was awesome (buying/selling prices were equal, you could easily upgrade or downgrade between ships) however, there are only a limited type of weaponry to choose from.None the less, besides these drawbacks, if you enjoy space & naval combat, this game will give you a good fix. Personally I've spent 60 hours playing and enjoyed it.			"

												Absolutely great fun, especially for $20. I'm a huge fan of the old space sims like Privateer and Freelancer, and this is the first game in years to really replicate the feeling they gave me. I think part of it has to do with its fun ''space truckers' aesthetic, but it helps that it's also fast-paced and arcadey, as well as beautiful.Also, the fact that things are locked to a 2D plane really isn't a problem. There's plenty of room for tactical positioning, and it makes the broadsides on your ship useful and interesting. If you simply cannot stomach the thought of a space sim without full 3D flight, then give it a pass, but c'mon - open yourself to new things!			"

												Seems like Eve, but plays like a side scroller. Its a huge sandbox, with a campaign that doesn't bug you. Brings back the good ole days of freelancer and privateer.The only con is the side scrolling effect. There is only the x and y axis, no z. No going up or down.Update: Have over 46 hours logged now.Game is addictive and fun. The Major Con is not having a Z axis, but you learn to over come it. There are some other little annoyances with some of the missions and mining, but luckly, they are fixing the major issues. Trying to think of some other cons, but the pros are fantastic. The graphics are great, the music is good, plus side, you can add your own music. The Storyline is thoughtful and enjoyable. All the side missions are fun to do as well. The hardest part is getting the money train started, but once you do, its easy going. Best Hint/Advise: To lower the mission difficulty, buy better weapons, shields, and/or buy bigger ship. I upgraded the shields, hull, and deflectors and lowered the difficulty, so its possible.			"

Im stuck to ONE plane of travel...IN SPACE!?!?!  WHO THE HELL THOUGHT SPACE IS FUN WITH JUST THE X AND Z AXIS!??!  Y U NO Y AXIS?!It does run quite nicely, the mechanics aren't all that hard to get used to, and it's kinda pretty...ish  While the game works well, I can't get beyond the 2 dimensional travel in space.  Should have been an actual oceanic warfare game.  Arcade pirate ships, that would be cool.			"

												It's good. Really, it is. It's not, however, amazing. The short: The storyline is... cursory, at best. The game would lose virtually nothing if it weren't there at all. There are some annoyances in missions and travelling, and you need to be comfortable with the need to grind for gear, but all in all it's a very enjoyable space shooter.The long:As I've seen mentioned in other reviews, there's an almost consistent misrepresentation of the mission risk. Low? It could be, then again you could also barely make it out with an inch of hull left. Other times you end up against a ship you literally do not have the damage output to even touch the shields on. High? It could be. It could also be a milk run. It just doesn't make any sense.You do learn to recognize them, though. Some mission types seem straight forward, but will always end with you having to deliver something to a station that's under siege. Skip those. Escort missions are a pain, as in pretty much all games, Fancy waiting 2-3 minutes while your ship lines itself up for the escort? Fancy doing that numerous times as the journey is interrupted along the way? How about inside an asteroid field, where your ship keeps getting stuck on rocks, adding another few minutes. At first, I learned this was a perfect time to go fetch something to drink. Or check email. Or read a page or two of a book. Later, I learned to just save my sanity and skip them. Eventually I did learn a set of mission types I could reliably predict the difficulty of, and I just stuck with those and ignored everything else.There's a fair amount of travelling required, which is to be expected. Space is big, after all. What isn't fine is how often your travels are interrupted. There are countless asteroid and junk fields littered about, and odds are you'll be pulled out of warp a handful of times on most journeys. Which means you then need to crawl along to the edge before you can get back up to speed. If you pay attention you can spot some of them and go around. Not going in a straight line from one place to the next, also seems to help. Then there are the random enemy encounters, which have the same effect of slowing you down. You can spend time fighting them (if they are ship types and numbers you can handle), for loot worth next to nothing most of the time, or turn your tail and boost out of there. In most cases that'll have you on your way again in 30 seconds or so.So why the heck am I recommending it? I guess I must really like spaceships. And lasers. I had great fun, despite the above mentioned drawbacks. Enough so that I put 40 hours into it. After finishing the story, I kept going until I had the best ship fully upgraded. I then went back in a few more times to just fly around enjoying being invincible. For entertainment value, it was a bargain for the price.			"

												This game is giving me everything I WANTED from Star Citizen.Heading into an iceteroid (ice asteroid) field at high speed, drop out, surrounded by Double Jack a-holes, with my Trigun soundtrack blazing (it lets you add your own music to  the already excellent soundtrack).  Take out a few small fry, then scream around a giant iceteroid to sneak up on the big gunship, unleash a swarm of missiles in its face, then a couple broadsides and it explodes, taking out the iceteroid with it. My wingman helps clean up the trash.It's 'only' 2D, with 3D graphics, but it works really hard to make you feel so f#@$ing epic.Remember those old Ambrosia games like Escape Velocity (and of course Star Control)? It’s like that except 3d engine and you’re right down behind the ship and that makes things a lot more badass.			"

												As I look back fondly at Freelancer and how I could spend nights hunting pirates and trading illegal goods in the edges of the galaxy, I noticed Rebel Galaxy hit steam and thought, wonder if this is going to be one of those “trying to hard” games or actually good.Well it’s actually good.Now I’m not going to call it a masterpiece, but I will say it is very entertaining in this day and age where everyone is trying to do something new and innovative. I suppose the kinda new thing is how the combat works, closest example is probably world of warships, but in space and even that comparison is not giving it justice.--Movement and Combat.--The ship that you pilot is on a horizontal axis so you can only move back, forwards and sideways, this makes it easier to pilot the ship and aim your guns to your target. Targeting is automatic in a sense that the target you are directly aiming at is your primary target.The ships you pilot have broadside ports on both sides of the ship and the number of them varies on the ship you pilot, The Broadside is your primary weapon as you can’t set it to automatically fire.Your ship also has turret spots, however your turrets can be set to automatically fire at set targets and you can choose the primary target for each individual turret. You also have access to a secondary armament slot that can be outfitted with different armaments ranging from flak fighter/rocket countermeasures to mines and missiles.--Ships and components.--As you would imagine, you can buy and outfit a wide array of different ships, each with their own unique specialities. This also means some ships are more heavily armored than others, or boast more potential firepower.Most things on the ships can be upgraded to a better variant, like more armor plating, better shields, thrusters, engines, bigger cargo hold and so on, you get the general idea.--Stations and trading.--Each solar system that you can enter and explore has stations and these stations, mostly, can be used as a hub to repair, refill and outfit your ship to your liking. However, that is not all you can do. You can visit the bar to get the latest news from the news board that gives you an idea what is going on in your solar system, this is an ever changing system, some stations might have a tech boom that bumps up the price of technological trade goods, making it more lucrative for traders to sell their goods to that particular station, this mostly means you.You can also pick up different missions from the mission board, that all range from, go and kill this dood, defend this dood from being killed by this dood, pick up this thing that this dood lost and so on, you get the general idea.As you would imagine, one of the easiest ways to earn money is to work the market. Buy a bulk of trade goods for cheap from a back end station and take it to a prime trade port to get the most out of your goods, rinse and repeat.I remember making convoluted trade routes in Freelancer to earn millions in a few hours simply by working the market, flying from system to system, buy goods that are cheap in that system, fly to the nearest highest bidder and sell the goods and repeat the same thing. I can imagine this tactic would work here and even slightly better because of the ability to steer your ship during warp.Like I mentioned earlier, stations are not solely for trading however. Some stations are designated as guild bases, like for example the first system you start in houses a merchants guild that offers unique ships and components unique to that faction.--Interaction.--What I mean with interaction is just the general interaction with other pilots that you come across while flying around in space. Your choices matter, not much, but they matter. The same goes for your story missions, like for example, one mission in the beginning you have the chance to bribe a pirate to make themselves disappear or just kill him like you’re asked to. These sorta decisions keep popping up all along your adventures and even in random encounters while exploring, like for example, you just saved a trader from pirates and scanned his cargo hold to find some very expensive materials, do you kill the guy or let him go?--Verdict.--I would imagine that Rebel Galaxy is very good for what it is trying to do, it’s deep enough to keep people of different moralities happy. Sure it’s not the most beautiful looking game out there, but it’s not a game you want to put a paper bag over either. Combat is nice and simple and offers variety of what weapons you can and want to use, same goes for ships and other components. For people looking for a slightly more casual space sim, Rebel Galaxy is your game.And let’s not forget the bloody music, oh my gawd the music. So Firefly, So Firefly.

												Competent mix of Freelancer, Elite & co for the setting, AC:Black Flag for the broadside naval combat (in space!), and Sid Meier's Pirates for the scummy yet light hearted mood of the world and storyline.Very easy to get into, no complex controls or pages over pages of keybinds - just a controller works awesomely.Those of you who love the complexity in 6DOF games like Wing Commander or, more recently, Elite Dangerous, might find the restriction to plane space (2DOF) frustrating though - I did too at first, but its a different kind of game, suited for a different set of mechanics.Love it.

												So far it's decent, nothing too bad.... yet.Pros:+You can be a space pirate! If you can find anyone to rob.+ The quests are decent, it definitely fills your time up with something to do.+ Space battles are fun and engaging+ You can customize your own Background Musc(BGM), for example; blasting kawaii anime music for the fighting bgm.+ The trade market is very nicely designed and you feel like collecting stuff to sell.+Player HUD is simple and easy to use.Cons:- You don't get to customize the color of your ship.- There aren't a lot of upgrades to your ship's guns. So far there's only 1 upgrade for each type of gun. There are around 13 different types of guns(I think)- Upgrades to your ship have and show no visual difference, so if I upgrade my Ship's hull, there's no visual difference between the old hull and the new one. It's not even shinier.- The original game Background Music(BGM) is REALLY BORING as well as repetitive. "

												Rebel Galaxy = Elite lite!Essentially this game boils down to a series of ""Go to X blow up Y"" missions to earn money to buy better gear and ships to blow up bigger and harder stuff. It's a little bit grindy. BUT! As a time deprived father of two, this is a fantastic game which allows me to dip in and out with minimal effort or long term commitment. The perfect accompaniment for a podcast or two.That makes it sound as if there's nothing of value in Rebel Galaxy - and that's not true. It's got a level of graphical and audio polish that you don't see on many bigger budget titles. Blowing things up is fun, even 32 hours in. The next big upgrade or ship is never too far away, so the urge to keep earning money remains strong.Rebel Galaxy is ace, as long as you adjust your expectations going in. Think of a space opera directed by Michael Bay rather than Ridley Scott.			"

												I don't enjoy every space game.  EVE Online while amazing was just too much of a headache for me to enjoy.  My personal favorite back before most folks reading this were born was Sundog.  You had it all, mystery, space, little rpg, ship repair, space and planet exploration.  While Rebel Galaxy doesn't have some of those things it has the right feel.   It is fun and challanging.   Highly reccommend!			"

												Pretty much the game i've been waiting for since freelancer. The thing that irks me, and my only complaint about the game is that you can't fly in all directions (up and down motion is locked) other than that this is the most fun i've had in awhile. Definite recommendation. Not much more to say, I'm off to rob some merchants.			"

												Guys cannot recommend this game enough! Pro's: Very good gameplay action        : Awesome sound track, very chilled and moody.        : Easy to learn and pick up.        : Great graphics and effects        : Open world with plenty of side content.Cons: Can be kinda grindy at times to get the cash for upgrades.        : Travel time can feel slow at the beginning ( Recommend upgrading warp drives and gettting gate travel early )        : Story is kinda mediocore, but the game play makes up for this.

												Only played for a couple hours so far, but I'm digging it.  Reminds me a little bit of Freelancer, but it realy seems like it's more fun and there's more to do, even though there is no Z axis to movement.  The combat is more strategic than most, with turrets and broadsides needing to be put into play--more like battleships than traditional space battles, but that is not a bad thing.  Doesn't hurt that the music and graphics are both fantastic, either.			"

												Holy Amazing!Ok so reading all of these reviews may build up a bit of hype and while the game is great, its not necessarily the greatest game ever. It is one of the best game values for your money, some sort of a story line (searching for your aunt?)  is at least present but, most importantly, it really is best described as AC Black flag with space ships.Customization is great as far as equipment and such.  I do wish there was the option to paint your ship assuming I'm not an idiot and didn't miss that.The soundtrack is great with that meaning its along the lines of rock/classic rock which makes keeps your energy up.  My experience comparison is to that of Sins of a Solar Empire... the music alone could make me stop playing the game.  To me its more like, I'm a badass! With a space ship!  Come get some! and lets rock out to that!not, oh hey... could you pass me that mozart cd so I can sit blowing up stuff with some somber tones running in my head...zzzzAnyway, this is as close as it gets to feeling like you're really out in your battlestar galactica or star wars destroyer taking on the skum of the universe.  There is some travelling but the space is populated and plenty of things to run into or die from on your own.  I have a knack for running into red threat levels and practicing reloading the game.The earn money and upgrade your ship works really well, you do need to do some main missions or use your map to find missions.  Flying in a particular direction works too however, you may find you run into near or sudden death encounters with ships you clearly underestimated.  Another way to describe this game is, its like FTL but you dont see through your ship and in order to jump, you best run like hell to reach a safe warp (jump) point!To summerize:Pros:Easy to play and get to the action (and die lol)Thank god its in 2D because handling a 3rd direction would probably make me sick and be overwhelmed (may be a con for some)Very good graphics to the point where it looks great and is playable on lower end systems.It still plays beautifully and perfectly smooth at 4k with a 980 Ti.  Simple but robust upgrade options.  Targeting is pretty easy, the AI can manage some of your guns as well.The universe is alive, even if you did nothing but fly around you run into stuff and/or cool planets with bases.Theres a story at the very least.Awesome sounds and an upbeat sound track.  Your ship makes most of those cool sounds you want to hear when you change directions or power up your warp drives.Great Value/Price makes this hard to beat!Cons:Limited view options (may not be a con but locking the view closer or further would be nice).Just to add in case a developer reads this, if there was a cockpit view I may have to change my pants every time I play.  That would be amazing and with using the broadsides, having the camera switch to whichever side you're moving your view stick to would be an idea.Unable to paint or color your ship.There are a lot of ship choices but I wish there was a variety of each class (not a big deal).While there is a story its not the most elaborate story or intriguing.  Something more along the lines of a mysterious cosmic disturbance was felt among the universe and a new alien race or super weapon is rumored to be the cause.  Among the warring factions and those at peace, spontaneous attacks from a new enemy emerge and along with your journey between the factions in space, do you suddenly run into unexpected encounters from this new weapon or race.  . . . . just my thoughts, some pulled form mass effect which was great up until they ruined it.  There is just more there to be desired but I'm happy to at least have a story.No multiplayer...not a big deal but would be fun to do missions or visit solar systems with a buddy.  Doubling the enemies per additional player would seem sufficient.Final Thoughts:  If the developers are still paying attention (hoping their sales numbers are great or better than expected), this is a great game and starting point that so many others try to achieve and simply fail at.There is a lot of potential here and simply adding more star systems with harder difficulty and additional story would hopefully not be too much trouble if DLC becomes a future ambition.  I was bored or at least overwhelmed with EVE and it really wasn't enjoyable having to basically learn how complex the game was...especially when you only have a few hours to play periodically.  This game strikes a great balance and at the limit of 2D movement however, I think it was a perfect choice because you can focus on battles! and Blowing stuff up!I am very pleased with this purchase and with so much room to add on or improve (even when it is already done so well already) I think it is something worth expanding on.None the less, you will have a blast if you go into this game expecting a space game with simple controls a little travelling here and there (typically no more than 1 minute in the first map), and small battles that grow to epic as the game progresses.Considering fast indoor go karting costs 20 bucks for 10 minutes.... this gives you a whole lot more with some speakers and a subwoofer .... you will be the next Han Solo in your SS Pea Shooter as I named my ship.Enjoy!

												Well first impression is this.  Its in space, sweet, but you cannot manuver on all 3 axis.  only left and right. very planer view.  but its recommended use of gamepad, may mean I'm missing something, but I don't see any options for pitch or roll. Ok so be it.  its not a true space sim in that sence.  It still seems kinda fun.  the first space battle due to story line was very reminecent of Pirates!,  alot of circling and broadside attacks.  the auto turrets take care of those pesky fighters or you can take over and blast those little buggers yourself. kinda fun and the percision mode adds some targeting skill.  the only thing I do not like is the lack of ZOOM.  you cannot zoom out.  so your ship takes up most of the screen. (I was constanly scrolling my wheel trying to get a better view)  so manuvering around objects around becomes a little panicked when proximity sensors pick up something and you have to attempt to steer around and fight at the same time.  due to fact you can only view what direction your pointing the camera this can be a little challanging. but the camera swivels like a top and is very responsive.   kinda curious to see if the scale changes when I can afford the larger ships.  or am I going to have a screen full of my ship. Now this is only my first time playing for approx 30-40 min.  overall graphics,ambiance,and backgrounds look pretty good it looked great on my 40"" 4k monitor at full res and high settngs.  I am definently going back in to play.			"

												This is easily the most addicting game I have played in a long time.  Wide variety of ships and equipment, both offensive and defensive, each with it's own pros and cons, and great music library.  Speaking of which, if you want to listen to your own tunes... you can.  When you launch the game, you can have the game look in certain folders fo combat, ambient, in-station and menu music, with another option to mix your selections in with the default music library.  This is the first game I've seen that allows you to do this.Anyway, that's enough typing, gotta get back in the game :)			"

												This game was sold to me as Firefly/Serenity the game but a more accurate description would be Sid Meier's Pirates in Space complete with trading, factions and pirate lords. The soundtrack as well as the eccentric characters you come across made me realise why people were calling it Firefly the Game but that's about it. Only a few hours in and it seems to hold up quite well although, I would like some more customisation options for my ship instead of just the weaponry. Overall a great indie space title and definitely worth the purchase.			"

This game is very easy to jump straight into, is gorgeous visually and has a lot of interesting things to do. I hope they take this formula to success and expand on it with expansions, sequels and hopefully we'll see more games taking the same or similar approach in the future.			"

												8.5/10 - Great game to have specially with any discount.A fun game, little bugs still (mostly pair warp issues), but mostly a reliable game.It is impossible not to compare to one of my favorite games all time ""Freelancer"", but i will try to keep it as independent as possible.The battle system I think was supposed to be simpler than Freelancer one but in my opinion failed in the fun aspect, i have 20h played so far and only had battles in full turret mode.The ""2D"" maps make the universe simpler but in my opinion it is a little weird to think that 100 planets in 10 systems are all in the same surface.Big sized map that could easily increase by adding more jumpgates.Many guns and ships options too.Some must have improvements for further patches:1. Auto-move implemented (and please make the pair warp faster, 2 min for a ship to stand aside another is unbearable).2. A ""rear gear"", sometimes would be very useful and i don't think it would cause any trouble.3. A better ""Esc"" menu, one that is easier to check any aspect without having to go trough every other item.			"

I purchased this game for just under 20 US. I would do so again. I hate paying for games, but some are worth it. The only knock I have against this game is that their isn't much of a modding community yet or tools available from the developers.

It also has very relaxing gameplay that deliverers fun at the same time, no boring routines. The controls are easy to master.

												This game is amazing.I've been waiting for a game like this for a while now. I thought Elite:Dangerous was the best that I could get, but I was wrong. It's a shame that there aren't more quality entries in this genre.First things first, make no mistakes: this is a game about you being the captain of an old wooden tallship as a merchant/privateer/pirate/whatever you want to be. Except with all of the boring parts of that cut out; your tallship is a spaceship because if this wasn't a space game you'd be sailing along at 7-8 knots (which would be SO boring) so instead you get to warp everywhere because space.Some people are complaining about this being limited to left/right forward/backward movement; these people do not realize that this is a game about boats. Space boats. So grab some alcohol and your xbox controller and go be a galactic naval badass.Highly recommended - one of the best games I've played in a while. Strikes the perfect balance in space-boat simulation.(Fun fact: do you know why ships in sci-fi always meet face-to-face? Because if one if pointing straight-up and tilted 37 degrees it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. I didn't realize it until now, but 2 dimensions is all you really need in a space game. And honestly, the enemies and such go up and down above/below you so it's not like the game is on a grid or anything. It is done really well.)			"

												Lovely little game, I thoroughly recommend it if you're looking for a simplified space game with minimal sim elements. The story is about as believable as Freelancer (by that I mean ludicrously cheesy but in a good way), it has an excellent soundtrack and is something you can mostly relax while playing. Well, until you go to a distress call and get jumped by 4 frigates, a command ship and more fighters than you can count! Ouch?I'd suggest taking a more patient approach rather than rushing through the story, the difficulty ramps up a lot between the first two systems so you'll probably want about a million credits to upgrade systems to be on a par with the NPC factions. Some of the best weapons also appear to be looted rather than bought (Viridian Beam? Oh aye! 3.8 k range and rips through shields like nobody's business!)Physics is out of the window, they never heard of Newton as you can stop dead then turn on the spot before almost immediately being up to max speed again. The weapon types seem a little limited but they do the job and fill the required niches, they just get upgraded to a new mark as far as I've seen but I'm currently playing the legit route, different factions appear to have some slightly diferent hardware available which you might be able to loot.Overall it's just good fun with a space/wild west theme that doesn't take itself too seriously.

I very much hope for additional content.Some things I would love to see:- The ability to ""zoom out"" from the ship - in various situations (like mining etc.) where it would be helpful.- The ability to customize the visual appearance of ships - or see purchased turrets affect the ship's look.- The ability to purchase (from the merchant guild - or whoever) - price tracking software for my ship- The ability to make lateral movements with my ship (if I'm too close to a mining node - for example)Anyways - thanks for making a solid game.

												After two hours, first impressions are everything and this is very polished for an Indie... In my opinion this is the closest, so far, to Privateer. Bearing in mind I have just started to play it, not very far through but so far it's blowing my mind. What set's it apart from the X games , and what i missed most about privateer, is the whole landing on the station/planet interacting with the bar/shipdealer etc. Combat is pretty fun , the sound track is brilliant, it fits the game so well. I would say if you like Privateer, get this, if you liked the X games with the intense trading and diplomacy etc, might be a little too simplified for you. All in all, for the price this is a bargain. Hope these guys do a squel or similar and spend a bit more cash because this has so much potential. The only thing that may be a downside, is that space is not a 2D landscape, except in this game. Minor gripe , and I can see why the did it with respect to the combat style of the game. Love the whole broadside thing, like oldschool naval ships giving it to each other. Graphics are good without blowing your mind (on ultra), sound is pretty good. Did I mention it was the closest to Privateer that i had played in a long time.... Loved that damn game....			"

												I'd say this one delivers the bang for the buck. The random maps and some other things make me think there is probably some good replayability, but I'm thinking even if I just finish a single play through I'll get more than my money's worth.Great production values for a $20 game. The voice work really adds a lot to the game to make it feel alive. There's more depth in just about everything than I expected. Except the actual flight... it is 2d. But that's just fine by me and it may even work to the game's advantage. The broadside naval-style combat works and seems pretty good.I haven't noticed any technical issues in the two hours I spent with it so far. Seems like it might be bigger/longer than I expected. I'm not out of the first system after two hours and I think there were around 10 systems when I looked at the map. I haven't kept the pedal to the metal for progressing the story but I haven't screwed around a ton either. I also see very expensive things to buy I won't be able to afford for quite a bit longer without major windfallsTravel can seem a bit slow, but I have yet to play any space game where more time than I liked wasn't spent just getting where I want to go and it isn't very bad here.The bit of the story I've seen so far is decent. 8/10 - Only because I haven't played enough to *know* it doesn't have any major shortcomings.

												Best space\space ship simulation game to come out in a long time! Reminds me of Freelancer with the look and feel and the combat is fresh and AWESOME!! Still learning the game but the developers REALLY put a lot of thought and heart into this game. First purchase I have been excited about in years!!The combat is VERY different than any other space game I have played. Different from ANY other game where you control a craft that fires projectiles except maybe an age of sail game! It is broadsided firing mixed with controlable turrets mixed with system components, like the deflector which absorbs incoming damage on activation, and a bunch of other features. You have to actually ENGAGE in combat, even more so than a typical arcade shooter system!! Its intense and the feeling of popping another ship, even a fighter, is satisfying!!The other features of the game are astounding so far. HUGE systems to explore, random encounters, the feeling of actually EXPLORING space! I cannot wait to get home tomorrow so I can get back into this gem!!Thank you Double Damage, for making a game that takes traits of previous great games, improving upon them and adding a TON of more great stuff to it!! I would have paid $60 for this game and $20 is a STEAL!!			"

												Overall good, but the lack of a Z-axis flight or targeting is still irksome after 10 hours, exascerbated by the fact that certain objects such as asteroids and NPC fighter craft do have Z-axis flight. The 2-dimension aspect does end up detracting from an otherwise good experience with outstanding visuals, very good audio and soundtrack. The lack of true depth results in an open world experience with an arcade like feel, but is still sufficient to warrant one or two playthroughs. The soundtrack is superb enough to warrant its own download. Ultimately, I am hopeful this title is simply a prelude or proof of concept for an eventual 3-dimension space adventure sim.			"

												 I feel like I'm HAN SOLO riding a COWBOY BEBOP spaceship in a FIREFLY episode with a soundtrack that'd make STAR LORD jelous YAAAAAAAYYYYY  Now, If that's not enough for you, let's talk about the 2D navigation (short story: to me it is a pro, not a con): When I first read you only navigate left and right, instead of 360 degrees I also thought ""Hey what's the bloody point of being in space, then!?!?"" but it really works for the gameplay because 1-the design was made in such way that it doesn't feel like you're being limited or constrained AND 2- it allows you to focus on weaponss, enemies positions and other stuff during the battles. For instance: some smaller enemy ships do fly in 3d and you also aim your turrent in 3D as you keep navigating in 2D towards the capital ship. As in a sailing ship battle (yeah... it's pretty much like a pirate ship battle, but also having to shoot at the gulls flying around you. Dunno, it just worked man! Thumbs up!!!			"

												Very good game, just as what I want for several years, X rebirth was failed, EVE was complicated.what I want is just simple as Freelancer, this game, Rebel Galaxy is hit the core: simple and fun!the 2D boardcannon fight is ingenious idea, avoid many boring and complicated design but keep the battle heat, and you don't worry to learn many things to start a good space fight.here is some idea to untapped potential of this game:1) I want Carrier! Since there're so many type of fighter/bomer/gunship those small crafts in game, and game has a clear tactical UI for these small crafts, there must have place for carriers, or frankly, hangar for all the capital ships.2) more exploration than routine quest line. There're so many minefield/nebula/junkyields, but only will the distress signal or quest will lead me to there, I don't have other lead to push me explore those place, what a waste!3) more skills/bonus/perksthe game has 3 types of weaponry: projectile/missile/laser, and 3 types of defense: shield/armor/deflector, but all the benefit provided by components are not specialized, how about some equiment only boost specialized laser like mine laser, to shorter their range but boost their damage even more? I think this can make huge diversify between ship builds.I'd love to see this game push the envelope in future DLC or patches.			"

												CLICK BUY RIGHT NOW!  Rebel Galaxy is a VERY good game.  Fun to play, surprising in its depth, and overall a great value for the money.Gameplay is pretty simple, the story is there and some of the fights can be very tough.The only negatrive thing I've seen so far relates to the mercenary guild.  The mercenary guild (which has a station in each system after the first) gives out random kill/protect contracts - just as the merchant guild does.  After playing through several of these to rank up my standing with the mercs so I could buy a new ship, I noticed that I get a lot of missions that pit me up against system militia and other 'good guy' factions, with no warning in the briefing whatsoever.  On one mission in particular in the second system, the enemies generated for my mission were also mercenary's guild - which resulted in a huge net loss for faction for completing an assignment from that guild.  This makes ranking up the mercenary faction very difficult and frustrating - after tweeting the devs on this, I heard back that it's working as intended, and the only option to get around this is to abandon the mission, fly all the way back to the source, and get another one - which may or may not present the same problems.So I would wholeheartedly recommend Rebel Galaxy - but with the caveat that if you do pick it up, save yourself the frustration of trying to rank up with the mercs and just go with regular civilian or merchant class ships instead.

												Well... what can I say. This game if you belive it, was created by 2 individuals. Saying that apparently they came from the torchlight team. Well that said, this is a must buy game for 3 reasons;1) If you like open ended space games. (bare in mind you can trade to the end, or fight)2) Very well thought out game, the mechanics are for about 90% right on cue (see note 1)3) This is one of the very few games I havent turnd off the music after 1 hour. Its that good, and that needed. (The only other game that i played that didnt make me stop the music was Home World). 3.1) Seriously look up Homeworld sound track its just awe-inspiring.Okay so lets get down to brass tax:Positives:- Open ended, you can make the game last as long as it takes for you to do what you want. (Mine was 40 ish hours. Not bad for the price)- Graphics considering the team, and price are really well done. Give the developers a beer.- Music, as said previously, Its the exception to the rule, it adds to the game.Neutral:- Reminds me of the T.V. series firefly.- Reminds me of the games of tourchlight, boarderlands (If in space, and wish they went with cell shading on some parts).Negitives:- Some A.I. issues, both with mercs, and escort. The worst has to be the escort missions though. (Had a few warp pairs that ended in us basically warping to a sun. Took so long waiting on the escort I gave up, even with the credit reward of 2.5mill.)- If you do not like navel tactical style games this is not for you.Afterthought:- Cant belive that I am going to say this, but this is one of the first games, I really hope they have downloadable content (DLC). This being said, not simple skin changes, but actual content.Note1: Basically A.I. Look Up A.I. both outside and in this review, gives a good context.			"

												Assassin's Creed Black Flag naval combat in space while being like Freelancer and Elite Dangerous.  So if you've played those games, then you'll most likely have fun with this game too.Gameplay is fun despite being in a plane of space, much like Freelancer.Graphics are pretty.  Lots of fun making other ships into space dust.Storyline I haven't really played much into it to give an opinion. But the voice-overs are pretty cool even with the aliens.Controls gets a little getting used to, but is rather simple compared to other space games.One of the first lessons anyone can learn is how to run.  Especially when you see a mass of enemy ships that take down your shields in no seconds flat...  Then kite them and eventually win.  Then get blown up by a fleet of fighters/bombers/gunships.  :D			"

												8.5/10 - Great game to have specially with any discount.A fun game, little bugs still (mostly pair warp issues), but mostly a reliable game.It is impossible not to compare to one of my favorite games all time ""Freelancer"", but i will try to keep it as independent as possible.The battle system I think was supposed to be simpler than Freelancer one but in my opinion failed in the fun aspect, i have 20h played so far and only had battles in full turret mode.The ""2D"" maps make the universe simpler but in my opinion it is a little weird to think that 100 planets in 10 systems are all in the same surface.Big sized map that could easily increase by adding more jumpgates.Many guns and ships options too.Some must have improvements for further patches:1. Auto-move implemented (and please make the pair warp faster, 2 min for a ship to stand aside another is unbearable).2. A ""rear gear"", sometimes would be very useful and i don't think it would cause any trouble.3. A better ""Esc"" menu, one that is easier to check any aspect without having to go trough every other item.			"

												This game is a little odd to place for me, its sort of like an arcade version of eve online... something like a sci fi biker story set on a space frontier. It took me a little while to get used to how the game wanted me to do things but once I did I really started to enjoy it. I think I sort of cheated myself out of the full experience though. I found a story mission early on that I was getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked on several times.. i would go in and fight a bunch of stuff nearly die so I would run away... didn't realize that each time I did I was just building up a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of cargo floating around the combat area near the mission. When I finally did beat it I looked at my map and it was literally covered with loot from my previous attempts.. some of it quite valuable. I went from having sub 100k credits to having several million.Naturally I picked it all up and sold it and went and bought the biggest, baddest ship I could and mounted it with the best guns and equipment I could. I then ended up just coasting through the remainder of the game completely decimating it. The missions just keep giving higher and higher rewards and I was so far ahead of the natural equipment curve that no matter what I came across I was 1-3 shotting even the super dreadnaughts and destroyers I was coming across. I decided to just keep plowing forward fully expecting to get to a point where my gear would finally just be barely enough.. but then the final mission of the game happened and it was a cake walk.Naturally there is still a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of game left and according to the map there are SEVERAL places I could still go that are marked as very high risk and such. But still.. i completed the ""main story"" in just under 4 hours because of what I guess is a flaw in the loot mechanics in the game letting my 5 or 6 failed attempts at a big fight just stack up loot that was somehow on the higher end of value on the trade market in the region giving me massive profits.Due to the procedural nature of the game I suppose the market prices are a part of that as well and I just got lucky. I am not sure how much more time I will spend with this game but I feel I probably could of easily of gotten 15 or 20 hours out of the main story had that not of happened to me. I might still go back and try to finish up the achievement list but I am not sure.. lots of other stuff coming out soon.Another thing this game does very well is its soundtrack.. something about biker road music set in space is quite appealing and it matches up perfectly with the combat they have going on here. Anyways its a cheap game with fun fight mechanics and some pretty damn deep ship customization when it comes to gear and weapons. Easily worth the money they are asking for it and a nice little diversion for a few days while we are waiting some of the bigger titles to come out in the upcoming weeks... I am looking at you fallout 4.... "

The only knock I have against this game is that their isn't much of a modding community yet or tools available from the developers.

												This game is amazing.I've been waiting for a game like this for a while now. I thought Elite:Dangerous was the best that I could get, but I was wrong. It's a shame that there aren't more quality entries in this genre.First things first, make no mistakes: this is a game about you being the captain of an old wooden tallship as a merchant/privateer/pirate/whatever you want to be. Except with all of the boring parts of that cut out; your tallship is a spaceship because if this wasn't a space game you'd be sailing along at 7-8 knots (which would be SO boring) so instead you get to warp everywhere because space.Some people are complaining about this being limited to left/right forward/backward movement; these people do not realize that this is a game about boats. Space boats. So grab some alcohol and your xbox controller and go be a galactic naval badass.Highly recommended - one of the best games I've played in a while. Strikes the perfect balance in space-boat simulation.(Fun fact: do you know why ships in sci-fi always meet face-to-face? Because if one if pointing straight-up and tilted 37 degrees it looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. I didn't realize it until now, but 2 dimensions is all you really need in a space game. And honestly, the enemies and such go up and down above/below you so it's not like the game is on a grid or anything. It is done really well.)			"

												Hello SteamersAfter giving the storyline a fast once through i decided to give my review of Rebel Galaxy.  First off great work to the creators of this little fantastic space game.  Finally these guys had the balls enough to put Rock Music in a Space Game and it really ramps up the excitement , I got all the dust cleaned out of my Bose speakers on this game and nothing but a big smile on my face when the explosions started from my missles  firing out the sides of my ship.  Sure there are some things that an older player might sqeem at as far as the cartoonie characters you meet but it's not a far trade off from Jaba.  The ships are superb in design and id have to say they look better than a few of the top rated space sim games on the market.  They give you plenty of mounting options for Lasers,Rockets,Missles,Mines and Mining Lasers that can be used for fighting aswell. There is a Storyline to the game and it's good...... I'm glad there is a storyline here some of the bigger space sims decided to leave out storylines and there games feel like there is somthing always missing even in the missions they have.  Rebel Galaxy seems to understand this and always has some npc in the game coming on screen to talk to you about your next mission or a character trying to make a deal with you.  You are not alone in rebel space there is always someone around to greet you rather if it's good or bad.  This i'm sure is a trail space game by Double Damage to see how it does and all i can say is please give us more we like it.  Well i do any way, this is a great space game to play for a few months and you can't beat the price.  score 86/100			"

It plays more of an arcade game rather than a space sim so for those looking for the latter might want to look somewhere else. What this game has is a procedurally-generated, sandbox solar systems set on a 2D plane where the player can explore right from the start.For starters, the player's ship can't roll, pitch, or yaw (sorry, no Crazy Ivan manuevers here) - only forward movement, and left/right turns. This is because the game’s combat is designed around the broadside naval engagements similar to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Basically, you line up your ship (think of it as a space boat) against the enemy ship for a firing solution, and then unload your armaments to see some fireworks. It might sound easy but it has its share of tactical positioning and maneuvering - each side of your ship (front, rear, port, and starboard) has a hull and shield rating. After you eat through a ship’s shield face, you start hitting its hull to do some serious damage. You can spin that damaged side out of the line of fire to regenerate your shields and retaliate or simply retreat and fight another day.The game has a decent selection of weaponry, ships, and ship upgrades. You can also choose to align with different factions but sadly, they have no personalities to speak of outside of the nicely animated talking avatars they have.There is a main quest you can follow, or ignore it and set out in any direction you want and be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, or space pirate. You can get missions from space stations that can earn you currency to buy ships/weapons/ship upgrades, as well as alignment points to factions. The said missions can get pretty repetitive after a while, but the gloriously huge space battles keep me coming back for more. Exploration in this game is fun and is rarely dull. It has the same relaxing feel as doing cross country delivery jobs in Euro Truck Simulator 2. There are asteroid fields, floating space junk from the ruins of some old battle (which may contain some sweet loot and military grade weaponry), nebulae of different swirling colors, planets, moons, and of course, stars. It will take a few minutes to fly from point A to point B, but there’s usually some unidentified signal, a distress call, or just a random fleet of space bandits to keep things interesting. The game’s soundtrack is really good. It exudes the same vibe as Firefly with its guitar heavy tracks with twangs. The devs also included the most phenomenal custom music support I have ever seen in a game. There’s nothing like Want It All Back from Cowboy Bebop kicking in as I enter combat. I have Cage the Elephant, Clutch, Johnny Cash, Darren Korb (Bastion OST), Queens of the Stone Age, Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop), Vitaminless (Cowboy Bebop), and Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica) on my custom playlist. You can sort and assign them as combat, idle, or title music. Your custom music can also be merged with the game soundtrack for more variety.I definitely recommend this game.			"

												If you loved Freelancer and have been waiting for a similar game to come out, I suggest checking this one out. The combat is great and might take some getting used to if you are used to 3D space games. The ship design is some of the best I've seen in science fiction. The galaxy is constantly evolving, making it feel like a real place and not just some static level. You also get to live out your space ship capatin fantasy, whether that involves piracy, smuggling, trading, mining, rescue, is all up to you. I can't really think of any negatives. Rebel Galaxy is a must play for any space or sci-fi enthusiast.			"

												Buy it if you like space combat simulators without the 3d flight aspect. Buy it if you like hours of game play for the 21$ price tag. Story and non linear; mesh well giving you freedom to choose what you do when you do it. Combat is fun and rewarding. There are a few draw backs but they are not even worth mentioning since they dont reduce the games playability in anyway. Good game wouldnt give it a 10/10 but 9/10 is still good enough.			"

												Well, after 6 hours, I can safely say it was a great buy. Tons of fun, I didn't see time go through, it's sandboxy but not too repetitive (even though missions ARE repetitive ^^), the campaign is good, the ships are awesome, you have various tactics you can use to outfit your ship, ... A pretty good find!			"

												Amazing game. Little short as I beat the main game in about 8 hours but TONS of replayability since I basically only did story missions  back to back. Could have used a little more plot with the merchants and mercenaries guilds but hopefully they come out with some DLC. Ship equipment seemed a little scimpy compared to the 21 playable ships. Basically my only complaint is I want more.			"

												This game, is something special to me... Perhaps it's nostalgia since this what this game is at heart, is a gritty darker-themed, third person evolution of the Escape Velocity game series. So far, disregarding minor technical issues that are getting fixed all the time, this game for this price is TOO good to pass up. Worth every penny!			"

												8.5/10 - Great game to have specially with any discount.A fun game, little bugs still (mostly pair warp issues), but mostly a reliable game.It is impossible not to compare to one of my favorite games all time ""Freelancer"", but i will try to keep it as independent as possible.The battle system I think was supposed to be simpler than Freelancer one but in my opinion failed in the fun aspect, i have 20h played so far and only had battles in full turret mode.The ""2D"" maps make the universe simpler but in my opinion it is a little weird to think that 100 planets in 10 systems are all in the same surface.Big sized map that could easily increase by adding more jumpgates.Many guns and ships options too.Some must have improvements for further patches:1. Auto-move implemented (and please make the pair warp faster, 2 min for a ship to stand aside another is unbearable).2. A ""rear gear"", sometimes would be very useful and i don't think it would cause any trouble.3. A better ""Esc"" menu, one that is easier to check any aspect without having to go trough every other item.			"

												Not X5, Not freelancer, much better then most space games. Think Firefly, with bigger ships, minus the ground stuff. Its pretty neat. Its a testament to how a sound track can make a game.I have not finished the game but I am getting there and I love it so far here are my thoughts, maybe updated when I finishPros: Lots of ships- It seems like the two main factions have 8 and then there are a few more. Lots of parts for those ships- All sorts of interesting mods to your standard ship stuff, Cool things like deflectors that make enemies take damage when you ram them!Decent Combant(read in cons)- Cool combat system, it changes up the standard sit and shoot captial ship fightsGreat Sound Track- speaks for itselfOk StorylineCons:2D movement, yea its not a deal breaker but its sucks when  you need to get around as asteroid. I get that it is alot more work to do but it would of helped a lot about the game.Horrible voice overs for some characters, some are great but most are ehh, maybe you should not of gotten your friend. In particular a few of the mercs you can hireCombat can be finicky, things like bad feed back, infinate missles from opposing ships when you can only carry 20 or so and the like is annoying.Artifical scaling, when you get stronger suddenly most enemies do too. It makes it hard to progress as often your upgrades feel a little meaningless.Overall-Get it, for the price it is great. It could be better, I hope it is open to mods as there is a lot more that could be done with this game. Particularly a randomized universe expansion. It isn't X, it isn't a dogfighting game it is its own thing.			"

												A scoop of Firefly, a hanful of Pirate-sim, a dash of Star Trek (would be Wars but lacks that touch of mysticism that the Force brings to things), stir vigoriously, and expose to the void of space for a few hours, then serve with a rather pleasing sound track.Was a little surprised by this, was expecting 3D, gut-churning, space combat (something like Elite or maybe EVE) but by restricting the game to a 2D plane you get the feeling more of a pirate simulator (AC: Black Flag is the closest thing that springs to mind) especially with the broadside cannons. All in all, well worth the price of admission.			"

												Love it, amazing sound track with the game and a easy option to add more music? Yup, Fantastics.Very interesting style as on-rails? 2.5D space exploration game.  Takes one complexity out of space combat and lets you focus on ship style combat.Opening up the map, and seeing all these different sectors I can travel too, having played for about 3-4 hours now and feeling like I've barely made a scratch so far in surface of the game.  Feels good.Negatives; Lot of repeating enemies or people.  But what there is of that is high quality and decently voice acted so its excusable given it being a smaller title.Hope for more content in the future too, and maybe modding?			"

												Like Space? Like Assassin's Creed style Naval Combat? Like Grungy Country Music? Then this game is a pretty good bet.The levels are procedurally generated and the visuals are fantastic, but this isn't Elite Dangerous. While set in space, the combat functions on a 2D plane, similar to naval combat. It works similar to Black Flag, with broadsides being your main form of defenceWhile set in space and with similar mechanics, this is not a space sim like Elite. Elite is a massive, slow grind, and while R.G. offers tonnes of replayability and endgame content (that I haven't gotten to yet) the game is nowhere near as big or complex as Elite. I do think the combat is more fun, but that's probably just because I'm better at it than Elite.It's definitely not going to live up to Elite, Star Citizen or even No Man's Sky in terms of scope, but it's a pleasant and worthwile investment with a fun gimmick.

												Great music! Good concept. Good graphics. Crucially flawed gameplay. The key problem is the mouse interface. Whenever you touch the mouse (I tried several), to do things like aim in a firefight, it automatically zooms in to a top down view of the ship, so you can get a closeup of your ship taking damage and do nothing useful to change things. To get the view up, you must scoot the mouse about four feet with max sensitivity to see who is attacking you and keep scooting the mouse to aim or get a glimpse of the object you're about to run into. It's basically a FPS where it defaults to looking down at your feet and you have to scoot like mad to glance at the enemies.  I can't believe they actually released a game where the mechanics of gameplay fundamentally don't work.Addendum: I'm on a Mac. The fix to the mouse control largely fixed the issue. Broadside aiming is still quite difficult because the camera still pans down automatically, although it is much, much easier to compensate for and the ship still often obscures the view of the target. I find I'm still guessing where the enemy is and firing blind, although often accurately. While clunky, it is now playable.			"

												First things first.I like this game. The pricing is fair and alright.But stop saying this is Freelancer. It is not. Star Systems and trade are a common in any space game. It has a random quest/mission system and a main story line like Freelancer and this is were they start to differ. The broad fighting system makes this a whole another experience.Another thing are the drops like shield boost you got in Freelancer. Ships in Freelancer were Dog Fighter, fast turning, front fire arc and you had to fire them manually.This game doesnt have this concept. Anyway some pros and cons:Pro:CombatGraphicMusicRandom SystemsWingman/woman/xeno/robotCon:Gameplay elements (will explain further down)2D (fully aware when buying, will explain futher down)One Button for: Docking/Warping/Looting/Acceleration (Context sensitive)So the two cons for me, which happen to drag down the fun quite a lot are this.The gameplay elements i dont like are enemies with missiles/mines/torpedes.See, you have a limited amount of them. Limited like under 24 for the first you can buy. The enemy isnt limited. They will spam this♥♥♥♥♥♥like no tomorrow. I am not exaggerating. I tested an enemy frigate, after i shot down all of the smaller fighters. Five minutes into the fight it was still spamming Hornets and Heat Seeker. The complains about 2D ties someone into gameplay. See, there are fields of debris and asteroid everywhere. The systems are rather big, but while ""warping"" (Fast Travel, has to be engaged after a build up time of 3-5sec), you will be dropped out by enemies, debris, asteroids. And because its 2D , you have to fly around them, if you want your warping. I dont mind it happening sometimes. But it gets old rather quick. Warping, dropping out, killing/avoiding stuff, build up time, warping, dropping out...you get the idea. Tl;drGood naval space game for time killing with some unlucky gameplay decisions.			"

												So this wil be the first time i will be writting a review so bear with me. The combat in thisgame is pretty good for a spacecombat game, i particularly like the fact that they try to not make it overcomplicated, Then there is just the feeeling of freedom that you get. You get to go anywhere you want at any point. The feeling of vastness of space is also beautifully achieved, without making the travel times to long. The game has a lot of ships to updrage to and a lot of upgrades for these ships. The story could be better, but that is not what this game is about anyway. The combat system is excellent. There is great music and athmosphere within the game.Now for some of the negatives, the most glaring thing that i am missing is an experience system either for the crew or the captain. This could have created another interesting dimension to the game. Also the fact that you cannot assemble a fleet isquite disapointing, (you can hire a mecenary but only one at a time). All in all this game is one of the more enjoyable games i have played lately and i would definetly recommend it for everyone.			"

												This is pretty much the space game I always wanted to play.  Not overly complicated with way too many systems to learn, just having fun flying around a beautiful galaxy, trading materials, destroying space pirates, and listening to an awesome Firely-esque soundtrack! The game takes place on a 2D plane, with an emphasis on broadside combat, but the option for other forms of attack such as turrets, lasers, mines, etc. exists.  Basically, if you've ever played Assassin's Creed IV, the game plays very similarly to the boat sailing and combat, only more responsive and more entertaining.  There are 21 ships available to purchase and fly, as well as many items for customizing them, including weapons, defense, and more!Pros:-Runs perfectly with little to no slowdown.-Beautiful graphics with plenty of options to change.-Great music, with an easy option to add your own music in a number of areas, such as battle music, ambient music, etc.-Big universe.  While not nearly as big as other space games out there, it's still plenty big.  I've played six hours so far and haven't even left the first galaxy that you start in, and there seems to be at least 10+ to explore.-Price: $18 at launch ($20 later) is a steal for this game.  It runs smoother and I haven't encountered any bugs so far, which is more than I can say for many of the AAA games that I've payed $60 for recently.-Most importantly: FUN! Cons: -One of the only cons I would say is that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of a damage model for ships.  If you ship is severely damaged, you may see a few minor explosions and fire going on around it, but you aren't missing any chunks of your ship or anything like that.  Pretty minor in the long run when compared with all the pros.-Possible con is that many of the side missions are similar, so you could get burned out after a while.  The positive is that you can do the story missions which offer a bit more variety, or take a break and play something else for a while!-Not really a con, but you can only save when you dock at a space station, which can be a bit annoying if you need to leave suddenly, but there are plenty of space stations, usually less than a minute away, and the game offers an easy option to find the nearest space station.Overall, if you're looking for a fun game with a cheap price, look no further than Rebel Galaxy.

												A fun arcadey space trucking game. Starts slow, but really opens up after you leave the first system, with lots of equipment and ship classes to grind for. Though I'm not sure $18 is a fair price for the amount of content you get, I'd recommend waiting for sales.I do have some problems with its game design, though.1. Escort missions simply don't work. Warp pairing just boosts the chances to break warp from proximity to objects tenfold, and since escortees can't navigate space for♥♥♥♥♥♥and just fly in straight line, if you're lunky enough to get some asteroid field or nebula in a way, have fun waiting 5 minutes for NPC ship to slowly fly through it. Not only that, paired warp speed is also extremely slow compared to how you normally travel by yourself.2. Warp mechanics in general are hit and miss. For example, there should've been different ranges that trigger warp break for different types of objects. There's absolutely no reason why some asteroid or piece of junk should stop the warp unless you're REALLY close to it, it's not an enemy dreadnought that pose any threat. Jumpgates on the other hand are extremely easy to miss.3. Not only the UI is pretty ugly thanks to huge prompt icons, it also suffers from many problems. Why do loot and small ships have the same color on radar? When I use gamepad, I sit a bit further away from the monitor and it's impossible to tell what's a small square and what's a small circle on the radar. Why doesn't mission board show location of the objective on the map? Why can't you wave traders goodbye right after trading with them and instead have to go through all dialogue screens again? Why can't you just use B to go back in dialogue? Why can't you use starmap to check available equipment/ships on stations you visited? Why can't you see where jumpgates lead if there's a mission marker on them?4. Its's another game that treats you like a r-e-t-a-r-d and constantly gives you tips how to return to broadside mode, use scanner, etc. I don't need to see these tutorials a hundred times, nor am I dumb enough to forget which button does what. These things just clutter UI and get on my nerves, there always must be an option to turn those off.5. Systems lack hand-crafted environments and originality. Every nebula and asteroid belt is just a copy-paste of another one, all of the same size, there are no really unique formations and places to visit. Every system is the same, just with differently colored star and background. It's true even for the blocked-off alien world you get to visit in the end of the game. When you have only a dozen systems to offer, you could at least try to make them feel original and interesting in some way. 6. Holding A activates tractor beam, docking, warp and opens dialogue if you're receiving a call. Want to quickly warp out but some pirate is calling you? Need to enter the station with full cargo but there's a bunch of illegal materials floating about? Tough luck.I mean, it's good fun, but these amateurish and obvious problems really keep the game from being as enjoyable as it should be.			"

												If you loved Free Lancer, you will love this game.  Looking forward to more updates and patches to polish it off. The music and graphics are absolutely perfect for this game and certainly will buy any addons they come out with.This game, has a FireFly, and Stargate feel to it. Even one of the larger ships look like Prometheus (if your familure with SG series).Developers if your reading--Some things I really want seen done with this game in newer updates are....  -Expansion - more galaxys even if some of them are meaningless I love exploring-More Ships to fly, they can have similar specs but different appearences ...like real life  big companies copy after each other but with their name and their little twist on it (chevy cavalier and pontiac sunfire are 2 good examples). More choices are a good thing.-More weapons,  diverse weapons...  examples be like...  rail guns for the broadsides, secondary weapons would be maybe a masking cloud to make missle attacks and tracking near impossible,   how about a massive payload missle like a Planet Buster, Grapling hooks would be grate if your a pirate to keep an enemy ship from moving (also prevent your self from moving), maybe gattling guns/lasers that would work as  flak cannons for anti fighters / missles -More aliens or more division among the systems. Maybe even some corporate warfare.-#-Also I want to be able to roll down the window of my space ship and flip off the militia, or aliens, what ever. That would be the best thing ever. Maybe even moon them.			"

												I'm am having the worst heartbreak feeling from a game in a REALLY LONG time. so i loaded my game with 10+ hour gameplay and boom. my computer crashed? or something happen that it turned off and restarted. jump back on to Rebel galaxy and what do I find...my save corrupted and need to start completely over. Now i sit here with a broken heart. I was some what far in the game, had the ship called Dravius, was about to buy the Vangaurd. had 6 MKII pusle turrets and MKIII nuetron beams. But what do i think im going to do about this game? That's right... Restart from scratchThis game is SOOOOOO much fun, It's been a real long time that i have been looking forward to start playing again when i get off to do life things. Missions are just the right amount of difficulty with the way I play.And now that I know whats easy money and who to side with and other nice information to know, I am actually looking forward to restarting.If you are looking for a space sim with addicting combat, just as fun side missions and contracts as the main story, or want to have fun blowing up pirates or traders or even both (I don't judge) GET THIS GAME! You will not regret buying this game.			"

												I am loving it. I'd watch a Let's Play to ensure that you will enjoy the combat style, which is more naval than space (no 6 degrees of freedom here). I genuinely love it because it simplifies the movement and allows me to concentrate on other parts of combat. Others might be frustrated at the restriction. Neither view is right or wrong, but you should take a chance to check which camp you fall into. Once I adjusted to the movement, everything came together and it's been a blast every since. I don't think you'll regret the purchase.			"

												Lovely little game, I thoroughly recommend it if you're looking for a simplified space game with minimal sim elements. The story is about as believable as Freelancer (by that I mean ludicrously cheesy but in a good way), it has an excellent soundtrack and is something you can mostly relax while playing. Well, until you go to a distress call and get jumped by 4 frigates, a command ship and more fighters than you can count! Ouch?I'd suggest taking a more patient approach rather than rushing through the story, the difficulty ramps up a lot between the first two systems so you'll probably want about a million credits to upgrade systems to be on a par with the NPC factions. Some of the best weapons also appear to be looted rather than bought (Viridian Beam? Oh aye! 3.8 k range and rips through shields like nobody's business!)Physics is out of the window, they never heard of Newton as you can stop dead then turn on the spot before almost immediately being up to max speed again. The weapon types seem a little limited but they do the job and fill the required niches, they just get upgraded to a new mark as far as I've seen but I'm currently playing the legit route, different factions appear to have some slightly diferent hardware available which you might be able to loot.Overall it's just good fun with a space/wild west theme that doesn't take itself too seriously.

												Well done Double Damage! I very much enjoy this game - love the freedom and the simplicity. I enjoy discovering how my actions affect the economy - and too many other elements of the game to list. This is elegant and well thought out game development for a fair price. I very much hope for additional content.Some things I would love to see:- The ability to ""zoom out"" from the ship - in various situations (like mining etc.) where it would be helpful.- The ability to customize the visual appearance of ships - or see purchased turrets affect the ship's look.- The ability to purchase (from the merchant guild - or whoever) - price tracking software for my ship- The ability to make lateral movements with my ship (if I'm too close to a mining node - for example)Anyways - thanks for making a solid game.

												Very cool western themed space game with naval ship to ship combat. Excellent value for the money. Great graphics. The game got campaign story, missions, ship combat, npc escorts you can hire, random events, scanning, mining, upgrades, different ships, trading, different aliens, animated characters for the story, and lots more. And it's made by two veterans (other contractors contributed) that previosly founded Runic Games and made Torchlight 1&2.Ok, you don't steer in 3D but I don't mind as the game is designed around the mechanics of a naval broadsides battle. There are tons of other games with real 3D space mechanics, this game gives the space genre more diversity. "

												Recommended, with some caveats. While very pretty, the game feels to lack a lot of polish. My turrets almost destroyed a ship I was supposed to be escorting trying to hit a target on the other side of the escortee. The menus were very obviously designed for consoles, with no work put in for them on PC. Mouse has little functionality in the menus, and you are forced to use the keyboard for all inputs. There are plenty of ships in the game that you won't be able to actually fly, which is a shame because they're some of the best looking ships. It doesn't matter what your reputation is with them you can't buy them, and there's no ship capture mechanic. The really disappointing thing about not having a way to capture ships is that you are forced to do very repetitive missions over and over in order to upgrade. Ultimately, its a ""blonde"" version of Starsector: pretty and fun, but, in the end, a shallow experience.			"

												First review, mostly because I'm all about some space sims these days and I think this is an interesting game that needs some clarification.So first of all it's not that deep.  It does get grindy.  The missions, while there are a few variations, do find pilots (captains?  Do you pilot a Dreadnaught or captain it? Whatever.) doing basically the same few things repeatedly.  You can't get out of your ship, you can't walk around your ship, you can't go down to planets, etc. etc.  You can't even fly up or down.  Yeah, true.  But you won't really notice after an hour, I promise.What you CAN do is blow stuff up.  A lot.  And it's pretty damn fun about it, too.  You can also put in your own music that plays in game, which is better than just having a music player on in the background because the in game music fades when you need it too, and if you have a large list of music added you get moments when the perfect song plays for the perfect fight, and it's awesome.  So I recommend this game, especially at the 17-ish bucks I bought it for.  It's pretty,  the combat is quick paced and fun, and if you're like me and waiting for even the beta of Star Citizen or for Elite Dangerous to actually have sand to go in its massive sandbox (Right now Rebel has more variation and more fun moments than Elite, but Rebel is not getting expanded for the next 10 years, so), this will scratch the pew pew itch.  Not going to be spending months and months on Rebel, but it's a fun game that might warrant a couple play throughs if you want to try going through with different factions.Almost forgot:  This is not a starfighter type of game.  You fly naval style big ships with broadside cannons and auto turrets (you can control them, too) that you angle in and open fire.  And when you unload full broadside and watch that other ship explode...I gotta say it feels good.			"

												Rebel Galaxy is not a simulation, nothing like Elite Dangerous or Starpoint Gemini 2 (both great space-sims); if you want to compare it you best go with Freelancer. The story, tone and visual presentation are very different from Freelancer; where the good old piece of gaming history served a more serious tone and a sci-fi-thriller plot Rebel Galxy offers more upbeat space-western; mysterie and discovery are still here but it feels nothing like what Freelancer showed.Yet Rebel Galaxy is very coherent; no matter if it`s the main storyline or the world your traveling in it all breathes Firefly.Visual presentation is top notch and despite what images and movies might suggest not very demanding, i`m running the game on an older rig and it looks and runs like charm. The whole galaxy your exploring, ships, effects, planets, stations, etc. are just filled to the rim with detail, colors and a unique art-style. Sound-design and music are some of the best i`ve ever seen, the soundtrack (western, space-rock) just hits the nail on the head, voicework is fitting, weapons, ship engines sound impressive. Just like Freelancer you`r free to do what you want (with more options); -explore and find valuable cargo, minerals, equipment-pirate trade-convoys (including a news-flash in stations giving you hints)-trade-bounty hunt-do countless randomly generated missions for various factions (tons of different missions types: escorts, deadrop pickups, breaching blockades, getting certain trade-good and the list goes on)and than there`s a mainplot which starts of rather boring but gets traction very fast and serves the space-western picture perfectly.the game offers tons and tons of different ships to fly, gear to put in your loadout (weapons, shields, engines, subsystems and and and), mercenaries to hire (one at a time) and as a unique twist: your flying the ""big ships""; starting with corvettes, frigates you soon hit capital ships like destroyers, etc. .the game is not centered around smaller fighter/bomber craft vessel dog-fights, but on you sitting in a massive turret filled capital class ship ditching out broad-sides (similiar to naval combat) while turrets and your mercenary do the busy work).....and it feels and plays amazing!the games does not offer the whole 3D space, but a 2D plane your flying in, which takes some time gettin used to, but it enhances the arcady gameplay by alot.controls and interface are very very slick and tight, especialy with a gamepad the whole UI and control-scheme feels spot on; it`s hard to describe, but every simple action (from hailing other ships, docking, pulse-scanning, scaning, operating different weapon-systems, to shield managment, etc.) goes just natural. Rebel Galaxy is a very polished, colorfull, space-western, sporting freedom and content...great visuals, amazing music and very non-simulation fun gameplay. the price is very misleading, this in no way feels like a low-budget, indie game, but more like a big-release tripple A game offered for a real bargain.

And I wish there's bigger and more powerful dreadnoughts (I don't like the design of Blackgate) and some sort of battle arena / survival, where I can just massacre the enemy.Anyways, this is a good game. If you like space sim like X3 or Elite Dangerous but feel that they are too complicated, get this.

												Fantastic! This is a must buy for anyone who loves space games. The atmosphere is fantastic! The music is a huge differentiator. I would have paid $50 easy for this title! Very happy with my purchase and will be playing for a long time! Other Developers take note Rebel Galaxy is how you make a solid space game! I've been waiting a long time for a game that gave the same feel as Freelancer did back in the day, and even though this is cap ships it still perfectly scratches that itch, which as space game vets and coneseurs know that is high praise. Kudos Double Damage and thank you for making the game we've all been asking/waiting for. Also huge bonus points for launching a fully functional product. On a final note the ship designs are fantastic and all effects have a feeling of substance. So satisfying! 9.8/109.8 is for wanting more ships to play with! Open up mod tools or make DLCs with more ships!			"
