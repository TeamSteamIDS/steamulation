												CPCW is an acceptable good Tactic-Strategy game. In my Opinion a good game to play on rainy weekends with a nice cup of coffee. Details: Graphics - 8/10 The ingame graphic is awesome detailed. Enviroment looks close steps to realistic, nicely done with much love to detalis. Also the realistic reactions are nice to look at (example: Weather / grenade in forest burns trees down / ramming electricity pylons make'em flash and fall /  after some gaming time the night comes and the tanks use activate headlights,....) Sound - 7/10 Sound is okay. The music is a bit monotone but fits in. Talking/responding of the soldiers is clear and good. War-Sounds are very good. You feel like inside the game.  AI - 7/10  The Computer-Inteligence is also okay. Sometimes, your tanks or troopers dont go the way they should (example: tank turns cicles before driving ahead). It happens acceptable rare, but happens. Enemys react good. with nice tactic that gives you the ""wow, could be human"" effect. Ingame functions - 9/10 There are quite a lot of functions, and I still keep finding out more. You can rotate your view from upper view to diagoal. You can tell the tanks where to aim at when they change position. You can group teams, individually. You have Maps to draw in for making plans with Multiplayer friends..... and so on. complexity - 7/10 Well as someone who doesn't like the HUD filled up to much and stuff I gotta say: you should definetly take a look at the manual. Fly over it for about 10mins, make the Tutorial and I think you got it. Some things could have been easier, like Keyboard-Settings but its okay.  Single Player - 6/10 Story is easy to follow, but could be a bit more motivating to play. Seems a bit ""loveless"". Campaign could be a bit longer or DLCs could have been released. Anyway its fun to play through. Multiplayer / Coop 4/10  Multiplayer is a bit frustrating. If you wanna go ""online"" then you need to activate an account wich is (meanwhile?) impossible, so no online servers possible to play with. It works if you use programs like tunngle and connect via LAN function to friends. There it is easy and with no problems to connect fast and fun to play. But sadly very less maps. Price 3/10 Well, the game is worth buying it, but not worth the actual 20 EUR it costs. This was maybe realistic when it was released but nowadays a bit to expensive for this kind of game. Ending words  You should definetly give it a try when its on sale. for a max Price of 10 EUR its okay to buy and you wont regret it. "

												I initially gave this a negative review because it crashes on launch.  The (new?) developers of the game are clearly trying to update the game and have removed the TAGES copy protection.  Hopefully they'll resolve the crash issue.   Until they do, the game will lauch if the computer is offline.  To my mind this is better than a game that insists on being online all the time.   Codename Panzers is a great series of tactical RTSs with the focus on action rather than base building.    ""Cold War"" introduced some elements of reinforcements (similar to Ground Control/World in Conflict) but the main focus remains on tactical action.  The graphics are good (for a 2009 game) and I enjoyed it as a slightly more relaxed alternative to Company of Heroes or Men of War.   Unfortunately the game was largely overlooked on release (as per another Atari classic RTS, Act of War) and recieved little suppport.  It's good to see that this game is now getting some developer support - and well worth picking up , especially if on sale.			"

												I have always been a big fan of the Panzer games. As you would expect from the name a lot of your units are armoured vehicals be they Tanks, APCS etc etc. Infanty play a part but mostly you are going to be using the Armour as a lance to the enemy.It ran very well on my rig (window 10) and only once in the final mission when all hell was breaking loose did I have an issue with textures not loading quickly ( took about 3 seconds to load up the tanks skins).They have removed the anti-cheat software so the negative reviews about that can be ignored.Story wise it was a bit generic and certainly no where as engaging as the first two games. A lot of the ingame converations take place as text by the side while you play meaning you do lose a lot of the plot.Its rather old so price wise I would not recomend it at the £15 mark...not nowadays. ( Although back in the day :D....I did buy it for £25 when it first came out.) If you see it for £7.99 or less thou?  Dont hesitate ....if you are a RTS fan who likes to be able to do more than ""select all and attack move to point""...you will like this game.			"

												Previous games : Codename panzers phase 1 and 2.Similar game : Road to BerlinI played all  years ago and enjoyed it.The reason why i set my teeth on the lastest release, Cold War.Game style :* fun RTS* rock paper scissor mechanism* no base building* fog of war* in essence only infantry and amory (tanks, APC) so no air or naval battles* healing (infantery) and repairing units (APC)* no indepth tactics needed or reading a thick manual* limited units due to fixed unit cap* capture hot spots (Points of Interest) to gain access to a helicopter pad, armor factory, healing station, radar station and so on.Difficulty : played on 'hard' level which is recommended to have enough challenge tobeat the game. If you played RTS before, 'easy' is too easy.Most difficult battle is not suprisingly the last mission.Story line (6/10) :You will tackle 18 missions which are linked with each other.Some have an intro and/or outro cutscene, some don't.Cutscenes can not match with those of the C&C serie (for example).Looks a bit amateuristic which has it's charm though.Western world is pushing back the commies (USSR and China) and kicking them outof Europe. Sorry, for spoiling the plot.You will play both sides in the single player campagain.Mission objectives :Each map comes of course with several mission objectives.The primary objective is to finish the mission.The secondary objectives are optional but can you give an asset during the battle.There are secret objectives which you can discover, for this you need to examine the entiremap (find an empty Russian tank which you can use, using a tunnel, destroy a boat).Objectives (except the secret ones) are displayed on the left side of the screen sometimes with additional commments of your commanders. It's not the best way to do so as you can oversee it.I paused the game and verified the message log from time to timeMedals :For completion of a mission you will get a bronze, silver or gold medal award.Based on which credits is not explained in the manual.Even after finishing the game, i do not have a clue on what it is based upon.Is it time related + doing all side and secret missions + not losing any unit ?Not really, something else, who will tell......Graphics (8/10) :Even today, it is still standing, detailed units, nice explosions, collapsing buildings.Looks fine to me and not outdated.AI (7/10) :Selecting a bunch of units and ordering them to move to another area can sometimesbe complicated. Armor units are turning from left to right and back again beforethey move. Can happen that the units are blocking each other and do not move.Enemy is not too cunning therefore as said before, choose the hard level.Most events and attacks are scripted.Sound (6/10) : the same fanfare (trumpets - horns) sound over and over again.Units produces the standard text lines like yes sir.Explosions, gun fire and other environment noises are okay.Bugs : Not encounteredTo play or not to play :Pfff, Cold War is not a must play nor it is boring.I found the first two games innovative during their release.Cold War is more of the same. If you have time and game is on sale, buy it.I love the smell of Panzers in the morning.			"

												Lots of potential, but ultimately disappointing. The third entry in a realistic RTS series, it's absolutely filled with inaccuracies - supposed to take place in 1948, it includes tech ranging from 1940 to 1970. It dismantled the fantastic headquarters system of the previous Codename Panzers games in order to introduce a Starcraft-like resource control system on the maps, which makes it seem like a cheap copy of every other RTS game on the market rather than the more unique games that its predecessors had been. Speaking of cheap, the game was obviously made on a shoestring budget, as there's no audio for in-mission dialogue (a step backwards for the series,) little music, and what voice acting they do use is absurdly bad.Then there's the story, which is so ridiculous that it becomes more painful to watch the longer you play. John Dillinger is *for real* a main character, having faked his death to defect to the USSR, and he flips wildly between his gangster and Comrade personalities. The ending of the plot doesn't make any sense, partly because it's hastily wrapped up in a sequence so rushed that it feels more like an insult than a reward.			"

												The main characters don't have voice-overs, but instead yap their conversations in small text boxes in the upper left screen. Meanwhile your units are constantly shouting for help, to acknowledge your command, because they see danger or just to make noise (presumably because the makers thought that was funny). The combat itself is hard to immerge in, because your troops are constantly outnumbered but still fight off hordes of enemy troops like it's nothing. The tutorial teaches you how to order a new tank once you've captured a helipad, but never zoom in on the barracks or how to get more infantry. But the worst part of this game is that it keeps lagging and freezing, even though my hardware far exeeds the recommended specifications!This game is nothing like it's previous installments, who were both absolutely brilliant. I'm feeling quite let-down by this last one..  "

												If you want a good Codename Panzers game, the other two are on steam. While it does do some interesting things, it somehow manages to look worse than the other two when zoomed in. The effects do the job, but the infantry models really needed work.Lack of unit variety, and what units there are completely don't make sense in the setting (It's 1949, so naturally tanks, aircraft, and infantry units from the late 1950s and early 1960s form the backbone while more reasonable vehicles are regulated to cameo appearances). Lack of information as well - instead of being told how much damage/armor a unit has, you get an ""attractive"" green bar that just tells you roughly how beat up it is.Windowed mode doesn't work, and the multiplayer backend hasn't been updated like the other Codename Panzers games either. Doesn't play well with alt-tab and it seems some of the shaders don't work properly on Windows 10 since I remember it running better before I upgraded from 7.It's pretty easy to tell this was a game hacked together halfway through development since Stormregion actually was closed down (along with 10tacle, their publisher) about halfway through development. It was finished under Atari.			"

												The game certainly isn't awful there are far worse and there were times were I was enjoying myself. However being immersed is a big part of a video game for me and the mixture of very little cutscenes and backstory ammatuer voice acting and a very generic main character screaming about america and freedom made the game feel a bit silly. As gameplay wise I'm coming off of the COH franchise so my expectations are rather high. At the start of the game you're dumped with this blob of units than will run around the city wiping out whatever it wants while never losing a man. The sqauds themselves seemed difficult to distinguish and micro manage and there seemed to be very little benefit to cover when you could run your men in as a death ball wiping out tanks ect. I thinkt he straw that broke the camels back was when an american tank commander comes over the hill in his lightly armoured M41 Bulldogs, surveys a large force of heavier russian armour resupllying in a city and crudely yells ""CHARGE!"" as no more than 3 tanks charge into a russian armoured collumn. In short gameplays not awful but bit scratchy, voice acting and story's pretty poor, worth the buy just not at the price it is.			"

												This game was a lot down form the word go. I do not recommend it at all. 3/10.Bad:1: Internet Connection.   Why would a game that requires a connection to a server have its servers shut off. Then not have the simple piece of code that requires the connection be removed or patched. Atari's answer: disconnect from the internet to play. Well Atari i should ♥♥♥♥ing have to you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Better fix: block it form the internet with windows firewall - just in case you were wondering.2: Camera controls.  Poor at best, zoom levels are awful compared to other games. But even if you do not compare it to other games the fact that the units are so big and you cant zoom out enough to make you life nice and easy. And really don't get me started on the pan and rotation. Its slugish, poor and overall like trying to look around with a broken neck.3: Resolution.  This game i fell wasn't made for higher resolutions above 720p which for me is just unacceptable. I know not every game will be made for huge res but i at least expect 1080p And it probably says it supports this res but i'm not feeling it. I wouldn't even like to play this game on a smaller screen if that's the case. Good: 1: ............ It loaded			"

												I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this game. It is very poorly optimized for modern systems with stutering and next misions audio playing over the previous missions victory screen. The game constantly freezes for minutes at a time between games. When units are ordered to attack enemies they run to within punching distance before attacking. And worse of all I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how the reinforcement pad was supose to work. If you have fond memories of Phase 1 and 2 I suggest waiting for them to be remastered.			"

												Playing on an xp computer. 18 missions. Finished on normal about 10+ hours game time with no deaths but that took some reloading to achieve. Scripted events so the AI usually didn't do much. I basically have my little zerg go from one section to the next. Got from gem auction so paid less than $2. I consider this Company of Heroes lite, basically a tactical RTS, where you a have a limited amount of units that can be gotten with limited prestige points. Also has a skirmish mode. Since multi-player was based on game spy and it's an old game I doubt anyone is playing. Still on the border if I am having fun or if I consider this a time killer. Basically an average RTS for me. Not a bad game but considering the normal price is greater than CoH, can't recommend.			"
