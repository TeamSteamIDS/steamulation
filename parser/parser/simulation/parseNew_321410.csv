												*Updated to March 2017.*The most advanced  videogame , simulator ever conceived off by the human mind. Who is this simulator meant for?- Active or retired naval or aviation military personnel. (Especially commissioned officers)- Active or retired military intelligence officers.- Individuals that are intellectually curious and possess a great deal of specific knowledge about modern military tactics, strategies and technologies. (Knowing how to play ARMA or Battlefield does not qualify!) You should at the very least, have a fairly detailed understanding of the modern fixed-wing combat aircraft utilized by the USAF, USN and the VVS along with their constituent weapon systems. TRUST ME, the more specific knowledge you have, the better.Every prospective player must have a keen attention for detail, in terms of being intellectually curious about and willing to understand very arcane data.  Pricing Money means different things to different people.  If you are one of these people that has a hectic work life, with at most, one hour of free time every day, then I would recommend waiting several months for a sale.  If you know that you can afford to spend several hours a day playing this game, don't mind spending close to 80 USD, know a lot about its incipient material and salivate at the prospect of playing it, then I think you might want to consider getting it sooner rather than later. If you find yourself intrigued by this product, but don't have the highly detailed knowledge necessary to competently understand it, then I would recommend you do the following: spend the next few weeks or months reading up on as many fixed-wing combat aircraft, naval surface combatant warships and Soviet/Russian SAM systems as possible on the Internet or your local library.  I would recommend that you use this research to better understand the game in the interim so that you can then purchase it at a later date when it goes on sale. History of Steam sales66% Off - Nov. & Dec. 2016, Mar.201760% Off - May 201650% Off - Feb.& Jun. 2016, Jun. Nov. Dec. 201545% Off - Feb. 2016  Gameplay Dynamics This game is 90% planning and 10% doing. You will in all likelihood, spend an inordinate amount of time looking at very minute data. (ex -the cruising altitude of an AMRAAM C-7 missile, whether  a ship's radar has the ability to detect Ballistic Missiles within the Earth's atmosphere, or the High Frequency Passive Sonar signature emitted by a Diesel/Electric Submarine)  Once you’ve sent out your aircraft/ships/submarines, the suspense you will experience is unlike anything you will ever imagine. (Which might seem counterintuitive judging by how simple the map icons look) Be prepared to feel drama, frustration, relief and suspense as the engagement of your forces vis-à-vis enemy combatant forces take abrupt twists and turns that will go either in your favor, or against you!Learning how to play this game is one thing, learning how to master it, is quite another.   The amount of tactics one could devise by making minute changes to your force’s plotted course, speed, altitude/depth and the effect that will have on the outcome of a battle, are almost infinite. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that you could spend hours trying out different tactics on just one engagement alone.**A quick word on the oft-mentioned database: It is arguably the most extensive non-governmental repository of data on every conceivable weapon of war designed by man since the conclusion of the Second World War.**  Enough said. Interface Over the past year, Command’s interface has gone through numerous revisions both in terms of appearance and functionality.  You can now for example, maintain the altitude above ground your aircraft will fly at, irrespective of changes in terrain elevation, thus allowing you to stay within a weapon’s minimum release altitude.  This allows you to no longer worry about whether your F-16 will be able to release a MK 84 JDAM bomb if it suddenly flies over a steep mountain pass because you know that it always be above its minimum release altitude of 10k feet AGL.  Other welcome additions include: allowing players to finally determine how many weapons they have allocated on a single enemy target without doing too much clicking (This change finally came one year after I pointed out this flaw in this review!), frequent updates to its already massive database, a new look for its GUI and numerous other additions that would be too onerous for me to report on, due to space limitations.However, there are certain other ‘changes’ that make this software UTTERLY FRUSTRTING to use.  Reasons that are unbeknownst to me, the game displays as default, the range curves for radar and weapons used both by yourself and the enemy, every time you load up a new game! This cripples the software’s performance and makes it impossible to navigate!  I cannot tell you HOW FRUSTRATING it is to have your monitor filled with up with dozens, if not hundreds of circles and rectangles whenever you load up a saved game and then being forced to fix this problem by going through Command’s numerous drop-down menu, EVERY SINGLE TIME you load it up. But wait there’s more!  Trying to understand the labyrinth of new options available in the Rules of Engagement window, honestly feels like trying to decipher the Rosetta Stone, due to its unbelievably extraneous nature.  There is also still no window that streamlines the activity data of what all of your air or naval assets are doing, so you are forced to remember off the top of your head lots of very minute details: which aircraft is still being shot at by what enemy plane, which of your ships are firing SAM’s at which aircraft, or which submarine still has its Active Sonar turned on.  Remembering so many details becomes impossible on the large scenarios. Final Thoughts All things considered, even with its flaws, I believe this game will give its very small target audience (service members and hardcore military enthusiasts) hours of enjoyment and learning.  I would therefore be happy to recommend it.			"

												+ Insane complexity.+ Size of the database.+ Gameplay.+ LOTS of automated processes, no need for micro-management.+ Relatively easy to 'jump in' if you have played Harpoon series before.+ Excellent support by developpers (last patch had changelog of 40+ A4 pages).+ Watching map full of half circles fighting rombs.- Hard to explain to your girlfriend what you are doing in the middle of the night.- Sometimes unintuitive UI (due to complexity and large variety of possibilities).- Larger scenarios can need quite a powerful computer.- NOT FOR EVERYONE. You need to find some military geek in you to play this.First of all, take a look at the screenshots. This is all you will see. No fancy graphics, but a map full of symbols...I bet you get excited, didn't you?This is not a game, it's a simulation. Very complex. Difficult. With steep learning curve.But once you get into it, you will LOVE IT.UI is good, but _sometimes_ unintuitive and you need to get used to it.Complexity is mind blowing. Well, for example - algorithm that calculates radar reflectivity, besides many other factors, takes into an account speed of rotation of aircraft's jet engine fans plus angle of reflection from it. And everything is happening on your desktop computer. In real time.No words can describe the emotions when you try to hunt down this bloody Sovremenny-class destroyer with your Kobben class submarines. Then, your girlfriend comes in and asks what you are doing. Well... how can you explain to her, in simple words, that you are ambushing Baltic Fleet with 4 Kobben-class submarines? (This is probably the biggest flaw of the game)I spent most of my time in the scenario editor. And it is not what you think. You can turn on time flow and play the scenario against yourself within the editor, switching sides from time to time. This is more like your sandbox and playground.I researched military power in my region, replicated all squadrons and units. Read dozens of wiki pages, followed twitter and facebook accounts of military units. And had lots of fun checking out my 'what if' scenario.I payed full price for this game and I would pay for it again.			"

												Firstly, let's get the elephant in the room dealt with, this game is expensive.  If you have any doubt as to whether this is your sort of game, don't moan about the price, watch some of the Baloogan Campaign videos to decide whether it's for you or just don't buy it.  In context, it's less than the price of two new AAA games (or one AAA game plus DLC), and unlike AAA games you won't be done with them in 15 hours apiece, you could happily sink a thousand hours into this and never run out of things to do.CMANO is the spiritual successor to the Harpoon series, the grand daddy of modern naval command sims.  That means while the graphics are limited to maps and NATO symbology, the breadth and detail of units and capabilities represented is second to none, CMANO is capable of simulating pretty much any naval conflict from 1945 to near future hypothetical flashpoints.   This is at heart a serious minded simulation toolbox, rather than a balanced and scripted game.  If that appeals to you, then there is no finer product available, period.I bought this shortly after the first patch (1.01) about a year ago and since release there has been ongoing support from the devs, who seem to be in this for the long haul and it hs come on in leaps and bounds.  The long term future for this game is looking bright!What I like-Breadth of units, every post-WW2 unit I can think of is in the game, or will be-Global coverage, simulate any naval conflict post WW2 in any location-Community created scenarios pop up regularly-Ongoing dev supportWhat I hope is improved-Beginners are somewhat left to their own devices, small scale scenarios are limited-Air combat is less well developed than naval combat (though this is improving)-Interface is definitely an acquired taste!-Sound is glitchy			"

												BLUF: This is not a ""game"" in so much as it is the best simulator of modern air and naval combat I've ever come across.You may want this game if:you seek the highest realism and detail possible in a warfare simulation.you enjoy commanding huge forces and using them in complex actions.you enjoyed reading Janes encyclopedias as a kid (or adult).Do your research before buying this. This is not for anyone that is a casual gamer, or thinks they can easily transition from an RTS or grand strategy game to this. This may as well be running on a pentagon computer as a simulation to game out attack strategies for the next major war. There is no ""gameyness"" here. Everything is modelled to the Nth degree. Radars, radar signiature, electronic countermeasures, nukes, weapon systems, sonar and sound propogation including CZ's, effects of weather... literally untold effort over years was poured into this, and not a minute was wasted on 3D modeling and lighting effects. The end result: You are the commander. You know what your ships and planes look like, you've spent decades around them. You've spent years training for a war you hoped would never come. Now, it is time to put the forces of your nation into action. This is the command center, and it looks like one.I can't reccommend this program enough.This is the one game I cannot live without. I played the harpoon series since I was a teenager and this definately is better by a landslide.			"

												This game is fun! Really fun! Right off the bat, after downloading the game, CMANO has monopolized most of my game time.  I even have nominated this for a new category in the 2016 Steam Awards: The Under the Radar Award.. haha.. get it?This game though is probably not for everyone. It's for people who love simulations and RTS games. Those who are into action games, platformers, and shoot-em-ups would probably want to avoid this. If you enjoyed Warcraft, Starcraft, the Total War games, Civilization,  Warhammer, the Wargame series (EE, ALB and Red Dragon), then this game would be worth considering.AND, if you are an old geezer like me and have sneakily played Harpoon on the office PC during the late 80s/early 90s then this one is a no brainer.Watch Baloogan's YouTube videos on this game. I have spent hours watching his games and have learned a lot from it. His videos are what gave me the final push to get this game.For some reason, Steam has a problem tracking my game time. My guess is that the initial loading screen is what it tracks (that screen stays on after loading the game screen which I turn off the first few times) and not the game screen itself. The learning curve is a bit high but not too high that it becomes frustrating. For me, the difference between frustrating and challenging is that frustrating is when you just want to get it over with in order to move on and challenging is doing it again and again until you are satisfied while enjoying it each time.  This game is challenging.Graphics are basically limited to the unit symbols and the terrain map.. basically its your imagination (best to dl the image mods to have a mental picture of the units) that drives what you're seeing on screen. Reminds me of old Infocom ads in the 80s, how the brain is the best graphical processor around.There are a lot of mission scenarios. The page says 40 but after downloading the community pack, I have another 177 (!!!) scenarios that cover engagements all around the world! And there is an editor where you can even make up your own scenario. To give you an idea of the missions, the first tutorial mission was to bomb a couple of land targets that are protected by SAM installations. I launched a couple of F14s to patrol the area, set up Prowlers and Hawkeyes to monitor the area and jam enemy radar, then set up my strike force. I still haven't got a major victory (only a minor one; ran out of ordinance and had one bldg still standing). But I'll get back to this mission later. Going back to this mission and repeating it didn't feel like a chore to me. In the second tutorial, I had to micromanage one submarine through 4 stages sub v sub, sub v boat, sub v boat with a helicopter patrolling the area seeking you out, and finally sub v land target.Units are intelligent. Just send out the mission order, define the conditions and send them off. You can have them do the mission automatically or manually control and guide them.Much has been talked about the price. I got it on sale but still it was a bit high for me that I really had to think five times whether I should or should not. I'm glad I did.I think about it this way, I have spent much more on games I haven't played yet and some that I never will play again.Just to set expectations: 1. The first thing you'll notice is that the game rests above Windows UI (similar to how Excel or Word launches). This took me by surprise since I initially thought that it was a subpar game because of it.  But don't let it fool you, the game is top notch regardless. Plus using dual monitors is easy because of this.2. The graphics. Much has been talked about it but to quote Cypher from the movie The Matrix, ""But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it. I...I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head""3. Sound. There is none to talk about. It's really basic that I just play it without my headphones on.4. The pacing closely resembles how the pacing would be in real life. Missiles takes minutes to hit targets. Your planes need time to be loaded up, taxi to the runway, and launch.  5. Planning and strategy. When a scenario loads up, a pop up with mission details come up. It's best to read it and familiarize with the scenario. The overall strategy is laid out with some helpful tips but you must still have to plan out how to execute it6. The Database. Much has been written about its extensive database and boy, it really is. It's like a big technical manual of every weapon, vehicle, and even installations around; complete with its history, and the different versions and iterations around.7. No multiplayer. I really can't comment on this because I'm happy already with the way its set up but some would want to try this out in MP but sadly it isn't an option. 8. UI comes out clunky and there's no immediate accessible keyboard control guide. After awhile though like most games you'll get the hang of it. But if I have to complain, it's the UI really.Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations is 100% really about the gameplay.Anyway, not sure if this review makes much sense but I wholeheartedly recommend this for people who love the genre and are deciding whether to get it or not.

												So if you're thinking of buying this game, I beg you to get it on sale. If you're anything like me, if you want the game you'll ignore my review entirely and buy it at the ridiculously steep price of almost $90 it's offered at at the moment, but this review is coming from someone who bought it on sale for the low low price of $54.Now, I really can't recommend this game, but I'm not going to actively discourage anyone from buying it either. It feels more like a super-precise military combat simulator rather than a game, like something NATO uses to figure out if they could plausibly declare war on russia. However, the fact of the matter is, it's so expensive because it covers so much. I have yet to actually find a post-WWII military unit I can't build in the game. The search function may lead you astray because it *sucks*, but if you know exactly what you're looking for you can find the precise unit built in the exact year that you're looking for. And it doesn't stop there. If you pick a unit (This is most prominent with aircraft) it will let you select the onboard loadout. And I mean there are a *ton* of loadouts for every unit that carry every very specific missile made in a very specific year by a very specific company, and they have loadouts with 4, 5 and 6 of them onboard. I mean this game (simulator?) is seriously detailed. After you've spawned a unit, you can go into a screen showing you very detailed information about the unit. The game (Again, simulator?) feels like they had 200 people working 24/7 finding out literally as much information as they could get their hands on, and supplied these people with an IV injecting caffiene directly into their bloodstream. There is a mind-boggling amount of detail in this ame, as in more than you could find if you wrote a doctorate thesis about every one of these military units. Now, I do have some concerns about this game:- This is very trivial, however I have not yet found a way to turn down the ingame music volume so I can play (simulate?) while lisening to music.- It seems like they put waaaaay too much effort into detail and not enough into sound, because if you have a couple destroyers firing on an enemy all you hear coming through your speakers is the same monotone boomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboomboom. I haven't checked, but in the game files I'm pretty sure there's boom.ogg and aircraft.ogg, because this game has like 2 sounds.- The game (simulator?) gets really boring, really fast. I can't really take this game in high dosage without getting bored of whatever I'm doing. Everything goes so slowly it gets very annoying after a while.- If you're not a military expert with several four-year degrees, this game is going to confuse the ever-loving hell out of you. You'll boot it up, find the only plane you know (Which is probably the F-18 or F-22), try to spawn one, and then sit there trying to figure out which convoluted loadout is best, and then just clicking one at random and finding out the one you picked has no guns.So, to summarise my review for those who don't want to waste their time reading the entire thing:PEOPLE WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME- NATO (Revising my review to note that BAE Systems actually uses this for actual, real-deal military applications)- People who are serious military geeks and don't think Wargame: Red Dragon is enough of an intellectual challenge- People who want to become serious military geeks and *really* like reading- People who kinda like military stuff with some money to burnPEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT PLAY THIS GAME- People who play Supreme Commander and think this game is exactly like SupCom (It's not, in any imaginable way. Don't ask why, it's just not the same).- People who know nothing about military anything and have no desire to learn- People who want to play this game and not simulate this simulator.- People who have trouble paying attention for a long period of time.I'll reccomend some alternatives for people who want a casual-ish military simulator without having to alt-tab to wikipedia every 3 minutes:- Wargame: Red Dragon- Supreme Commander (Not the second one. The second sucks. Get the original)- Command and Conquer - StarCraft- SuperPower 2 (Good if you like running a country, but it does not have nearly as many units as C:MANO)TL;DR: Read the review.

												This game is complex, has a steep learning curve and is a niche game, but if you want to understand the evolution of moden naval warfare - there is no better choice in any form of media. There are lots of online video tutorials to help with the learning curve.  It is a virtual naval war college and it is managed by a team that is dedicated to its constant improvement (I've never seen such dedication to supporting any game in my 25 years of playing them).  They have improved the game non-stop over the last year,  It is insightful, flexible, versatile, and has a database that rivals the most expensive reference books like Combat Fleets or Janes.  I served in the USN for 24 years, and I can tell you that this game is priceless for understanding how navies operate and how modern air/naval warfare works.  It is the best simulation I have seen in or out of the service - and a useful tool for taxpayers who want to understand where their hard earned money goes.  It gives you 65 years of naval warfare across the entire globe with a multitude  of realistic and challenging scenarios, and a scenario editor that is relatively easy to use and which has generated an impressive amount of user content. If you have any interest in naval warfare you should buy it - I doubt we will ever see a game this good on naval warfare for the foreseeable future.  Hope you give it a try....Mark			"

												As many have already said, this isn't a game, but rather a simulation.  I'm goanna keep this simple.  It's a great game that's incredibly realistic, with pretty much any Ship, Aircraft, and Weapon you can think of in the Post-WW2 era.However this comes at a price to the casual gamer.  If you have not studied these systems, or don't have experience in the Navy, you are going to be completly lost.  Since this is a ""Simulation"" rather than a Game, you NEED to understand the technology.  There are tutorials, but even those require a basic understanding.  Additionally you should also understand Naval strategy and how to actually go about sinking an enemy fleet (Obviously).The high price is also something to be considered.  But i can assure you, if you like strategy games, and you like Naval/Air battles, this game is without a doubt worth its price. "

												“Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations” is a strange beast. Its good features could make for a gem of a game. However, its bad features deeply mar it. And, unfortunately, the bad features outweigh the positives BY FAR. I bought it from Matrix store one year ago and followed its evolution up to the current patch. Unfortunately I do not have good news.The game is fairly functional, but the interface is crude and cumbersome with tremendous clutter in the single map that cannot be disabled.  The dearth of hotkeys is also noticeable as the player is forced to chase back and forth across the map with his mouse to accomplish the most basic and simple functions. The lack of a database editor for this game is quite significant especially in this day and age where the most successful games such as “ArmA” or “Crusader Kings 2” (not to mention “Harpoon” itself) actively encourage their user communities to create additional content and, more importantly, to tweak the existing one. “Command” users are limited to only those things that are already within the database since no new planes, ships, or submarines can be created nor can any pre-existing information be modified. You can mount American SSMs Tomahawks on a Soviet Kirov class cruiser, but players who like to tinker with known units (or experiment with hypothetical planes and weapons) are out of luck.There is no multi-player option available at this time so players are limited to the AI opponent. The game is, in fact, primarily designed for players to issue general orders even for the friendly AI assistant to interpret and implement. Unfortunately, the AI is so weak that the users have to constantly follow what’s going on if they want to hope for success.  This means that the player is virtually compelled to micro-manage every single aspect of his battle.  Instead of the role of battle group commander, he is relegated more to that of supply clerk or bean counter as he almost has to fire each bullet or drop individual bombs from his aircraft.  If a daunting UI and awkward game functions do not scare you, then moving into surrealism maybe will. The “depth of research” and “the value of the database alone!” are the other items which are touted as “crown jewels” for this game. Then you discover that almost all planes’ speed is topped at 950kts. Planes capable of reaching MACH 2 on afterburner (about 1300kts) are out of luck. That these planes were designed for speed above anything else doesn’t seem to bother the “hard researching developers”. True, some planes, like the MiG-25 or its “heir”, the MiG-31 can exceed this “roof” and act as interceptors. But try to check an F-14, an F-15, an Eurofighter 2000 or even a Tu-22 “Backfire” (naval bomber, top speed 1,250kts): every single of them will have a top speed of 950kts. Still in the realm of surrealism is the weather model, which allows the player, via the scenario editor, to choose the weather for the whole world. A “true WWIII scenario!”, another possibility touted by the developers as the Second Coming or such (“Harpoon 3”, BTW, already manages thousands of units just fine) will see Russian ICBMs depart from their silos in a rainy Siberia, overfly a rainy North Pole (!) descend over the rain that pours over Canada from Montreal to Vancouver, follow the soaked Western Coast and hit a San Diego chilled by the low, rainy clouds. As a consolation, the people of San Diego can be assured that, in the meanwhile it is raining in Italy, Mumbai, Tasmania and the Marshall Islands. Maybe the developers were hit by the famous passage of James Joyce’s “The Dubliners” where Gabriel Conroy’s soul “swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.” I don’t know. I love Joyce, but I never associated it with Tom Clancy.I had high hopes for fun from this game and excitedly followed its development and eagerly awaited its release one year ago from Matrix; but, even after the patches Command is, currently, too much of a chore to play.  It really is work to accomplish the simplest tasks.  Scenarios that might take 1 hour to play in similar games like Harpoon usually take 2-3 hours in “Command” due to the difficult interface. True, “Harpoon” players (the game “Command” will be most compared to) will be happy to know that many of the ìHarpoon 2/3 functions are replicated within “Command” thereby making it easy for them to quickly jump into the game, as the fundamental mechanisms are the same.  However, once in, they are likely to run into a wall of frustration as not all the helpful Harpoon 2/3 functions are available.  They soon begin to ask themselves “How do I do <<this function>> that I remember was so helpful in Harpoon?” only to find that it isn't possible with this new game. Why, just to give a simple example, I cannot designate an independent subordinate map for every area and/or group of platforms of interest, when ”Harpoon 2” managed to give us this opportunity in 1994? (!!) The sad truth is that every time I fire “Command” up, I start looking for something else to play within 10 minutes or so because the constant mouse-work required in this click-fest just isn't fun. The lack of basic game functions such as Multiple Maps and an easily functional or recognisable Formation Editor soon become apparent.  Command is like a ""big box"" of ""shiny new toys”. A wargame like “Panzer Corps” gives you the whole War in Europe. You can (metaphorically) shake it and exclaim, ""Wow! Ships! Airplanes! Land Units! Flame throwing tanks! Look at the beautiful map!” The same happens, for example, with ""World in Flames"" (yet to be published on Steam): ""All the counters from the original war game! An enormous map! Video tutorials!""The key question, however, is: ""Do they work together to return a cohesive, fluidic, and fun game experience?"" “Panzer Corps” does and it is a blast to play. ""World in Flames"", after a year, is BARELY functional, full of bugs, and lacks basic functions like an AI and multi-player capability.Then, a treasure like ""Command Ops: Battle of the Bulge"" comes along with its masterful use of real time, chain of command, and realistic control over troops in a war zone. A game worth every penny of its price But a lot of people will “shake the box” and say, ""It's just the Battle of the Bulge! Where are the toys? I won't pay this price for only a Sherman and a Panther!""“Command” is a box full of ""toys"" (""Ships! Airplanes! Sensors!"") which still lack cohesive and functional interaction. It is not ""difficult to play"" because it is supposedly realistic, but because the basic design still creaks BIG TIME. Ask any Admiral: their job is to fight the enemy, not the interface. And, maybe, the same Admiral will tell you that the sonar model is broken, but no one can do anything about it because the database is locked.Don’t be depressed if my comments sound negative! “Command” is delivered by passionate people. I can only see it to improve - hopefully to the point when you both have fun and your biggest challenge is to come up with a winning strategy. But, don't fall into the trap of, “Lots of toys + I need a degree in naval warfare = Masterpiece!"" Games that help you learn while having fun: those are masterpieces worthy of your money. It doesn't even need to be a computer game. Even Chester W. Nimitz could have told you that.			"

												Ok, so I picked this up since I was curious as to what a £70 game should contain - especially since the poor graphics are pretty self-evident.So having logged just over a full planetary rotation in it I can tell you now that there is a two questions you need to answer: are you fascinated by military hardware, to the extent of being interested with minutiae level of detail. If yes to that, then answer: would you like to see what that stuff can do in a particular setting. If yes to the first, but not the second, just buy a copy of Jane's. If yes to both, then buy this.For me, I was able to justify the cost, but in hindsight, I would have paid the full price (although who ever does that on Steam?! Oh, wait, me with Fallout 4) considering the sheer quantity of information available. The gameplay is actually more intuitive than the UI might lead you to believe; although there are elements (probably whole swathes) I've yet to even discover. Imagine the fidelity of submarine control from Silent Hunter, combined with strategic nuking of DEFCON, combined with data reading of Papers, Please! combined with the field positioning of the Total War series (though with far inferior graphics - they really are poor, though you will soon see how irrelevant this is; chess didn't endure due to graphics!). Visually, watching a battleship bombardment closeup looks not dissimilar to a game of Missile Command - lines and expanding circles.What I have found most amazing is the way the ""Friendly AI"" keeps everything coherent and cohesive. Whilst a great deal of care must be used with mission loadouts etc, the game plays units smartly when you aren't tending to them.There is a wealth of community stuff available - but the real gold isn't to be found on Steam. If you do pick this up Google for ""Baloogan Campaign"" and watch his YouTube video's - this guy takes it seriously and I ended up glued to his tutorial videos.Do I recommend? yes. Should you listen to my ""recommendation"" - with this title even I would urge caution; only a very specific mindset will appreciate it (it makes EVE look very simplistic by comparison for example). But yes, I would. "

												I would like to say Bravo! to the developers.  You have an impressive system here.  I call it a ""system"" and not just a game...I'll explain:First, if you are looking for fancy graphics and ultra-fast unrealistic action, this game is not for you.  This is a complex, battle simulation on an Operational and Tactical level of war.  It uses the NTDS symbology to plot unit positions on a map, much as you see on real world battle systems.  (I feel like I am back in the Command room that I worked in years ago...only much improved.)Second, I don't have to dig out my Jane's books to look up a range or specs on a particular weapons platform.  With a click or two you have that information available almost instantly.  The weapons database is one of the other reasons I call it a ""system""Third, you must plan your attacks, or defenses with attention.  This is not the run in and gun type of game.  This requires thought and planning, considering terrain, resources and unknowns.Fourth, you can create your own scenarios with units from the Korean War era to the near future.  Your imagination is not limited by the by the system but enhanced by it.  Oh, and by the way, there already is a large user community out there making scenarios for download.My fifth and final positive point is that the developers are very engaged in this project.  Both fixing bugs and adding functionality.Some minor negatives:1.  Don't bother with the sound.  Turn it off and use your imagination.  There's no sound effects in the Command Room either, (Unless you count loud Lieutenants)2.  Some users have reported blocking bugs, but realtively few and the devs are actively working on it.  I have encountered none so far myself.3.  Currently no Steam Workshop support, but installing scenarios is no more complicated than unzipping and placing in the correct folder.A definate buy for the wargame enthusiast, but it is not for everyone.  If you have qualms about buying, do some research first. "

												At $80 I am relunctant to recommend this game but I will.   I paid full price for the game and I am satisfied.    It took me a few months to convince myself to purchase the game at full price so now I am committed to getting my money out of it.Cons:   Price - It is very expensive for a game.   They are going to limit who buys or even considers this game because of the price... but maybe that's what the developers of the game want.   Land Units - The game is called Command: Modern Air/Naval operations.  It's not called Command: Modern Air, Land and Naval operations,  I get that.   BUT,  really... you can't have marines, navy seals and other infantry units in the game and then put almost no programming to make the units useful in a scenario.   You can add marines or seals to an aircraft for deployment but you have no easy way to get them off the aircraft.   You have russian, UK paratroopers that you can select for a scenario but no US AB units.  You can't add specific infantry units to an aircraft for deployment.  The land units move around the battle field like aircraft in some cases.   Land unit gameplay could be better with a little tweaking.  Pros:The air and naval side of the game is detailed to insanity.   You have to know your unit capabilities and weapon load capability to make it work.   If your jets fly over the enemy airfield and nothing goes BOOM... you did something wrong.  Check your weapon and load specifications.  If you are at 1000 feet but the weapon requires 10000 feet to be released.... it won't fire (lesson learned).   The game requires more then just a point and shoot mentaility.    You need to plan it out,  understand your unit and weapon capability to be successful.  I won't go into submarine warfare part of the game because at this point I don't know what I am doing with it.   The details of the submarine gameplay are again, INSANE. Scenario editor -  I love messing with the scenario editor and trying differnt event triggers and actions.  It's also a great way to learn more about units and weapons capability in the game.  The editor is what makes the game for me.   Most of my time in the game has been messing with the editor.    You can literaly build any operation or battle in this game.  The only limitation is your imagination and time.    Somene posted the game is 60% research,  30% scenario creation, 10% gameplay and that is about right.  This game makes you want to learn more about operations,  units and weapons.   It's required.Support - I had an issue with one of the scenarios and support was there to help.  I'm always relunctant to contact support for any game because I know in most cases customer support is not a reality... but in my case the technician gave me a solution to my problem immediately.   This game has a dedicated development group that is constantly updating the game and listens to the players.   The game overall is a fun game to play.   As I learn more I'm sure it will get even better.   There is a learning curve and it will take a lot of gameplay to really understand all the mechanics in the game,  I just hope I have the time to commit to it.    "

												I've been playing this for a good ol' while before it came to Steam.Its certainly a niche title, and this should go some ways to explaining the price point, I don't think this type of game will appeal to every type of gamer.However, I would highly recommend this, and I am no fanboy (never even played harpoon, which most people seem to compare this to.To help with the price, be aware that the game has a very active community who are constantly creating new scenarios to play, and many of these are as good (or better) than the stock ones, so there are always new scenarios to play.There are packs of these, so they are easy to get hold of.I must have played one scenario (Duelists) 10+ times, as the British force vs Soviets. I am determined that I can prevent that hidden sub from getting enough info to effectively missile my carrier force, but so far some missiles always do seem to get through...Not for everyone, but a good game if the genre interests you, and a helpful community.

												First, I purchased this game from Matrix. I realize that my review will not count toward Command's overall rating. Steam might think that makes me a fan somehow, but not at all.Is it a good game?The bottom line is NO. It's painful to play. Others might have you believe it's complicated and difficult. It's not at all--although looking at a database table or spreadsheet might seem disorienting at first.This product, however, is simply and poorly designed.I personally don't care about the windows interface or freely available NASA map (with ugly NATO icons), but simple player tasks are difficult/awkward and the responsiveness overall is choppy. Even simple map panning is awkward. The devs clearly bring the intricacies of the database to the forefront at the expensive of usability and realism.How could realism suffer in such a ""hardcore"" game?Because it is solely focused on equipment and technology (their beloved database/OOB), so the realism (and fun) of how strategy, operational art, and tactics synchronize is totally missing from the game.The front end of the game provides no realistic (or intuitive) simulation of the needed tools and controls. The ""mission editor"" is about as close as they get, but even that comes off poorly considering other games.Want to fight a modern Korean War in a theater-level air/sea campaign? You can't.Want to implement your own Silent Hawk helicopter into a special ops raid scenario? No. You can't touch the locked database without making an approved, licensed, paid, DLC product for them.Add to that, every single unit in the game acts with the same level of morale, surprise, training, competence, leadership, etc. The devs focus entirely on a tech database which works exclusively to model equipment traits via connected tables.If 2 Greek F-16 Falcons go up against 2 Turkish F-16 Falcons, the outcome is a roll of the dice.Want to setup waypoints/steerpoint for your aircraft with timing, altitude and posture settings. How about an ATO with packages and supporting flights? There is nothing like that is in this game. You can only set a reference point(s) on the ground for a unit to move to or to define an area -- in the same way you can in any simple rts. That's nowhere near professional quality planning and control for a sophisticated wargame.The game actually plays like a really bad rts game; that has terrible mouse and keyboard commands. At this point, rts player control is ubiquitous. The devs could have at least followed the best practices already established by those folks.Despite a basic 25-year old windows interface, you can't remap a single hotkey. They think they know best for you.What's the real deal with this game?As you are fighting the game's controls instead of focused on your opponent, you can be confident that the jumbled icons on the map are meticulously replicating minuscule radar band calculations for you.To be blunt, I see a group of Harpoon modders who focus almost exclusively on milking the old Harpoon game's database with their changes. Meanwhile, they lock their database version down so that someone else can't do the same thing they did -- without working licensed/paid content through them. Their Inferno and LIVE products are proof of this strategy. Yes, you can hobble together a scenario, but only given strict areas of control and extremely limited scope... a single battle with no external influencers. When asked by a new player just a few days ago (on the Matrix forum) about modding, Sunburn (listed as a dev) responded with one line only, ""Will you pay for this?""Interesting and telling response from a group of Harpoon hackers.For $80 you should expect a lot more from a GAME you plan to play, particularly one that released beta tester created scenarios as paid content. Moments after I purchased the game, I made the mistake of pressing the Campaign button at the top of the opening menu screen. I was greeted with an advertisement to buy some more content. My verbal response to that would violate Steam's terms. I think these guys are a lot better at business development than game development.			"

												EDIT: If you see this on sale, and you liked the idea enough to check out reviews, buy the thing. Apparently, they picked the Blue Pill.Has a pretty good database of military ships, aircraft and weapons. Its cheaper than a subscription to Janes. There are a lot of decent scenarios written for this game.That all said, this is still a game, when it could be a simulator (which is how it is advertised). It cant seem to pick between game and simulator - UI that makes life harder than it has to be, which is an absolute nono for a game, then a very realistic list of units to pick from - that do not follow realistic performance or tactics, especially the aircraft.In fairness to the games developers, the game does handle ship to ship combat in the modern age, very well. Its aircraft still need a fair bit of love.This is a game that for the longest time, I held hope that there was some chance that issues would be attended to - and if they were, the game still has that potential to be a fantastic military command simulation - but there is seemingly no interest in realism for the sake of reality. For $30, this would be a fantastic game. At over 3 times that however, its simply not worth the money.EDIT - Having spent some time on the latest build of 1.07, Ive decided to revise my fair price upwards to $45. A number of very much needed improvements have been added since my last serious amount of in depth play, granting the player significantly more control over their units. All other things being equal, one thing you cannot fault the developers on is their update cycle. Comparing 1.01 and 1.07 goes to show what an update cycle SHOULD look like. Many other small developers could take note.EDIT - With 1.10, Id pay $50 for this title. Controls are better, aircraft are smarter, a host of much needed improvements. Kudos again to the devs - literally the only thing at this point making this review a not recommended is the price tag. The title still doesnt scratch the realism itch hard enough for me, but it is still an enjoyable game.			"

												CMANO is one of the greatest simulation games out there for those who are interested in military hardware. From it's seemingly endless and detailed military database to it's many scenarios that cover a period from 1945-2020 this is a military armchair generals wet dream. The game mechanics include a serious sensor/weapon gameplay in which an intricate amount of calculations are made akin to an actual military grade combat simulator. You want to see what happens when X forces attack Y area that has Z units? You will get a pretty accurate picture of how it would end up with this game.In addition the editor seems to be a endless toolbox where you can exercise your dream military engagements and even create campaigns with some effort. There is a great deal of tools like triggers, events, scores, weather, time that help you create whatever scenario you dreamt of. The editor is where most of my time went to I tested hundreds of military hardwares in different situations. To give a few examples the S400 vs F35 or DF21D vs Gerald Ford Class Carrier. Both tests ended up having very interesting results.There are some obvious downsides namely being the UI and Performance but those are not distruptive to the experience and have been improving ever since it's release with 9 big patches released so far. Kudos to the developer team for their continuous support of the product. As of the writing of this review I think the game has gotten very smooth on these two weak points.  In addition to those points I have to say out that the visual aspects of the game are weak since it features a world map but it maintains the modern Command and Control Center operator feel which is crucial.If you think the price curve is too high for CMANO go get Command: Northern Inferno it's a smaller scale CMANO that features a 1975 Cold War turning hot campaign that will teach you how to play and will give you good a taste of the game mechanics. In Conclusion I give this game 9/10.			"

												Command is one of the best games that I've played in the last several years, and has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment (note: this is not reflected in my Steam time, as I purchased it originally from Matrix). It provides a much more faithful model of modern air and naval strategy than any other game out there, vastly better than the Wargame series, and aligning with many other real sources. I don't think that there's any better simulation with both the depth and width of this.There are a few issues. The UI is very hard to get used to (and the learning curve is rather steep) - while the interface looks like Google Earth, it doesn't work anything like it, and takes some time. The keyboard shortcuts are somewhat annoying to find, and are really, really nessecary to play well. It also requires something of a powerful CPU, as I'm running on a upper-mid-level notebook i7 and can't go much past 30x time acceleration.The game certiantly is still under development. A number of features remain to be added, such as a time-on-target strike planner (what other game even needs one?) and ""surge"" air operations are forthcoming. However, the developers are very active and responsive, and the game constantly improves further. This is augmented by an extensive community of scenario creators that have done some fantastic work (I'm especially a fan of the Caribbean Crisis scenarios, where Venezuela invades the ABC islands).All in all, I would highly reccomend this game. I think that the $80 I originally paid for it was entirely worth it, and the $60 price is more than justified. While I wish that they would reduce the price further, I think that if you have even a passing interest in modern military you should spend the money.Edit: Rewrote for more completness.			"

												I know I have, at this point, only scratched the surface. Or, rather, gently rubbed at the surface, but I wish to state now that I thoroughly reccommend that you buy this game. There is one cabveat though. The price is very high. I admit this and I will say that I got it during the 50% off special sale here on Steam. I have been wanting to get CMANO since it was first released but just could not justify the cost.Anyway, what is so special? I played a game called Harpoon many years ago. I played each version as it came out. This is the spiritual successor to Harpoon. There are even the same people who were so influencial in Harpoon 2 and 3 working on this version. For example Ragnar Emsoy. What do you get for your money then?Flashy graphics with amazing 3d models of the ships and aircraft you control? NoGreat voice acting? NoGreat big explosions when your weapons hit an airfield? NoA game of such depth and interest that it will keep you playing for years? Hell yes!!!A developer who is always looking for new additions to the game? YesA developer who adds these new additions regularly? YesA developer who fixes bugs quickly? Yes!Large community who can help you get started? YesThe ability to create your own scenarios? YesThe ability to modify platforms with new weapons? YesThe maps are basic, but then this is the point of the game. You are controlling groups and platforms from a command centre. you are not looking down on the world seeing Intruders and prowlers flying over mountains. You have NTDS symbols that move across the map following your flight plan. When creating scenarios you don't just have two sides to play with. Create multiple sides with different postures between various factions. No longer red vs blue. Want red vs blue with green who are neutral to blue but also are unfriendly to red? Easy to set this up.This is not an easy game. If you want a game that you manually fly your intruder into Hanoi airspace during the Vietnam war, expect to destroy a missile park, (yeah, I've read ""flight of the Intruder"" lots!), and fly out again this is not for you. If you want to plan full alpha strikes and set up ingress and egress points yourself with iron hand missions going in first then this is for you. But this is not just a game set in the past. The platforms include the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, not yet in service. There are two databases available for the game, the cold war database and DB3000. This give you the choice of so many platforms with DB3000 giving platforms from 1980 to 2015 onwards. This is so brilliant!!!Personally I think that I may as well remove most of my other games from my downloads as they will not get played a lot now. I will stop here as I have been writing this while waiting for my Seawolf to creep around an island looking for 2 Nampo frigates that are there somewhere. :-)			"

												***WARNING! This is not a sit-down, left-click walk in the park.  I highly recommend that you first go through the tutorials.  The initial tutorials will explain almost everything you need to know.  You'll need a good full day to learn the basic controls.***NO MULTIPLAYER (yet)***WHO MIGHT LIKE THISThe type of people who purchase this game are highly military minded, geopolitical enthusiasts, and/or people who work for think-tanks in Washington, who want to play out simulated real-world scenarios of any size or scope imaginable.  Surgical strikes in Saudi Arabia via US strikes against militants? You bet.  A naval blockade by NATO forces of the Baltic Sea against Russia? Let's go.  All out war between the US Pacific Fleet, including allies such as the Phillippines against the Chinese Navy? Bring it on.***GOOGLE EARTH IS THE WHOLE MAPBasically, they've taken Google Earth, and allowed you to have free reign to setup naval and air operations ANYWHERE on the map.  And unlike Jane's Fleet Command that limited you to a certain section of the globe, the entire world is open on this game all the time.  You could launch a B2 Spirit bomber from Colorado, and send it on a sorty to the Middle East (midflight refueling points setup as well) and all the way back.  The game hosts 35 scenarios in total, with conflict dates ranging from the 1950s to modern day.  But there are many more scenarios that users have uploaded***JANE'S FLEET COMMANDIf you liked Jane's Fleet Command, you'll probably like this one too, however this game is MUCH more detailed and technical than Fleet Command ever was.  Personally, I like that it's more detailed.  Fleet Command meant you had to micro-manage all of your units, and this could get really hectic the more air assets you put into action.  In Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations, you're able to assign specific mission sets and other RoE factors for your squadrons before they ever take off and for your ships as well.  Rather than micro-managing on the fly (which you can still do, if necessary) you do all of the preparation heavy at the beginning of any operation.***VAST LIBRARY OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT, WEAPONS, EXPLANATIONS ALSO, the game comes with an absolutely amazing library of every single military piece of equipment currently declassified.  It not only lists the ships, and aircraft, but it goes down into the types of weaponry they possess and then what those weapons themselves are capable of, and what they're used for.  This library alone is worth the price.  Sure, a lot of this information may be on Google, but it hasn't been fact checked, nor is it as consilidated into one place like it is in this game.Personally, I really love this game.  It's allowed me to play out one fictional scenario I've written about in my geopolitical book, which was amazing.  It's hard for me to have any cons with the game.  It's very technical, but that's just the way it is and I'm okay with that.			"

												There's not much to say. It's simply the best modern air and naval simulator. It is a sandbox, you usually would expect from sims used by the military.The support of the (Indie-)developers is simply outstanding. Since more than two years they have continously improved the sim, adding features like Lua-scripting so that you can now even create very dynamic scenarios by yourself.Some complain about the price. They forget that you get not a usual game. The database alone is worth the money.Highly recommended for anybody interested in this genre.			"

												TL;DR, 6/10, would not buy again unless discounted, but still weirdly timeconsuming in a good way.Interesting if you liked strategy games, sandbox and military history.Much easier than expected. Huge database, but limited gameplay mechanics. It comes to life when applying mods. Unfortunately it suffers from heavy framerate issues even on modern systems(insanely bad coding, suspect no GPU usage at all) and the sound is terrible. Soundtrack crashes halfway each time so had to disable it. It is a great game if you value data over everything else. fortunately I do, but can not recommend it as it is priced far to high and the quality is sadly to low. Multiple crashes during gameplay. It is still being developed, but only attempts at bugfix. Pick it up when it comes in the discount bin (50%). Hope the developer makes a successor game with a better engine. There is so much potential with the concept.			"

												If you enjoyed Harpoon, Fleet Command etc than you'll enjoy this.. There is a LOT of depth to the game/simulation which can be intimedating there is no denying that fact. As others have mentioned look at the video's around etc before you buy to check if its your cup of tea or not. That being said there are some things that they could have done a little better.. The UI is not the best, actually I've seen real military systems with far more friendly UI and that's part of the point here.. with the amount of information/data etc that your juggling UI is important and here you either need to know every short cut key or go hunting in the menu's, that shouldn't be happening especailly not in this day and age. The other is that you'll find the music getting on your nerves fast... but that's easy enough turn it off.. Finally the Video they show is a little misleading in that even in the missions.. there is no scripted radio messages.. that come through audio.. at all, least not that I've seen.. again not a biggy but slightly misleading.All in all though I'm happy with it, But then I enjoy these styles of games..

												Pros:1 - Highly realistic wargame2 - Very detailed information about all kinds of existing and retired military hardware3 - Editor that lets you to create and execute your own scenarios4 - Ideal for hardcore military strategy gamersCons:1 - Price, *sigh*2 - Poor GUI and graphics3 - Can be overwhelming and confusing for casual strategy gamers or newbies4 - May run slow even on latest PCsThe price is ridiculously high because >Matrix Games. Naturally, this is for passionate strategy fans with great demand for realism. Even though this game focuses primarily only on naval and air control, the degree of realism is quite high.At first you can just launch some planes and order them to engage particular enemies with few buttons.... OR you can analyze characteristics and properties of your planes, naval units, their missiles, radar specifications, etc. etc. and use that to choose certain combinations of loadout and to control individual planes' movement, speed and other properties in high detail, even though without fancy graphics.The game offers a range of scenarios, both hypothetical and historical, yet it remains a tactically-oriented strategy, rather than something global like what we see from Paradox or even other Matrix Games titles. Nonetheless, if that's what you're looking for, then you found something worth your while.Lastly, performance can be an issue as the game seems to be quite demanding despite its lack of great graphics. Don't let screenshots deceive you - this game will weigh on your PC unless it's adequate enough to run some of the latest titles on ultra settings.Other than that 7/10. I'm sure there is a niche for this kind of games, and this looks like the most serious\professional strategy game ever made - a kind of game that NATO staff plays to exercise their strategic skills. As someone who studied strategy in college, I recommend it for those interested in the subject. For others? Not so much. "

												Review from a nerdy noob to nerdy noobs (not a super Navy Officer Rear Admiral 2.0)So I love overly complicated games like this. Basically, if you fill a game with numbers and data for me to interpret I'll eat out of your hand like a recovering anorexic bunny.That said, I've written a similar review for Hearts of Iron III and let me tell you that this is nothing like HOI. I mean, I pride myself on being able to grasp things quickly, but holy smokes this one is complex (I enjoy sucking and learning ways to improve my tactics via experimentation and reading the 172 page manual which is like your civilian version of Navy/AF OCS/OTS. That's what I've been trying to do but it's just a bunch of intro. You'l eventually need to do some deeper research unless you're already a Naval or Air Force officer in which case please teach me your ways).Anyways, I'll add more to this review when I learn more about this game. Just know that it's not a pretty polished game like HOI IV. Quite literally it plays like what I imagine a Navy Intel officer would see (of course I don't have a TSC so I have no clue what they actually see. Maybe aliens but the game doesn't simulate aliens for some reason. Source: Have been abducted!). Basically, you don't zoom into things smoothly. It's literally quick movements around the map. You right click where you want your camera to center (not smoothly dragging around). Not sure how realistic this is but you'll get used to it fairly quickly.Another thing to note is the way the game displays. Basically it's just a big map with a bunch of displays and buttons and stuff BUUUUT....when you click stuff these popups display (so it's not your typical fullscreen game either. It's like an application. This is good for this game though. Just understand that sometimes you might need to look at multiple displays. If you have multiple computer monitors then this will be perfect. I have two set up. One has the map at all times the other...well the other should have the systems and weapons info but instead has the damned manual because so far my main accomplishment has been getting my ships sunk (seriously Morocco kicked my♥♥♥♥♥and I'm leading the bloody Spanish Armadda...which is really just four ships and a sub but whatever. Close enough).Ultimately, if you're a super nerd who likes maps and spends their free time reading military crap or you're a super soldier who does all the Hooah stuff for 10 hours a day and wants to sit back for a nice session of hooah (or hooyah for the Navy maybe...I think?) then get this game.Seriously, though, expect to put a lot of time in to accomplish anything. I recently got this game and have thrown a few hours in and it doesn't appear that the ships I lost will be recovered...Oops. I uh...I should probably resign!			"

												It's Harpoon. If you know what that is rejoice, for you have found your home once again. If you don't know what Harpoon is, it's a naval simulator complete with submarines and aircraft carriers. This is Harpoon, but Harpoon with wings, a kick♥♥♥♥♥guitar solo and more god damned possible scenarios you can create than I'd like to even start to theorize. C:MANO has a very steep learning curve, and the graphics are basically Google Maps plus Sharpie marks, but the amount of depth and sheer intensity it manages to convey without having to do much more than make a simple canned sound is incredible. You don't know terror until you've heard the VAMPIRE alarm go off seven times in less than seven seconds as that ♥♥♥♥ing boomer you've been trying to hunt decided it's had enough of your♥♥♥♥♥♥Combine a game that probably could be sold to naval war schools (and probably *is*) with a database of military planes and weaponry from the start of the Cold War to the 2020's, and it gets even better. Add in a healthy amount of theoretical platforms such as the F-19 'Frisbee', the A-12 Avenger, a navalized F-22, stealthy anti-ship missiles, and more you can put in with the editor, and pretty much any concevible air to air battle can be portrayed by this game. Downside is the price. Get it on sale with Northern Inferno and have a blast. A nuclear depth-charge fueled blast. So satisfying.TL;DR 10/10 would cause global thermonuclear war again.  "

												Very deficient AI.Originally purchased on Matrix with many hours played before switching to Steam.Commands approach to AI is to create very scripted scenarios that provide very little in the way of replayability. Without heavy use of scripting the scenarios as well the AI is dumb as a rock. This is the only flaw I find with the game but a big one. I doubt the designers will do anything to correct this as they are really hyping the fact that they have recently released a set of tools to allow even more scripting by potential scenario designers.

												This is very heavily based on Harpoon 2/3. I still have the original Harpoon 2 command cards, and all the keys in-game are even bound to the same values. I've played a great deal of Harpoon 2 and 3, and this is Harpoon 2/3 with nothing removed, but with a lot of extra detail added. The multimonitor support is very nice too.In a nutshell, it's Harpoon 2/3, with a graphical and UI over-haul, better performance, improved sensor modelling, mobile ground units, and with rates of turn and acceleration added for aircraft and vessels.  This game is the ultimate in its genre, truly fantastic.			"

												I should start by saying that I'm a 10 year army veteran, with a solid 4 of that spent as an all-source intelligence analyst that worked on fusion database and all-source analysis systems mainly at the echelon above corps (EAC) and strategic level. That said, this is like straight up military porn. Words fail to convey just how much I love this simulator, and I call it a simulator because to call it a game would essentially be like calling GabeN an unaccomplished nobody.Seriously though, this is not a simulator for the faint of heart, or for RTS gamers looking for cutesy 3D models, explosions, and hit points. Everything, and I mean EV-ER-RY-THIN-G, is modeled in excruciating detail with extreme care and thought at every turn, from individual weapons systems to radar performance to 1970s era warships. The only thing not modeled to an insane level are ground units, and by that I mean that this is not a simulator intended to play out a second Korean ground war or the fighting in the Ukraine. But for air and naval systems, the detail and amount of control are beyond anything else I've personally seen in either a military or civilian product.Be warned, the learning curve is extremely steep, mainly because there are so many options and variables to take into account. But if that doesn't scare you, or if you happen to be a fan of the Harpoon series, then look no further because you've found the last serious air and naval combat simulator you'll ever need.I happened to catch it on sale, but I'm completely serious when saying that $80-90 is not nearly too much to ask for such a deep, serious, and versatile simulation tool. Do yourself this favor and just buy it already so that years from now you can tell your grandkids 'sit down, kiddo, and let me tell you about the best damn conflict simulator I'd ever had the privilege of seeing in my life.'TL/DR: If you like Harpoon or excruciating detail and don't care about graphics when it comes to serious military simulations, then quit reading/being a cheapskate and buy this NOW. Be warned, steep learning curve...			"

												I will preface the following with the fact that I have just started messing with this sim and there may be things I have not quite figured out or missed in the cursory reading of the manual and tutorials I have viewed. That being said I really wanted to like this game and it had been on my wish list for quite a while. From the onset it looked to combine the best of the Harpoon and Janes Fleet Command series while adding a touch of depth and realism both those simulations lacked. My overall experience in just the few hours I have been trying to wrap my head around the interface is it just the opposite.  It seems to be lacking in some crucial areas. For a game that requires one to meticulously plot out every waypoint for an air asset (lest you be condemned to micromanage and entire air war) it is quite frustrating that I cannot group aircraft and load mission sets without getting them airborne first. Basically, in a sim attempting this scope of realism I should have the ability to input an entire Op-Order broken into an individual Frag Order for each unit before they even leave the ground. Beyond that the friendly AI is absolutely stupid without the aforementioned micromanagement and the ability to adjust them on the fly is cumbersome, especially if you have multiple aircraft converging on hostile airspace. The editors claim an intuitive GUI and I hate to say that it cannot be further from the truth. A miss-click here or a fat finger there and something you have spent the last several minutes or even hours trying organize and execute takes a horrible turn for the worst. I again attribute this to the unintuitive interface and the stupid AI. To be quite honest, the designers could take a page from Falcon 4.0s real-time dynamic campaign map as the ability to edit strike packages, target sets and mission loadouts was actually quite intuitive and in many ways had the same meticulous attention to detail and threat modeling Command wishes to challenge the player with. I have yet to mess with the naval component though I am concerned I will encounter many of the frustrations I am experiencing with the air assets. I am hoping that this review is pre-mature and most of my gripes are coming from unfamiliarity as I see a lot of potential in this program and am excited to see if the developers will continue to improve on this platform but as of right now it just seems cumbersome and unpolished.

												I've been a fan of both turn-based strategy and real time strategy games based on historical military engagements played on the PC since the late 1980's, and I have to say that ""C:MANO"" is a fantasy come true. I tried playing Harpoon before, but for some reason, its user interface kept leaving me frustrated and I didn't feel immersed in my encounters because of the struggle I had with the UI. C:MANO's user interface is better, and more intuitive, and right after I bought it I was able to immediately play and enjoy a scenario without reading a document or manual. The unit/weapon database is astounding in depth and surprisingly updated. It truly is a fantasy sandbox for anyone wanting to see how a scenario involving a particular set of units would play out. I recommend this game to hard core real-time real world military simulation enthusiast who will not be turned off by the fact that the game doesn't have much ""Michael Bay"" effects in it--only serious number crunching and fantastically accurate outcomes of scenarios and engagements. Two-thumbs up.			"

												This game – an excellent Sim really – is truly splendid, but it’s not for everyone.  Command is the best Naval/Air simulator for 1945 through the near term future that you’re going to see without a security clearance (And some of the secured Sims aren’t as good either).  It’s long and fact and zero on trying to engage the user, which is as a good sim should be.  Thousands of hours and reams of accurate, expensive data have been accumulated here.  The result is something you can use to accurately sandbox real-life events in the news, and see deeply into a situation you otherwise aren’t going to see without joining the military and ramping up into Staff School.  Want to see the actual likely effects of the North Korean nuclear proliferation?  Check out why Russia feels they needed to invade Sevastopol?   See how a nuclear Iran would really look?  This is one of the best places for civilians to see this.  This sim can change your geopolitical awareness, if you use it well.On the other hand, there are no dramatic first person graphics, no embedded plots, no immersive story lines.  And if you need these, look elsewhere.The learning curve is steep, but the community support is excellent.  This game also continues to evolve, so you aren’t going to wind up with a white elephant that sits on your disk with no fixes, changes or upkeep.  Bottom line:  If you enjoy sims of this nature, this is by far the best I’ve ever seen.  And if you want something like WoW, you’re not going to find it here. "

												If you are at all interested in modern combat, weapons systems, or air/naval operations, you must buy this game. It is seriously a crime not to buy this thing when it is on sale. It includes what probably is the world's most complete database on weaponry, aircraft, radar, ships, and a number of other modern combat assets. The game is not difficult to learn at all, the mechanics are fairly straight forward and simple, where it does get complicated is strategy and implementation. If anything, it is most definitely a hard core simulation rather than a game, but the variety in the types of scenarios give a feel for operations from the tactical scale - strategic. If you are a board-wargamer or a PC wargamer and consider yourself somewhat serious about the hobby, you need to buy this, you'll not only enjoy it, you'll be about 20X more informed about modern combat assets and operations after messing with it for an hour or two. Multiplayer is being eventually added which will be fun, but the AI itself is brilliant. The scenario editor is powerful and amazing, you can try out hypothetical designs or whatever your heart desires. You basically can emulate every clancy novel with this game lol. Edit: I should mention that there arent really any graphics in this game, but who gives a ♥♥♥♥. You are talking to a guy that grew up on Dwarf Fortress.More recent edit: People complaining about the graphics are very silly to me, you could play this thing on a ♥♥♥♥ing CRT TV with windows 97 and it wouldnt make a difference, it's about NATO/DoD symbols representing real world weapons and the implications of the use of strategic force and tactical doctrine. Simply put, don't buy this game if you are more concerned about graphics than the things actually going on in game you rubes.The developers put in a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time and effort and there are huge programming hurdles to be figured out to make things work natively with whatever fancy monitor you may have, the program is primarily bought by government clients who have it modded (ARMY, NAVY, CIA etc) for their own use. Their specifications I would assume would take a higher priority than some guy on Steam.			"

												Quick review:Amazing title that takes the laurels from Harpoon. Some intense battles to be had and the number of assets available is unbelievable. The DLC are scenarious and you can have fun fighting in the Syrian Civil war and so forth and understand why somethings happen the way they do.It is a bit let down by a lackluster AI and a confusing UI. The UI in particular is ancient and not very user friendly. Even after you somewhat get used to it you will still get a bit lost.Long Form:Well, if you like games where it takes a long time to do a scenario because you have absolute freedom, you are going to love this one. You can change everything in a given scenario or create your own and have fun seeing the forces pitted against eachother. You can even play vs a friend in local coop hotseat (by running the scenario through the editor).I wouldn't call this game fun in the normal sense you usually expect in a game. You will see no images of what you are doing and what is happening. It is all abstracted to symbols. The UI is not fun either. For me, it is the worst thing about the game. It is that bad. Sure you start to get used to it but you will still struggle. Of course, tutorials and RTFM are essencial here otherwise you might get a bit lost and without a clue of why your precious ships are being torn to pieces by a rag tag force comprised of an HMG mounted on a polank of wood, some glue and an old man who has a speech impedement that makes him unable to pronounce the word turnip.Now this game is fun FOR ME and if you are like me and like to watch numbers going down on a screen and calculate hit probabilities and force comparisons (statistics) and you have a soft spot in your heart for military hardware, then by jove will you have a blast in this game!Seriously, even the UI will stop being such a hassle after a while and you will start seeing your simulations bear fruit. Mind you. This game has the mark of a truly realistic game in that when you win a scenario you are left with a feeling of bewildered disappointment as there are not loud noises and flashy colors saying ""WOOOOO!!! You are awesome. Like, literaly the best general ever on the face of the Earth!"" and you probably have no clue about what just happened in the past 3 hours while you moved your symbols about the map. You just get a white square saying ""Scenario over, now we will show you the score"". underwelming really but usually ultra realistic games like this one usually don't go about blowing your horn (future update maybe?).

												Rather complex simulation with a bit too much to do sometimes. Although you can plan a complex operation while game is paused, start the game and watch it play out; most of the time you need to tinker with things all the time. Because, no plan ever survives contact with the enemy.The whole world is at your disposal, there are ton of missions to try out and community has created even more with the really great integrated tools. There's tons and tons things to learn and consider in each mission and probably a really thick book could be written about how to play the game.There's two things that I found a challenge in the beginning: understanding how to play the game (how do I make my planes and ships do what I want them to do. And what is even possible to do in the game) and how to conduct missions (do just barge right in, maybe take a detour and use mountains as cover). Community is good and can help you with both.Price is quite high, but on the other hand, we aren't talking about game that complete in 100 hours and then ditch aside. If you can get into game, learn enough to start enjoying it and you like modern air and naval warfare, this game is good match.			"

												A small amount of time spent on this but well worth the purchase. The scenarios included in the game are solid. You can find more scenarios with a quick google search. Its worth the price because of its replayability. How? You create your own scenarios with the existing databases. Pick some countries, choose their sides, assets and play it out. Falklands part 2? Create it. Japan vs China? Create it. Save the Yazidis by inserting Marines in western Iraq? Its a scenario thats been made already. Bomb Iran as Israel or the US? Its been made. Russia vs Georgia? Its there. The scenario making is endless. The database is endless.Some complain about the UI but I have a good feeling that most of the time you'll find the military using Windows to begin with. Worth it? Absolutely. Its a classic that will only get better the more scenarios are made or when there are more flashpoints in the future.updated 12/30/16: workshop content is where to find scenarios. no need for google anymore. and lo and behold, with Libya's Sirte being a recent flashpoint, there's a Sirte scenario			"

Posted: October 20, 2015
												This is one of my top 3 favorite games. Why? Well, here are some pros and cons:+DepthThis is something inherent to any good sim. To simulate a proper environment, the game must allow one to interact with the world to a huge extent. C:MANO excels at this. You can manage aircraft loadouts from a huge variety of options, decide the speed and height/depth each unit follows. Weapons can be fired automatically, but also can be manually fired if the player prefers an exact amount. Want your units to fire more AMRAAMs at targets automatically? If so, you can tweak that with an extensive ROE/EMCON/whatnot menu. This governs a variety of things from the use of nuclear weapons and evasive manuevering to what radar/sonar/ECM profiles your units follow. This can also be set on a unit to unit basis.+EditorThis is where I spend most of my time. While the game comes with a large variety of scenarios and the ""Community Scenario Pack"" contains enough that you will never finish them all, sometimes there are places where the player wants something else. Want to have a fight between two opposing carrier groups or test that weapon system against another? Well, you can do that. While I typically prefer to make shorter, less intricate missions, there is a scripting system in place for all of your more complicated ideas.+DatabaseThis pretty much goes hand in hand with the editor. Without both, the game couldn't really thrive. Really, I am constantly surprised at how many systems are there. From supercarriers and hypothetical aircraft to obscure coast guard helicopters, the game has it. Ohh, and if it doesn't, it also has a huge weapons database. Want to give that arleigh burke a laser? Well, its pretty fun.+Active DevelopersSomething I find great about C:MANO is that, despite the release being, in my opinion, worth the money, the devs have continued to update the game, adding features that I never knew I would love.+RealismRealism is obviously going to be inherent in this type of game, but realism does not make a game great. However, when the other, above things are considered, it adds a lot of extra value. The effort they put into the ECM and Radar systems are truely astounding. It adds extra meaning when your aircraft have realistic sortie rates and your weapons have the proper ranges. It allows C:MANO to be beyond a game, and be a sim where one can learn about many technologies from the early Cold War to the near future.+-UIFrom a quick glance, it is easy to call the UI ugly and overall of poor quality. Sure, there are some things that could use improvement, but the UI is ultimately very functional. I actually like how it looks because it gives the impression of a more realistic program, something a more gamey UI could not provide.+-Learning CurveThat is one of the concerns about the game. Having a steep learning curve can be very annoying to new players and can easily scare off potential customers. However, while a difficult learning curve is hardly ideal, it is all but necessary in a game with as much depth as C:MANO. I recommend jumping in and playing one of the ""First Contact"" scenarios a few times. Sure, you will get demolished for a bit, but thats they way I figured out how to play, and I found it quite fun, slowly getting better.-Land CombatLand combat, if you couldn't tell from the game's name, is a very weak part of the game. Infantry platoons are always unable to kill anything before running out of ammo and vehicles behave in an unrealistic manner. As I have heard said before, land units in this game only exist to be targets. Another huge failure is the inability to disembark land units from landing craft, helicopters, and aircraft. Many scenario authors will teleport/create ground units to simulate this, but it is always very artificial and restricted. However, as I said before, the dev team is very active, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if land combat was fixed later.-PriceOkay, the $80 price tag is very steep. However, I absolutely believe it is worth the cost. There isn't another game like it, and it is truely a gem. Also, I would like to point out that many people spend $60 on games of *much* less quality every year.I think its also reasonable to point out that Steam Refunds exist.Anyway, I think the last thing I should point out is that C:MANO isn't for everyone. It is a very time consuming game and even some of the shorter scenarios are quite long. Even if you do have an abundance of time, any possible enjoyment could be taken away by its slow pacing or lack of visuals.Thanks for reading this, good luck with your decision-making. :)			"

												Love it! Every aspect of the game is fun. I can and do spend hours just looking through the database!I was big into older games like Harpoon until I finally came across this game.You can play scripted scenarios, or create your own in the editor. You can compare ships/aircraft/armies against eachother by simulating the battle! See if the F-22 is better than 4 Su-27s, or a US Destroyer vs Russian submarines. It has a steep learning curve, but once you get past that, the possibilities are endless			"

												Pretty cool Harpoon modernization. Be ready to read up and maybe watch some videos.A few points:This game lives and dies with it's scenarios, as everything is heavily scripted.Thus, sorting through the ton of (community-made) scenarios to find the good ones can be a chore at times.Mission editor is very powerful and makes for a nice sandbox.Limited support for high-dpi displays (4K), although this has been improving over the last few patches and is now largery playable.

												This is a real in-depth game simulating modern warfare at sea, in the air (and to some extent on the ground - as title says it is really around air and naval operations)It is is continually evolving with expanded or additional aspects. Which can be daunting to newcomers, but given time, it IS really a time-consuming exciting game.For scenario designers, use of expanding LUA-driven events gives a degree of flexibility and control, unlike similar war games.All in all, I have enjoyed this game since I first got it - in some ways it almost feels like a new game after each enhancement release :).A real successor to Harpoon (all versions), which I grew up with and spent many hours playing.

												CMANO is not for the faint of heart or someone who wants to play a quick easy game. If you want to learn about real world militaries and weapon systems (and don't mind putting in a little micromanagement work) this game is right up your alley.I like this game because it makes you want to learn about military weapon systems. You can't simply play a scenario without knowing and understanding your OOB. There are plenty of resources on the web to help you thru the game, and you will need them. Don't expect the game to hold your hand.There are several smaller scenarios that you can do before your graduate into micromanagement nirvana.When you play the scenarios, and are managing your units, you will get a great sense of accomplishment when you take out enemies. You will also get an appreciation for just how difficult war is and the logistics that go into it.After seriously playing this game you will know a lot more about war and weapons systems than before you played it.If the price seems steep there is a easier path with Northern Inferno. This will give you the best intro to the game at a less expensive price. "

												I dont really write reviews very often, but I feel I should for this. Stunning this game is just that stunning, now if you are into running around with glitzy graphics and bells and whistles (Dangerous Waters or Naval Warfare Artic Circle ) strategy games then walk on by and save yourself some cash.  However this game has endless possibilties, infact for me its not really a game, its a simulator, it allows me to simulate any situation I can dream up, I often read about a real world event (RAF tornado raids in GW1 , USN Alpha strikes against North Vietnam) then set up CMANO and fly the sortie myself again and again , working out what could have improved the mission ect ect. I even set up a sceanrio with a bolt from the blue nuclear strike against the US to figure out how likely it would be for the president to get away and the likely surving assests after a soviet first strike.  It simply gives you that level of fiedelty and control. It keeps getting better as well, the developers release periodic updates with new missions , weapons and refinements to the game play, they are happy and eager to take suggestions from users on how to improve the game as well and serveral suggestions have been incorporated into updates.It is pricely I grant you, but the replayabilty of the game does make it worth the high tag.

												I want to be able to recommend this game for its gameplay but can't because it is so buggy and its user experience is beyond awful.I love the concept. Command is a game that gives you:- Complex strategic pictures to play with (while you concentrate on supporting that Marines deployment in Tripoli, are you not forgetting the long-range aviation threat over Albania, or the Soviet naval group steaming past Crete?);- Lots of uncertainty that creates nail-biting action (there is nothing quite like the panic that comes from detecting a submarine already in torpedo range of your carrier group, or a stream of anti-ship missiles headed your way from a direction you were ""sure"" there were no enemy forces);- A real sense of achievement (OK, beating that final boss in that other game is rewarding, but nothing like saving Iceland from a Soviet invasion without losing any major ship).Command is not a beautiful game. It's basically coloured dots slowly moving across maps. As far as I'm concerned, that's how it should be; like chess. Other naval strategy games try to look nice, but fancy graphics only distract from the gameplay. So, kudos for that. Still, I would have liked the game to do some storytelling. For example, when you end a scenario, you're given a prompt: ""this scenario has concluded, you will be presented with an evaluation"". It's quite a let-down after a large battle. I understand it's supposed to be a simulation game, but I still feel it doesn't do justice to the sunken ships, thousands of people who lost their lives, perhaps the nations that rose or fell that day.However, the real issue with this game, and the reason why I can't recommend it, is its programming. It's ridiculously buggy. I don't finish most games because the non-stop stream of bugs and unexplained slowdowns and ""pauses"" frustrate me too much. It isn't helped by a user interface that's by far the worst of any program I own. Simple actions require dozens of clicks, everything is confusing, key information is hidden in remote menus, mission planning, which should limit the need for micro-management, ends up creating death-traps for beyond-stupid “AI” units... it's a joke. I wish the (obviously amateurish) developers would hire real software engineering and user experience experts to fix the game and give it its real potential.			"

												""steep"" doesn't come close to describing the learning curve for this game.  Before purchasing, I recommend looking at the tutorial play through on Youtube.  I hoped that my Harpoon experience from years ago would get me off to a good start - wrong!I do not have the monastic discipline required to master this realistic simulation, nor do I want to do nothing else with my gaming life - and that's what playing this well wouild require.For those who love this game - hats off.  For me, no thanks.			"

												Well i wont get into immense detail but quite simply if you have any interest in air/naval warfare you need to buy this game/sim. Its' fantastic and it now has the second most amount of hours played on a game in my library and i have many games. The amount of depth is staggering, the detail on a huge database of aircraft/surface ships/submarines/SAM systems plus loads more and loads of weapons and sensors accurately modelled to how they work in the real world.With so many scenarios created by the community and continue to get created, steam workshop support, active devs that constantly update and improve the game is fantastic. An example of this is the most recent update which enables waypoints for cruise missiles, weight dependant aircraft kinematics and electronic warfare improvements to name just a few of the improvements in the latest patch, along with a host of database additions. Its worthy of its price tag but just be aware that it may consume many hours of your life and if you have a girlfriend or wife, say bye to her lol.10/10			"

												Ever wanted your own naval ops command center? Look no further my friends. The breadth and depth of this title is staggering, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is pretty much a sim I've always wanted my entire life and I didn't know it till now. But be warned, this is not for the feint of heart. If Paradox grand strategy games or Ageod and HPS wargames are too much for you to handle, this is certainly not for you. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of those titles and want to take it up another notch (or three!) give this sim a look. If you have ever played the classic Harpoon series, you already have a good idea of what you're in for. Highly reccomended for the veteran Grognards as well as new people willing to learn and be patient. This is a massive, realistic, and complex sim with a bit of commitment (lots of reading) necessary to undertake. Are you up for the challenge?			"

If you have an interest in the technology of war, you will find no better tool for education. Watch some you tube videos first to see if its your cup of tea. The developers of this sim never stop developing it so it is always getting better to use.  Highly recommended.			"

												I think I made a mistake in buying this game.  It looked interesting and looked like it would be fun, but so far it is just too overwhelming and much too complicated to appreciate.  I may come to love it, but I'll most likely give up on it and go on to something a bit easier to grasp.  I find the gameplay isn't very intutive.  The UI seems antiquated and hard to manage.  I could see this game possibly being fun once you learned all the nuances of it, but that WILL take some time.  I think for casual gamers this isn't a good match.  I prefer games like war games like Hearts of Iron, Supreme Ruler and the ilk.  This game is not like those except in the broadest terms.  Those games have some complexity, but they aren't too difficult to figure out... they are intutive, for the most part, this game on the other hand is not.  My opinion may change if I ever take the time to get a complete understanding of it, but at present that seems a daunting task.  I think the game has a lot of potential and I love the specifics, details and all the minutiae the game provides, but I think the UI ruins the game.  The tutorials aren't very good and the graphics need updating.  I normally don't care too much about graphics, but this game seems to be lacking them almost altogether.  The price of the game is too high in my opinion.  I think the game is so high because of all the research involved.  Having a large database is nice, but I think the first goal should be playability.  The playability for this game is woefully lacking.  I wish I could trade this game in for another... they make a game that I think I would enjoy much more (War in the East).  I wish they would have offerred this for a free weekend so I could try it first... I bought it on sale for $59.99 (normally $79.99) and can already tell that it really isn't a game for me... and have only put in a couple hours or so.  I'm posting this review so others are forewarned, it's not what you MIGHT expect!  I thought it would be amazing considering the price and what I got was lackluster at best.  The game isn't horrible, but way over-priced for the casual gamer.  I think they are targeting a particular type of player and since they have basically no or little competition they can charge a lot for what they offer... so if you never played Harpoon or aren't a military junkie I would recommend giving this a pass.  They need to offer this for a free trial weekend, but I don't think they will.  They probably are afraid that if they did they would lose more customers that might give it a try when it was on sale (like me) than they would gain from those interested enough to purchase after a trial weekend.Hopefully, I can get some enjoyment out of it... eventually.

ENG:If you ever played Harpoon Series and/or Jane's Fleet Command and if you're interested in tactical/operational sims where you have full control over air and naval units, based on Cold War and/or Modern Era this sim is for you.Pretty easy to start if you have similar games experience.Built In Scenario Editor gives you possibility to create almost any scenario you want, from fully historical authentic to absolutely fictional operation.In-game tools provide you with very detailed control on whole operation phases.Every unit is worked out in details, every ship has its own, modeled in real time, system - which can be controlled by crew(AI) according to RoE or by yourself.Simulator provide player in real time detailed environment log, where you can check - when, who and what did.You can plan and execute small scale operation (ex.:Israeli air raid on terrorists HQ in Tunisia) or you can be in change of the whole Desert Storm operation.Really like it and looking forward for multiplayer addon.RUS:Если вы играли в серии игр Harpoon и/или Jane's Fleet Command и если вы заинтересованы в симуляторах тактического/оперативного типа охватывающих период Холодной Войны и/или Современных операций, где имеете полный контроль над воздухом и водой - этот сим для вас. Довольно легко начать, если у вас есть опыт в похожих играх. Встроенный редактор сценариев дает возможность создать почти любой сценарий который вы пожелайте, - от полностью исторически аутентичного до абсолютно вымышленного боестолкновения. Внутриигровые инструменты дают вам возможно полного контроля на всех этапах операции. Каждый юнит спроектирован в деталях, каждый корабль имеет свои собственные моделируемые в реалтайме системы - которыvb может управлять сам экипаж(АИ) в соответствии с RoE или-же вы можете это делать самостоятельно. Симулятор обеспечивает игрока журнал событий в реальном времени, где вы можете проверить - когда, кто и что делал. Вы можете планировать и осуществлять маломасштабное операции(Например: Израильский авианалет на штаб террористов в Тунисе или вы можете встать во главе операции - ""Буря в пустыне"".Очень нравится и с нетерпением жду аддона с мультиплеером.

												Command: Modern Air/ Naval Operations is a text based 2D global strategic Cold War-Modern military RTS based around air, ground and naval operations. The game allows total control of land, air and naval assets from changing atltiute to turning on ECM jammers to firing all weapons. This game is one of its kind due to the sheer amount of content (at least 10,000+ units 5000+ weapons), replayablity (30+ standard missions, 60+ community missions and an in game mission editor) and total control from a tactical to strategic scale. Pros:Sheer amount of contentSheer amount of replayabilityGood AIRequires a lot of micro which is wanted out of a game like thisCons:Very poor UI; hard to tell which unit is which Steep learning curve for those not a familiar with modern military equipment.

												CMANO is a very deep sim without any flashy graphics. Expect a tremendous learning curve if you know nothing or little about the numerous platforms, weapon systems and sensors depicted in this game. The in-game database shows detailed informations about every single system/weapon/sensor though.The price looks relatively high, but it really isn't. The replay value is endless, it has a very good mission editor, tons of custom missions, and the devs are very committed, they constantly update it with new features.Old Harpooners should buy this without thinking twice, it's way better than Harpoon3.

All very carefully researched and detailed.2. Quite realistic behavior of different vehicles and systems.3. Great variety of different scenarios, thanks to a thriving community. You can fight nearly everywhere from 1940s to the near future.4. Great scenario editor. 5. I like the graphics. They feel like commander's display. I genuinely prefer it to 3D graphics.6. Devs are still adding new features and the game is nicely supported.7. Stability - crashes are very rare, although do happen. Cons:1. Lack of ground combat. 2. Lack of true amphibious operations, although you can make them using scripts. 3. No downed pilots except for those created by scripts. Anyway, done with the nitpicking. This game is really good.			"

												The more you play it, the more you'll come to like it. It's a great game/sim for those interested as to how x scenario may go down in the real world or for those who simply want to play a simulator involving air and naval combat from a commanders point of view. (Ground based combat is pretty crude and feels like its there just for the sake of been there)At first when you load up a scenario/mission, you'll just stuff around and work out how to do what and when and why. Maybe pop open your browser in the middle of it a couple of times and search the forums to figure some things out, but if you persist you'll find its an enjoyable experience even if your not heavily into simulators of this sort, simply due to the depth and vairability the same scenario can have even with slightest of vairations in your actions. 1 scenario can play out 100 different ways. You can play it for an hour and only feel like 5 or 10 minutes have passed. If you want a game you can play when its raining outside and the internet is down (as is often the case for myself), or when you've simply got time to spare and want to play a game that is something different this will hit the spot. :)			"

Posted: January 3, 2015
												So, i was not sure about this game, at first. I did not want to shell out the considerable price for a game i would not use. Granted i have not played much, but thats not for a lack of wanting to. Normally i get bored easily with RTS type games. They just get too samey for me, for various reasons.But, as is obvious, i took the plunge. I had read and seen enough to warrant a gamble.I did not regret my choice...This is not what i would call an RTS (even though it is, sort of). There is a complexity to it that makes it interesting. I cannot just pick this game up and win instantly, by spamming units and just overwhelming the opponent. I have to work with what i have got. Also, i need to really know about the unit/s i am commanding. I need to know what they have in regards to all manner of things ranging from weapons to sensors. I need to think before i attack. Tactics. Real tactics. Guns blazing often gets you killed. And then there are things such as creating missions in a scenario. Instead of just directing my units by clicking on a spot on the map and hoping i find something i can set search patterns, or direct units to patrol. and the AI will actually do it without completely messing up by expecting me to babysit them all the time. Another refreshing thing is the combat itself. The best thing i can compare it to is a tabletop wargame. It essentially rolls a virtual dice, in the background, for hits and misses, with modifiers that influence the outcome, of course. To me that represents something that some RTS's are missing, and thats individual skill. A bit like the UFO games with the people in your unit having their own skill sets. For me, though, the icing on the cake is the scenario editor. I can create so much. I have recreated the Falklands War. I created WW3 I even created small scenarios such as pirate hunting. This is all done because there are so many tools at your disposal.Now, i know a lot of RTS's have mission editors. But not to this extent. At least none that i have played.I love naval combat. So this filled a niche that was missing in my game library. Dont get me wrong, the air combat is just as good. But i have a history of family members who were Royal Navy. So there is a bit of bias. I always loved hearing about tactics and ship types and so on...Which brings me to another point, that may seem odd to some people but others may be able to relate to: I am unable to serve in any of the armed forces. But if i could i would. This provides me a small amount of satisfaction in that i can at least play act, in a way, i can feel like i am commanding a ship in battle or a wing of Air Force jets. Something no RTS has ever given me.Anyway, i could go on and on about this game.It is a great milsim. Dont let the price put you off, its dear for a good reason. You are not buying a game that you will forget next week when the next AAA title comes out. Its something that will make you come back for more. Understamd, though, this game has a steep learning curve, and i urge you to read the manual that is available in the Forums section of the CMANO community. It helped me a lot. And also Youtube is your friend. "

												Ok, let’s put this first, there is a HUGE learning curve for this game, it takes a few hours of experimenting to understand the interface and commands, it is not innately straightforward like fleet command, but it is not impossible and makes more sense after a while  I already mentioned fleet command, and I do think this game a ok replacement for it, for this review, I am assuming you were someone that liked that game or something very similar and wants to replace it as fleet command won’t run for me anymore and lacks newer units, but fleet command had more missions and a more straightforward and user friendly mission editor, although more limitedI do miss the image screen from fleet command, you will probably get over that and it allows the game to support a lot more unitsBut, at the moment it is not worth 80$, although it can be in if it is improved (I believe it is still being changed as there is the interface for things in the game that can’t be done yet), mostly it needs more missions, so making it easier to make them would improve the value quicklyFirst off, the editor needs to be way better some things that would help are:•	Options to restrict choices in the list to a time period•	Select by unit class, so I can have it list all minelayer or carriers, this would make it easier to assemble fleets•	Land facility generator: it would have you put numbers of buildings and then arrange them around a point on the map, this would make airbases easier to make but still attackable (although there is another way to fix this, but it is not for the editor)•	Options to add all of a layout to a carrier magazine, so add 10000 would♥♥♥♥♥10000 of each weapon that was on the layout once, so a 2 sidewinder 2 sparrow layout would add 20000 of each if the button was clicked •	Options to add custom layouts for aircraft, like putting Russian missiles on a f-16 that was owned by a different country •	Custom unit editor, this is possible without speed changes, but it is hard, especially if you want more than one(long live the battle-plane) •	Also, a custom weapon editor, these could be attached as a separate part of the scenario and added to the database when it was loaded, and removed when you are done(or it could just be a workshop file, but then people may get a scenario without the unit)•	And a  custom sensor editor it is really annoying to look up a table of ranges when adding a sensor to a unit, you see the “AN/asp ###”and have no idea what it really does, it would help if you could make you own and specify its range and effectiveness, and name it something else(this also would be helpful in missions as you can ID by what radar they use)•	Create unit event, as you can teleport a unit for landings, but there is no easy script to land troops form planes, at it seems odd to put the unit in Antarctica so you don’t see it•	Hidden event triggers, as when I get a message on the log saying “Iranian task force 51 attack”, it kinds of gives me early warning you would not have  Also, some editor features I would like, but are minor things that only a small group of people would be interested in/hard to codeFictional land masses or being able to scale the world, like having the earth being 5 times the size if you wanted to do a WW2 with today’s weapons, and not change everything in the battle, as the battle of midway would be way different if both sides radars on EVERY planei have a bunch more possible impovements, but i seccond guessed this as a review, so it will be more reviewy			"

												It has an extremely sharp learning curve, as much as I love these kind of simulators and have a real interest in modern defence systems I was still very frustrated starting out.Once you get used to plotting the missions, fiddling with the settings etc the only limit is your imagination, as cheesey as that sounds.Want to send an Indian carrier against a Chinese carrier? Do it. How about a nuclear B-2 raid against Russia? Get on it. Plus it's on offer right now!			"

Rarely is a game so deep that you feel like you are drowning in the stuff even after getting through the tutorials.  It also happens to be fun if you have even a single vein of war/military nerd in you.Do 3AM tv military documentaries put your to sleep or wake you up?

												It's complex and intricate with extremely detailed realism and a lot of content. The only thing that is not the best is the UI but you can learn to live with it after a while. This game will require a lot of time and effort for even a simple scenario, since you have to be extremely careful and expect the unexpected, which gives you a very definite sense of realism, since you are constantly devoid of information and practically scared for the lives of your men or the destruction of your units. It's as well a very hard game but then again success in the game is very rewarding.			"

												I  have been despondent since the demise of Harpoon. I am an ex-submeriner from the cold war era. I purchased the Command, Northern Inferno package to see if it was comparable in realism to Harpoon. It took one scenario to see that it was far more advanced and realistic. I immediately bought the main Command Naval wargame. If you are a naval historian or inthusiest this is a gamers wet dream. Even if you dont play the game, the data base is worth many times the cost of the simulator. James Warships and weapons references are all here for the relevant time envelope. The very best feature in this simulator is that there are no built in rules. outcomes are entirely dependant on your imagination and the platform capabilities. You can develop very advanced tactics with only practical limitations. I can truly recommend this product for serious naval war fans.			"

												Calling this game a ""hardcore"" military simulator is underestimating the scope and difficulty of this game. This is less the nice, clean cookie-cutter American hardcore where everyone is smiling and having fun and more ""A Siberian Movie.""This isn't so much a game and more the civilian version of a teaching aide a military academy might use to train naval officers. (And I believe it is exactly that because I've heard the British Royal Navy uses a special version in the classrooms.) yes the price is high (and like an idiot I bought it at full price) but it goes on sale often and, again, it's not really a game but a teaching tool for military tactics.Command is the spiritual decendant of the game Harpoon, which I played on paper with dice on my friend's living room floor because his house was bigger and we could lay out the scenario properly. Harpoon was developed by Larry Bond, a US Naval Academy instructor, friend and co-author of Tom Clancy and author of a few technothrillers himself.The computer version was a brick wall of complexity. Command is more like that meme about the learning curve of Eve Online where it turns into a cliff with bodies piled up at the bottom, people crucified at the top and bulldozers pushing more over the side. Make one mistake in the first ten minutes and you could lose a four hour scenario.			"

												Steep learning curve; may be complex to some while an ""easy"" game to enthusiasts. Not your average simulation/war game. I like the user interface (UI) and the detail on the game. If you are the type who lets the game continue without hitting ""stop/pause"" on the game, then you spend most of your time planning.If you are patient on learning the mechanics and or a military/modern war enthusiast, then buy this game. If not, then skip this game.The price says it all. This game is for the niche market of the gaming community.FYI: I have not played this game to the fullest as everyone can see in the hours played. Have played the tutorial though.			"

												In my opinion this is one of the best naval/air battle simulator that you can get on the marketIt has a ginormous database that includes all the ships, aircrafts, weapons, sensors, submarines, and missiles ranging from the beginning of the cold war to modern day.  If you like the Harpoon series, this would be a no brainer.There are a lot of scenarios made by the community and if you want to, you can easily make your own.Some features that this game lacks:Official Multiplayer, but there is a PBEM multiplayer called Joint CommandGround battle, not that important cuz this is a air/naval simulation but would still be nice if there is a more detailed ground battle system so that close air support can be simulatedIn conclusion this would be the best game ever if you are a fan of military simulatorsIt might take a while to get used to it, but once you start playing, you wouldn't stopSome useful links:Baloogan's wiki: good for finding historical info and unit database, also incluces tutorialhttps://wiki.baloogancampaign.com/index.php/Main_Page cmano-db: fantastic site for unit comparison http://cmano-db.com/ "

												Don't be put off by the incredible complexity of the simulation - I would heartily recommend this game to anyone with any interest in the subject matter. Even if, like myself, you don't have the time or mental energy to devote to the larger scenarios, there are plenty of smaller scenarios that will provide hours of enjoyment without making your brain explode. The database and editor alone are worth the price of admission. A mind-boggling amount of research has gone into this amazing game, and it is constantly being improved. Nothing else comes close, at least nothing that's available to civilians.			"

												I have only started playing the expansion Northern Inferno (so more hours recorded there) before I look at the scenarios in the main game but so far it is excellent. Very complicated and deep, after playing sub command but never playing games like Harpoon, this is something I have wanted for a long time since it was in development and called Red Pill. I decided to take the plunge at christmas and get this. Interesting and totally rewarding when you get it right.  Hopefully it will keep getting better with future dlc.The only thing I would like is more sounds for when selecting the controlled unit when for instance a  a sub so it feels like being underwater with dynamic and accurate (hearing the noise of the detected ships props etc - I reference the experience from sub command) passive and active radar sounds when you are engaged in conrolling it.

												This piece of software constantly astounds me. The first time I opened it up: I was not impressed. The graphics were dated.  The start menu was a popup, Windows dialogue style. However, once I started playing, I appreciated this simulator.You can model anything that involves aircraft and naval warfare. The databse is absolutely enormous and contains pretty much every parameter. The new update will factor in such things as *drag* on fuel burn for aircraft. More and more, I move away from the prebuilt scenarios to making my own. As an example, I set up a Russian strike in the 70s against the UK and modelled just how far away the Bears were detected coming over the horizon. Want to see how a Saudi Patriot air defense system fares against a Yemeni raid? You can do it all. The devs are committed, releasing regular updates and improvements.Yes, there is a steep learning curve. Yes, the graphics aren't that great. But I guarantee you will spend hours watching your screen with bated breath as you try and ease a submarine around a carrier group and watch your MIRVs launch and each warhead land in turn.			"

												I've played Command for a few hours (Steam didn't record the time for some reason, probably because I was offline while playing..?). Anyway I played the three tutorial missions (air, sub, surface) and enjoyed them. Then I played through a scenario set in Somalia where I had to protect some crash site for six hours (""Raven 21 is down""), and my experience was not good.To sum it up, the interface is fairly terrible, the AI is very poor, and the game (at least the scenario I played) seems quite easy. Setting up ""patrols"" results in your AI unloading all their weapons at a crazy pace, so the game becomes a very slow, long exercise in micro-management. Anything related to land units seems broken - I had Chinooks with USMC dudes but I couldn't figure out how to unload them. The enemy had a Brigade of tanks and they drove off to the wrong side of the map rather than attack my two squads of SEALS. Enemy vessels just cruise into you - they unload a few missiles, then just keep on charging even though they have no weapons, right into my fleet of 7 US ships... who mightily screwed them up.Overall I think Janes Fleet Command is still a much better game, this new one is more detailed (adjusting weapon load outs etc) but it's just not that much fun, at least for me.When the game was over (after I had protected the crash site as directed and pretty much killed everything Soviet) the game gave me a score of zero - ""average"". Highly annoying after maybe 2 hours of playing the one scenario.So fairly disappointing overall. Maybe there are some gold scenarios that are much better, but so far I'm unimpressed. Also the game seems to run very poorly (laggy interface) on a brand new Razer Blade. On my desktop it crashes regularly. Steer clear of this game is my recommendation.			"

												Like many here I thought that my experience with Harpoon would help with the learning curve.  It won't didn't doesn't.  That being said, so far I've fumbled my way through some pretty enjoyable gameplay.  My criticisms are just from the short time that I've played.  #1  Some of the settings have to be reset, every time you fire CMANO up.  That's just beyond ridiculous.  #2 There is ONE song (if you can call it that) that plays over, and over, and over........................  Now, I like the atmosphere that some good music can provide in games.  How you can charge $80 for a game, and not provide at least a short play list, is mind boggling.  Heck, you could probably find some players that would do it for free.  I would be surprised if any gamers have the music playing, unless they're mad, having been driven mad by the ""music"" in game.  #3  The interface is one of the most non-intuitive I've seen, and that's saying something.  #4  You can add custom map overlays and that's pretty cool, but, you have to re-enable every time you load the game.  #5  Sound effects are repetitive (just like the so-called music) and there really is no variety.  They're all annoying because there are so few.  None so bad as the gun fire and resulting ricochet, that would be funny, if it weren't so quickly annoying.  #6  A little too much micro-managing required.  Maybe there are some options I haven't discovered yet, but, it's pretty annoying.  It's difficult to discover everything that needs micromanaging, but, you know you've left something off the list, when you start getting messages about aircraft that are crashing because they've run out of F'ing fuel.  A certain amount of common sense autonomy from the AI would be a huge help.  #7  I know this game is all about the strategy/gameplay, but FFS, how bout throwing a graphical bone.  I know this isn't Harpoon, but, for instance when launching a cruise missile, Harpoon would pop up a little video showing the launch, and if it was at night, it would show a night launch.  You could have check boxes to enable/disable it, if it got annoying.  What I would like about it, is that I'd have a visual cue as to what was taking place, rather than having to read that fine print message screen that's scrolling by way too fast.  Yes, I know I could slow time down or pause, but, if I had the visual cue, I wouldn't have to.  #8  There are plenty of quircks and oddities that I will just have to get over, but, some more polish would be nice.I've been doggedly determined to not give up on CMANO, (took me about 2 days, just to get it to run) and to really try to learn it.  If you don't have the patience or the desire, then I wouldn't recommend CMANO.  If you liked Harpoon, you can find enjoyment with CMANO, but, you'll have to be willing to re-learn.  I got it on sale, and for $20 or $30, it's pretty nice, at $80?  I'm not sure I'd be real happy.  But, that's just my 2 cents.Edit:  UpdateJust wanted to add to my review after more time with it, and plenty of time to cool off after my struggles to get it running.  Addicting, is the word that comes to mind.  I've had a tough time over the last few years feeling like sticking with a game for a while.  Usually I play for a while, and let it go, because it just can't hold my attention.  I had been waiting for Hearts of Iron 4 to go on sale, and it did about a week after I got Command. (For which I had also been waiting on a sale)  Well, about 4 times now, I've opened up HOI thinking I'd give it a look.  That's all I've given it.  I open it, and think, ""this looks like a game, let me get back to reality"", and then I go back into Command.  I easily overcome my own gripes about CMANO, and let the hours go by.  Don't pay any attention to my hours played.  I ofen just leave it up in the background, and a couple of times overnight.The music thing is minor.			"

												Maybe a little late, but here is an extract from C:MANO FAQ about the speed treshold of 925 kt.Warplanes never fly at their theoretic maximum speeds operationally. Over a fighter aircraft’s 6000-8000hrs life span, less than 10% is spent at supersonic speeds. Most airframes will never even go beyond Mach 2, and certainly not while flying a combat sortie. Aircraft use a lot of fuel accelerating and maintaining those speeds, and going beyond 925kt (Mach 1.6) offers no real tactical advantages and may even be impossible simply due to the long time it takes to accelerate to those speeds and the insane amounts of fuel needed to get there. Furthermore, in many cases getting to those speeds will be physically impossible due to weapon and drop tank drag, weapon release envelope limitations, and the possibility of damaging or even detonating external stores. For instance, the special 500kg bombs carried by the MiG-25 recon/bomber variant were given a thermal protection coating to prevent the explosives from over-heating at Mach 2.35.And let us not forget that ejection at high speeds is extremely dangerous. For most ejection seats, the chance of survival drops dramatically above 600kt or ca Mach 1.0. Even if the pilot survives he is likely seriously injured and may be grounded for good. So although the airframe and engines can push it to Mach 2.0 and beyond, the pilot simply won’t. Especially not in a shooting war.Command takes aim at simulating a modern battlefield and therefore uses practical operational aircraft speed limitations. Theoretical specs are left out. That means most modern combat aircraft will not fly faster than Mach 1.6 in the simulator. The fuel burn rates are adjusted accordingly, and for example the F-14D Tomcat can fly 230nm Deck Launched Intercept (DLI) missions at Mach 1.6 dash. There are of course numerous exceptions and fighters like F-22A Raptor, MiG-25 Foxbat and MiG-31 Foxhound can easily fly faster. The same goes for aircraft like the SR-71 which can cruise at Mach 3.2. The MiG-25/31 series can perform intercepts at speeds up to Mach 2.35 in the simulator, and F-111s can do an amazing 800kt dash on target at sea level for delivering iron bombs. F-104 Starfighters and English Electric Lightnings have a 1150kt TAS (Mach 2.0) maximum speed to reflect their unique capabilities.			"

												The price might turn down a lot of people, all I can say is that the possibilities that this game/software/simulator provide are endless when it comes to recreating any air/ground/naval scenario. Maybe the ground part is not as detailed or complete as the air/naval one, but you still get lots of units With that said, the performance of the units isn't 100% realistic, but it is close. For example afterburner capable aircraft can only reach 950 knots, when some of those in real life can reach higher speeds. Also you need to know that this uses a lot of CPU and can get ""laggy"" in very huge scenarios.Now, some good things, there are tons of free community made scenarios. There are a lot of databases. It's in active development. There are plugins/mods that allow turn based multiplayer.  I like to play it with a plugin called SeaHag that reads the messages out loud using either the default windows voice or any other commercial ones. That way it is more immersive, it's like having an assistant, and I don't have to be constantly checking the screen(I don't use to accelerate time)			"

												Built on the detailed database core of the old Harpoon series, this is certainly aimed at the serious gamer in modern warfare simulation.  As is true in modern warfare command, the game is experienced through detailed messages and digital map information provided by selected active and passive sensors.  Response, reaction, planning, and dealing with the ongoing fog of war make this real enough to be used by many current and retired professionals.  For those looking for high-quality graphics of actual combat, the Command: Modern Air / Navel Operations is certain to be a disappointment.  The real place the game is experienced is in the mind of the player.  And, like genuine warfare, it can unfold slowly and be tedious, only to suddenly hit the player with an unmanageable number of unexpected twists and turns.  Meticulously detailed to reflect actual tactical and platform abilities and limitations for warfare dating from the early 1950s into the near-future, the game includes numerous scenarios that can be played at a variety of realism levels.  Each can also be edited (allowing you to answer questions like, ""Say, what if we would have had a Aegis class back in the era of the Vietnam war?"").  The strength of this game is ""under the hood,"" is modeling aspects of real-world warfare as close as it can get without violating national security.			"

												I REALLY hate to give this game a negative review. I bought it full price about a year ago, I consistently go back and play it as you can see from my hours. The reason I go back to it is because I have not found another game like this out there. The amount of content and sheer size of this game is massive. Why the negative review? The reason ""I consistently go back and play it"" and don't continuosly play it is because it is EXTREMELY UNSTABLE and I can only take crashing so much before I move back to my other stable games. I literally crash every time I play in one way or another. The tech support is great and the community is very helpful and loyal, but that only goes so far and doesn't fix all the bugs. Editing missions is almost impossible if you want to work at a modern pace, if you try to work efficiently you will have problems. Playing the missions/campaigns at even 5x speed will cause issues as well. I will continue to go back and play especially when there are updates to see if things change and would love nothing more than to change my review to a huge thumbs up, but for now it's a no go for me. I wrote this review right after spending the day making a mission and I just had to stop and write this. Frustrating because it could be so good. Not worth the money in it's current state. I think it's time to move on to a new game engine and a new Command title. It doesn't seem to be made to run on modern PCs.My PC Specs:Windows 10 x64i7 4790K16GB 2400mhz RAM480GB Sandisk Ultra II SSD(2 SLI) EVGA Nvidia GTX970 SSCs			"

												This software does not properly support resolutions above 1080p, and has DPI settings issues if your DPI is set to above 100%.The developers have known about this since at least June of 2016, and promised a fix then that has not materialized. They did post a work  around, and I guess that was good enough for them, but it means you as a user have to make their software work on your hardware - ridiculous, for something that sells for $80 without a sale. At that kind of premium price point I think it is fair to expect they will fix their known issues.While it is incredibly compelling and I have had my eye on it for a year or so now, shame on me for not ensuring that it would play nice with my 1440p monitor. If you use a 1080p or below screen, this is maybe the most thorough modern warfare combined arms simulator I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I do recommend it if you don't mind that the developers promise fixes they don't provide - but I personally, between my screen incompatibility and knowing the developers know this is an issue and apparently don't care am turned off. I don't know about you but I don't enjoy feeling like someone is trying to mislead me - and telling your customers you are going to fix something that you don't is a special kind of dishonest.I have no issue with the complexity, which I think other reviewers have overstated somewhat, but I've been playing old-school wargames for long enough that this isn't too hard to grasp. Even if you don't have any experience, the reviews saying you simply must be prior service or have extensive knowledge of the systems represented here are wrong. Anyone can learn this and enjoy it if they have an interest in it. You may need to watch some tutorials and it may take a few hours to understand the different doctrines behind various types of engagements, but the AI is quite capable. You can find videos of people winning scenarios and using as little manual control as possible - you just don't need to know to the functional ranges of the AIM-54 vs. the AIM-120 to get that they are missiles that you can use against air targets. You don't need to know the fuel consumption rate of an F-15C in full burn to know that you can use it to fight other planes. The game will tell you everything and anything you need to know about each unit and its constituent systems.Don't let the elitist chest-thumping scare you off. I would love to play this at a future date, should the developers ever bring it up to speed with modern hardware. Back to the watchlist it goes.			"

												A game so good that I bought it after... aquiring it by other means first. If you have any interest in ""big picture"" operations where you would like to control the flow of the whole battlefield rather than one or a handful of units, then this game is for you. Don't let the graphics fool you, there is so much going on under the hood of this game that if it had fancy 3D graphics, no computer would be able to run it. It is incredibly realistic, incredibly complex, and if those two descriptions don't scare you, then do yourself a favor and give it a try!			"

												First things first, I would say that CMA/NO sits right on the line separating what is a game from what is purely a simulator, and that should be taken into account for anyone considering purchasing it. Secondly, yes, it's $80, I got it for 60% off and it is commonly at least half-off during major steamwide sales. As with any game, I would recommend it be bought on sale.   One common concern about CMANO is bugs, which frankly I have experienced very few of, I would say around 1/100 of the scenarios in game that I have edited/created have wound up bugged and/or corrupted beyond fixing. In my own experience with the program I would not list bugs as a major problem, although of course I cannot speak for everyone  The program takes an enormous database of weapons platforms, systems, sensors, etc, and models at the very least a rough approximation of their publicly known capabilities, takes a range of variables, and rolls the dice regarding how these systems successfully or unsuccessfully function in whatever scenario they are being used in, (ex, It determines whether or not a surface-to-air missile successfully hits its target, is spoofed by countermeasures, or simply misses). This sort of dice-rolling (literally called that in the program) is an issue for some (primarily concerned about just how ""realistic"" the results of this actually are) and is often combined with concerns about the limitations of the scripting in-game. These concerns and complaints are completely valid, although I implore anyone to find a program at the scale and complexity of CMANO that is wholly open ended and with all possible variables as seems to be desired that can be acquired without a government license for a price tag under $200.------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DRPros:A simulator without easily accesible peer, and the only of its kind availiable on steam.An absolute dream for those desiring and/or interested in this kind of simulatorOn sale during the major sale cycles on SteamStill actively updated, particularly the database, but---->Cons:Expensive, clearly.No free demoBugs may be an issue for youAlthough I don't take issue with it, the UI simply sucks. <----any new major features are probably going to be DLC (as is sadly expected of most games nowadays)Meh:Performance (Framerate) isn't a steadily flowing creek, and probably won't be regardless of your specs, if this is a problem for you, its a Con, if not, it isn't.Enormous learning curve, some hate em, some like the challenge, I am one of the latter. ----------------------------------------All in all, I enjoy it very much, haven't bought the LIVE DLC scenarios, don't think there is much of a need to. I am a junkie for this type of stuff, and having got the game 60% off it is worth every penny.If the price is your #1 sticking point for trying it out, I recommend the standalone DLC Northern Inferno, $20 regularly, and less than $20 on sale, It's a single standalone""campaign"" in the game that is useful to see if CMANO may or may not be ""your kind-of game""ps. if you buy it, don't forget to download the platform descriptions and pictures from the website, helps a lot with familiarity and makes things more enjoyable.

												Overall I reccomend the game.As a kid i grew up watching my old man play harpoon and this is very reminicsant of those times.However...Some finer tweaking of coding is required.Especially with Air to land attacks scenarios, numerous times air to ground bombs/missiles/bomblets etc will miss. So maybe out of 100 bombs you might hit with 30.Stand off mode does not function correctly, sometimes anti-radar missiles wont be fired until your already being attacked by vampire's etcOverall it is a good reproduction but I would like to see some finer tuning with the armaments coding and the rate to hit improved.Make it more realistic.

												Once in a while, a simulation or game comes around so complex it almost becomes a hobby in itself to learn it properly. War in the East by Matrix Games in one such game/simulation. DCS World is another. Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is almost one too. I have to be honest though, when I got it I was pretty much able to get a game going rather quickly thanks to right-click menus and some quick reading of the manual. But to truly master it will take years.Command, or CMANO, is nothing short of an ops room simulation. Equipped with a database containing a mass of platforms spanning from the 50’s up until the near future is a sandbox within which the player can explore a multitude of historical and speculative scenarios. It is relatively scaled back in terms of visuals and sound, NATO symbology representing the various ships and aircraft in any given scenario, the playground is spread across the globe with audible warnings of hostile weapons releases and the roar of missile launches being the peak of the audio experience. This is a hardcore simulation. A simulation that turns into a sandbox for all those what-if’s or for recreating history. It’s an impressive achievement by the developers. Highly recommended for the Harpoon crowd. "

												This is a really good game. Very like the old harpoon, which inspired Tom Clancy to write all of his big military block busters like ""The Hunt for Red October"", ""Red Storm Rising"", ""The Bear and the Dragon"" etc...Highly recommend it, with the following caveats:1 - Have to play it with the sound turned off, because the audio warning when a a new enemy missile is detected is so annoying, that there's simply no other option, other than not play the game. No audio affects my enjoyment of the game and you do miss some events as a result. Very annoying and totally unnecessary.2 - Selecting an airbase (so that you can give units based there orders can be challanging, if there are other facilities nearby (e.g. a radar installation or AA/SAM). So this is pretty common. You often have to zoom right in so that you can differenciate between them and select the damn airbase you want. Again, very annoying and totally unnecessary.I play the game despite the above. Just bought the campaign (Northern Inferno) when it was on offer. That's good too. Therre's loads of community scenarios out there too, so great value IMHO.			"

												I have spent far more than 1.1 hours on this game but it's not logged by steam because I don't use the autolaunch.I consider this an investment for my future application to the CIA as a warfare analyst.Additionally, if you are starting to realize yourself (growing in your consciousness) this 'investment' could help you determine(sense/experience) the eventuality of future, current, and past conflicts. You could then sell the information to interested parties, I mean party, cough cough.Thus, the price is completely justified. Make no mistake this game is pretty much like a flash game. It has no 3D graphics and almost no sound effects what so ever except for about 5 types of sounds plus basic music. Some would think it would be better to turn them off.I shall give more updated review once I have obtained return on my investment. Should you not hear from me again, I'm probably dead from trying to sell information gleaned from the game and my rather advanced consciousness or kidnapped by the North Korean government to help them with military intel.Or I got accepted into the CIA.If you're adventurous or dangerous buy this game. If you're a sheep, stay away and buy the grass simulator.Joke aside,REVIEWThe gameplay isn't bad but I wouldn't say extraordinarily good because it's not. The game appeals to military enthusiats and hobbyist. It's not particularly difficult to understand the game but then again I'm pretty familiar with most military units and weapons.Buy it if you are a military enthusiast/buff or a thinker and buy it while it's on sale. The game needs a lot of your imagination because you hear little and see only NATO symbols on a 2D map.The database of weapon systems is amazing and probably the most amazing thing about the game.In that sense the game might last you half a lifetime through its database alone if you really like these kinds of games. I can foresee the developer updating the units into the near future as at the moment global naval powers see rapid growth and new units being comissioned like never before. The end of the cold war brought a hiatus in naval weapon system development but today, nations race to launch new platforms to service. The global powers are preparing for global scale war thanks to depletion of global oil supply, the melting of the arctic and the rising sea level due to global warming that the majority of civilians still fail to recognize.You won't go crazy over the game but the appeal could be long lasting and you will probably come back now and then and get to experience a battlefield commander role in modern naval and air operations.While the vanilla game lacks pictures of units, a community mod helps with adding pictures to most units and it enhances the game quite a bit.Update:FIRST SCENARIOAfter playing several scenarios I can say the game grows on you, the tension is real. Watching two small Philippines corvettes duking it out with a Chinese frigate was pretty tense and enjoyable. The skipper of the first Philippines corvette did real good job of damaging the Chinese Jianghu frigate although his ship's weapons and displacement were outmatched by the Chinese. The second Philippines corvette didn't fare too well having his ship's engine taken out early.The U.S. is racing to the scene and a Chinese surface group is fast approaching. I'm hoping the Virginia SSN would be able to put a dent to the group. Meanwhile I haven't found the Chinese submarine suspected to be loitering in the vicinity. The Helo I sent for an anti ship mission successfully struck the Jianghu frigate damaging it further real good.My task force is approaching to deal the final blow to the now heavily damaged Jianghu frigate. She's on fire and suffers from severe flooding. Meanwhile, a yet identified Chinese military vessel is fast coming to help the Jianghu and I'm not letting that happen. Just hoping no Chinese sub or two will surprise me. The helo assigned to the ASW mission still hasn't found the sub. I just hope the waters in front are clear.The F-18E squadron from Singapore is on transit and I'm going to send them to cripple the incoming Chinese surface group.LATER ONHowever, after the two corvettes under Philippines command had been sunk, things took a turn for the worse. The new U.S. LCS ships were taken out rapidly by the Chinese forces through a combination of long range anti ship missiles and 100mm naval gun (these ships didn't seem to be armored). The capable Arleigh Burke DDG was sunk by a torpedo launched by a Chinese sub. The Chinese sub was successfully prosecuted but at the cost of the DDG. The Chinese have won their first South East Asia naval battle.SECOND SCENARIOIn the second memorable scenario, the cold war had gone hot. A U.S. warship had been rammed by the Soviet. A U.S. landing group had just landed its marines in northern Norway and one of the landing ships was strafed by a Su-17 Fitter. Now the group has been ordered to make at best speed to a safe port to the south.A U.S. surface group is tasked with protecting the landing group. A Soviet surface group in the vicinity of John Mayen island is returning to Murmanks with the order to sink any encountered U.S. warship along the route.Early, a military intelligence gathering ship of the Soviet Union that had been tailing the U.S. surface group was sunk.The squadrons from the U.K. and Norway were launched for an ASuW mission to seek out the Soviet surface group which they did and sank a few of its ships. The U.S. surface group meanwhile is on the move to intercept the Soviet group. Unless the Soviets send in their long range bombers with standoff ASuW weapons it seems I'm going to win this engagement!Damn the suspense is good.THIRD SCENARIOThe third memorable scenario is Raven 21 down. The U.S. has lost an aircraft near the Somalian coast. It has dispatched a rescue SEAL team to evacuate the downed aircraft crew.However, the somalians and the Soviets are bearing down the crash site with tanks, armored personnel carriers and military trucks. The Somalian air force that has benefitted heavily from Soviet assistance has also been scambled to support the operation in addition to several Somalian patrol boats.But the mighty U.S. has a carrier battle group just off the coast. The many group flights of A-7 Corsairs and AV-7 Harriers, escorted by Crusaders and helped by artillery fire from a U.S. surface group near the coast decimated the Somalian and Soviet ground force bearing down the crash site. It felt good saving lives. Evacuation will finish in 5 more hours!ON REALISM (Update, Jan 10th 2015)After playing more I began to notice the game is actually not that quite realistic. For example, one of my controlled submarine was able to detect the radar emissions from an enemy frigate while doing 9 knots! In real life this would not be possible because the ESM would break at more than 5 knots as detection of radar emission would require the sub to go to periscope depth and extend its ESM mast (maybe modern sub's masts could withstand 9-10 knots of periscope depth speed).Other thing I noticed was that as soon as my aircraft expended their medium radar guided missiles (the AIM-120B AMRAAM missiles), they immediately turned back to return to base but the AIM-120B requires radar lock until certain distance where it goes autonomous but this isn't factored in in the 'simulation'.SUMMARYThe game is well made. The gameplay is good for a grognard. However, the performance leaves somewhat to be desired on accelerated time as you would see things kind of rubber banding when there are a lot of things going on at the same time. That being said, I don't regret my purchase. It is a little expensive but they don't milk its buyers with ridiculous DLCs. It's a niche game hence the pricing. If you're a grognard and not too fanatic about realism, this is your game.			"

												CMANO is a sandbox of military simulation and fun. Ever wanted to pit a flight of F-16's against, well, anything? This is your game. You can lay out complex missions, watch as the AI executes it all, or micromanage each individual jet. The database alone is monstrous, covering almost everything you can imagine from 1946 up to hypothetical future aircraft.One of the more pleasant parts of the game is the interface is fairly simple. So instead of fighting to learn the interface you get to fight the scenarios. Sonar, radar, and emissions are all modeled correctly. Some scenarios can have a steep learning curve, but once you realize that you need to think like a real commander and learn the methods, things tend to work out.I've been enjoying the scenario creator a a lot. I've got hypothetical conflicts galore, and the community is really robust. Well worth the cost for a professionally developed and supported piece of software.			"

												This game supplements my military porn needs quite nicely alongside Wargame. Pricing is a bit off. But it's on sale enough that you can just wait it out. Also, the game comes WITHOUT descriptive pictures. But you can easily download those off their page. I highly recommend them. The gameplay is strategy based. You usually start with a set of air and/or naval assets (sometimes also ground but I don't like those missions) with loadouts ready to tackle the mission objective. How you set your missions up is up to you. When you fail a mission it usually has a clear reason. Every mission can be treated like a puzzle and it feels really satisfying when you finaly solve the puzzle.  The community packs are cool. The missions go from very easy and quick to very hard and long. The military jargon might also sneak up on you. But a few google searches here and there and you are good to go.My closing advice, try not to shoot nuclear torpedos at whales.			"

												I have been playing Command: Northern Inferno for a few weeks (30 hrs to date) and I only got this larger game to enable the 'Live' scenarios in my NI game really (because both games use the same program just with differnet missions enabled depending on which you buy) - although there are loads and loads of very nice community and standalone scenarios to try as well in this larger game. The Live scenarios are fantasy scenarios released regularly. They are based around current news stories - like the ongoing Chinese Spratly Isands, North Korea's nuclear missile testing, Ukraine, and the Syrian Conflict. I love this idea because it gives the game a current, up to the minute, real world sort of gameplay.This is a very addictive game where you have to make use of your assets like subs, ships and planes and employ them to suit the desired strategy and complete your objectives. It might be to get air superiority, or to remove all the SAMs and then strike a target, it might be to prevent enemy subs penetrating your area or even to attack or defend a whole country. The possibilities are endless. All the units are here from modern stuff all the way back to WW2. The GUI is a bit clunky, the map could do with mouse controlled panning, but once you get used to it there is some real fun to be had with this game. And although they are only icons on a map (you can add photos of the units as well) your imagination takes over and you really see those MIGs evading Lightnings or whatever. So I cant recommend it highly enough for people who love realistic warfare, tech heads and wargamers who want to play out a modern conflict like the Gulf War or the Falklands War.			"

With its latest 1.06 update, this stunning sea and air-land war simulator gets even better: in particular, there are new options for flight operations (Surge and Quick-Turnaround air operations) and an even more advanced scenario editor.”  REVIEWS (v1.05 / WOTY)Martin Wiinholt, Eurogamer.dk : “CMANO: ‘Wargame of the Year Edition’ is a perfect-10 on the road from here: there is simply no other game (or simulation) doing what this game does. Whether you want to explore the current conflict in Ukraine, create a scenario that reveals aspects of a potential conflict between China and its neighbors over the oil in the South China Sea, or you want to try to see Israel bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, CMANO can handle it. For the last year it hasn’t left my hard drive. One can never never truly ‘finish’ it – whether you are studying military history at university or if you just love the intellectual challenge of strategy and tactics, CMANO delivers on all counts. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.For this reviewer, CMANO is one of the most important wargames that have come out since the original Harpoon in 1989, and as such it should be rewarded: 10 / 10.”Maj. Erich Swafford MD USAF (ret), Wargamer.com: “Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations belongs in the library of anyone who has even a passing interest in Air/Naval warfare, students of warfare since 1945, and also just wargamers in general who like a fun game. Like Battles of Napoleon, Combat Mission Beyond Overlord, and War in the East – this is one of those classics that will never leave my drive.No matter what new game comes out, I always find myself coming back to CMANO because of its unrivaled ease of use and its ability to simulate events which would otherwise be totally inaccessible. This is probably the most important wargame to come out since I started in the hobby back in 1979. It’s pretty much what we all dreamed about having back then, and to now have something this professional-grade available for home use is just nothing short of amazing.”  REVIEWS (v1.00-1.04)US Naval Institute : ““Command” will find a following not only among civilian gamers but might have value among military, government, and policy circles as a simulator of modern warfare. […] what time the designers did not spend making graphics and interface attractive were spent on building a game that depicts modern warfare on an unmatched scale. […] [This] is a game with broad appeal for everyone from casual gamers to government users looking to model unclassified, informal simulations. It likely will be the main choice for hard modern warfare simulators for years to come.”SimHQ: “the interface is full of thoughtful details which add up to a very easy-to-use system that’s both intuitive and powerful .[...] I started playing the other night at 8pm, and my wife angrily tracked me down 4 hours later. I told her I thought I’d been playing about 45 minutes, and I meant it. She wasn’t amused, but I sure was. The game pretty much grabbed me and hasn’t let go. [...] If you’re into modern military hardware, what-if matchups or historical conflict analysis, this wargame is definitely what you’ve been waiting for. [...] Command is, if you’re into the subject at all, an investment in something which you will quite likely still be enjoying for many years.”Out of Eight Reviews : “The powerful yet relatively easy-to-use scenario editor includes a map of the entire world and essentially every plane, ship, and submarine used by any country the past sixty years; it’s a tool that should be fully embraced by the community. [...] The flexibility to manage what you want and automate the rest certainly expands the appeal of this realistic military simulation. The AI does a good job following directions and behaving intelligently, and provides a good opponent for the battles. [...] The exhaustive unit research, flexible scenario editor, handy automated mission system, and relatively accessible interface will make Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations appeal to any fan of realistic military strategy games.”Armchair General: “To sum up: Although the price tag might seem a bit much, this game is well worth every cent of it. If you have even a passing interest in the subject matter, then this game is for you. Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is, without a doubt, a seriously fun, intense, involving simulation of modern naval combat with nearly infinite replay value. It is a more than worthy successor to Harpoon.”Hub3r.com: “The amount of content provided with the game is baffling. I was blown away by the amount of details, customization to our fleet, how I could control every aspect of the scenario without ever feeling overwhelmed. That was mostly due to how the user interface works. Sure, it still needs some work when assigning missions but overall it was a pleasant surprise. Last, but not least, community help and how Warfare Sims handles it. Tons of new scenarios in a matter of months! New database stuff, its amazing! Overall, Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations is one of those games that I will pick up five or ten years from now and it will still be awesome to play. Definitely one of the best strategy / wargames released in 2013.”Coiler at Amazon.com:“Conclusion: Since 1.01, the hardworking developers at WarfareSims have improved upon their already spectacular product. Version 1.04 of C:MANO takes a base game that was incredibly adaptable and makes it even more so.” "

												By the number of hours played it looks like this review was written by someone who just installed the game, but I bought it from Matrix Games upon it's initial release and have dozens of hours on it, in playing the official and community scenarios and building and posting my own weak attempts.The game isn't for everyone, as it is abstract in that there are no first person views from a bridge or pretty graphics. It is also complex, but not in any unreasonable way. Some of the smaller scenarios are actually pretty simple once you understand the interface and the menus, but the player needs to be able to grasp how the game world is being presented, which means understanding the terminology and the symbols. You just don't decide to pick up this game on a whim and be good at it in an hour. However, the tutorials (as I remember them, it's been quite a while) were very good. Where the game really shines is in the vast number of scenarios, both official and fan created. The player can pick and choose what interests him/her which makes the game easier to get into. And creating scenarios for one's own satisfaction is fairly straightforward. This is useful because it allows you to try out different features of the game and/or different bits and pieces of the hardware database.And the database is pretty vast. If your interest lies in the just post WW2 era, pretty much every piece of hardware, from carriers to patrol boats is there. If it's attuned more to near-future conflicts, same thing, pretty much all the hardware is there. And hardware doesn't just mean ships and planes, missiles and guns. It's sensors, radar, sonar, ECM, ECCM, ESM, the whole gamut of electronics. And don't forget the different types of ammo and fuels.If there is a weakness to the game, it's that the behavior of the AI in the scenarios has to be scripted to some extent, and in some ways quite extensively. You are not playing a representation of another person who will play the scenario different each time. Although there are some tools in the scenario development to support randomness in deployment or actions, for the most part scenarios will play out in roughly the same way. This isn't a bad thing in most cases, as the official and the community scenarios are well constructed to give the player an interesting challenge, and there are a whole lot of them. Just don't expect to replay the same scenario over and over and find new, unexpected behaviors from the AI each time. Also, if you think about it, this isn't a weakness at all. If you are playing to learn as well as being entertained, you will want to replay a scenario more than once to understand what happened and why. Most wargamers (or at least me) play as much to learn about the hardware and the tactics as much as to just have fun.So, overall, is the game worth the money? If this type of gaming is your thing, then yes it is worth it. The price is higher than the norm, but it's really a niche game that required (and still requires) a lot of support to provide those new features and the seeming constant updates to the database. And cost is relative in a case like this. Me, I've spent much more than the cost of the game just on one edition of Jane's Fighting Ships, or Jane's Weapon Systems, or the Naval Press Institute's Combat Fleets of the World, or what have you. It is *not* for the casual player or the impulse buyer.			"

												I have played the game for a short period of time due to my busy life as a College student and part time worker. I will revise this review with more gameplay but so far I really like this game and its near real life level of realism. What the game lacks in fancy graphics is completely made up for in the attention to detail of the game mechanics and the vast catalogue of units in game. With the ability to download and fairly easily add community built scenarios to the steam version of the game it will be very diffcult for you to become bored. Overall I highly recommend you buy this game if your dedicated to hard core war gaming even with its high price.			"

												First of all, if you are looking for an easy click and point warsim, this is not for you!  This game, with luck, takes many hours of playing, researching, and watching tutorials to get the hang of.  This isn't meant to scare off those that are interested in detailed strategic/tactical war simulators, but to simply save those who aren't into this type of gameplay the hefty pricetag.Due to the launcher being closed after startup, the gameplay time is a little off, but I have spent the past 3 days engulfed in a small fraction of what this game has to offer, and I can say I'm hooked on it!Pros:* Heavily involved and very detailed OOB for all platforms.* Very active and supportive development crew and player community.* Hours upon hours of endless gameplay.  (Even replaying scenarios will render different results every time)* Ability to micromanage or manage battlespace at a strategic (macro) level.Cons:* You forget about other hobbies and interest while plowing through hours of gameplay.* Price (but even after a few days, that doesn't seem to bother me anymore)			"

												Simply the best simulation available on the market if you are serious about modern air/naval military operations and it can handle small scale (think special forces) land units too. Huge and constantly updated database of equipment and weapons, detailed detection and damage modelling, real world map. There is also a great community developing scenarios.That said, game still lacks a few things - mostly multiplayer mode and AI could be better, not to mention bugs and poor performance, but judging by the past developer's performance I am sure the game will only get better with time. NOTICE: I've played this game pre-Steam so my play-hours count is actually bigger.			"

It is 2D as you can see by the screenshots provided. Nvevertheless, it contains a ton of units,which include naval,air,and (limited) land units. This is a SIMULATION game,not an arcade gamem, so don't texpect it to be an arcade type of game. I would try this game out if it's on sale for $60.			"

												I bought this game on the Matrix games website, and I got my key redeemed just now. This is an incredible game, I have never seen the like of this game before, it is really unique and one of the kind. if you are thinking that you want this game but the price is to high? please don't, find an excuse and just get it now! if you do, you will be happy you did, it's that good. the amount of work the developers have put into this game is simply jaw dropping, and the amount of details they have put in is amazing, they got every single airplane type of every country in the world, every ship, uboats, do you want to know the weight or length, width? or the weight of the bombs? no problem, they got that to, all real data, and besides that, the game is massive! the amount of playing hours you can get from this game is unlimited,  the intire earth is at your disposal, you are looking at everything simular from a Google Earth perspective, you have the globe wich you can spin around. it really doesn't look like a game at all, it looks like an application, you have menus just like in any application, it is really one of a kind, however, this game is not for everyone, you have to be a strategic player, and you should not be afraid of micro management, the learning curve is quite steep, it will take a while to really get into, but there are in game tutorials and also on their forum and other resources on the web. I give this 10/10 if I could give it 11/10 I would.			"

												If you liked Harpoon or Fleet Command, then this is the game for you. In case you haven't played those, then its an operational level simulator that has you commanding naval, air and ground assets. Its real strong points are naval and air combat, with ground combat being very much a secondary thing, in support of the other two. Its very well detailed, and with the mission editor almost any scenario can be created. It lets you have access to anything from an OV-10, to SS-18 Satans. Your imagination truely is the limit with this if you are a mission maker.Edit:The maximum size of missions allowed by (my) computer and the software allows for the simulation of for example a few CVBGs attacking a small-medium sized country (say Israel or Iraq). Beyond size when it comes to active units it might get a little difficult. So you won't see a full on exchange involving all the strategic weapons (ICBMs, SLBM, strategic bombers, plus all the things hunting or protecting against them) of the US and USSR, things would probably get too bogged down. But you can simulate the initial stages of an invasion of Cuba, or possibly one of the Arab-Israeli wars if your computer is good enough.The game does not force you to micromanage your units, you can give them missions and objectives, for example you can have one group conduct SEAD/DEAD, another conduct strike missions, and a third run CAP to protect the other two. However in some ways you may benefit from micromanaging some aspects like the strike missions if enemy AD is particularly nasty.Software stability is fine and except for perhaps some issues with optimization it runs well for me, even with most of the larger missions.The game comes with two databases, a Cold War database which has units from 1945 to 1975, and database with units from 75 to now. The Cold War database has some WW2 era combatants in it, but I haven't examined it and the impression I have is that it is incomplete for the WW2 stuff. What there is is late war weapons and ships.Now its not for everyone, if you are to enjoy this you will want to have an interest in the subject matter, it would probably help to have some knowledge of it, and certainly you will want to have some curiosity and be willing to look at a map (there are no 3D graphics in this at all).Ground combat it doesn't do well at all and as I mentioned before is very much secondary to air and naval combat. Me, I love it and have had it since it came out a year ago, but I'm a little weird.			"

												The simulator core itself is professional level and excellent, but beware: the graphical user interface is made for obsolete low resolution displays only and does not work correcly with up-to-date high resolution displays. Also zooming and panning the map is very sluggish. So far none of the updates have fixed the scaling problems. The whole graphical user interface should be completely rewritten. As long as the amateurish GUI fails, I can't recommend this. Too bad as I'd be willing to pay much higher price IF the user experience were as good as the simulator itself. Developers: At least make a native OS X/macOS version for Retina displays...			"

												Many of the relevant functions of the game are good(database, weapons simulation and vehicle simulation). The UI has had many improvements over the past updates, many additional functions to AI behaviour have been added and some of the units in the database were corrected overtime. The reasons I stopped using this simulation was because of the AI, lack of multiplayer and no improvements have been made to the map. Generally, lack of improvements.IMO this game is too overrated for where it's at now, so I was motivated to flip my review upside down.			"

												It's really, really good. It's got enough stats to make the nerd in you smile contentedly and enough complexity for real Simmers to enjoy meddling until their hearts content - yet it remains totally accessible to plebs like me, who really would love to know how to play a game like this properly, but haven't the patience to learn it.Just a few re-runs of the tutorials, then dipping my toe in the Scenarios and I'm already comfortable enough to fly a sortie or two, travel undetected through enemy waters in a Sub or activate a Battle Fleet for full on Naval warfare. I've even been launching Tankers for refuelling and electronic surveillance planes for better Radar. That kind of logistical detail is the stuff I usually get lost with.The best thing about the game is once you know the interface and the main enablers to get your icons rolling into the sky or out into the sea, the AI does allow for micro managers to step in or out of the action. I'm not a great micro manager so I just oversee them (to make sure the odd unit doesn't go off on it's own doing something weird, which has happened occasionally - turns out that's my dodgy Doctrine settings!). But the beauty is, you can take control at any time if it's a part of the battle you want to get 'on the ground' with.I love this. The Database alone is worth the money if you like reading technical stats (which I do) but the gameplay, despite the standard UI's attempt to prove otherwise, is fully engaging and  absorbing. I hate losing planes or ships to enemy fire and when they go down, you feel it. There's a level and depth of realism you wouldn't expect from symbols on a chart.10/10 for me - specialist game for sure, but if you do like this kind of sim to begin with, then you'll want for nothing from this package.

												I gave this a thumbs up despite a massive shortcoming.If you enjoy naval or air operations then this is the game for you.However, if like me you were looking for something along the lines of Hearts of Iron 3++ then this isn't the game for you.In ground operations terrain plays no part. There are no roads, there are no rivers and there are no cites as such. A T72 will roll across terrain that you know is marshland or mountains, it won't slow it down or effect it in any way. This game is expensive but also has a decent modding community.HOI3 lacked massively because you couldn't move your forces around very well, only from one region to the next, this game doesn't have that particular limitation but instead brings a dozen more.In HOI3 you can easily (ish) control entire army groups due to a proper structure system, in this you'll struggle to control a division sized force. The logistics system (for ground units anyway) sucks pretty badly.That said, it's still probably the best air and navy simulator on steam.  I'm a army person though and should have spent more time looking at reviews.9/10 for naval forces.8/10 for air forces.2/10 for ground forces.1/10 for the map and terrain when using ground forces.

Otherwise, you might get disappointed.Do not mind the time spent, I have had it before the steam version came out, since release.			"

												Effectively a spiritual successor to Larry Bond's Harpoon series.  Like its predecessor, graphics aren't much, but you really don't need fancy graphics for something like this (if you do want graphics similar to Jane's Fleet Command, Global Conflict Blue may be more up your alley).  Has LUA scripting support.  Word of warning though: If you don't enjoy staring at tons of unit/weapon tables, this is probably not the game for you.  As of the writing of this, while naval/air combat is simulated quite well, ground combat really isn't there quite yet.  Important to note that the devs constantly update this game.  Regarding the price:  I bought it for full price, I've personally gotten more than my money's worth from it, but considering it's a very niche game: if you don't KNOW you'll get your money's worth out of it, I would recommend you purchase it when it's on sale.  Last point: Be prepared to learn.  This is not an easy game that you can just pick up and play very successfully.A small note about the new ""Command LIVE scenarios"" DLC.  I personally like the concept of ripping stuff straight from the headlines to wargame.  Not everyone may be fond of this, however.			"

I have been playing naval simulators for a while now (anyone remember ""Strike Fleet"" by Larry Holland? yeah, that long) and I will say that this is a great evolution. It's evident that it does have a learning curve to it and it will take a while to master its controls. I do not see this as a ""i put in my quarter, now I want my gumball"" type of game as I have seen on other reviews. This is more like the more time you put into it the more of a reward you will get.

												First and foremost, that semi-ridiculous price point is an investment in your gaming future. I've had the game since it was released (pre-Steam release, that is) and it's by FAR the game I've spent the most time with over the past year. Obviously, I got my $80 worth out of it. If you've got any interest in post WWII naval and air warfare, this game will be fulfulling - first and foremost because the editor that comes with it is so easy to use. No, there aren't any 3D graphics. Maybe someday. And ground forces are still largely targets, but maybe that'll change eventually too. That's all part of the investment - this game will be around for years. The developers are very active and willing to listen to the community. The community also comes out with many new missions each week, so there is always something new to play.			"

This is also why i bought Northern Inferno without hesitation when it was released.Warning: long review ahead, i won't touch on everything, as a lot of the steam reviews do a good job as well.  I would definitely have to recommend Command:Modern Air/Naval Operations, if you are up to the challenge and have enough interest and patience to enjoy it.  Yes, $80 USD is a lot of money for one game. But this is actually acceptable for a number of reasons: -Steam Refunds make it a safer purchase if you are unsure. -Command:Northern Inferno is a reasonably priced way of trying out the game without committing to the full price. -What you get out of $80 USD in CMANO is completely worth it, ill go into this is more detail in a little bit. And of course if you can get it on sale, that is definetly a bonus! CMANO definitely requires, above all else, patience. You are not going to get the hang of this in one sitting. I highly recommend doing what i have done: Downloading the printer-friendly version of the manual, print it out, along with the various manual addendums on the website and buy a three ring binder to put it all in and have the manual available for reading in your spare time as well as during the game. I have only logged about 74 hours into this (plus probably an additional 3-4 hours when steam was in offline mode), and i am by no means confident enough to take on alot of the scenarios. But i am learning.  To put it bluntly, CMANO is a wargame/simulation of Naval and Aerial warfare all over the world from 1945 until the present day and the near future (i've seen scenarios going as far as the 2030s). That by itself inherently gives you a lot to work with. But that is a massive understatement. ""What do you get in CMANO?"" You should really be asking: ""What don't you get in CMANO?"", well not a whole lot. Well one thing you don't get is fancy graphics that you see in other naval wargames like Jane's Fleet Command or Naval War Arctic Circle. But to be honest, those don't really add alot to the games and are really just eye candy. I have never played any version of Harpoon, so i really cannot draw any comparisons there. As of right now, CMANO contains i think around 40 standalone scenarios, plus seven or so tutorial scenarios. If you also get Northern Inferno that is an additional 14 scenarios, which can be played individually or as a campaign. HOWEVER, there is the Community Scenario Pack, available on the developer's website, that contains close to 300 scenarios, most of which are made by the community. This is a free download, and every once in awhile it is updated as more players submit their creations. This is absolutely a must-have, think of it as free DLC, as the scenarios go through some peer review before being put in the pack. Also the most recent patch (v1.10) added steam workshop support, just be mindful that as of this writing (March 11 2016) many of the scenarios on there are already in the Community Scenario pack, So if you already have the pack, just check that before downloading from the workshop so that you don't have unnecessary copies of the same scenario.  As the above clearly implies, you can very much create your own scenarios. The possibilities are massive, as you have the entire planet earth to work with, as the whole program uses a Google Earth style globe.  Basically, the meat of what CMANO contains is in the two databases. These contain all the units, buildings etc (referred to as platforms) and weapons and sensors in the entire program. All put together, there are literally thousands of entries in the database. There are so many that there are actually two separate databases: -""Cold War Database"" AKA CWDB (stuff from 1945/6 through 1979)-""Database 3000  AKA DB3k (stuff from 1980 until the present day and near future) Some players on the forum have admitted to spending more time just browsing through the databases than actually playing. It is that huge and extensive. Much of it is available to look at for free on Baloogan's Campaign Wiki, there should be a link in the steam community discussions. One snag is that you cannot have stuff from both databases in a single scenario, you have to use one or the other. The sheer size of the databases means that as long as you keep within the Post-WWII timeframe, your options are, for all practical purposes, unlimited. The information in the databases is also incredibly detailed, basically all of the military hardware is portrayed in the most accurate way possible using publically available information. Obviously some stuff has some guesses about the capabilities, as the much of the details about things like the F-22 Raptor or the Virginia class Submarine are classified. There are also quite a bit of speculative and prototype units, such as the planned but never built aircraft carrier version of the F-117 stealth fighter, i think even the long suspected ""Aurora"" spy plane is modelled, obviously in a guessing way. One update recently added anti-torpedo torpedoes.You cannot, however, make your own units from scratch. I think this is fine for two reasons: 1. the Devs clearly put a lot of effort into modeling such a huge amount of units, weapons, and sensors, and i think it is not unreasonable for them to want people to enjoy all their hard work. 2. most of what you would need is already there, unless you are going for something totally science fiction, i think you will find just about anything you want within the game's timeframe.  You can however, make modifications to existing units, to use an example from the dev's website, you can put the modern advanced Aegis radar on an Iowa Class Battleship. Perhaps the best part about all of this is the developer support. They give great help, as does the community, and their free updates add a lot. It is worth it to create an account on the forums. CMANO is still very much being built. Each major patch usually adds new features for free, For example, the latest patch added the ability to give waypoint targeting to cruise missiles. In the next one they are improving mid air refueling and air strike planning.   Perhaps there is no better testament to the quality of CMANO than the fact that it is starting to have real world applications in the defense industry. Not that long ago the devs signed a deal with BAE Systems, the second largest defense contractor in the world, to use this program professionally. This wargame definitely has the potential to become one of the go to programs for Naval and Air Force academies around the world, especially since customers of the professional edition that you and me cannot buy have the freedom to add in more realistic information (classified stuff) for their own private purposes. Bottom Line, if you are willing to put down the money (save up for a while if you want), have an interest in the subject matter, and enough patience to accept the learning curve, you will not regret purchasing CMANO. I swear it is worth every penny, in fact it is worth much more than $80 USD, you really are getting quite a deal given how much work went into this, and the fact that the devs keep on adding to it for free, save for the Northern Inferno addon.

												Early initial impressions from mainly doing the aircraft scenarios. There is a lot of detail in the game and the AI seems to work well. Although if you make a mistake in setting up your missions there is no assistance and so at first it can be a little frustrating working out why your missions don't go to plan. For example if you setup a plane formation and your allocated  group of planes does not have enough planes the AI will just leave some of your aircraft floundering. I think in that respect the interface could be improved in letting the player know where there is an issue. I believe the simulation is under constant development. There are different layers of settings or so called doctrines to control your own sides AI and that can get complicated. On first look the simulation looks very basic, no next gen 3D graphics here, and it is although it uses detailed world wide terrain maps. Note a fast CPU will help since I understand the AI decision making is detailed and so I expect a lot of units could slow down the game. I've not had any issues here but I've  only been playing relatively small scenarios. The instructions are basic and so the best way to learn how to play is to see people playing it and Bunyap sims has a nice set of Youtube videos. Baloogan also champions the sim and has his own supporting web site on the military database the simulation uses. The database is very detailed and the AI uses the info it contains for its decision making. You have to import most of the database images from a fan site due to copyright issues. There are a lot of scenarious included to play through although you can design your own scenarious.  Its a shame the developers couldn't reduce the retail price so people sitiing on the fence would buy it. I bought mine in a recent Steam sale.  If you are interested in military hardware and strategy from after WWII to the present you will like this game/simulation.			"

												CMANO is a truly unique game. Modeling Naval and Aerial warfare on a very realistic level, I quiet enjoyed the complexity this game has to offer. If you aren´t into these aspects of warfare you may have to do some learning. I was especially excited by the idea that this CMANO allows you to set up missions for your units which then will operate, engage, avoid, refuel, rtb on their own, reducing the micromanagement workload. While the mission setup editor indeed provides great options, even with learning all aspects, investing a big amount of time into setting up zones and sophisticated missions, your plan still won´t go like anything you expect and you´re way too often forced to correct courses and to control engagements. Not many games there like CMANO you´ll find yourself expressing the physical gesture of a facepalm. Overcoming this limitation is the game´s main challenge and you are left with complete micromanagement which can be extremely tedious if you aren´t a big fan of it. While micromanagement will propably safe your units, nothing can be done about the enemy´s AI,  don´t expect it to be of any challenge. Expect it to be suicidal. Briefly: Neither your nor the enemy AI is capable of doing something right on its own.If this isn´t a concern for you and you´re okay with micromanaging units or even do prefer to manually control all your units, and don´t have big expectations for the enemy AI, get this. Otherwise stay away.			"

The trailer is a bit misleading as well. Be warned that if you complain in the forums you will be either deleted or banned.   One called it ""heavy handed"" moderation.They will soon learn that steam users won't put up with stuff like that.  LOLThe game if I dare call it that is good but very basic.   Maps, charts, drop down menus. No arcade style graphics here.The screenshots you see on the store page is exactly what you have most of the time while playing.    So go and watch lots of clips and tutorials on youtube to judge if the game is for you before handing over the money.   There is NO demo.			"

												Been a gamer my whole life, and as a military veteran, I enjoy mil sims quite a bit when done with detail. I went into this with some excitement, ready to dig in and make this a 'Study Sim' similar to how much I enjoy DCS World for its complexity.Honest review:Fairly disappointed. The complexity seems to be mostly found in the difficulty of managing the very awkward text based interface(the display screens look more law raw database output than anything you would see in a military scenario), instead of a realitic or immersive form of complexity. And then the rest - parts where I expected more content - just seem shallow, not complex, and even money-grabbing, to be honest.As a fan of Dangerous Waters and other strategic milsims of that top-down type, I thought this was more of the same, with many more units. On paper, that is what this looks like. The Steam store page makes it look like that.In reality, this is pretty much LESS of the same, so to speak. I am trying to play this more - maybe they really hid the features I am missing here?, but its really not holding my interest and it feels like work, it is not engrossing.Compared to Dangerous Waters, this is like that, but then start removing things. There is no sitting at the stations to man them yourself, hear what they hear, take sensors through their logical functions, find that submarine YOURSELF, all the FUN, ENGROSSING PARTS. None of that. There is the same sensor(as a game object, but not literally seen or operated), and some dude says he found the sub and you choose to attack it, but all that is text on the screen feedback or at best, new icons or circles on the map. Nothing tangible to dig into.Compared to Dangerous Waters, this is like that, but then take away the 3D view. They did not model the equipment in any way I can find. Those icons on the map are all you get. I know DW didnt have great graphics or animations or effects, but the effort made to let me SEE what I am doing makes a difference in situational awareness.The supposed upside of this would be that it has SO MANY MORE MODELS than DW, and it does. That falls apart very quickly though, when you realize that means MORE LINES IN A DATABASE, and not much else. No equipment to operate in any tangible way, no manual tasks to do in a realistic way simulating how it works in real life at all, nothing. Just more text than the other guy. That rings VERY holllow to me.When you take away the skill-based ability to see, operate, and successfully use a simulation of the equipment, what you are left with is a 'Simulator' - where the AI does most of the work , everything is too automatic and simple, and the map and text are very hollow and seem a lot more like an alpha prototype engine for a future simulator, than a functional simulator realized.Last but certainly not least, there is price. I am a 'Binford model' guy, and if you don't get the reference I mean, I buy the best one, every time. I want something that will last and has a solid warranty behind it. I will always pay more for quality. But I do that not because my money means nothing, I do that because I am looking for QUALITY. And the price of this is BAD. Far beyond BAD. When you have some simple icons, text menus and a database of theoretical specs for lots of equipment, there is really only so much work you did in making your game. Thats just the reality of it. Eighty Bucks is a joke . I got this for Twenty Five on sale and man, I wouldn't do THAT again. I really don't feel like even hardcore milsim folks would find this a good deal at Eighty. no way. But it gets worse - this game is LONG on DLC and not afraid to push it. The first 21 maps you can load in SP are all DLC bait. Each prompts you to make an additional purchase of twenty or more to add to your eighty you already, honestly.... wasted on this database dump of a 'mil sim'. I can't honestly use that term to describe this, because its got lots of Mil but they didnt really try to Sim any of it.Lesson learned on this one - its too late for me to return it. But the lesson would be: mil-sim realism doesn't mean much if its at the cost of pretty much all other features like ACTUAL simulation of equipment or letting me visually see the toys I am putting into use.Highly un-recommend this. No idea what they had in mind, but it feels like they missed their mark wide left, or maybe they just know they are fleecing people for way more than the game deserves. That last part might be more likely than you think: I get the impression this above AAA price is an attempt to fund turning this prototype database modeler/engine into an ACTUAL GAME in Command 2 when it comes out.

												好游戏，我表示我连内华达任务都搞不清楚在干吗如果家里有一两台什么深蓝了啊，天河系列计算机了啊，或者Google AlhpaGO Porject了啊，某大学Alpha之类的你可以考虑去官网买专业版，专业版的内容与DCS专业版和钢铁猛兽专业版差不多。之后你也可以帮助别人在佣兵团入侵他国之前进行一下模拟，卖卖战斗数据什么的。UI优化上有Bug，任务编辑器中间的东西不知道是没给换行还是没限制空间都把右边的指令盖住了。诡异的掉帧。。。恩还没打起来没CPU运算呢啊可惜没有陆军模拟，虽然说如果加入陆军相当于重做N个游戏了。毕竟除了气象还有实际地形(实际上也是有陆军的，然而。。。好吧相当于没有。)			"

Modern Naval Ops Review (Steam v1.05) 
A Video of Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations WOTY
By: HermanHum

			This is a review of the game Modern Naval Operations v1.05 published by MatrixGames and released on 26 Sept, 2014 via Steam. Overall rating: 4 / 10 To see how the game has evolved since the 24 Sept, 2013 debut, watch...		


4.0 / 10.0 ratingThe Good1. Many game functions and commands are compatible with Harpoon3. H3 veterans will easily grasp the basic game concepts and controls and be playing within an hour.2. A physics package will ensure that most units will observe the Laws of Physics.  This means no more instantaneous acceleration, turns, dives, or missiles fired 'over-the-shoulder' at a pursuer.3. Sensors and weapons report very detailed resolution through comprehensive messages that show the various modifiers and variables. These messages can be disabled if they turn out to be too much information.4. A Scenario Editor allows for scenario writing so that players are not limited to the 39 official scenarios that come with the game.5. Third-party modifications to images, sounds, and icons are easy to add.  Many images for the aircraft, ships, and submarines have already been added by the user community as well as a speech and ambient sound module.6. Color-coded messages make for ease of reference by the player.  Hostile action reports appear in Red, while other administrative reports appear in white, green, or yellow.  The colours quickly catch the player's eye and help him categorize those reports that require immediate attention.The Bad7. No multiple player capability exists.  The only opponent is the AI, which can be easily tricked once it is understood.8. The Event Engine produces strange results from teleportation of units instead of the more recognized deployment from aircraft or ships.9. A crude Formation Editor capability means that the solitary map is cluttered with unnecessary icons and symbols.  Confusion quickly ensues when aircraft assigned to protect the carrier group cannot easily be distinguished from those assigned to expeditionary missions.  Most other games have independent window displays to control formations so that units can function as organized groups.The downright Ugly10. No database editing capability exists.  The database is locked.  The current items, equipment, and systems can be shuffled, re-arranged, or re-combined, but nothing new can be added nor can the performance of any current system be modified.  Players are forced to accept false perceptions of reality.11. The UI is severely overloaded, cluttered, and user-unfriendly.  The dependence upon a single map to display all the units and functions means that the number of icons and other data displayed is extreme.  Coupled with the inability to turn off some information, this means that the player is easily overwhelmed by the data, much of which he probably did not want to see in the first place.12. Direct player control is difficult to exercise due primarily to the single map display.  The inability to differentiate between units at a distance or high altitude means that the user must constantly zoom in and out to locate units for his orders and targets.  This awkwardness triples the time and effort necessary for the most simple and basic orders and truly makes the game a chore to play instead of a pleasure.In ConclusionThis game is theoretically functional, but could easily have used twelve additional months for optimization and polish. As it currently stands, MNO is a hodge-podge of ideas haphazardly thrown together. It is good that MNO replicates many functions from NWAC and Harpoon3. It is too bad that many bad ones are also duplicated while helpful ones were forgotten. Features such as the Formation Editor and Event Engine are prime examples of good ideas for functions that were poorly implemented and badly integrated. The awkwardness of the UI makes the game a chore to play instead of a pleasure. A thorough re-examination of the overall design phase might be prudent, especially considering how some features generally considered “standard” within the naval wargame genre are conspicuously missing.This is version 1.05 and, hopefully, improvements will come in the form of game Patches instead of “paid patches” (a.k.a. download content or DLC). Should this game be meaningfully patched in an expeditious manner, an update of this review is certainly possible.			"

												I found this game amazingly complicated with little to no assistance from the tutorial. I've played all the Janes simulations  from the 90's with no problems as well as Harpoon. I was over my head right off the start.			"

												Love harpoon, loved this game while I could play it well. Short version is 4k support isnt there. Choice to either downgrade to 1080 or play with a broken UI. Would recommend when resolved.			"

												Schlecht - schlechter- am schlechtesten !!!! Dieses ""Taktik Spiel"" ist einfach eine billige Windows App auf Grundlage von Googlemaps. Zudem ist dieser Mist so schlecht programmiert, dass alles mit riesigen Lags abläuft..... Die Steuerung an sich ist noch schlechter...lächerliches rumklicken, und dabei kaum was sehen, was man auswählt (auswählen will). Kann nur davon abraten.......			"

												This over-priced piece of software is misplaced in the games category here on Steam.If you would put about 100 variables in an Excel sheet and make them interact with each other, you would get the same slow performing abomination as this.Horrible to say, I find no joy in having spent so much on something that was so distasteful, like a culinary expert accidentally stumbling upon a fast-food restaurant where they spit on your fries and burger.I thought that within this software, I would have the ability to customize everything - including the creation of my own vehicles, this alas cannot be done.The most unfortunate thing is that I bought this game before the steam refunds were introduced, as I would gladly receive my money back for a product I used for 0.6 hours in total. I might alter this review after having met success with support regarding my experience.			"
