												I think developers could did it more precise, even with that game engine. I've just hit the car while parking and no points were taken from me, game only considers some area to activate ""success"" trigger if your car touches this area. This is a good idea to give people some software to train their driving but I see laziness of developers in every aspect of this game.			"

												Lets start with the pros:The game had  a decent seletion of cars as well as buses and trucks........?Easy achievements if you are into them.......?Nudity?Thats all I can think offNow for a massive list of cons:AI cars drive in surges, often braking suddenly causing you to hit them.AI cars often drive 20-50kph below the speen limit.AI cars often fail to follow road rules. Running red lights, hitting pedestrians, failing to give way.AI cars never indicate.AI cars will change into your lane regardlessif you are right next to them or notStop signs have absolutely no meaning in this game.Except on the highway map, you can drive anywhere you want on the road (or on the side) as long as you dont cross the center if it is a solid line.Cars are oversized for the roads, Buses barely fit.City corners are square which is hard to turn a car around. Buses have to drive on the sidewalk.Pedestrian crossing are randomly placed, usually with no lighting which makes nighttime driving pretty hazardous.Pedestrians WILL cross the road regardless if you are too close to stop. They WILL walk into the side of a bus causing a penalty.Lights at smaller intersection change rapidly and will cause you to lose points if you have not exited in time (buses nearly always lose points).No cabin view, which is ok for cars, but makes driving a bus challenging.Terrible mouse control for adjusting view. No options for quick change or centering. Need to fight to looking backwards.Keyboard driving controls are terrible making driving on the highway map near impossible.Low beam does nothing. High beam is nearly as good as you would expect from low beam. Limit cone width. Signs do not reflect the light until you are nearly on top of them. No penalty for driving with high beam all the time. no option to switch from high beam to low beam.Sign visiblity is low so you barely have time to see a speed change and react.Any Steam notifiactions pop up right over your speed, despite 2 corners having absolutley nothing in them.There is more but I think you get the general idea.For a driving game I would rate this 2/10For a driving game that claims to educate, I am hesitant to give 1/10BTW, I lied about the nudity so looks like that brings it to 0/10 "

												First Impressions:Driving School Simulator has some great ideas (an XP system to unlock more cars, a free play mode, different car interiors, etc.) and some not so great ideas (XBox controller was ""wonky"", keyboard turning was rough, limited camera view while inside a car, freeplay maps aren't labeled, etc.).  The game is only $15.00 and whether or not you should pick it up will honestly fall back on what you feel an appropriate price tag should be.  I myself would have waited for a sale had I not received a press copy.  It's not a bad game and does have the potential to offer a lot, but some of the implimentation of these features were pretty lazy.  My advice is to check out gameplay videos (like the one below) to see if it's something you feel is worth $15.00 ($12 until Oct 2, 2014).  Steam really needs a ""maybe"" button...my recommendation would have fallen into that category perfectly.

												It's a Simulator but... not in a good way.The popins are bad, Cars appear out of nowhere. The controls... You're driving along, Make a slight turn and your car crashes because you couldn't control it.All you do is drive and you gain XP for doing certain stuff. I'd only get this when it's cheap and you enjoy unlocking achievements.Otherwise ""steer"" clear of this game.			"

												The controls are terrible and the physics laughable. A pedestrian walked across the road and rolled a car over in a collision. Yes, pedestrians are stronger than cars in this game. You can be merrily driving about, one tiny nudge to the left (that used to allign you correctly) makes you take a violent 50 degree turn into oncoming traffic. No reasons, only penalties. It also doesn't properly judge where traffic lights start, and why the heck you're forced to park in reverse is anyone's guess. Whilst trying to park in reverse, I drove in and out of an entire building without any penalties. It was simply an illusion. Put together as well as Big Rigs, but that at least lets you blast off into orbit. This game is just so poorly constructed, I can't even get a giggle out of its woeful assembly. I got this in a bundle, and that's about all it's worth.			"

												At first after I played the Mobile version of the game, I thought that this would be just as fun, but what I was delivered was a terrible, unorganized, garbage, laggy game that took everything good out of the mobile version. It basically feels like you just made the detail higher and added a WASD control. Game controllers do NOT work correctly and the options menu and key changing menu is such a piece of garbage.I wish I could get refunds back because I would in a heart beat. If you are going to release a god damn simulator, MAKE SURE IT EVEN SLIGHTLY WORKS AND HAS THE SIMULATION FEEL LIKE THE REST OF THE OTHER ONES!I bet if you compared this game to Flight Simulator 2014, IGN would have rated it a 10/10 compared to this piece of garbage!Take my advice and don't buy the game, I have every game the company made on my mobile device, and it's way better to just go get that version FOR FREE, FREE! Then spend the money you have on this piece of ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I wanted to believe in this game and I hoped it would deliver, but it doesn't.  Strange technical glitches prevent it from being what it should be.Graphics are a little under where they should be, but they're fairly okay for a game of this budget, but pedestrian and car animations are off, and that's quite jarring considering positioning and simulating the operation of cars is what this game is supposed to do... you had one job, Driving School Simulator!Gameplay... sigh... is off.   It seizes whatever controllers you might have nearby and that's what you have to use - once in game you don't get to reconfigure anything, it's terrible UI design.Technically - well it's all bad.  Janky animations are jarring and unforgivable.  You have two video configuration options (something has gone very badly wrong that we should be in this position) - and if you use the second one, you can't set the same resolutions as the first one - but you have to use the second one if you want FSAA.  This is practically malicious.This is a game that could have been so much more but just doesn't deliver.			"

												Very nice driving game. Good variety of cars, carrer mode and free run mode . Controls are awesome like in real life. Very good game for those who like to taste the real life driving, also good for learning the rules on the road. Congratulations developers!			"

												The worst simulator I've ever seen. While driving, the car suddenly turns completely to one side making you crash instantly.  It seems as you need a joystick to play (my experience with the keyboard was frustrating).I'd really like to get my money back.			"

												I have ""tried"" to play this game, but it is pretty much unplayable!!! £11 is a rip-off!! Its not even worth £0.10 in my opinion! I dont even know where to begin... The controls are awful, the handling (if you can call it that) is pretty much non existant!This is not a simulatior in the slightest!its impossible to change settings and for the game to remember the settings, cars keep spawning out of thin air.And the physics..... OMG!! its the one and only thing that is not broken in this game (BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST)oh, and dont let the ""pretty"" screenshots fool you either. This is pulled straight out of a origami jar! graphics are rubbish to say the least!Honestly, this game is not worth a buy... It is not a sim....			"

												This game is broken in many ways... AI cars that are too slow, breakable maps, some unfair penalties (for example, cutting too sharp when turning left at a light crossing will result in running the other road's red light!). Oh, and let's not forget the wonky controls, especially when driving a bus. And the fact that you just need to keep the blinker lit during the highway level (which bizarrely consists in a loop, not a real highway with interchanges) to score points. Fun fact: did you know that the game will not penalize you for taking the wrong way on the highway? Achievement hunters, keep this in mind, this will come in very handy if you want to perfect this game... Seriously, just do it quickly because it really doesn't deserve much playtime.			"
