												Build-a-lot puts you in the shoes of an estate manager. You go from to town to town and you restore them. You build houses that are being sold or empty lots, you sell those in your possessions to get money, you collect the rent, you build also building like bank, that can give you interest or avoid any taxes by donating these, a sawmill that gives you discount for the material you have to buy to build houses or to upgrade them (and raise every value), a workshop to form workers at half-price or any other buildings asked in the objectives.When you finished a level, you get the value of the buildings in your possession added to your carreer total, which is in reality your high score. However, while you have to play first the carreer mode, at one moment, the casual mode will be unlocked and there, you're managing your stuff like you want until you reach an ammount in cash.That's the main core of Build-a-lot. It's an easy time management game, as you don't have many things to manage, but I can promise you that some of the levels are very hard. I mean by that that you'll be close to be defeated as you have a deadline in carreer mode. And if you want the star showing your sharp skills, you have to be very very fast, which I am not. Sometimes, you may be forced to restart the level: you don't have enough money for getting material because your only house has to be repaired (which means no money) and you don't have a bank.Build-a-lot is also an old game.  However, the graphics aren't really outdated. They're acceptable, a balance between realism and colorful backgrounds. As for the soundtrack, it's very cheerful and the sounds can be a little annoying.So did I like this game? Yes, because I already played it in the past. However, you should be aware that the objectives are often the same and without real twists apart objectives being added during a level. But it's always: income = 250 000 dollars or have three estates with three stars or no empty lot or have 10 millions in cash, etc... There is nothing exciting apart repairing houses (unless you inspect them thanks to a workshop) or buying and selling these.But it's still a good game, though I would wait for a discount, because 9 euros now is a little too much, when you see recent titles that are better.

												A fun time waster. This was preloaded on a Dell PC I got a few years back. It was the only thing that was semi-addicting on the thing, so I had to get it when I saw it on Steam.			"

												Overall, this is a solid building game with some nice graphics, music and sound effects, along with solid gameplay. I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"
