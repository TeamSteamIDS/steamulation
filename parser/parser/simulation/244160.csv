												EDIT: Crash bugs right now if you have texture size turned way up. The classics are working fine for me. By the way, you must download the DLC to be able to play the campaigns in the remastered edition. Issues thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/discussions/0/617328967243529430/Let me tell you something about homeworld (1+2 AND the lost game, homeworld cataclysm). Even 15+ years later, it's still the gold standard for 3D RTS. Here's a few big points:Very intuitive controls. Movement control is a simple two step, where the first sets horizontal movement, then *optionally* holding shift or click and drag for height. I've yet to see another 3D RTS which even comes close to how quickly and simply that I can give move orders in a 3D space, even though mice and monitors are 2D devices.Extremely helpful *contextual* visual indicators. When in the process of giving a move order, a lot of supporting information for movement then pops up. For example, to show how high other ship's height are above yours in the 3D battlespace, an ecliptic disc is drawn centered on your ships in the move order interface, and vertical lines are drawn from that disc to those other ships. It GREATLY aids in plotting the movement order so you can order your ships to intercept over long distances. Once the move order is given, all of this goes away so there isn't information overload.Battles actually take place in 3D space as well. Skilled players WILL use height to flank from above and below to avoid being subjected to a full broadside of guns. Fighters zoom around ships without regards to direction, attacking from multiple angles. This isn't ""2.5D"" as I would call it, you NEED to use height, especially with fighters.Two camera modes. One is the standard battle camera, which you spend most of your time in for orders in a small area, and a strategic camera, which is an ""at a glance"" of the battlespace with a LOT more information and large map wide movement. The space bar is the simple key to switch between them.In the story, you must be somewhat careful of losses (but it's not so bad that it inhibits gameplay). Every mission brings the resources, ships, and research that you have from the previous missions. You are quite literally a nomadic fleet. Resources on each map are *not* regenerative, even in multiplayer, so grab what you can! Think starcraft in terms of resources: it's plentiful, but resources will run out in a prolonged battle.The story itself: It's of loss and sacrifice, hope and victory. It's quite a roller coaster of emotion.Soundtrack: Very ""spacey"" feel that is well designed to suit each mission. Plus, mission 3 on HW1 had the best freaking use of a classic choir song (Agnus Dei - Adagio for strings) I've ever heard.My only regret: the source code to HW:Cataclysm is lost. There's no remastering it. It's not considered canon, but it was still fun playing as the mining faction's ship ""Kun-Laan"" and fighting the galactic cancer known as ""The Beast"".EDIT: Made a grammar mistake, fixed. Kun-Laan is the mining faction's ship, but I forgot to mention that their faction name is ""Somtaaw""			"

												As a kid, I remember asking my father about all the different ships as he was playing the original Homeworld. As soon as the Remastered version came out, I had to buy it.Overall I'm very happy with the game. The remastered version is beautiful, and in my opinion one of the best things about it is that it has a great storyline behind it. While I understand that not everyone cares about that, for me it makes the game so much more. Homeworld offers a rather unique experience as a strategy game in a 3 dimensional enviornment which isn't really like anything else I've played.Both HW and HW2 remastered versions seem to be optimized well, as I've never had any lag or framerate issues. I can't speak for the mods, as I haven't yet felt the need to utilize any - there hasn't been any that I've seen that have caught my eye as a ""must have"".Some people have complained about scenarios being more or less difficult depending on how well you're doing throughout your campaign. Say you fail a mission, but you rememeber what's thrown at you and plan accordingly beforehand - the next time you start it stronger only to find there's even more enemy ships. Personally I kind of have mixed feelings about this aspect, it makes the game more unpredictible and more challenging, as you can't plan for everything the way you can with most other game's missions/scenarios.As a negative, I have encountered a couple small glitches with scenarios, such as objectives not checking off as complete even though you've finished it, therefore making the scenario impossible to finish. I also don't particularly care for HW2, the storyline and ship variants just don't do it for me. In my opinion the first game is far superior but that's simply a matter of opinion. I can't say I have anyone to try Multiplayer with but I think it would be an excellent MP game with a few friends looking to out-strategize one another.In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking to try out a new type of strategy game in a 3D space enviornment, or anyone who gets their kicks out of a great back story like myself.

												Here is a full ist of the changes made from classic to remaster:http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/another-ye-olde-homeworld-players-view-on-remastered/98847Homeworld is a space strategy game that redefined the RTS genre, and remains today as the only game that did it right. A deep and thrilling story (30 missions over 2 campaigns), powerful and anomalous music, and a very unique style of play. A true space opera!Even though games are nearly 15 years old now, the mechanics and gameplay don’t feel outdated. Instead, they are still unmatched by any other space RTS that have released since. The three dimensional environment requires a whole new level of thinking when it comes to strategy.Now let’s talk about the Remaster and a company that actually put effort into a remake. This was crafted with the assistance and guidance of the original creators as well as the help of a passionate fan community.Here’s a list of some of the changes:+ Significantly upgraded visuals, including high-res textures and models+ Up to 4k resolution+ Sound and music overhaul+ Upgraded cut-scenes with clean artwork and some new 3d animations+ Redesigned UI for HW1 (from HW2 which also got an update)+ Mod compatibility and workshop support+ Compatibility with newer operating systems+ Combined Multiplayer between both gamesAs you can see, they put a considerable amount of effort into this remastered version of Homeworld and that's why I totally think it’s worth the price tag, unlike any other HD remake out on Steam. You also get both of the original games with this package, which were previously hard to get ahold of, and they are even updated to be playable on modern operating systems.If you enjoyed Homeworld 1 and/or 2 in any shape or form, you should strongly consider buying this, as it really is a whole new experience! Let’s show the industry that there is still demand for strategy games like this, so that we can expect more in the future!			"

												Let me start by stating this: - I did not play the original games, so my review comes untainted by fandom both possitive and negative.OVERVIEW:At this time the game is best enjoyed single player. The campaign in HW1 Remastered is amazing and I expect HW2R's to be great as well. The story, cinematics, music and atmosphere all get 10/10CONTROLS:Some players have a little trouble getting used to the controls and while this is in part due to the fully 3d nature of the game I also feel it is in part down to the developers descision to keep the old control system rather than improving upon it. That said, everything works nicely and I found everythign easy to get used to. 8/10GRAPHICS:The game is simply stunning close up, ships are well detailed, docking ships looks awesome, the enviroments and FX are great. Could they be better.. Probably.. Are they good enough, definitly. 9/10MULTIPLAYER:PvP is still in beta, so it is hard to judge, but so far things seem real good. There are objectives and that is something I find very interesting as it is unheard of in other PvP games I play. AI is skilled enough for skirmish games and will give you a real run for your money, Changing tactics from game to game and really testing you. Only real issue is possibly balancing still needs to be done on some units. But hey, this is something completely new to the franchise so it was always going to take time. There is however no co-op campaign.. Something I find sorely lacking as it is my prefered game mode ussually. 7/10OVERALL:An exellent game, I highly recommed it to anyone who loves, RTS, sci-fi, or who is just looking to try something new or find a great story to be immersed in. 9/10			"

												The first thing I noticed on playing HW:RM was how the HW2 UI and seemed to be everywhere. It was as if the whole HW1 game had been transplanted into the HW2 engine... turned out I wasn't far off. Homeworld 1Unfortunately there are a few things that bring the quality of the remaster down as a whole - players aren't able to experience HW1 with it's Ballistics physics engine intact (shots fired could be evaded or go on to hit something else), instead shots fired by ships generally always hit (some RNG seems to be involved) the selected target as in HW2. This is a large part of what made HW1 stand out from other RTSes at the time (in fact most RTSes nowadays) and made certain manoeuvres such as doing increased damage to ships when attacking them from behind, etc, possible since damage resistance was also modelled as part of this engine. As far as I can recall this was not something that was taken through to the original HW2 or the Remaster. Pretty big deal in my opinion.Formations in general are completely borked, meaning that a lot of the tactical (and at the time, genre defying) flavour of HW1 is completely absent; while I don't particularly miss the fiddly micromanagement and lack of context sensitive clicks, I do miss the extra depth of tactics that formations offered. If Gearbox ever start work on a Homeworld: Cataclysm remaster (the original HW:C = my favourite game of the series) they have to get this fixed. Good news is that a patch may be on it's way to restore formations to their intended form.Overall I still enjoyed playing through the HW1:RM campaign, and ultimately found it more ""playable"" than the original (especially while using a Steam Controller). Basically I found the game easier and more accessible than it used to be, which for newcomers and busy old-schoolers like me is not a bad thing. I think it's a huge shame we never got to see the original ballistics physics etc on todays capable machines however.Homeworld 2Being completely honest I originally played Homeworld 2 the least of the games in the series, however I feel that the remaster did a solid job of restoring and enhancing the game for compatibility while staying pretty faithful to the original. The remastered graphics really shine here, fleet battles are a thing of beauty. Seriously, pick a fight and soak in that goodness, JUST DO ITSince the remaster has been so good to the game I have in effect enjoyed HW2 anew - I'd basically offer this collection as an instant recommendation for fans of the original. The only issues HW2 fans might have is that the voice actors from HW1 have been used instead of the ones they may remember from HW2, as well as a few other VA changes here and there (notably Makaan).GeneralGearbox have been patching things up slowly, with various bugs and issues like bad pathfinding (crashing into asteroids) being fixed. There are still issues like formations not working properly and friendly ships merrily continuing to pour heavy firepower on ships you are boarding/salvaging to add to your fleet, amongst other things.Scoring based on faithfulness to the spirit of the originals;-GFX/FIDELITY 8Glorious hi-res Fleet battles and Furballs, gorgeously updated and retouched. The UI scales perfectly and there are sliders allowing you to adjust the scale of varying UI components manually. -AUDIO 7Remastered audio (apparently; I can't tell I'm no audiophile), original voice actors (notably Fleet Command/ Mothership from HW1) brought back and re-recorded. HW Classic sound effects are particularly dated and low-def when compared to the remaster, so good job I guess. -GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS 6In regards to HW1 the best I can say is some patching is definitely needed.HW2 on the other hand is in a good place. If Gearbox attempt a remake of Homeworld: Cataclysm, I hope they get a better handle on what made these games great in the first place.As a Remastered Collection It's a good update on the originals, however it's not perfect by a long shot. It's also a shame that some of the technical limitations that held the old games back have not really been challenged (in fact the opposite, much has been dumbed down). The unfulfilled potential is pretty crushing in my opinion.Multiplayer is also a bit hit and miss, in that Gearbox are clearly putting a lot of work into the facilitation of mp matches, but the bugs/missing mechanics are keenly apparent at higher levels of play.In any case I have to thank Gearbox for bringing back these games, and can only recommend this Collection as an essential for RTS fans, and those gamers who enjoy a good story alongside a challenge.

												Sadly, as a HW player since the first game came out, (Back in 1999) I cannot recommend this game.  The first time I played Homeworld, I was a young boy about 8 years of age. My grandfather introduced me to the game, and whenever I go see him I will still play LAN games against him, on the same two disks that we have always played on. Now, with that being said, at 8 years of age I didn't really understand tactics or how to win, the main objective for me was to build a heavy cruiser and try bum rushing the enemy mothership, praying that my prized cruiser didn't get salvaged in the process! As I grew older and understood the game more, I enjoyed it more as I began using formations and tactics to alter the outcome of battles, some of which were against slim to none odds.   The depth and complexity of this game was really what hit the mark for me as I grew older. I played Homeworld nonstop until Homeworld 2 came out. I enjoyed playing that game as well from time to time as well, but my Homeworld life changed forever when the Complex mod came out. This mod essentially combined the tactical and strategical gameplay of HW1 with the beautiful graphics and upgraded UI of HW2. I have played this mod since it was released, all the way to 9.1 which is where it sits now.   Now fast forward to 2014, when I learned that my favorite strategy game was getting remastered. I poured over screenshots and gameplay, developer interviews and every last piece of media I could grasp my hands on. The promise was simple, updated graphics, and no changes to the original engine this game ran on. Unfortunately, this was a lie.   When I first booted up HW:R I was amazed with the beauty of the game, but felt betrayed as I continued to play on. The most important feature of early combat, even going forward to endgame combat, the formations and tactics features, do not work. This is a gamebreaking feature people, because strikecraft are worth their weight in gold at all stages of the game. The fact that you can no longer use bombers and corvettes to their full potential will ruin the game for anyone who has played this before. The developers essentially put everything HW1 onto the HW2 UI, all for the sake of being able to play Kushan VS Hiigarrian in multiplayer. While this introduces great improvements, such as better 3D movement and harvesting, the developers lied in their statement of, ""Nothing but the graphics will change"". The month is now June, and the Dev's haven't even made a comment of when these issues will be fixed, no issued an apology for their lie.   Also, mods will STILL not work the way they should in the classic versions of the game. I would be fine if I could still play Complex 9.1 on the classic HW2 game, knowing that the fix will come eventually and formations will be able to be used again. However on bootup the mods (and I'm talking other mods too, the star wars mod, the halo mod, etc) will crash and burn, leaving you empty handed. The dev's should have kept these engines separate, as even on multiplayer, HW2 strike craft will always slay HW1 strike craft, because the HW2 squadron formations still work.   As a man who has played thousands of hours of Homeworld, and in light of this 60% off steam sale going on currently, I strongly advise putting your hard earned dollars, euros, pesos, or whatever currency you're using into something else, unless you have never played this game before, because you may be able to enjoy it for what it currently is. If you have played even one skirmish vs cpu match on the original HW, don't even bother picking this up.**UPDATE**As of today, 9/20/2015, the game is still borken, formations are still not usable, and now mods are ceasing to work as the dev. launches half ***ed patches ever two months in order to justify a poor excuse for a ""Supported"" title. Folks, for your money id say buy an actual HW2 disk, so at least you can play the great mods that have been released. This, sadly, is not the Homeworld Remaster we were promised or expected it to be.			"

												At first, I was not pleased with this game. It was very buggy and frustrating, with numerous other issues like HUGE pathing problems, stupid ai and automation problems (Several harvesters waiting to get to a single asteroid to harvest when they're surrounded by unnoccupied other ones). However, the largest problems lay in the fact that ""Homeworld 1 remastered"" was essentially just homeworld 2 with homeworld 1 ships, because a lot of mechanics which gave the original tactical depth had to be removed so it could fit into homeworld 2's engine. This meant that the whole collection was a buggy, broken, imbalanced shadow of the originals.But then the June 7th update happened This update (in my experience so far) fixed everything that was wrong. It has fixed formations, ballistics, tactics, pathing (mostly), targeting priorities, balance, and all general bugs (that i've experienced so far).I can now safely say that:  Both campaigns offer an amazing narrative experience, complete with incredible music and visuals.Both campaigns provide a great challenge, as does the AI in singleplayer modeEasy to use and pick up basic mechanics, with complex ones to pick up laterTrademark 3d movement and map are very well implementedIncludes the 2 original games, fixed to run properly on modern OSs and hardware Maps allow for potentially hundreds of small fights at once which can be really intense as larger strategies take shape Gorgeous visuals and sound, which all run very well Multiplayer supports up to 8 players I think, which can lead to some titanic fights.Overall a great experience and a very solid recommendation after the update. 8.5/10  "

												Let me start out by being fair and pointing out what Gearbox got right with HW:R - the ships look beautiful, it's quite obvious a lot of time and effort was spent lovingly crafting them and they feel very solid and real. The other eye candy like HDR and shadows is very welcome and really calls out to my first experiences of playing HW1 in 2000. Sounds and voice-overs are also remastered to a very high standard though some of the inflections aren't to my personal taste, but that's just me.Now then, onto the bugs and why I can't recommend HW:R in its current state. If you've read the other reviews by now you'll probably have found some pointing out the bugs with formations and strikecraft in general. I am no purist, but quite frankly I think these issues have been understated so far. Not being able to put your fighters or corvettes into formations massively affects the combat effectiveness of your strikecraft (less so for capitals). Since they refuse to maintain formation (regardless of tactics set) they will not fire en masse and you the player cannot position them precisely where you need and want them. A wall of just 9 heavy corvettes in HW1 would easily demolish a flock of enemy fighters if managed correctly. In HW1 the same force takes at least 3 times as long to complete the same engagement and you’ll probably take losses. I've seen positive reviews on here downplaying this issue which I find hugely disingenuous to say the least. I'm going to have to make a video showing HW1 and HW1:R side by side to really illustrate just how much this affects the game and almost everything you do in it, it really is that fundamental.Formations aside, the path-finding for strikecraft again is quite poor. Ships like the heavy corvette with heavy forward firepower seem to insist on circling the enemy and trying broadsides to no effect, which is probably why the fights take forever to finish. Because your ships refuse to stay in formation they will also largely ignore player attack-move commands during combat (ctrl+A).Other reviewers have already pointed out the firing system changes as well, but I really have to emphasise just how much this negatively impacts the game. Basically, in HW1 your ships would fire bullets that would actually travel through space i.e. no hitscan or RNG. Since this is no longer the case your ships are at the mercy of the Random Number Generator and setting them to evasion tactics has literally no effect where as in HW1 it could vastly improve the survivability of your strikecraft.I understand a lot of these changes were implemented to allow compatibility between HW1 and HW2 to enable multiplayer which is just fine imho. However, I consider the formations and tactics issues as bugs since they severely handicap HW1 strikecraft compared to their HW2 counterparts, not to mention that it robs the player of a huge degree of tactical control.I love Homeworld, but being unable to control my strikecraft effectively reduces the whole thing to pumping out ships, sitting back and hoping for the best. The pathfinding and formations issues are major bugs and I hope to the almighty Gearbox get on top of this crap.			"

												It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. Homeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. The only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. If you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.			"

												We all know what made Homeworld great. We all know Gearbox made a visually stunning remaster. What needs to be said now is what Gearbox did to make the remaster a disappointment. While the following things may sound petty, they fundamentally change how the game is played and the emotional tenor of the story:-removing formations-removing stances-removing fuel for strike craft-reworking repair mechanics (repairing is now not feasible in combat, it's more meant for between battles)-making diffculty scaling much more aggressive-replacing the ballistic simulation for random number generation combatHomeworld was always a story of disempowerment. Of overcoming long odds at the brink of genocide. You were perenially starved for resources, and forced to be extremely careful when shepherding your tiny little fleet. Put your craft into evasive mode and they'll live longer. Put them into aggressive mode and they'll kill faster. Use your support craft to keep expensive ships alive from mission to mission. Use the almost Napoleonic wall formation to concentrate firepower, but don't try complex maneuvers with it. The level of care you had to put into your fleet assets, great and small, contributed a lot to the overall feel of the game.Now, stances have been removed. Formations have no effect, and fall apart the moment your ships enter combat. Fuel for strike craft has been removed. Support ships are now so unwieldy and take so long to engage that they are only useful outside of combat. Individually these changes wouldn't be so bad, but taken together they rob Homeworld's story of it's gravitas, and it's gameplay of almost all its depth.It's hard to care about your fleet because your ships are now throwaway items, and honestly there isn't much for you to do with them other than throw them at the enemy fleet and designate targets. What was once a game of tactics and risk management has been reduced to a laser light show. Pretty, but ultimately there isn't much for you to do but sit back and watch.If you want a pretty game with all the familiar sights and sounds from the Homeworld we played back in 1999, then this fits the bill. If you want a game that captures either the spirit or the tactical depth of the original, then sadly you should look somewhere else.			"

Pros + HD graphics supporting up to 4k wow and the ships looks amazing.+ Really well done UI that makes the game easily mangeable.+ Redone sound effects that is amazing+ You get HW1, HW2 remastered and the classics + The game runs very smooth and the system requirement isn't too insane game is 4 gigs total.+ The backdrops and environments bring back nostalgia and really well done.+ Multiplayer is being worked on but it is damn fun.+ Compelling story and voice acting redone with tasteful cutscenes.+ NO DLC BS+ MODS ENABLED, Compatibility for mods.Cons - It isn't a remaster vets were hoping for, they took away somethings such as fuel, some tatics etc from homeworld- HW1 is actually in HW2 engine, so if you didn't research you would not know this. The mechanics from the old one is changed up a bit.- Formations are breaking sometimes, is this a bug?- Some bugs and crashes but it can be ironed out hopefully- The engine to the battles feel less projectile like but more dice rolling battles on the attacks			"

												Just one word... AmazingGearbox did an astonishing job with Homeworld. It really got what it deserved. The sound and graphics were amazing for the time (15 years ago for the ones that don't know Homeworld). With the remastered edition they did such a great job with improving everything and keeping the game practically the same. The sound is amazing. I did the first mission in 30 minutes. I was just listening to all the gorgious sounds. And i haven't talked about the looks. The graphics are so good looking now. It all looks really high detail even upclose. And the cool thing about up close view is the new Depth of Field. I just love watching a huge destroyer firing its guns at some frigates in the distance. It sounds amazing. It looks gorgious and it plays wonderfull. And you can get some amazing screenshots when you turn off your HUD (Backspace).TL:DRIf you love Homeworld, you will love this. If you love Space RTS, you will love this. If you just love amazing sounds and graphics, you will love this. Like i said. One word... AmazingBig applause to all the guys that worked on this at Gearbox and for the original developers and voice actors (Which helped with remastered). You guys made a masterpiece into an even better masterpieceOver 9000/10			"

												Beyond incomplete. The Homeworld 1 ""remaster"" has removed :- Fuel Mechanics- Ballistic Damage Model- Formations- Tactics (Defensive/Agressive modes for vessels) The above are not ""bugs"" because they are features that were crucial to Homeworld 1 which have just been completely left out. Bugs include :- Functional Resource Harvesters (Often do nothing, bump into things forever etc)- Function Salvage Mechanics (You now must individually select salvage targets from large groups of targets)- Functional navigation (Often ships just collide and do nothing forever)- Numerous bugs in missions. Crashes etc. Many players can't get past mission 3 because it never loads. Homeworld 2 Remastered is much more functional but still experiences many of the above bugs. Homeworld 1 Classic. Chris Faylor said in an interview : ""We had to make sure that the classics were out there no matter what, as untouched as they could possibly be for the sake of history.""They removed multiplayer LAN from the Classic - not the Remastered - version. Homeworld Multiplayer Beta? Don't get me started. - Massive Balance issues - chronic disconnects- no re-joining mechanics to games - CHRONIC DISCONNECTS			"

												Some games define a genre.Some games define a playing system.And then you have games that define a generation.Homeworld is one of these very few games that define how games make you feel totally immersed in the actual game.The game is extremely well made and just draws you into its universe.The graphic update for the remastered version is something that all game developers should look at. If you want to relaunch a old game just update the graphics. Dont ruin the game by trying to add your own idea.But for me the crowing jewel for this game is the music. This game has music to sooth the savage beast. I played this game for hours at a time just to listen to the music.i was close to tears sometime when the music coinsided with some very dramitic game play.If you have the money then you must add this to your game library			"

There are some bugs but....the game is completely playable and enjoyable...and is a must have for veterans of 1998...but it can be a really challenging and wonderful space RTS also for younger players.Pay attention to which strategy you use during the 2 campaings because the game is very challenging (particularly HW2)..I warned you because people are whining: ""The Game is unbalanced!! The game is boring! Gearbox is not serious!"".....don't pay attention to those people..Buy It!			"

												Such a shame... What I though was going to be a true-to-original remaster, was too far off to keep playing. Being a fan of HW2, and reading the reviews and complaints of HW1 carefully, I thought I would pick it up on sale. Playing the first two HW1 missions, I saw what some folks were talking about in the way that GB had changed the fighter behaviors, and other details. I also some improvements they had carried over from 2 such as being able to select units from the space map. Being a fan of 2 I thought that this was ok since I had always seen fighters as being OP in the original. I once beat the game with NOTHING BUT fighters and bombers.The deal breaker for me came when I started the third mission. I had built 6 salvage corvettes in anticipation of ""stealing"" the coming frigates and using them against the enemy as I had 15 years ago. To my horror, as each frigate was captured, nothing came back out. I was like ""where the hell are my frigates?!"". Then I noticed that my RUs had grown substantially. I quit the game right then and started reading more into the forums and saw that this was now part of the game. Then I started looking in the Workshop to see if anyone had made a mod to fix this, and sadly there was no fix. Salvaging was one of my favorite parts of HW1. I don’t understand why someone would take a classic that was so well received and decide to cut it up as much as GB did, and describe it as being true to the original. Remasters are a common thing in the music industry. Old master tracks are taken back to the studio and are mixed down again on new hardware to bring the sound quality up to par with current music quality and to fix any “noise” that may have been in the original to clean it up. Imagine if you went to the store and bought the remastered version of your favorite band's album, only to find that someone else is playing guitar, and your favorite songs from the original are missing even though the album cover makes no mention of it? Its a beautiful game with great sound and gameplay, but a remaster of the original it’s not. Maybe one day GB will get their ♥♥♥♥ together and put the game back like I should have been in the first place. Watch the video that Bobamelius has posted in his review carefully if you are thinking of getting HWRM. Hell, watch it two or three times and know what you are buying. Thanks to Steam's new refund policy I'm on to the next game! "

												Via reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2xcwdl/homeworld_remastered_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly/I've spent about 8 hours with Homeworld remastered re-living one of the best game experiences I can remember, and have to say that there are ups and downs to the remastered version.The good:    The graphics are beautiful yet look like I remember them. That is to say Gearbox has done a great job of updating the graphics so that the game looks as it should through my rose tinted glasses of fond memories :)    They stripped out some mechanics that were a real pain in the original, specifically fuel for fighters.The Bad:    Stripping out some of those features had unintended consequences. For example, strike craft used to automatically fly home to refuel from time to time and would automatically be repaired and re-armed. Now since they don't have fuel they don't return to base on their own and die very easily left to their own devices.    Gearbox removed the 'aggressive' and 'evasive' posture from the original which used to be very handy for keeping your ships alive longer. In the original game you could re-position your forces, withdraw, or wait for reinforcements without taking crippling losses, but now these situations lead to crippling losses.    Formations don't seem to be working right... you can put your ships in formation but they break that formation if so much as an enemy fighter shows up.    Automatic harvesting was added but works inconsistently. This was a Homeworld 2 feature meant to be a time saver so you could hyperspace out when the mission was done instead of waiting for 40 minutes for your harvesters to finish gathering resources. It's broken though so it seems to harvest random amounts and not everything on the map.    Another homeworld 2 feature they seem to have dabbled with is dynamic difficulty, which I personally hate. It basically punishes you for playing smart on prior missions and removes most of the incentive to do a good job rather than just scrape by. They should have left it out or put in a difficulty level selection.The Ugly:    Frequent crashes to desktop even with updated drivers and directX. There are some bugs in the graphical portion.    Myriad scripting errors including...    Some missions can't be completed about 1/3 of the time. For example the mission diamond shoals has a nasty bug where after you clear the minefield the bentusi may or may not show up making the mission un-finish-able. As if this wasn't bad enough the bug also exists in the automatically made quicksave at the start of the mission, so if you get stung by this error you have to reload in the previous mission.    In the previous mission there's a scripted event where fleet command tells you about enemy defender ships and how you should research your own... in my game the research option didn't show up, so I literally cannot build this type of ship for the rest of the game.    On later missions similar bugs appear where you finish all the objectives but just can't finish the mission.    Some AI seems to have been lobotomized in transition. The garden of kadesh used to be very tough, but now most of the enemy ships don't do anything... "

												Homeworld is sacred. Homeworld is art. Homeworld is one of the greatest PC games of all time.I for one, embraced this remaster and embraced the return of the the great art that is Homeworld.That said, this remaster might not appeal to the hardest of the hard core HW1 players.If you prefer HW2, then by all means, get this now.If you're extremely picky about all the HW1 mechanics, there's a lot of HW2-ism that clashes with it. Formations, tactics and certain game mechanics (and bugs at this point) are making it very obvious that it's a HW1 port in HW2 engine. I've never been a huge multiplayer player in HW1, but I'm a huge single player fan. I've played a few LAN games with my brother and friends, loved it, but I was never a master player in the ""Internet ladder"" sense.That said, I'm a much much bigger fan of HW1 (never even finished HW2 completely), and played it a LOT back in the days. The remaster didn't kill any of the experience for me. Sure, I prefer a lot of the stuff from the vanilla HW, and would love to see it return, but I realize, not all of it is possible by patching the game. And I'm ok with it. Now I can't wait to play through HW2 campaign too, and try out the MP.So yes I do recommend this to die hard fans of both Homeworld 1 & 2, but only if you're not extremely picky about old HW1 mechanics and are willing to play through this game with slightly different approach.If you've never played HW games before, get it now!Oh, and you get both old classics along, so this to me, is a great deal. Thumbs up!			"

												Can some people have fun with this game? Yes. Can I, personally, recommend this? No, sorry. You licked my lollipop, rewrapped it, and then sold it back to me; what did you expect.Full disclosure: I own the original disc versions of HW1, HWC, and HW2, and have been a big fan of at least the first two.I played the crap out of Homeworld 1 and Cataclysm for years, both the campaigns and multiplayer. I rediscovered them all over again several times, when unpacking boxes or reinstalling a new PC. They are at the top of my all-time favourite games.HW2: I think I finished the campaign once, and not in one go. It just felt like a step back from the previous ones, for several reasons. Still, it entertained me for a good while and in some way stilled my hunger for a continuation of the HW1/HWC line.Was I excited about a remaster? Absolutely; I like shiny new graphics and better sounds, and I looked forward to having the games install and work 'out of the box' on current day OS. But for me, that was literally all they needed to do. Because functionally, HW1/HWC already worked exactly as they were.For me, they could not have done this remaster any more wrong if they'd tried:* They picked the wrong engine. If it was at all true that they could not do a remaster of both with each their own engine, I would've picked HW1 over HW2 every day and twice on sunday, From my perspective, it would've made their job easier: just dumb down the HW2 races/campaign to ignore the superior HW1 formations and strafing and ballistics, et voilá, HW2 on HW1 engine. Besides, this argument reeks: they went to the trouble of completely redoing/reinventing the HW1 campaign and ships and balance on a HW2 engine... and that was somehow less effort than simply keeping those parts of the existing source code unchanged? Hogwash.* They picked the wrong UI. Yes, it took a few moments and maybe a peek at the manual to figure out how to call up the HW1 UI, but the almost entire absence of it made Space(tm) feel Real(tm). I agree that the research/build/launch dialogs would have benefited from an overlay implementation, but functionally they worked much better than HW2.* They picked the wrong camera movement. In HW1, when rotating the camera with right mouse click, the pivot point is the ship or object you focused on. This feels utterly natural, because that is what focus means: maintain your view on your point of interest while rotating to get an overview of all that surrounds it. In HW2, the camera instead pivots on itself. Aside from breaking immersion (wait a minute, am I part of this story, or am I filming it?), it does not maintain focus on what you told it to. Homeworld is not an FPS!* They killed the AI in so many ways. Strikegroups break formation the moment they start moving, or never form up the way it was intended in the first place (sphere guard, anyone?), broken pathing makes ships get stuck in places, ships forget halfway what they were ordered to do and need to be reissued so they don't either stop in the middle of nowhere or decide to do some suicide move on their own.* The remastered graphics and sounds, while pretty and certainly a significant step up from the originals, end up being underwhelming when compared to community mods like Complex which have been available for years.And as if messing up the Remastered versions wasn't enough:* They messed with the 'Classics'. Yes, they included a 'Classic' version that supposedly kept the original experience intact for those who may not like all the changes in Remastered. Which I would've been happy with, except... they kept the bugs/shortcomings intact (no widescreen/high resolution support unless hacked through registry), but they messed with things that should and could have been left alone (load/save no longer compatible with original savegames; LAN multiplayer removed; D3D/sw rendering removed).Why? Especially that last one: it was already becoming difficult to make the originals work on current hardware and OS... and they go and remove compatibility options that existed in the originals! What exactly is the point of including HW2C then? It's not as pretty as HW2R, *and* it's now almost as bad about backwards compatibility. Pointless. If you need a lighter version to run on somewhat lesser hardware, just run HW2R with all graphics options turned to minimum. (except now, since they removed the other pre-existing rendering options, it's OpenGL 3.3 or nothing. Sucks to be you if you don't have updated compatible drivers).I played a few missions into HW1R before I got too irritated and went back to HW1C. Two missions short of the end of that campaign, they then published a patch for the Remastered version that somehow managed to break load/save in HW1C, making it freeze and crash on loading savegames created just days/hours before.  So I ended up playing halfway through the campaign on my original disc versions before even feeling like trying again.Did I miss the remastered resources while playing HW1C / HW1 original? Quite honestly, not in the least. They are a shiny bonus, indisputably, but simply have no bearing on the masterpiece that was and still is HW1.In the end, I just feel duped for letting my nostalgia win and buying into the pre-order. This collection does not deliver: it removed what was good and added new gripes, in exchange of some shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds. On top of things, where my original dics versions came with the soundtracks included, now they want additional cash just for the soundtracks (which are not even complete btw, something about licensing quarrels).I noticed some people keep arguing that it's 'only' been days/weeks since release, that we cannot expect everything to work right yet, that we should allow them to get feedback and patch things. I regard this a non-argument.Under normal circumstances, with a production from scratch, that argument already makes me grit my teeth. Software/gaming has to be the only industry where consumers not just accept, but even *defend* incomplete and bugged-to-hell product releases. This should not be acceptable, and if consumer rights were anywhere near any other industry, we'd all be eligible for a refund.BUT THIS IS NOT A NEW RELEASE!! They had full access to the original sources. Again: they started with full access to the original source code. They even had the original developers assist them! And even with all that, their release is broken through bugs or intention. They do not get to claim 'needing time to fix inevitable issues' when those issues are in most cases clearly caused by meddling with code that did not need to be touched to begin with.Whether some people may like HW1/HW2 Remastered the way they are is frankly irrelevant to me. I'm sure there's plenty of people that feel Mona Lisa's smile could use a little retouching. It still does not make it right to put a marker to the master piece. If the original developers felt like they didn't get to make their 'definitive' version of Homeworld before, they could've saved that for Homeworld 3, or more likely, a future DLC for Homeworld Remastered.End verdict: A lot of money for shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds packaged with broken functionality, which makes at least this vet go back to the originals.P.S.: for the ones asking about Steam showing my play time increasing - that is me trying out the dozens of mods already coming out trying to restore what Classic/Remastered changed from the originals. Just let that sink in: the community, with limited tools and gimped access to game data, making right what the developers couldn't do with full access to everything.			"

												What is there to say about this game?It's 16 years old, putting some fancy graphics on it literally makes every Space RTS of the past decade run in fear.The Music is top notch, screw your Dubstep and Hipster music, this game has Classic music and you will love it to death (and one rock song in the credits).The Story is intriguing and atmospheric, if you are one for the story part of a game, this will be your Mousse au Chocolat on cheesecake with a cherry on top.The Gameplay is easy to understand, at first it might seem overwhelming, but the learning curve is not too steep.The Graphic has improved, thanks to the Remaster, to a very to-date level with many options to fine tune it to your liking.What you get for 30€ are one of the best RTS (And for me THE best Space RTS) games ever made, plus it's sequel, in a fancy new look while keeping everything that made Homeworld the outstanding game that attracted a huge fanbase 16 years ago, and if you don't want to play the updated graphics, you also get the original classic versions as well!10/10 If you are a Homeworld fan this is a must buy!

												I'll start with the obvious: yes, the remastered graphics and sound are absolutely beautiful. That alone almost makes this a worthy buy. HOWEVER...This is Homeworld 1 re-created in the Homeworld 2 engine, which is actually a major downgrade. There are major differences that make this bad.- They removed the ballistics system. Ship attacks are all random-number generator rolls now.- They removed the ship tactics. You can't select aggressive or evasive tactics anymore.- Formations still exist, but they don't actually work.- Unit pathfinding is pathetic. Ships can get stuck easily.Aside from the 3-dimensional game space, these were the things that made the game unique and exceptional. Without them, Homeworld 1 loses its most important elements, and you end up micromanaging your units instead of leveraging the brilliant ship formation and tactics system.			"

												Hands down, one of the Best RTS Games of All Time.And now that it finally has the ability to not only work properly on Modern Day OS'es, ALONG WITH Updated Gameplay, Remastered Graphics, Improved Multiplayer, etc.... AND the fact that I get both the Classic Versions AND the Remastered Versions of both HW1 & HW2 in one?! Why the hell ANY FAN of this game in the past would turn this game away is just beyond my ♥♥♥♥!The fact that we can now fight each other in Multiplayer with all 4 races from both the 1st and 2nd Homeworld Games is just absolutely fantastic. That was something I always wanted to do in the past, and now I can do so without mods! How could I possibly say ""No"" to this game?!However, there are some things to note. A lot of people have been complaining about some of the balance changes specifically regarding Frigates and Capital Ships. Primarily the fact that their HP has been DRASTICALLY nerfed since the originals. And unfortunately, I completely agree. I find this nerf to be very unnecessary and kinda makes capital ships and frigates to be a lot less useful as they used to be. Thankfully, however, there is a fix for this in the workshop.There is a mod called ""Remastered Re-Balanced"" that is available to get in the Steam Workshop that fixes nearly Every Single Problem I have with the Rebalancing Changes that Gearbox made. If you wanna play this game and fix all the problems that are present with the Remastered Versions with Frigates and Captial Ships, along with many other things as well, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting that mod. It will make your game 10 times better. You have my assurance on that one.Now with that said, some people are gonna be confused as to why Homeworld: Cataclysm was not included in the Remastered Collection. The reason behind this is because the Original Source Code of Homeworld Cataclysm is currently Missing. The original game developers of Cataclysm are long gone now. But Gearbox has said if anyone has any leads to where that Source Code may be, to report it to them immediately. But honesttly, it could also be said that it might just be easier to re-do the whole game from scratch at this point. But regardless, there's already a mod in the Workshop right now that allows you to play as the Somtaaw in HW2 Remastered. So that's definitely a start. But I still would have loved to play as The Beast again. Hopefully someone will make a mod of that too if Gearbox doesn't remaster Cataclysm.But the bottom line here is this:This Game is a MASTERPIECE. If you love Sci-Fi RTS Games and if you love things like Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, etc.... This game will MOST DEFINITELY be something to pick up........What, are you still reading this? GO! Buy this game right now! Stop reading and do it! It's worth every single penny in your wallet that you spend on it! It's a Legendary Spart RTS, for Christ Sake! GO! NOW!			"

												Take yourself back to a simpler time. A happier time. A time when PDAs were cool, people wore really high jeans, and when Homeworld was released.That's right. Take yourself back to September of 1999. I was 7.This was a time when strategy games were designed to be pursued and beaten over the course of weeks or months, a time when game designers weren't afraid to kick you in the balls and tell you that you were terrible at their game, and a time when thousands of Homeworld players ripped their hair out after spending hours harvesting resources only to have their fleet obliterated in one short battle.As a 7-year-old, I did not possess the mental faculties to fully understand the majestic space banana or its purpose as the salvation of a species. I was completely unable to tactically order my fleets through the three dimensional battlefield.  As such, I had no hope of navigating the campaign, but what I could do was build hundreds of space fighters, frigates, capital ships, and carriers, and watch in awe as an epic battle between two armadas unfolded before my very eyes in all its polygonal glory. Many happy hours were spent watching interceptors swerve around capital ships while my ion frigates bombarded them from afar.Oh that magic nostalgia feeling. How welcome it is. Homeworld remastered has taken the elegant design of the original game (something I'm now more equipped to appreciate) and made it more palatable with gorgeous visuals and streamlined interfaces while keeping the incredible atmosphere, mystery, and ♥♥♥-poundingly difficult strategy that we all know and love. A million thumbs up.			"

												7/10Essentially Homeworld 1 skins in the Homeworld 2 engine.  If you've never played the original Homeworld, the remastered version is the game for you.  If you have, however, you'll come to realize that Homeworld 2 was a step back in terms of strategy and micromanagement of your fleet.  The formations in the original Homeworld, for example, allowed ships to move in an ACTUAL formation.  In Homeworld 2, these formations break apart as soon as you move in any direction besides forward.  Another thing is ship intelligence.  In the original Homeworld, heavy/multigun corvettes tended to strafe around the target, with their fronts facing the target.  This allowed maximum damage since no gun was obstructed by another.  In Homeworld 2, the ""strafe"" of corvettes is just a circular movment around the target, no fronts facing at all.  This meant that damage output is reduced, since the guns on the opposite sides do nothing.  Oh, and difficulty scaling.  Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ difficuly scaling (Sea of lost souls mission on remastered...like no..just kill yourself).  These three things are the most disappointing aspects of the remastered, in my opinion.  There are a bunch of others I didn't cover but I'm sure somebody has in the reviews of this collection.  All in all, this collection is really just a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  Graphics are top notch and so is the UI.  The original versions of the games are also included (which is freaking awesome).  Get this collection even if you have or haven't played this game.  For the old vets, it's a nostalgic trip and for the new players, its an experience you don't want to miss.			"

												I was bored and waiting for a train one day in August and saw an issue of PC Gamer, a ""100 Greatest PC Games"" special issue. Homeworld Remastered was at spot number 62. I tend to suck at RTS but I added it to my wishlist for later. I impulsively bought it the other day, after games higher in PC Gamer's list didn't quite click with me, and it's shaping up to be one of my best purchases on Steam ever.You play as a race of peoples whose culture and history have been erased, but have managed to preserve a map to their ancestral homeworld. Your attempts to reach the homeworld are resisted by an Empire, with whom your people have had contact thousands of years prior. The story is wonderfully enigmatic, and poignant, and thrilling. There's a curious religious element several stages in, which I also won't spoil. Mission objectives are varied, with unexpected twists and emergency changes of plan when things often go awry. The interfaces are beautiful and clean, and the mechanics of the game are fairly easy to pick up, with a short tutorial that should cover everything you need to know.So yeah.TL;DR -- Doesn't matter if you're not a strategy or RTS buff. Unless you don't like space and are allergic to fun buy this now. P.S. And if you're curious how this game looked in 1999, you have the option to play each of the games in classic mode.P.P.S. Damn Homeworld II is way harder than Homeworld I ;_;			"

												Singleplayer review Homeworld, first released in 1999 and developed by Relic Entertainment, is a science fiction real-time strategy game. This was their first breakout success and was met with critical acclaim and successful sales, which lead to a sequel. In 2015, Gearbox decided it was time Homeworld became accessible to a modern audience. Working with most of the original development team, they painstakingly remastered the two original games. Their time and effort really paid off with this beautiful and lovingly crafted remake.PlotFor a Space RTS one would expect the story to be a bit one-note. Thankfully that isn’t the case with Homeworld, as the story is one of almost movie quality. It begins 100 years in the past. The world you live on is a harsh desert world, with its people split into warring tribes and factions. One day a crashed spaceship is discovered in the desert. Inside this spaceship, a stone table is found. The only two things on it are a map to a planet and the word ""Hiigara"" — home. The discovery of this tablet proves that the people are not as alone in the galaxy as they thought and this unites the factions. Jump forward 100 years and you start the game at the grand launch of the ""Mothership"". Thanks to what was learned from the crashed spaceship, this is the first ship capable of traveling at hyperspeed. What starts of as a routine test of the Mothership’s hyperspeed engine quickly turns into an ambush by an unknown enemy. To say any more about the story would lessen the impact it would have for new players. So the main mission is to overcome many perils and to guide your people to the lost homeworld of ""Hiligara""GameplayHomeworld doesn't really break the RTS mold, as the main focus is still on gathering resources, building a fleet and using it to destroy enemy ships to complete objectives. The one thing Homeworld does differently is the movement of ships. Because Homeworld is set in space, ships can move not only forwards, backwards, left and right, but can also travel upwards and downwards. This adds a whole extra dimension to fighting. You are not limited to a flat plain, but can use height for tactical advantage or even retreat to escape enemies. With this you have two view modes in which to control your fleet: Standard mode, which is the standard view mode with which you can select ships or watch battles or Tactical mode, which gives you extra details on where your ships are heading and gives a much easier representation and understanding on what height your ships are at compared to enemy ships. This mode is mainly used for precise movement of ships through the battlefield.Level and game designThe campaign for Homeworld 1 is broken up into 16 levels, with Homeworld 2 being structured very much the same way. The player starts out with an objective and then must accomplish this objective before they can proceed to the next. In between each level is a voice acted black and white animated cutscene, which acts as narrative progression. While common today, it was a very unique way of telling a story back in the days before 3D rendered cutscenes. The look and feel of the game goes without saying. Anyone, who has played a Relic RTS in the past, can expect the same smooth and responsive unit control and well detailed vehicle models. The game is full of beautiful backdrops of various parts of space, from moons to bright and vibrant suns, they really set the mood and feel of the game. To also accompany that is the amazing soundtrack that just helps add so much atmosphere and wonder to the whole story. The use of orchestral instruments and choirs during the beginning of the game just gives such a sense wonder and vastness, which fits the fact that your people have to travel the vast void of space in search of a home. But as the game goes on the tranquil music turns to strange tense hunting music, drums and alarms to really put you on your toes, knowing that the enemy is everywhere trying to hunt you down. Sci Fis of the time, such as Battlestar Galactica, obviously had a huge influence over the soundtrack.If any complaints have to be made, then it can be said that the movement system can be a bit tricky. Due to the 3D movement of ships, it can take a while to understand and get used to at first, as it isn’t very intuitive. That being said, there's a tutorial at the beginning of the game. Another minor gripe is the steep difficulty curve. Some missions are a walk in the park with others being extremely tough. It does help to make the levels very rewarding to beat though.In conclusion, Homeworld Remastered is a very solid and complete package. This is a perfect example of what a remaster should be, not only including the original unedited non-remastered versions of the games, but also reworking everything from adding a new game engine, re-recording voice lines by the original voice actors and a fully remastered score. Relic has outdone themselves by putting so much love and care into this re-telling of an amazing story. With two games and multiplayer modes for each, Homeworld is sure to keep players occupied for hours on end!			"

												On the positive side: The game is very, very pretty when it works correctly, and it includes the complete untouched originals as a bonus, except they actually work correctly on Windows 7 64-bit from what I'm seeing. Homeworld remains one of the greatest PC games ever made. The uniqueness and originality of Relic's game is still unmatched and it required very little touch-up work to remain breathtakingly beautiful.On the negative side: Homeworld Remastered has many bugs which you will discover rapidly. I certainly did, in my first few minutes of play. The tutorials do not work; the voice instruction speeds by without waiting for you to hit 'ok' to continue, and hitting 'ok' will in fact skip a section of voice. The tutorial in HW1R is in fact for HW2, not HW1; it includes HW2's ships. Achievements do not work; they only unlock when you leave the game, and even then it seems to be a fifty-fifty tossup whether you get ones that you earned in your last play session. The game is highly unstable; I had to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times due to the game entering a state of crashing whenever you did anything at the launcher, and I'm still not sure what's causing the instability. If you have any sort of desktop overlay software running, for example MSI Overdrive, AMD Raptr, Stardock's Windowblinds and Deskscapes, or even apparently the steam overlay(!) you will suffer graphical glitches including transparent ships, broken UI effects and broken HDR effects.I'm keeping the game because I like having a version of HW classic that works on my machine. I wish the remastered edition worked equally as well. Hopefully in the future patches will fix this, at which point I will change my opinion to positive.			"

UPDaTE:the devs have finally decided to update formations, ballistics and AI behaviour.I will thoroughly test it and as those are the major downsides of the Re-release so far I might give the game a recommendation if those issues are gone after the patch!Until HW1 remastered formations are fixed you can't claim that it's an improvement over the original. Formations and stances are the very essence of Homeworld. If you mess this up, you failed. Get this fixed, and the remastered collection will be very close to a recommendation!HW1 classic is (apart from the graphics) still the superior version. This shouldn't be.The Good-graphic engine updates are awesome and it's a joy to look at-succeeds in recreating the original atmosphere-many bugfixes since release, see patch logsThe Bad-still bugs in ship behaviour (some got fixed!, see patch logs)-minor campaign mission design flaws that were not there in the original (lots of fixes here, too)-HW 1+2 races mixed in multiplayer. Pretty much unbalanced, because...(see next chapter)The Ugly-HW2 engine for HW1. This means: squads not working properly, stances broken. Strike craft behave...just wrong. Sphere formation while guarding broken. A nuisance!-refueling for covettes/fighters gone. I did like complexity...oh well.-squishy cap ships-HW1 ship management tuned down in complexity. Many tactics don't work because stances AND formations are broken. See above. So, some flaws will be patched, others may be modded. Until then, don't buy if you're a true fan and conaisseur of the original HW series. I hate to say it, but I'm rather disappointed. Wait until they get their job done!			"

My review. First of all I want to start off with the positives. The game has been beautifully remastered. The graphics are unimaginably improved from the original 1999 release and runs smoothly even on the highest graphics settings. Ive heard though some people have been getting black screens on startup. It is the first release of the remastered collection so some problems like that are expected.Now I have to get a bit Nit-PickyIf you are thinking this is truely Homeworld1 remastered, think again. Many parts of the gameplay have been changed from how they were in the original. For instance fighters no longer require fuel, research costs money, ship count limits have become stricter, etc. These changes are welcomed by some and detested by some. The remastered version also uses Homeworld2's UI. It is cleaner and more modern than that used by HW1 but many argue that it provides a lot of meaningless information and takes away from the more simplistic feel of the original.There are many more bugs in the game than I expected. Formations for strikecraft are completely useless as no matter what tactics you assign to your fighter squadrons they always break formation when engaging enemies. A lot of the original formations and tactics functionality has been destroyed. The AI pathfinding is pretty bizare. I formally sent my findings regarding these bugs to gearbox and they tried to assure me via E-mail that they are working hard on the issues mentioned and are trying to pop out a patch within the month. Not sure it will actually happen but I am happy about gearbox's enthusiam for improving their product.Despite the bugs and sometimes unwelcome changes I still reccomend the collection to anyone. I advise older fans of the game like me to do more research into the changes in the remastered before being completely commited. That being said the collection still includes legal no-cd versions of both original games and is alone worth the money. The remastered versions and revitalized multiplayer are welcome bonuses.= UPDATE =After a long wait formations and tactics have been returned to the game. Now it is so more like the real old thing that it is worth everything to play again. It is once again a great game and I strongly reccomend it. Now that it has proper working formations tactics and ballistics the game is so much better.			"

												A few years ago I began searching for a space RTS. I found a game called Homeworld. Allthough I was unable to play the game due to it not being downloadable and the region I am in. So I played other games and kept Homeworld in the back of my mind. Last week when i noticed it was coming to steam I jumped all over it. After playing Nexas Jupiter Incedent and the Sins series, I was left with a want of more. I wanted Sins openness of the skirmishes and the relaistic feel and look of Nexas. My first hands on with HW was great. I love the viuals and its feels relistic too. The radio chatter is very good as well. The only issue for me is how the campaign is mission based (I would like a big galaxy to build my empire and live amoungst the others) so I tried skirmish. The maps are too small and really result in quick deathmathes in skirmishes. All the while I am still loving the game I just needed it to offer more freedom. So I went looking for the perfect mod. I found Complex mod. Its exactly what I wass looking for and in my opinion makes the game what it should be and to me the best space game out there. Complex has a skirmish map that is 60000 km. Its basiclly a galaxy for you to skirimsh on. But its so big you have to use hyper space to travel long distances making it hard to be found and easy to disapear. If you like space, rts games, and you feel u havnt found that game yet. This game migh just do for you what it has done for me. I suggest using complex mod. It can only be used with classis HW2 for now, but you will not regret it. Remastered is great but with no mods to help me immerse myself into the galaxy, I will stick with HW2 classic for now.My Verdict:Visuals 9/10Sound 10/10Gameplay 10/10Replay Value 9/10Mods 10/109.5/10 without mods10/10 with modsThanks for reading.

												Homeworld 1 and 2 are still the best RTS games out there. They were way ahed of their time when they were released and they are still amazing. Epic tactical battles in 3D enviroment, fantastic music, fantastic ship design. Gearbox made a nice remaster and I can recommend it. I didn't had any problems so far, but it seems some people did so check your recommended configuration before buying it. Atmosphere in this game is also worth mentioning. It's not some dull zerg-rush RTS, it has interesting story (HW1 story better then HW2) and it's definately worth playing. If you're an old player, then you'll want to bring back memories and if you're new, believe me, in all these years I still haven't found better RTS.Mothership is standing by...

												While I'm a big fan of Homeworld franchise and nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself when they've announced a remastered edition, I must say they didn't do a very good job. 1st thing, the most important, is that the ships from the 1st installment (especially fighters and corvettes) behave the same way as in the 2nd game. And this is terrible, since fighters and corvettes work different in both games. Now in Homeworld1 I can't order my corvettes to stay in formation and unleash a wall of destruction upon their targets, instead they are flying around targets, and utilize half their guns at one time to hit the target, instead of all-gun barrage. I can't order my interceptors to stay in X formation and become a serious threat to single targets, instead they disperse and get destroyed by ridiculously accuracy-boosted assault frigates. And navigating in sensors manager is not as good as it was in original games (both of them). I do not reccomend this game, since it destroyed the gameplay mechanics of the first installment of the series.			"

												Oh god, I love this game. Not only does this game have the benefit of the nostalgia that I so deeply cherish, it also has the benefit of a kickass developer pulling the reigns. Gearbox are just good people, they took a well known and beloved classic and wanted to make another game in the series, but before they did that they decided to remaster the original games from the ground up, while preserving the original feel and design to the game.To add to that, they also just optimised the original games, leaving the memories completely intact.It also doesn't hurt that this game is just, ♥♥♥♥ing, beautiful. I just have eye ♥♥♥♥♥♥s whenever I play, it's fantastic.(To enable Theatre mode: Press escape twice, press backspace four times, more games need this feature.)I can't recommend this game enough, if you are looking for an intense Space RTS experience that kicks you in the balls during the story and in gameplay, then this is for you.Please, for the love of all things RTS and classic, buy this game, show big companies that a faithful remaster is all what the fans are looking for, teach AAA developers to do more things like this, to not ♥♥♥♥ on beloved franchises just for the sake of a money grab, to be good people.Buy this game, you won't regret it.

												This review assumes you've already played Homeworld 1 or 2 before.tl;dr If you were hoping for a faithful and direct Homeworld 1 port - I'm sorry. You aren't getting it. This is Homeworld 2 with Homeworld 1 assets dropped in. Almost all HW1 related gameplay mechanics that made the game stand out, are gone.Pros:Upgraded graphics and UI; better multiplayer options (Relics, objectives, tech level, etc.), higher quality audio. Some under the hood changes to make HW2 mods easier to port and give modders some more tools. In the end, there's not really much to say on the pro side. We already know that both games are pretty good. Quality storyline (though the second game doesn't follow through like the first does) good art design, detailing, etc. If you've played the game before, you know all that. As such, most of this is...Cons:Most gameplay elements from Homeworld 1 have been completely stripped away to shoehorn it into Homeworld 2's engine: Ships do not stick to formation during attack runs; missile destroyers output a constant stream of missiles instead of a short high-dps alpha strike; Support frigates are essentially useless - they no longer repair larger ships, and with the removal of fuel requirements, strikecraft no longer dock and repair automatically at them; you can no longer exceed fleet limits with salvage in HW1- probably one of the most-liked defining 'bugs' of the game; multiplayer requires a 3rd-party DRM/sign-up to play; there is no way to disable mouse acceleration/smoothing or change mouse sensitivity; on multi-monitor setups panning is frustrating because the mouse isn't captured to the screen; UI elements come in four sizes: Big, really big, humongous, and jesus christ it's huge; multiplayer is in an unfinished beta state.I bought this game specifically for Homeworld 1 multiplayer - the original is no longer playable because it relied on a 3rd-party system called Gamespy. This remastered version of the game now ALSO relies on a 3rd-party system/DRM check called Shift, so who even knows how long multiplayer will be available. Certainly not nearly a decade like the original Homeworld 2.The rub is this:If you are like me, and you wanted to play Homeworld 1 like it was, in singleplayer or multiplayer; skip it. This is Homeworld 2 with Homeworld 1 ships in it, repackaged and resold. Modders have already done this with Homeworld 2. None of Homeworld 1's game mechanics made it into this ""remaster"".If you are only interested in Homeworld 1 or 2 with an updated coat of paint, and don't care for Homeworld 1's game mechanics, then it's worth a buy after a price drop. (As of writing, the game is nearly $40).Frankly, this game is an insult to Homeworld 1 fans. I can't say I'm surprised that the dev team took the easy way and just dropped HW1 assets into HW2 without doing anything to actually make them work - we're talking Gearbox here. I should've known better than to put money down with them at the helm.-----That said, most Homeworld fans have only played the second game, so in terms of mass appeal, this game still works. A lot of people are excited about their favourite Homeworld 2 mods - Complex, etc. being ported, and these people will likely be quite happy with the game. If you're a Homeworld 1 fan though, you got shafted.			"

												I don't think that ""remastered"" means what Gearbox thinks it means. While the game has had a significant face-lift bringing the graphic detail of the units and surrounding space to current resolutions. The major drawback is that they didn't really remaster many of the controls or flesh out some much-needed tactical options like ""don't deliberately crash into asteroids"" or ""hey, guys everyone come here… except you, go chase that guy and die!"". A lot of the UI feels a sloppy instead of being tightly bolted down and intuitive and much of what you didn't like about the original is still there in large parts. In a few cases it's made worse with widely variable strafing that will make you question whether your frigate captains are actually cats high on catnip. The graphics are fantastic, but the game is largely unchanged and not improved upon where it was sorely needed. As an unnecessary bonus, I can make the menu UI take up 90% of the screen.			"

												Homeworld is possibly one of my favorite space games in terms of game mechanics, music and visual art style this game does a fantastic job at it. Especially now that it's remastered. Not only does this game offer the remastered first and second game. But also the classic versions as well!I won't spoil the story in this review. Simply because it needs to be played. The only thing I can say bad about this game is persistent bugs. (Yes, you read that line correctly) for instance some mission triggers don't happen right away or not at all forcing players to reload an autosave or outright starting the mission all over again. But as everything else stands? This game is playable.Also there is an active modding community bringing intersting mods to the game. The tutorial is really straight forward so you won't get lost at the controls. Now the missions themselves, while some of them are straight forward. Other missions can be a pain in the butt. You will have to micro-manage your resources in order to survive some of these encounters as it can go from ""All quiet"" to ""IT'S A TRAP"" in a matter of minutes or seconds. Overall if you like space battles on an almost epic grand scale. Then I recommend the Homeworld Remasted Collection.			"

												Homeworld Remastered was released in February of 2015. In spite of being a Homeworld fan, I decided to wait for the reviews; and I was glad that I did. While the game was not short of impressing people for its new visual enhancements + the merging of both games units and assets for a unified game, the developers neglected some very important details on the game that we all love. The formations in Homeworld Remastered were screwed up. In the Original Homeworld, people remember the fact that formations assigned to groups of units actually impacted their ability to effectively and efficiently dispose enemies. As explained in details by one of the reviewers: that whole aspect was stripped away as a different method for damage calculation was done on ship to ship combat. The problem was, individual ships didn't feel individual anymore, the formations did not chew up hostile ships like they were supposed to; and that right there frusterated me, which believe it or not: deterred me from buying this game. It was only over a year after in the fine month of June 2016, that the game developers decided to release a patch which RESTORED this crucial gameplay aspect. The formations are back and are effective again! The only complaint is you can't make larger formations (large spheres would be nice). Two hours into the game, I have been satisfied with my conclusion that the game is now fixed, and the good old mechanics have returned! Coupled with the new visuals, multiplayer support, mod support and Homeworld 1 and 2 content merge; I would say this is a rather spectacular title that is worth grabbing. The 2.0 patch really did it a good number, and even though I have my doubts about Gearbox; I am honestly surprised. If you like Space RTS games with 3-dimensional movement, formations, tactics and fleet battles; I highly recommend this game. Originally made by Relic; Homeworld was and still is a one of a kind RTS game to me. Pros:+Unit formations work.+Content merge of HW1 and HW2 for interesting battles.+Very nice visuals.+Multiplayer support.+Mod support.+Modern OS support.+Everything that made Homeworld great. Cons:-There is no way to save custom paint schemes, preview for ships allows no rotation for viewing models.Overall: This game is worth it now, kudos to a company for listening to its critics and fixing something, rather than ignoring them altogether. There may be hope for gaming.  "

												Homeworld is one of the best space RTS games ever created. Slower paced than modern frenzy RTS games, Homeworld lets the vast quiet of space sink in as an amazing soundtrack acompanies your journey. The story is top notch and the voyage  hits all the right emotional notes. The remastered version looks amazing and holds its own against all of the modern RTS juggernauts. Purists will also be happy to know that the original Homeworld 1 & 2 come packaged with this version as well. If you have never experienced Homeworld or are an avid space/rts fan, you would be remiss to not play this game.			"

												As someone who skipped the original series I would definitely recommend this game! Music, arts, voice acting are working together to create amazing atmosphere. I'm not sure I've experienced anything like this before. Campaign is interesting, can't say it brings something unexpected but it's decent. Just finished Homeworld 1 and looking forward to play Homeworld 2.Graphics looks good. Good effects, loots of options. Can't say that it's optimized well though.Can't say anything about multiplayer, I'm not really interested in it.Bugs: don't be fooled, it has some. One crash, one uncompletable mission and few minor bugs in controls and behaviour of units, but overall it's ok. And they fixing it, in particular that mission was fixed the day I've encountered it. :)In general it's one of the best games I've played in a long time, definitly the best in this year so far!			"

												In a word, dissapointed.If you are looking for remastered HW1 do not buy this game in its current state.  If you are looking for remastered HW2 you will enjoy it.  The remaster is HW1 ported into a tweaked HW2 engine.  The HW2 engine has limitations that break or substantially change core mechanics for HW1.The Good:-Looks fantastic.  Manages to update ship models and graphics while keeping the feel and asthetics of the orginal-Its pretty-It really does look niceThe Bad:-Formations (one of the best and most important mechanics in the game) are flat out  broken in HW1  (HW2 limitation)-No bullet ballistics, hits are determined by RNG (HW2 limitation)-No Evasive mode for units-No fuel for fighters (Probably a HW2 limitation)-Good number of crash bugs, sound bugs, and gameplay bugs of varying seriousnessHopefully formations will be patched but the cause is a HW2 engine limitation so dont hold your breath. All this really needed was a new paint job but unfortunately core gameplay was lost in the process.  Currently this is a dissapointment and I wish I could get my money back.			"

It seems that they belong to the ""only multiplayer matters; wreck singleplayer at will"" mindset; as a result, while skirmish and multiplayer works quite well, the HW1 single player campaign is badly messed up by their methods for combining HW1 and HW2 into a single multiplayer environment.From the start you're plagued with insufficient resources to build enough ships. You're almost guaranteed to fail the second mission, unless you know the trick: while Heavy Corvettes have been badly screwed up, salvage corvettes now steal anything bigger than a fighter. So you go from, ""Wtf? 3 Interceptors just wiped out 5 Heavy Corvettes?"" to ""Wow, if I have interceptors and salvage corvettes, I can steal EVERYTHING.""So the game goes in a flash from stupidly, head-bangingly messed up to OP'd and too easy, and has been transformed into a pirate game. Also, the option to play the campaign through as Taiidan has been, frustratingly, removed.Needs a LOT of work. NOT recommended in present form.			"

												Note: This review was originally written prior to the 2.0 rebalance patch.  While the 2.0 patch gets the game to much better state, the original version of Homeworld 1 still remains better playing than the Remastered version; I have to stand by my thumbs down.---Homeworld 1 is in my opinion the far better of the two games and is unfortunately not well maintained in the Remastered version.Homeworld 1 was a game of relatively slow naval battles.  There was time to plan meaningful maneuvers, and the game has a certain grace many other RTSes lack as a result.  Carefully managing the units you had was in many ways more important than simply building a large number of units or even always matching units against their appropriate counter-units in fights.Homeworld 2 was headed by a new lead designer who decided to throw out most of what made HW1 feel unique and just make a Starcraft clone.  Rock-paper-scissors balance taken to extremes; huge fleets that could be wiped out in seconds; a game won more by clicks-per-second and sheer numbers than strategy.  It lost much of its grace and was a massive disappointment for me.  On top of that, another of its problems was a very poorly implemented dynamic difficulty system that scaled the number of enemies you'd face on some missions based on your fleet size and resources at the start of the mission.  On paper it's an ok idea, but in practice it punishes you for keeping your fleet alive and wasn't well tested or balanced so that sometimes you would face an unreasonable number of enemies.Homeworld Remastered puts the first game in the second's engine, and it is unfortunately rebalanced to be more like the second - complete with poorly implemented dynamic difficulty scaling.  Version 1.0 was nearly unplayable due to the balance being so bad.  The 2.0 patch pushes balance a bit closer back to true Homeworld 1 and reigns in the unreasonable difficulty scaling, but it still doesn't feel right.  Fleets that were viable with careful management in the original game still get wiped out too quickly.  Strike craft aren't as effective as they should be.  Plus there are AI problems with the units not engaging enemies the way they should.This isn't just a matter of me wanting the game to exactly duplicate Homeworld 1 due to nostalgia goggles.  I replayed the original recently and I still think it's a better balanced, more entertaining game than the compromised version of it they crammed into the Remastered engine. It's an incredible shame because the updated graphics of the Remastered version are great. I'll grant that building essentially two Remastered versions from scratch (one based on HW1's engine and another based on HW2) would be a bit too much to ask, and I'm thankful that they included the original versions in this package.  However, given that the Remastered version is a fairly big departure from the original, it is disappointing that they couldn't then do a very bare minimum of work to make the original versions more easily playable on modern systems.  Specifically, it's always been possible to configure HW1 to run in modern widescreen resolutions but it requires a registry edit to do so - not too hard for a savvy user, but still annoying.  Would it really have been that hard for them to do minimal things like update the options menu to be able to directly select modern resolutions?			"

												An excellent remake of an excellent game. The games hold up extremely well, even though the games are 16 and 12 years old. The devs reworked everything from the ground up as opposed to improving some textures like in most HD remakes. I finished the first campaign and played a few skirmish games and haven't encountered any bugs. The multiplayer is still in beta at this time since they are letting all the factions across both games play against each other, and things aren't balanced yet. There is a new UI and controls, mostly revamping the HW1 controls to make them more like HW2, and getting rid of refeuling for strikecraft in HW1. Ignore people that are complaining about this because it makes HW1 10x more playable. On the down side the formations from HW1, that were crucial to using strike craft don't work in the remastered version. Hopefully this will be fixed in a patch, but if you want a faithful HW1 experience the set includes both HW1 and 2 in their original untouched forms. Also I believe the campaign has gotten easier. I can't verify if this is because the game is simply easier or because I have played so much of it over the years.HW has a slower pace, so if you prefer 5 minute multiplayer matches HW might not be fore you. The story is very good, a rarity for a RTS, also the soundtrack and art is also amazing. The HW franchise was so ahead of its time that it is still innovative more than a decade on. No space based RTS has ever come close to besting it. The modding community has been active for the past 2 years for HW2 specifically, so you can expect a lot of mods comming out shortly. I wouldn't be surpirsed if HW: Remastered won many RTS of the year awards, like it did when it came out years ago. These games are a must play if you like RTSs or space based games.			"

												First of all: This is a wonderful thing. If you have not played this game before and like RTS Games, ignore anything I type below and just get the game. You will like it, especially the single player story. The name of the game is Remastered. Sadly, due to the use of the Homeworld 2.5 Engine, Homeworld 1 suffers. This may get fixed in later patches and does certainly not take away any from the remarkable experience. It will just be different as to how you remember it. This is however worth your time.			"

												Im one of the People what played Homeworld and Homeworld 2 back in the days so maybemy Review isnt that for People new to the Game and Genre for RTS Games.But the Game is really great, it works well, has many Graphical options what look amazingwhen pushed to the limit. It has the Advanced UI from Homeworld two and any otherimprovement for a today worth Game. It has a well done and long Story with the Original Actors including Heidi Ernest for Homeworld 2 Remastered, also it features well done fights against theCPU what offers a good challenge. Multiplayer is at the moment in its Beta phase because itneeds balancing and it will get opened shortly.I only can recommend this Game, you get four Games Remastered and Classic for a fair price.It is one of the best RTS Games of all time updated to the actual Standards and offering a great amount of fun.

												HomeWorld Games are hands down one of my Favorite RTS Titles  Next to Warcraft Games.  This was Really the first game to do space battles Correctly and my opinion the only one to do it correctly. I Nearly Played 200 hundred hours on the Original disk version.  So much in Fact i Warn the disk out Two times.  How you might ask well after playing the original campaign and playing the multiplayer and VS AI to death.  I wanted to see if the game had any mods so i looked up it moddb page and i was surprised to see it had one of my favorite TV show BSG as a mod and looking at that i Downloaded that Right there and started to play that into the ground.  im a big sci fi fan and this games Fan are nuts.  You like Star wars theres a star wars mod.  You like halo they got halo mod.  Pretty much got anything you can dream of on there.  But now that it has Been Remastered i cant wait to see what happens next.  Buy This Game Because it Offers More Play time than your average game Plus the Base game it Fantastic too.			"

												Well im a HomeWorld fan been one since its first release and I Loved it.Well as soon as I see a Remastered Collection of it My eyes bugged out of my head, I had to have it, and I Pre-ordered it (Never done that before, and wont do it again in the near Future).I start the game up and play ""Remastered"" Homeworld 1.... all they did was use the Homeworld 2 engine and beef it up with mods, IT IS NOT Homeworld 1 the story is the same sure BUT the gameplay and the ships are all Homeworld 2, this is just a Buffed up Homeworld 2 mod nothing more.Not saying its bad but I will say the ""Remastered"" title is a BIT missleading. I still like Homeworld and this is STILL fun.They NEED to give the lan play back to this game so you can still do lan partys.anywho good Homeworld 2 pack to have.IF your a Purest then I don't recommend this game for you, BUT if your someone that likes homeworld and mod it or likes  Big space battles this is a good game still.""Show them no mercy!""=Hiigaran scout			"

The fighter formations don't work properly, and the change in how fighter combat is resolved is too jarring for me :(I was expecting ""Homeworld: Remastered"", and I got ""Homeworld: Rewritten"". It made me sad, and I stopped playing after the third or fourth campaign mission.Good effort, but I can't play it. Maybe if you've never played it, you should give it a go ... still a great story.

												This is what Re-Masters should be like.It's not an effective re-release of a game that came out only half a decade ago, with only graphical updates and better modding support *Cough*...Skyrim...*Cough*...Should have been Morrowind or Oblivion...*Cough*...It's a Re-Master of a game that was first released 17 years ago, that would not work so well if at all on current machines due to compatability issues.For me, this has brought back the nostalgia of the early 2000's when I first got in to gaming. I have fond memories of going to LAN centres, amassing armadas of Battlecruisers and using their Hyperdrives to warp to and destroy my friend's Pride of Hiigara.Game works well. Just like I remember it being back in the day. Having the whole 3D space as your battlefield just gives the game a greater sense of scale and epicness to your battles.10/10			"

												To start, I played all of the games in the homeworld series for many years. I have been waiting for this reboot since it was announced. I think they did a great job on the textures/models for the reboot, but there are an absurd amount of bugs in this remaster. PLEASE make sure you support your product by releasing patches fixing all these issues. Some of the bugs I've run into, when you build the research vessel it warps in at random locations instead of coming out of the mothership. My harvesters will just stop as soon as they finish all close RU clouds. The resources take waaaay longer to harvest then they used to? I've increased the multiplier and it's just awful how long it takes to gather enough RUs to play the game. There was something lost there in translation. I wasn't able to move my newly constructed probe in the tactical map but when I zoomed in I was able to move it. In short, I recommend this game, but I really feel like gearbox let us down and I really hope you guys fix the errors you put in this masterpiece. PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR GAME AND FIX IT!!!			"

												This game is, NOW, perfect.At the release there were several things missing. I uninstalled it and waited, patiently. Since the patch 2.0, the last awaited feature (efficient formations) is here, and you have the most beautiful, strategic, and immersive RTS I've played since ... forever (I'm 40).StorylineThe storyline is epic, even though the HW2 one is less interesting than in HW1, you'll enjoy doing it from start to end.Is it required to clear HW Deserts of Kharak before ? No.Is it interesting to clear DoK for the story ? Yes, but not mandatory to fully enjoy HWR story. DoK was released (2016) long after HW1 (1999) and HW2 (2003), even HWR (2015).MultiplayerI didn't play multiplayer at all (yet ?) but for the solo part, it is fully worth it.I know there's a lot of popular mods for multiplayer, and Gearbox worked his ♥♥♥ off to make everything possible for modders.I hope you'll love this game as much as I do, it deserves it.

												The enemy sent Destroyers at me. I sent a crack team of foul-mouthed experts in Salvage Corvettes to subdue the capital ships, yelling at them over the comms as they jam them sideways into my mothership. I am now the proud owner of a Destroyer and a Carrier. On mission five.The game looks fantastic and the UI is very smooth and an improvement over the old interface. This is just from my experience of playing the Homeworld 1 campaign.If you've never heard of/played Homeworld in any way shape or form then consider this a hearty recommendation for a game that doesn't hold your hand. You're given objectives to complete and you decide how to do them. ""Destroy the enemy fleet and take out their resource operation!"" Or if you're feeling fancy, capture them.Graphics options are varied and versatile so you can probably run this on a toaster. Better yet crank it all up, attack move into the enemy fleet and watch all the pretty lights and explosions. Trust me when I say that Gearbox has shown a lot of care to this franchise and really with the market for RTS games being basically 'Starcraft 2' and not really much else you owe it to the genre to buy this game and experience the joy that is Homeworld.I feel like I've gone on and not really gotten my point across so...TL;DRes good gyme gud grafic gud remasta ver prett			"

												""Homeworld Remastered Collection"" is a great buy if you're looking for the definitive edition of ""Homeworld 2."" Unfortunately, its predecessor's campaign and gameplay leave much to be desired. I've yet to finish the remastered campaign of the original ""Homeworld,"" but I believe I've played enough to notice the various nuances that strengthen and diminish the product.While the reconstruction of the original game in the ""HW 2"" engine brings some welcome additons, like panning, strike groups and better visuals, it also introduces some new problems. Instead of listing them all out ad nauseum, let me just say this: The differences in the remastered edition of ""HW 1"" are likely to irk a good majority of classic fans.Regardless, there is some great potential in this product, and it is still the great set of games you remember. I can see some enterprising modders fixing a lot of the issues that many players are complaining about. As of 3/2/15, I would suggest waiting several months or even a year before purchasing this game.			"

												There are very few if any RTS's that stand the test of time like Homeworld does. The work that Gearbox have done to this timeless masterpiece is fantastic the graphics have been updated beautifully, the control system still feels the same 95% of the time there is the odd glitches here and there with certain fleet formations and occasionally having to redo a mission due to an event not triggering. But considering they’ve been working with code that is roughly 15 years old I can forgive all that. The missions are still challenging as ever, which seems to be lacking these days with quite a few AAA titles. Gearbox had a lot to live up to with this and from what I’ve read they’ve done the most intelligent thing any company can do with reviving a franchise they engaged with the community continually and took on board their comments and suggestions and still post release.

												HW vet says something different, still disapointedLong post get readyI played the games when they first came out of course... im 31 and was just a young kid at the time. The game was the greatest of its time as so many have pointed out. The Ui at the time was revolutionary, and so many games have tried to reproduce it but failed.The many great points of this game is what kept many playing and playing again. And for good reason, it has stood the test of time with the greats like the starcraft/warcraft series, age of empire series, and command & conquer seriesFirst some changes that I like...Fuel for fighters (except for the fact that ai fighters never had the fuel restrictions)and thats itThe ""Reboot (because it is not a remasted edition in my eyes) Edition"" is a complete farce because...--There are no more tactical fleet setups- no need for interceptors now that you can build bombers- no need for assault frigates, you have access to drone frigates- no need for frigates at all cause you can build destroyersThe original game had this, if you had a fleet of assault frigates you were gonna die to a swarm of fighters. why was this changed? It is intuitavly a tactical desicion thats missing--Formations no longer matterAgain so many have said this before but so many new players do not realize why they were so integral to the game. or understand why people complain about them-a wall formation would attempt to hold that formation as they attack while retreating-an x or claw formation would hold that formation while strafing-a sphere formation would attempt to guard the strongest ships at their center while attackingAs it is now every formation devolves into chaos at the first sign of enemy contactAlso The 3d management of the map no longer matters (or exists)As stated in even the first mission of Hw 1 you can do more damage on capital ships from below, above, or behind... Without the cohesive formations we had before this is a non-factor now because once they engage its a free for allCampaign Difficulty ScalingThis was something else way ahead of its time, instead of a difficulty slider the campaign progressed based on how good you were doing... the original did this well by placing a few more corvettes or frigates in at innopportune times.The new version just slams em in there.""oh you played smart and made 5 interceptors on mission 1?""""im gonna destroy your world and put in 20 light corvettes before the mission starts""or""you had just a mothership? oh you must be a noob, there will be no fighters to defend the carrier on day 2 ever i dont care how many you produce there will never be defenses for me cause you are such a noob""Test this one for yourselfIt is my hope that every new player to the franchise finds this post helpful as to why those veterans of the franchise fine this game so frustrating and disapointing.I know a lot of balance changes were made for the players of hw1 and hw2 multiplayer but that should never have been done, let the players choose which game they want to play multiplayer and balance accordingly dont intermingle that bull.

												You will be hard-pressed to find a game that is both deeply challenging and provides a narrative that makes each loss you take feel like a personal failure. The game does not hold your hand, and you are *forced* to think about each strategic decision you make.The remastered editions are beaufitul, exquisitely detailed and worth a few multiplayer matches lost due to gawking at the battles. While there are some significant day-1 bugs, GBX and BBI have promised support and the community is heavily involved in scouring the game for any and all necessary improvements.The classic versions are just as I remember, and they no longer require edits to command line options or registry content to get them to run correctly.Buy this game.

												The Homeworld games are both timeless classics, and one of the greatest tragedies in Gaming history is the fact that despite their success, no other developer ever attempted to emulate their particular, iconic style.These games are gorgeous. Their stories are enthralling. The gameplay--a tangible joy. Granted, the strategic aspects are a bit simplistic, but the sheer polish and intuitiveness and fun more than makes up for any percieved lack of depth.This remaster collection updates the visuals to look just as good today as the original games looked in our memories. So good, in fact, that they put many modern games to shame.Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are both All-Time Classics. This is an absolute must-buy for any gamer.			"

												Review in short: Awesome. If you have never played and are thinking of buying it, start with HW 2.I never played the original Homeworld, but I am a big fan of Homeworld 2. It still is one of my absolute favorite games. As you can imagne, I was rather thrilled. I still am thrilled as I play through HW 1. I have read several complaints that HW 1 Remastered has become too HW 2. How do i feel about this? Meh, never played the original. Only played 2. So I think its great. I loved homeworld 2 and have no problem with the remastered game.Multiplayer/vs cpu is a different story. Its beta so there is a bit of grace there. Some maps have next to no resources. Must have been HW 1 maps, Thats my biggest complaint. On the right maps it is a ton of fun. Love having relics as the center of some epic space battles. My inner 12 year old is happy. Can't wait for some sick new mods. I hope they flesh out some of the other factions that you encounter in the games.			"

												FantasticIs it a perfect remake? No. Some of the mechanics in HW1 in particular have been removed, and make certain missions that were monstrously difficult (at least when I was young) rather easy - like Gardens of Kadesh. The removal of strike craft fuel and the change in formation tactics makes it a very different level. There are also some bugs here and there like you'd expect from any new release. None of them I encountered were game-breaking.What surprised me is that nostalgia didn't cloud my recollection of this series. These games are truly incredible, and unlike any other game you'll experience. They require patience and deliberation that many games now have done away with, but it is every bit as rewarding as I recall. A millenia-spanning story, gorgeous visuals done the justice they deserve, and demanding, yet oddly relaxing gameplay married to one of the most unique UI's in all of gaming. Thank you Gearbox. I had considered this series lost in IP limbo until the THQ auction, and now a new generation can appreciate a flawed, astounding masterpiece along with its excellent sequel. TLDR: If you haven't played Homeworld and you like the RTS genre, buy it. You're in for something truly special. These remakes are awesome, and if you don't like the changes made, enjoy the originals in all their glory.			"

												'Homeworld Remasted Collection' is a package that includes the remastered version of Homeworld, a game from 1999, as well as the remastered version of Homeworld 2, that was released in 2003. Additionally the package includes the classic version of both games. Although Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are both very similar real-time strategy games, they both play and feel very different. The discovery of an ancient stone plate showing an engraved course through the galaxy, triggers your people on a journey through space to find your original home world. As expected this journey comes with many obstacles and as commander of fleet it is your task to overcome them. In other words, you have to fight. Think of Battlestar Galactica and you get the idea.The concept of the game is really cool and takes you on an intense science fiction journey that feels very unique. Every hyper-jump brings you to a new level in the game. Your remaining fleet arrives centred around your mother-ship. The mother-ship is capable of constructing all kind of different ships. Frigates, cruisers, corvettes, fighters or destroyers, you name it. Additionally you can research new technologies to upgrade your equipment. In order to build new ships you need to collect resources. Resources can be found in asteroid fields and shipwrecks.As for Homeworld 1 most levels are slow paced. Most of the time you are not attacked unless you engage the enemy. This allows you to take your time, which is a wonderful thing. You can drink a cup of tea or relax with a glass of whisky, harvest nearby resources, explore your surroundings and plan your strategy. In this way Homeworld 1 almost feels like a game of chess.Homeworld 2 is the complete opposite. In Homeworld 2 you are constantly put under pressure by never-ending scripting events that force you to permanently fight for survival. Additionally the amount of enemies seems endless at times because the developers implemented a variable AI that automatically adjusts to your fleet size and makes sure it's stronger than yours. The relaxing atmosphere from Homeworld 1 is diminished to a few isolated occasions in Homeworld 2, which makes both games two very different experiences.Both games are generally considered to be hard games. And while I really had to struggle with some levels in Homeworld 1 I was always able to manage them by re-trying one way or the other. This is not necessarily the case for Homeworld 2. The achievement statistic on Steams shop page shows that many players gave up on Homeworld 2. This impression is mirrored in the forums. Homeworld 2 is an extremely difficult game and can be very frustrating at times.Pros: (both games)- beautiful graphics, still not like games from today but considering the age of the games the developers did a great job- tutorials- good keyboard interface- very good music- good voice acting, well designed ship communications- option to manually save at any time, very important!- addictive, after failing to complete a level I went to bed and woke up at three o'clock at night, re-tried and made it :-)- interesting story- very good cutscenes with regard to contentsPros: (Homeworld 1)- relaxing, great atmosphere- difficulty is well balanced, rather easy in the beginning and pretty hard in the end (but still not as hard as every single level in Homeworld 2)- freedom to self-initiate the hyper-jump to the next levelPros: (Homeworld 2)- resource collectors and repair ships are now combined in one unit- more ship upgrade options- Cons: (both games)- games come without manual. Thankfully players provided links to the manuals in the forums that left me with four documents of 173 pages, nice- if you end up finishing a level with a remaining fleet that is unfit to beat the next level you need to replay the last level to make sure your remaining fleet is prepared for the upcoming challenge- one achievement asks you to play the tutorial of the classic game. Unfortunately this is not possible because the classic version keeps crashing. Forums are full of players with this problem. Adding this kind of achievement was a really dumb move from the devs.- Cons: (Homeworld 1)- last level seemed a little to hard- Cons: (Homeworld 2) - stressful most of the time- can be frustrating at times- too difficult- if your last main objective has been completed the game automatically hyper-jumps into the next level. This can be a huge problem if your fleet is diminished after a lengthy fight and you jump right into the next fight. In order to prepare your fleet before jumping you have to wait before completing the final main objective- salvage corvettes make no more sense because they have become far to expensive to justify the risk- maximum number of ships in a group is restricted. In Homeworld 1 you can exceed the maximum number by capturing enemy ships.- stuttering cutscenesAll in all I really enjoyed both games. They offer a very unique atmosphere. I don't know any other game with a similar mood. Homeworld 1 deserves a 100% recommendation while Homeworld 2 deserves a recommendation for the hard core fans but probably not for everybody.			"

												While it's great to have Homeworld looked at again, especially as games like No One Lives Forever fades into being forgotten as a result of publishers not giving a ****, Homeworld Remastered Collection boasts some impressive visual updates at the cost of some of the gameplay mechanics that made the predecessors what they were.The best part happens to be the visual updates involved with Homeworld 1's remastering. It's absolutely stunning, texture detail beautiful. For Homeworld 1, this comparison is outsdanding, but for Homeworld 2 the improvements aren't as radical due to the game still being in the same engine. That's not to say that both aren't improved, but it's much more significant for the original.Some of the audio has been re-recorded and while it sounds alright there are portions where old (albeit not as compressed) samples are used. This makes it sound jarring since the same settings aren't used between both recording as well as the actor's ages have dramatically changed since the original releases. For Homeworld 1, it's nice to not hear as much compression on things, giving better clarity.The biggest problem with Homeworld 1's remaster is that old tactics aren't working. Formations are fundementally broken, shedding the fact that these fights are in space and momentum is a thing, instead going for a jet-fighter approach. The problem is that makes guard orders useless as you might assign a sphere formation around a target with guard orders, but as soon as enemies get within range, your ships break off and take forever to get shots on target.The good news is that having the Classic version is great, but while the Classic version does run, it does have problems with multi-monitor systems.

												It has some small improvements from the original, but all the improvements seem very worthwhile.Firstly the question that needs to be answered: Has the original game miantained its great gameplay?Yes, it has. It is as good as it once was.Secondly: If I own the original is it worth getting the new versions?Probably not. Sure the graphics are better, and there are some UI improvements, but oveall the gameplay is not improved. If you care about graphics then upgrade, if not then stick with originals.Thirdly: Why should I get it when i can get the originals for a few bucks?Becasue by buying it you prove that such an awesome game deserves developers to be rewarded. Homeworld remains one of the most unique and awesome strategy games. Show how much you love it by buying it.			"

												Disclaimer: I'm assuming a long-standing familiarity with the Homeworld series here, for anyone who reads this.I'm very torn on this game. On one hand, I am a long-time fan of the Homeworld series of games. From the moment I'd played the original HW demo prior to the game's release, I was in love with the game. So much that over the years I've wound up with several copies of it so I could play with friends who didn't have their own at the time.Fast forward past Homeworld: Cataclysm (since it's not in this collection), to Homeworld 2. I was still quite happy with the game, although I was not so impressed with the new game engine. Also, I was quite confused with some of the continuity errors introduced into the units. Why were capital ships no longer capable of jumping themselves, with the exception of ships that could build the hyperspace module? In HW 1, all frigates and up were jump-capable without support. Why were formations and tactics effectively non-existant? They played such a huge role in carrying out a successful combat action in the original. The list goes on.So, here we are today, with the Homeworld Remastered Collection. As a lover of the series, I'm thrilled with its existence. From a collector's standpoint, this is a wonderful addition to the Homeworld Universe. It preserves the story and music from the original versions, and does indeed do a very nice job of updating the appearance of the setting.Now, the gripes...First off, they made subtle modifications to the classic version of Homeworld included in the collection. There is a queue-limit, restricting how many active build queues per mothership and carrier. Want to queue a whole mixed corvette wing at once? Nope, you can only build 2 types at once, regardless of how many of each. This continues on through to capitals ships. Also, they removed all capablity for multiplayer. There isn't even a LAN option. If LAN was still an option, through some network trickery people could still play multiplayer, even if there was no ability to just find and hop into a game like before the multiplayer lobby finally was shut down.Regarding the multiplayer side of things in general, I've only tried one game over the beta system (well, beta as of this writing, anyway), and I was unimpressed. About 15 minutes in, just as my teammate and I finished fending off an initial assault from the other players (6 went in via lobby, 4 of us wound up in game), the game just up&closes on me. No error, no crash message, nothing. Just back to my desktop.Now, onto my gripes with the ""Remastered"" version of Homeworld 1. In short, it's just a mod for the original Homeworld 2 engine (as ""improved"" for the remastered version of HW2). Unit caps, insanely-decreased hangar capacity on the mothership, a queue that can only build 2 or 3 different things at a time per production ship, RUs required for research (and no parallel researching anymore, just one tech at a time no matter how many sections you build for the research ship), and otherwise the same failings of the Homeworld 2 engine that the original HW2 suffered from. Namely the joke they called tactics and formations. And the same, clunky&screen cluttering interface (I loved the simplicity of the original HW's interface, it let me spend more time dealing with events in the gameplay, rather than trying to wrestle with which panel or convoluted ""shortcut"" I needed).As it stands now (and any patches/updates aside, will ultimately probably remain so), I really can't recommend the game collection. I really only bought it for the inclusion of ""Homeworld Classic,"" and while mostly happy with that part of the collection, I still have some complaints about the changes made to the game.Only get this if you have a similar love of the franchise as I do, otherwise you should save your money and look for something else to scratch your space RTS itch.

												It's almost as if they said to themselves, ""Let's make homeworld look twice as good, but play half as well"".I can't say much about homeworld 2: remastered since I haven't played the original too many times  but homeworld 1: remastered is a tragic disappointment when compared to the original. I wish I'd read the reviews before buying. It's baffling that they haven't ironed out such major bugs in such a long time.Bottom Line: I can't recommend this game to new comers with all of the broken elements that made the original so good. You will be left wondering what all the fuss is about with such a mediocre game.I definitely can't recommend this game to veterans who've already tasted the goodness of the original. You will go 'Wow' when you see the graphics on level 1, and then you'll be mounting frustration as you discover one broken feature after the other.Details:- Formations: Don't work. Ships break formation as soon as they engage enemies which defeats the purpose entirely. Battles are basically a free for all. This occurs in hw2 as well.- Tactics: Don't work. There is no discernible difference between the 3 tactics. The buttons are just eye/ear candy.- Tactical map: Homeworld 1 allowed you to specify a 'move to' point, then hold the shift key to lock that point while panning with rmb to adjust elevation. This is no longer possible, and you have to specify both the 'move to' location and the elevation from a single angle. Not possible, not impressed. Also applies to hw2.- Salvaging: It's nice that they've made it possible to salvage those standard and missle corvettes in the early missions (without painful scuttle tactics).  It's NOT nice that the 6 assault frigates from mission 3 simply disappear when captured (and are down to 4 for some reason).- Resourcing: Nerfed to 500 RU's per load (down from 600) for no apparent reason. Takes an eternity to collect resources. Also there's a whole lot more resources available in each level, severely hurting the fine tuned balance of the original game. But I guess that was an easier fix than trying to fix the balance.- Balance: Downright terrible. Battles that should be over in a flash take forever and with unacceptible losses. An army of 21 interceptors, 7 heavy corvettes and 4 assault frigates should suffer no losses when facing 5 interceptors + 2 corvettes. Neither should they take more than 5 minutes. But that's not homeworld ""remastered"".- Interface: I, for one, preferred the original build manager to the homeworld 2 multi page build manager since it's easier building everything from a single page.If it ain't broke, don't make a half-a!$@d attempt at 'remastering' the game.

												The 2.0 update adds everything that was lacking from the initial release (bar the HW1 credits music). The newly added physically stimulated ballistic weapons, strike craft formations and intelligent strike groups have combined the best tactical features from HW1 and 2 into this masterpiece.If you're getting this revitalised classic (2 remastered games AND the 2 originals) on sale you're getting an incredible bargain.

												Nostalgia aside, this is one hell of a grand remake.Better Graphics, Better Gameplay, Better UI, and Better AI.The Multiplayer and Skirmishes have been redone and improved.Homeworld has an excellent and deep dark story that is gritty and tribal.The Music is great and very atmospheric, dark and epic.This remastered edition is one to pick up for those new and old to the series. It combines both Homeworld 1 and 2 into Skirmishes and MP and lets you use factions from both.Still has a few bugs here and there but it is still early days.Most importantly it is one of those RTS games that keeps the immersion and the darkness of space.Has beautiful dustclouds, explosions, nebulas and planets.11/10This is not just an RTS or a simple game,This is Art, THIS IS HOMEWORLD.One that is timeless.

												Yes! If you never heard of this game, learn about it now.I have both games (and the other one in between - Cataclysm - that they didn't relauched) on CD since 1999 (the first). Once sierra vanished from history, i lost all hope from seeing these games disapearing as well (for multiplayer pourpuses ans such). Now, i have my hopes for the 3rd again!The remastering did an amazing job both on graphics quality and game improvements, without taking anything of the original titles. It is great not to have a full screen research for example. On homeworld 2 they had if fixed, and the remastered made it a pattern for both games.The games their self are great. It's easy to see the product qualidity here - both in history (yeah, these games you'll stop to watch their cutscenes BECAUSE THEY ACTUALY HAVE HISTORY CONTENT AND IMPORTANCE!) and in game play. As an strategy game, there's everything you may want. It is really a journey, and you'll feel that.Great job! And good gaming.			"

												I heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real-time strategy. The remaster of Homeworld 1 is imperfect, unfortunately, and not as well-executed as the remaster of Homeworld 2, but regardless it remains an excellent game, and still up near the top of the space RTS genre. Seeing as the classic versions are also included and are now fully compatible with modern systems, there is no reason not to get this game.Homeworld Remastered is basically the four best space RTS games ever made all bundled together. Two just happen to be remakes of the other two.			"

												Simply put, a game everyone needs to see. If you love RTS and atmospheric stories then dont pass this up. I wont try to ice it over, this game has some aggrivating bugs at times, and I wouldnt recommend trying the multiplayer yet (or if you do prepare for some... ""fun""). I wish they left the first games mechanics how they were and not to implement the seconds into it. That way it would have kept its original feel. Recommend this game? Of course! Hopefully they fix the problems and support this game like it should. Those complaing have good reason to do so, however there are a few faults in their accusations:1: These games are from a different era where you had to really think and plan ahead, most may find the game a bit hard and frusterating as each mission always throws loops at you so in a sense you had to keep in mind what you brought to the table each time you finish a mission and start a new one.2: They CLEARLY SAID that they were integrating HW2 mechanics into HW1, sad but they emphisized this multiple times3: Many memebers of the Original Team were involved in this...dont go blaming Gearbox. Games must evolve, and adapt to changes in the industry. I also dont agree with everything but you have to ask yourself the basic question ""Is it fun?""As someone whos played this game since its first release and still have the original disks, I bought this for 2 reasons. First being Steams support (Which could add a much bigger fanbase, and easier way to setup mods) and that I simply felt the need to assist this series by buying it. They were never perfect but they were inspiring in their time... Just like now, its not perfect but why get so upset? Especially when they INCLUDED THE ORIGINALS!			"

												TL/DR: Game breaking bugs.  Wait for bug fixes and the next steam sale to get this one.I have fond memories of the original Homeworld, so I decided to pay full price to reward Gearbox for refreshing a classic franchise.  With all the good reviews from critics and some of the original Homeworld devs working on the project I was confident it would be a solid experience.  Gearbox you burned me on this one.  I didn’t pay full price to beta test your code!  Frequent crashes.  Also game breaking bugs.  For example, if you have to reload a mission from an auto save, mission events will fail to trigger, preventing you from completing it.  Serious bugs in the AI behavior too.  Critical to success in Homeworld is capturing enemy ships.   Imagine my frustration when my own ships continue to shoot enemy vessels after I’ve captured them, often destroying both the captured ship and my own salvage corvettes in the process.  I almost threw a monitor.  Don’t reward Gearbox for rushing this out the door and expecting us to Q&A it for them.  Refuse to buy it until they’ve resolved the issues and it goes on a big sale.

												If you are planning to buy this because you were a big fan of HW1, don't. Much of what you'll remember of HW1 was lost when it was brought over to the HW2 engine. A few changes to HW1 (Most not for the better)-Fighter/Corvettes no longer require fuel-Formations don't hold in battle (all) and often do not work outside of it (sphere, parade)-Minefields require constant maintenance-Ship evasion is severely diminished-Research costs RUs and Research ships can no longer research independently-Balance of many missions has been changed, often for the worse (looking at you Sea of Lost Souls)Despite being very pretty, this game feels rushed. As a community, Homeworld fans were kept in the dark regarding what the remastering was going to bring to the table. Updates were non-existant and the only newsletter I got after signing up when it was initially offered was the release date email a year later. I imagine mounting negative feedback on this got Gearbox to kick it out the door before it was done =/Gearbox did not do right by fans of the original title.			"

												I played the old homeworld games and was pleasently suprised with this addition. As many have experienced these remastered games are often just disapointing and might aswell buy the games on GOG for a cheaper price with more content, see HOMM 3. This game is an exception to the rule, the games has become easy to control and easy to master, the graphical upgrade has been done with thought and is a completely new experience. If you're new to the series i will strongly recomend this Space RTS, i can't compare this game to something similair as this game is quite unique. They've made it easier for newcommers without dumbing it down for the veterans.The story is great, graphics are great and gameplay is unique. What more do you need?i've come across one game breaking bug, but it was fixed with a simple restart of the map.Welcome to Homeworld!Edit: If you're a veteran and is skeptical about the user interface changes, they've enabled you to play the old games, so you basically bought 4 games:p			"

												After playing HW1 classic, I was foaming at the mouth to play this game. Then I get into the game. Fuel is no longer a thing, which has a huge tactical concern. Now its not. Formations don't work. Pricing on all units from HW1 was changed. In the single player resources are THROWN at you in massive amounts.  For example, in Sea of Lost souls. I had a large enough fleet to absolutely destroy the entire thing, then it became a game of just whittling down the alien ship with attack bombers.

												It's odd that one of the best space musical performances on PC ought to be an incessant theory redirection, however that is the appeal of Homeworld. Over 15 years after its excellent discharge, Gearbox have remastered Relic's creation and its continuation with high-res surfaces, bolster lighting and another UI, suitably modernizing a champion amongst the most troublesome and suggestive structure game-plan ever manufactured. It's an incredible thing, particularly in the event that you have a getting a charge out of for spaceships doing spaceship things, for instance, shedding squadrons of assault workmanship and shooting mammoth lasers over the void. Regardless, Homeworld's splendor runs energize. It's in the sound course of action—the blending use of Adagio for Strings; the brief, devastate comms from your manager; and the way Homeworld's three-dimensional doing combating mirrors debacle and destroying over its battles. Both are stories of survival among the stars. Your species' last trust is a goliath boomerang called the Pride of Hiigara, a titanic mothership with the best way to deal with make an economy of more minor barges, from unassuming mining vessels to plane and assault make. The Pride's capacity to make military makes her your imperative opposing instrument, yet that rich arced carapace ensures the cryogenically established remains of your species. Her setback recommends mean vanquish. Homeworld astutely plays on this strain. One early mission makes them protecting ranges of stasis-bound tenants from criminals. Your ship's PC declares ""100,000 spared"" with each safe, appending an unsavory loss of life the vessels the bandits absolutely take off. Military units and general subjects you shield are passed on through from mission to mission as you reinforce your goliath space family and bring your species toward the day's end from the skirt of aggregate catastrophe. The team's turn from removed individual riffraff to military storm is shrewdly paced, and the battle stands today as the best use of the RTS as a portraying instrument. It's attempting, in any case, and consistently fiddly. Micromanaging troops transversely over gigantic segments in a 3D situation takes hone and sensible utilization of the concede key. Might want to contribute gatherings of essentialness isolating your qualities into control social affairs and sending them after particular targets – contender units, or the subsystems of some huge war vessel. Vessels are around amassed into opposing to contender and against capital classes, however their size, relative speed and the updates you get some information about fluctuate their parts essentially. There's far to go, and missions pound you with astounding goals. It's ordinary to deal with two or three battles in the interim, all while keeping up an economy and keeping your construct lines included. It's cerebrum boggling, and purposefully so. Crusade missions can wind up being unfathomably troublesome on the off chance that you dismissal to secure obliges amongst missions and the unpretentious components of battle—like micromanaging units to strike the gentler top protected layer of frigates—persuades the chance to be difficult in Homeworld's most unmistakable scraps. The great craving to hold information is outright protected paying little regard to the exertion, nevertheless, for the dream of organizing such a fantastic get-together of smooth, shining vehicles, and for the scene when they help into fight. That is upheld by Gearbox' striking update work. They've rehashed Homeworld's creating foundations and ship surfaces concerning Relic's uncommon vision. Lasers cast light on vessels, a noteworthiness of field impact redesigns the sufficiently especially made notion segment amongst distinguishing strength and the updated UI makes cycling between era line units less troublesome. Just a few minor issues meddle, similar to the impression of ship classes to subjective geometric shapes in menus, regardless they're minimal bandy given the method for the bundle. Homeworld is just personality boggling and everybody ought to play it.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Homeworld Remastered is a remake of two classic and very popular games, Homeworld 1 and 2. It's a real-time strategy space game that is basically the best one to this date with no game to overcome it, in most peoples eyes.This is going to be a thoughts on the game, my thoughts, as a person who never played the originals, and a friend who did play them and now playing the remake. Also, neither that friend or I have finished the game, just to note.Both of us thought that the graphics are, for how old this game is, compared to the classics, it's beautifully remade.The ship models are a lot more pleasing and awesome, same with the background (space), and the UI is adjustable which is neat, but for me that UI could have been better.The story, for my friend has always been great, and to me it is just great. The presentation is fantastic, which include the story, the cut scenes, and the battles, all of which are awesome and emphasizes that space is scary and there's a lot of powerful forces out there, showing that to you directly opposing your power.The only complaint so far for the game is that me and my friend thought that moving the camera around can be a pain, not hard, just annoying, and most of the other issues for the game are coming from the fact this is a remastered game, of an old game, that didn't get a makeup of modern technicalities and controls that we get in most new games nowadays, which isn't necessarily a negative thing, but it would have been great if it were tweaked to have them.So overall the game is great, for new players and for the fans, and for the price it has, for two remade games in one, with the mixed multiplayer, it's a great purchase, and a cleaned up superb old/new game/s.Shameless link[ksalue.com] "

												Definitely a good game, quite pleased with the graphical update, audio update, and also the UI update. It plays very smoothly and I am having loads of fun in both the campaign and multiplayer. Definitely recommend anyone to give this game a go, especially if you like space opera and a strong story coupled with good RTS gameplay.However, it does have some bugs. For example, the speech audio sometimes randomly mutes itself during the campaign, which results in me needing to save and reload the game to get the speech audio back on. Another bug both me and a friend encountered was with the garden of Kadesh mission: When you attempt to enter hyperspace and fail and you have your units docked, it will force them to launch  and you cannot dock them again. The swarmers then wreck my salvage corvetts.Also, it would be nice if the game were more 'unified'. In other words, I want to be able to access HW1 campaign, HW2 campaign, and the multiplayer without needing to close the game and open the launcher again. Those should all be options in the menu, not separate 'games' you need to launch.Despite that, I tend to overlook bugs and UX issues on the first day, as long as developers get them fixed in good time. So for now, I shall keep my review as overall positive. Definitely looking forward to the many more hours of fun completing these campaigns again!			"

												Everything I remembered it to be and more.  I remembered the tight controls and surprisingly simple style for tactics (BTW definitely play the tutorial).  I remembered how cool it looked to send squadrons of ships in claw formations against enemy carriers (which looks amazing now compared to then).  And I remembered how the game gives you simple missions at first to ease you into the action.  But I forgot (I'm not sure how) the gripping narratives of the two games.  I was immediately sucked back into the journey across the galaxy and the aggressive response to enemy threats.Now I've barely touched the remastered game thus far: hardly restarted the story as of writing this.  It may be early for a review.  They could have bugs further on that I don't know about yet.  So far it's played smooth and error free (despite turning my gaming laptop into a blast furnace).  But I've played through the old versions before and this stands up to and exceeds my expectations for a modernization.Pros:                   .Gripping story       .tight controls               .great visuals.gentle learning curve (simple missions at first familiarizing you with the game).Bug free and plays smooth..Two games plus expansions in one!Cons:.You better play the tutorial or that gentle learning curve is going to be much steeper..new visuals (outside of the new lighting and weapon effects) are simply hi-res textures pasted onto relatively simple ship models from the original game so don't expect elite dangerous graphics..You don't own it yet.

												Great remaster for those of us who had major nostaglia for Homeworld RTS gaming back in the day. The texture and graphics updates are very noticable (go load up the classic games to see). Still lots of fun, HW2 story is still not as good as HW1, though I liked it more than I remember liking it back in the day. Lots of explodey ship fighting. Some of the, uh, 'fun' difficulty spikes in HW2 are still there though.Still stands up as a decent game even without the nostalgia.			"

												I'm writing this review mere minutes after beating the remastered Homeworld campaigns. Bear in mind that this review talks about the remastered games ONLY.I cannot overstate how much I looked forward to something like this, since Homeworld never had a digital release (good luck getting those old CDs to run).The remaster is done well, but not perfectly. My biggest gripe being ship squads. In multiplayer, the Homeworld 1 races simply don't stand a chance in the fighter/corvetter categories. Of course that could change with future patches (as I'm sure it will).Campaign wise, the Homeworld 2 campaign feels nigh-on identical to how it was before. The Homeworld 1 campaign though definitely felt different. It seemed a bit easier, maybe because of the rock-paper-scissors combat system associated with the Homeworld 2 engine. Either way, it was fun and a great trip down memory lane... except it looked a hellova lot better!But there are some issues, almost all being Homeworld 1 related. Formations need work, simple as that. If I put my ships into a sphere I expect them to hug around a guarded ship, not sit next to it in a ball. Fuel is gone, but TBH, to me (!) that was a positive change overall. The UI is neat and better to me than the old one. This one (like Homeworld 2's original UI) allows you to monitor the action while issueing build and research orders.Most of the other changes are minor, such as Kadeshi Multibeam frigates not doing a barrel roll when firing or research ships not spinning anymore. All of that could be patched in later though, or modded.If you can live with the above differences and consider the amazing visual upgrade, then this is absolutely a good buy!Homeworld is an RTS franchise you OWE yourself to at least try.

Homeworld is unlike anything that's out there, it's a game who defined the space strategy genre as we know it, becoming a high standard. I remember myself playing with friends when Homeworld2 came out, the amount of incredible games we had, and still have. That was the best experience I had in strategy video games thus far.As much as I love strategy games, I fell in love for this title the first time I played it. I will probably always consider it as my favourite one, and that's probably the most valuable reason I started developing mods on it, not just because I wanted to create something related to my favourite science fiction universes, but because this game brought us so many possibilities that I had to do it.I seriously believe Gearbox gave Homeworld the respect it deserves, like other people think. This Remastered version is definitely what we can consider as ""Remastered""... in opposition to other studios who tend to promote remastered games just because they changed the textures or the screen resolution. It's not a Remastered version, it's.. a Renovation. Now highlighting high definition score, great voices, Full-HD animated cutscenes and one of the latest version of OpenGL, Homeworld Remastered makes the whole game really epic, with a well-told story.My unique complain is that they decided to remove audios from other languages (such as French, Spanish, Italian...) while they still have them and that the original records are already in HD. They said that ""they don't have them anymore"", so they would have needed to remake all of them with foreign recording studios, and I don't believe Gearbox wanted to spend money on this, as they're not a publisher, and don't have the same amount of ressources.Pros of this Remastered Version:✓ Brillant and stunning visuals.✓ A better campaign (improved cutscenes).✓ A great multiplayer mode.✓ Far better Interface, and god we needed it.✓ A great User Interface, which proves Homeworld rhymes with Modernity.✓ Awesome multiplayer games in perspective.✓ New tracks and remastered awe-inspiring score.✓ Better movements and improved AI.✓ Steam multiplayer platform, a good point to play with your friends.✓ Mod tools, although not finished.Cons of this Remastered Version:✖ Audio strictly limited to English. A shame because foreign languages had really great voice overs.✖ Some missions could have been improved (strange movements).✖ Formations and BC should be improved as well.✖ Steam exclusive. Even the CD version requires Steam, which is something I consider as ""bull****"".There are cons, of course, but let us all remember than this Remastered version is a way for Homeworld fans to support the future of the franchise. Thank you Gearbox, command line green. Homeworld Forever!VERDICT: IT'S A MASTERPIECE! "

												The best stab at a truly 3D RTS the gaming industry has ever taken. The easy and intuitive interface, and the three dimensional weak spots on assorted craft makes your movement on the field of battle meaningful. The story, artwork, and voice acting bring the struggle of the inheritants of the former Kushan empire to life in this unparalleled masterpiece.After languishing over a decade in relative obscurity, Gearbox has brought the universe of Homeworld back to the forefronts of our imagination in a master stroke born of proper reverence for the titles. The Remastered Collection breathes new life into the game's backdrop in a way that does it more justice than our own imaginations could during the game's initial release. The magnitude and quality of the effort—and the joy it brings to my sense of nostalgia—cannot be understated.			"

												Homeworld Remastered: The 90's gave us many great RTS games. One of them was Homeworld. Sadly, I missed out on playing this gem. However thanks to the folks at Gearbox Software, we now can play it in full beautiful HD. With redone graphics, cleaned up audio and more. Homeworld Remastered brings back this 1999 classic in style. The story and music are fantastic. The RTS side of Homeworld is a whole different beast though. The usual high paced, high action style of games that we get these days is slightly different in Homeworld. Its a much more relaxed experience. Leaving you plenty of room to decide your next move. Sometimes this leads to unnecessarily long missions. It does enable you though to come up with a master strategy. Like a general on a battle field watching from above. In all Homeworld Remastered does the game justice and then some.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												A truly unique RTS (and the only one I know of that truly has 3d maps), HWR gives you the ability to move craft in literally any direction.  Don't know if the videos shown display this ability or not, I do apologise.  The remastered version is about as close to the original than any other game I have ever played that has been remastered to such an extent except for the 1st halo maybe. I have not played it, I will not buy a console for only 1 game (**** you square enix, for making FF15 exclusive to PS4).  All craft are very unique, in what craft they are intended to combat.  The story is very rich for what you can expect, ships communicating to each other with icon thumbnails that are usually not an actual face (outside of some cinematics between missions).  There are 4 different playable factions, each with their own unique strategies for multiplayer and skirmish mode.  Only 1 race is playable in both games during storymode.  There is only 1 type of currency for both games, mined from asteroids (or dust clouds as well in HW1).  Most missions require careful tactics, lest your currency dries up before the next mission (still possible with just resources that are in each map - but not likely.The only critisism I have seen from the community, in the remastered versions, is that weapon projectiles function differently from HW1 classics.'  I personally didn't really care enough to get upset by it, I was just happy enough for the remastered versions to be as good as they are, but there are some players who are not too happy about that.Be aware, however, most missions can take a substantial of time to complete.  Although, there are setable parameters to make multiplayer games go faster and during anytime you can save on singleplayer.P.S.:  there is a third homeworld game that occurred between HM1 and HM2 named HW:Cataclysm.  I do not know why it wasn't remastered but the story of it not essential to the plot of HW2 (outside a near extinction event of a non-playable species). "

												I would not recommend this game if you played homeworld 1 or homeworld cataclysm in their original state. It is VERY broken. Especially harvesting. AI is dumb, formations dont work (which also breaks many tactics you would use in the original), harvesters have to attach to items, multiplayer is a beta, the homeworld credits song is gone, and you cant play as the Taidan in the redone version, which is dissapointing since you would think the WHOLE game would have been redone. Harvesters also need to constantly be retold to harvest. They will think they are done, when they are not. This game is an offense to the original homeworld.			"

GB has shown great respect to the old version of this fantastic story driven space RTS title, every element you see and feel in the remastered version brings you back to old days, but with a greater enchanced graphic, sound and interface. Until now i have not seen any downside of this remastered version, unlike what most of other HD remastered game did that changed alot of things which made those games more like a 'half new' title.For those homeworld fans, you might wanna play the tutorial missions first since GB changed some hotkeys so that its no longer the keys you familiar, for example the right click menu, now its Shift + right click.

												Homeworld remastered is a broken and disapointing PORT of the  origonal Homeworld into the Homeworld 2 engine.Due to being a port into a different engine, alot of the base mechanics just dont work anymore, major changes have been made to ships health, cost, unit caps, and damage to try and balance Homeworld 1 in the Homeworld 2 Engine. there are still many features that still just dont work, formations,  the cease fire command, captured carriers cannot build and contain enemy fighters after capture (fun!).if your looking to play a graphically updated Homeworld 1, this is not the game for you.if you have never played Homeworld, you will probably have fun, as you wont notice the changes.But as someone who absolutly loved the origonal to bits, it hurts to play the remaster, seeing the shortcomings in every facit of the game.

												Fun, old sci-fi strategy games in space that got a pretty good ""facelift"". Includes Homeworld and Homeworld 2, both in classic and remastered versions, that work on modern systems.It's not easy game at first and it will take you some trial and error to complete the campaign. All ships have their strengths and weaknesses, some are better at dealing damage yet can't take much damage themselves, others are faster and more agile so they can overwhelm the larger ships if they have the numbers. Ships have either a projectile attack, missiles or energy weapon attacks. Some may have combination of all three like few of the larger capital ships.There are many different starships in game that are divided into fighters, corvettes, frigates and capital ships. Some ships you will use for specific tasks, not just attacking but repairing, gather resources, cloaking allies, capturing enemy ships, disabling them, shielding allies from damage and much more.In battle, ships can miss their shots, so 10 on 10 fighter battle can have different outcome depending on how lucky your shots are. And in large battles it's all about tactics and knowing your enemy weaknesses. Apart from solo campaign there's skirmish and multiplayer for some custom matches with friends.Homeworld 2 bring all that was great in Homeworld and adds more enemies, ships, modification modules, new research options for ships as well as new campaign. It's hard to review a ""bundle"" of sorts, because it's 4 games in one package, even though they are similar, the remastered versions have a lot of new features as well as improved visuals and game user interface.[Tutorial lady]: If you liked this review, click OK to continue.[ OK ];8)			"

												I usually do a bit more research before I make a Steam purchase, as a result most of the games I own were either given to me or I bought because I knew I would love them.I was a little wary of paying $35 dollars for a 15 year old game no matter how ""remastered"" it sounded, but I genuinely lovd the original Homeworld so much I decided to go ahead (I thought it would be great to be able to play online against friends for the first time in ages, as well!) I was worried about that when I was still using the traditional definition of Remastered and not, ""turned into complete trash."" Between the bugs and the changes the game flounders near the area of unplayable. For examples of changes, fundamental tactical abilities like telling your fighters to be ""evasive"" has simply been ripped out of the game. Whether or not this was to foment HWI vs HWII multiplayer is as irrelevant as it is uncertain, it renders figher groups so much less meaningful or useful. Fighters instead seem to behave in a sort of constant half aassed evasive which means that their aggressive behavior has also been scuttled. For examples of bugs, from mission to mission my groups would fail to properly select. If I hightlighted, say, all the ships in group one then they might all show they were in group one, but if I actually hit one, only a few respond to the hail. I have to reselect and reassaign them all to ""rebuilld"" between missions. But this is nothing compared to ships simply REFUSING TO OBEY ORDERS. I have tried playing The Wastelands three times now and in each instance a point was reached where some group of ships simply refused to move or engage no matter what they were instructed. I was especially impressed by my salvage frigates staring dumbly at me as I repeatedly tried to get them to capture a destroyer or, indeed, any ship as they slowly got picked off one by one. I have never before felt compelled to write a negative review for Steam. It's one thing to simply make a bad game, that happens all the time. But this is a case of taking a masterpiece and destroying it. And I've been offered the chance to waste $35 dollars for the priviledge of watching one of my favorite games of old trashed in this manner. Simply releasing the games for $5 apiece and rebuilding the multiplayer environment would have been the right move. As it stands, I regret this purchase without reservation and cannot recommend it, at least not until the myriad gameplay issues have been resolved. Even then, the graphis upgrades hardly justify $35. In my opinion, if you make this purcahse you are probably getting ripped off.			"

												The short of it: grognard vote of approval.The long of it: Homeworld (its demo, in fact) was the first game I installed on my first computer. I've kept at it constantly through the years. The Remastered edition does contain Homeworld and Homeworld 2, they are as good as ever, and this is reason enough for a thumbs up.The Remastered edition adds a lot of visual improvements, and some gameplay modifications as well. The awesome Homeworld story is brought into the Homeworld 2 engine - some players might choose this opportunity to experience it, since you can now issue orders while the game is paused, and thus deal with the more hectic moments of space combat.Apart from more detailed textures, 3D models, lightning system, here are some pros and cons at a glance:PROS:- the gameplay tried to remain faithful to the original- game runs well- good sound quality- everything said in cinematics has a subtitle, including the launch game-engine cinematic- good first day support (got a game update immediately after my first crashed, which got fixed)- you can pit Kushan against Hiigaran, or any of the 4 factions of the two games in skirmish- it is funCONS:- though technically impressive, the visual aspect of the game needs some more polishing and fitting together- some HW1 ships don't work well yet, like Hive Frigates- HW1 Salvage Corvette numbers are now drastically limited; doing the campaign junkyard style seems doubtfulNitpicking:- The starting cinematic ends with the view centered on the Resource Collector; however, due to the orientation of the camera, the backdrop is outer space, rather than Kharak, as was in the original game. I feel this disrupts the narratively important visual repetition of Kharak (multiple times in the starting cinematic, then contrasted in mission 3), and I would like the developer to 'fix' the narrative element back.Bottom line: good, fun games, done in the spirit of the old and improved upon. Still need a few patches.			"

												I bought this on sale expecting to play HW1 with better graphics and to have a copy of this game forever preserved on the cloud somewhere, even though I have the original CD. So far, things have been a huge disappointment. The following only applies to HW1 as I have not attempted to play HW2:+ The graphics have indeed been modernized and fleet combat is spectacular to watch- Every single ship has had their resource cost and battle prowess completely changed- The AI of strike craft has been completely changed,  making fighters nearly useless in every type of battle- Damage dealt by larger craft has been greatly increased, shortening combat and making tactical movement orders unnecessary- Enemy fleet scaling has been completely changed, causing some missions to be stacked ludicrously against you and punishing you for playing wellThe net result is that battles play out completely different. In HW1 Classic you had a framework for what to expect in combat: fighters would beat capital ships, capital ships would beat corvettes, and corvettes would beat fighters. Several craft would break these rules, but you always had the option through smart gameplay to even the odds - formations, tactics, and tactical movement could swing unfavorable fights in your favor. Now, in the Remastered version, all of that is pointless. Spend all your resources building as many of the biggest ships you can, and just drag a box around the enemy fleet to issue an attack order.

												If this is your first time playing homeworld, go ahead, get this and enjoy, you will probably love it. But if you spent your childhood or your younger days playing the original homeworld for hours on end, to the point of having a ridiculous amount of the campaign memorized, dont get this. Or at least get it and ignore the Remastered ones and only play the classic, because they managed to change it to the point that it just isnt homeworld anymore. This isnt Relic's Homeworld Remastered by Gearbox, this is Gearbox's fully legal almost the same ripoff of Relic's Homeworld.			"

												Why, Gearbox?  Why couldn't you have either just cleaned it up, or given it the love it needed?  This frankenstein's monster of a game is offensively disrespectful to your history and your legends.The upgraded graphics break the game - many people report a 'general failure' any time they try to load, and disabling many graphical features seems to be the only (unreliable) fix.  Formations and simulated projectile bullets are gone, both foundational mechanics.Whereas HW1 achieved it's balance by making ships and weapons actually function according to their role, HWC:RM achieves its balance via HW2's rock/paper/scissors balance, by arbitrarily weighting certain ships to function less effectively against ships they aren't meant to be useful against. Actual simulated projectiles and formations were never made to function in HWC:RM.If they had just upgraded textures and models and called it a day, they would have shown this game more respect.  Instead, they crammed it into an engine it wasn't meant for, ignored everything that became broken because that new engine doesn't support foundational game mechanics, and released it with numerous game-breaking bugs that after almost two years they never bothered to patch, despite a number of balance patches.

												I'm not entirely sure what they were thinking with Homeworld 1 remastered, especially putting the original in there beside it. Strikecraft, tactics and formations feel incredibly neutered and pointless in the remastered game. All it does is just confuse a fight more times than it helps, unlike the original where it was an important part of small unit tactics. Still, the story and pacing are mostly the same and it feels right.Homeworld 2 remastered... Where do I start? The story they give you is strange and vaguely nonsensical that wrecks some of the plot points from the first one for absolutely no reason that is apparent to me. It lacks the relaxed pace of the first game with crisis' piling up in your lap before you have a chance to deal with previous ones. Your opponents, the Vaygr, not only vastly outnumber you in each mission, but you quickly notice the quality of their craft also outstrip your own in most instances, this leaves every single engagement an attempt to overwhelm them and the fact that the mission automatically ends (also unlike the first one) means you have no chance to rebuild or reinforce your fleet before heading to the next mission.The game looks pretty, but I feel that was Gearboxes ONLY concern when they remastered this game.

												To begin the dot pointsThe lowsGames are often long, like most RTS gamesteams and units are constantly being balancedmatch making suffers for the usual people driven problemsThe HighsGreat ScoreTerrific visual effectsfun campaigndynamic teams and unitsterrific battle chatterWhy I like itIts an old school classic remastered as it says! This jem is one of a kind and in my opinion it is the staple for space RTS with a terrific score and challenging campaign. Its shining multiplayer skirmishes when players work together to defeat the opponent, where matches feel like a tug of war with players contesting resources until the final battle big battle with fighters and capital ships each filling out their repeated roles. Homeworlds beauty is in the campaign, each mission allows for the ships that survived to remain with you, and if your lucky you can keep that elite group of fighters that you get a the beginning. In addition, the steam workshop has great fan made mods such the stargate, battlestar, star wars and my two personal favorites Mass effect and Halo conversion mod. "

												I have to say that Homeworld series is absolutely amazing. The remastered edition has beautiful graphics with lots of special effects that make you drool at the eye candy. The combat is fun and the plot sucks you in. However I find the first Homeworld to be incredibly buggy with everything from broken quests, wrong army size displayed and extremely slow unit movement. In addition I found the difficulty to be completely unfair and a chore to finish. I think you will have a LOT more fun to just play Homeworld 2 remastered edition. Overall I highly recommend 8/10.

Homeworld is one of the most unique RTS's ever made! There is still no other game (that I know of, anyway) that's anything like it. Not only was the fully 3D environment groundbreaking, the graphics had a beauty unlike anything ever seen before. This is how space games were meant to look!The remastered version is everything that the original was, and so much more. This isn't just an update to make the game compatible with modern machines, this is an honest, thorough HD remake of the game. The game looks fantastic, even by today's graphical standards. The gameplay still feels fresh and unique. I've played this game 15 hours since it was released, and not ready to quit anytime soon! In all those 15 hours, I have not run into any bugs or game breakers. The game has been smooth the whole way through,. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, as I want to finish the campaigns first, so maybe there are some bugs there (it is still in beta, after all) but the single player experience is flawless.If you were a fan of the original Homeworlds, this is a must have for you! If you have never played the originals, then now is definitely the time to experience this gem of a game!			"

												I played Homeworld 1 not long after it first came out, some 14-15 years ago. I got stuck early on as it was too hard for me, but I still remember it well. I was pleased seeing this come to me from Humble Monthly, as I kept hearing how good the originals were. Maybe the remaster is just as good?I suppose most people don't expect an amazing story when they go to play an RTS. And this is how Homeworld stands out in my eyes. Sure, some strategies had really cool campaigns (ex. Red Alert, Starcraft...) but Homeworld is like a class of its own. In terms of lasting, emotional impact it is perhaps unrivaled in its genre (although still not a tearjerker proper since it's still a strategy). The ""we are away"" moment at the beginning of the first campaign is - for me - one of the most memorable moments in all of gaming and how they redid it at the beginning of the second? Excellent. The whole game just feels surprisingly artsy a lot of time. Maybe it's the semi-choral pieces. Maybe the ambient, dead-silent camera pans at the height of drama during cutscenes. Maybe the gorgeous backgrounds that fail to convey the size and scope of the universe but do their best trying. Maybe the attention to detail in the writing and establishing a vast world.Before you run off to get it, let me warn you. This is not an effortless feels dispenser. This is still a remaster of a game designed and made in the 20th century. Back then they made games hard. I mean hard. Homeworld got a graphical facelift but it's still as difficult for me as it was 15 years ago. Giving move and attack orders in 3D in the middle of battle without pausing, when all the forces intertwine is a right cluster*uck. You can actually pause and give orders but the tutorial didn't say so and thus I had to complete the whole game without it. But the absolutely worst thing is a system that scales up the amount of enemies spawned against you based on your resources. That means not only the ships you have on the field but also the amount of resources (money) you have in the bank. If that sounds as abhorrent to you as it does to me, then you probably've guessed that this game had a close shave with the thumbs down button. Luckily, there is a brilliant mod here, which allows to adjust that mechanic (or turn it off altogether). With this, the game is actually manageable.I had fairly high expectations for this game and it lived up to them. Both in the quality of the source material (which was unknown to me up to this point) and its remastering into a modern product. If you'll hear people say Homeworld was a milestone for gaming they generally are not lying, although it was a bit niche due to its uncompromising difficulty and thus this milestone was quickly left behind.

												I played this game back in 2000, and it consumed a good part of my freshman year of high school. It's a perfect storm of perfection - perfect music, perfect crackling, crisp audio comm from your pilots, perfect sound effects.The graphics in this remake are stunning, just as the original game was stunning back in 1999. Seeing the re-meshed, re-textured ships for the first time again as they fly out of the Mothership's bays is like greeting old friends after years away. I may have actually shed a tear of delight when I saw the good ol' bug-shaped Salvage Corvette, ready to steal slow moving Ion Cannon Frigates at my command.If you like RTS games, there is no question that you should get this game. If you've never played Homeworld, you're in for a treat.(my only downside is that Gearbox seems to have been a bit overzealous in bringing Homeworld2 engine-based strategy into Homeworld. There are plenty of threads about this elsewhere. I'd prefer if they patch the game to make the original game remaster as close to, well, the original game, as possible).			"

												Spoiler Free Review: Once you step into the realm of Homeworld, a flood of memories will hit you like an onslaught, meeting an old friend, a friend who is out to kill you.  I remember the game being hard, but I totally forgot how hard.  If you like a challenge, this is the game.  It is both engaging and challenging.  You're not playing for the story, which is contrived, but it's the game play where this game shines. Controls are excellent for moving in 3D space, and the graphics are quite an improvement over the originals.  I wish the graphics were a bit better though, they aren't the best of what is currently out there, a little room for improvement.Be prepared for a challenge.  You'll replay levels that you won just so you can have a few more ships and resources left over to give you an edge in the next mission.   Rating: 8 out of 10. Recommended.

												I cannot tell you the countless hours I've put into the original homeworld series. I was a super huge fan of the entire thing, even the never mentioned cataclysm. To say I was excited to see this game remastered was an understatement.For those that are not familiar with homeworld: It's a fantastic space strategy simulation game. You use your massive motherships as space factories and face off against other ships/factions. The scale of combat expands quickly from smaller fightercraft all the way up to massive capital ship battles. It features a harvesting economy, salvage, ship theft & invasion, and a lot of research and development to keep your fleet operating and developing in a fashion of gameplay that you enjoy. The HIGHLIGHT of this game is that it's fully 3D. You can make attacks and travel along the Z axis freely.As a returning player, the remastered game has exceeded all my expectations.1) The new graphics engine upgrades are gorgeous, giving you a much more believable/enjoyable visual experience.2) Multiplayer: Has been masterfully reworked so that the kushan, higaaran, taidan & vagyr all fight in the same maps. Each one has it's own distinct (yet familiar) style of gameplay, and benefits.3) With Steam support, the mod packs of this game are exceptionally easy to use! You can quickly ""subscribe"" to mods, and flick them on & off at a whim!I HIGHLY suggest this to anyone who is either a returning player wishing to re-kindle some nostalgea, or to new players who wish to experience one of the best space tactical games out there to-date.P.S. For those who throught homeworld was great buy easy, try the complex 9.1 mod! It upgrades the game in almost every way!			"

												This was one of the very first space RTS games I have ever played back in my early teens. With the remastered edition, graphics are slightly updated and everything (especially UI) is given a better polish. For it's age (and update), it can still hold value for space fans.I haven't completed the first Homeworld but have the second (and am still sort of unfamiliar with the story). Basically, you play as this race called the Hiigarans. The game starts with the Hiigarans attempting to finish constructing their mothership but are quickly interrupted by attacking Vaygr enemies. From what I understood from the first game, there are 3 ancient power cores in the universe that if all three are collected by the wrong people, ""end times"" can ensue.The gameplay follows a somewhat unique sequence. There is no base to build. There are no supply depots. There are no factories. There is only the mothership! The mothership is capable of building resource collectors, battle units from interceptor to capitol ship size and mobile resource centers. It is the headquarters that will provide everything necessary and will take your leftover units to the next level. Capitol ships and space stations are also units that can create more units. The issue here is that certain units require certain modules to build. A capitol ship cannot build frigates unless a frigate module has been built. Same concept applies with the space station. The challenge here is trying to balance out the fleet while being conservative with resources. The RTS factor to the game is unique in the sense that most of the crafts you build come in squadrons (except for the larger units like frigates). The space in which you can tell the units to move is on a 3D plane (the Z axis positioning can be modified by holding shift and the right mouse button). This adds some substance to the game as you can ambush your opponent in 3D! Having the right setup and formation can really bolster defense. Choosing units isn't too much of a hassle. If you find that your selecting repair units as well as military units, there is a special setting within the options to prioritize selection of military units. This is a good way to keep your peon units out of fights. There can be a lot going on at times and it can be hard to keep track of units. Pressing space will allow the player to zoom out and see the ENTIRE battlefield. This is a good way to manage your units. To make the camera go up and down for a better view, simply press insert or delete.There are a few categories of units : strike craft, utility class, capital and frigate. Strike crafts usually come in groups (of 3 to 5) and consist of interceptors, bombers and corvettes. Bombers are more or less meant to strike larger ships and structures. Corvettes are quite slower than interceptors but pack more of a punch in their armor and weapons. Frigate classes have the ability to heal themselves but quite slowly. There are two types of frigates, marine and flak. Flak is meant to deal some heavy damage to structures and larger ships while marine frigates are meant to invade and seize control of structures or even opposing ships. Capital ships consists of carriers (which can build ships) and two battle focused units : destroyers and battle-cruisers. The mothership is the only ship capable of creating such behemoths. Destroyers are quite obvious and are meant to be like boulders rolling from afar but battle-cruisers are definitely devastators. They are able to have 5 strike crafts docked with them and give an additional 2 module slots. These guys are definitely the bad boys of the game. Resources are harvested by specialty units called resource collectors. Resource collectors need to be told where to go in order to start their operation. They may stop in their tracks when there are no more resources left in an area and will most likely have to be told to move on to somewhere else. A mobile resource center can be created to cover more area and allow your resource collectors to submit their resources there instead of going all the way back to the mothership. Resource collectors are also able to repair units and structures but require additional research to unlock this ability. Research upgrades are available for a lot of units to improve their defense, mobility or offense. New unit types also have to be unlocked through research. Additionally, a few units will have special abilities available to unlock (such as corvettes laying out mines).The visuals are pretty good. Definitely an upgrade from the original. The sounds are good and provide a decent atmosphere. The explosions sound varied as well as the weapons. The dialogue is as intriguing as the story line. Honestly, going from the old graphics to this is really enjoyable. I feel though you could have done just a bit more to make it that much more appealing to the eyes.Overall, a good game. The ability to fight in three dimensions coupled with it's unique approach to creating units makes the game poke it's head from the crowd. I found the price to be a bit steep and bought this game off a humble bundle. I think if it's for sale under $15 and you're a real space fan, you'll like it. If you're looking for ground breaking space RTS/battle simulator, this isn't it.RATING : 7.35/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  Ship size varies greatly in this game You can target sub-systems What the view looks like after pressing space Even though I'm a little overzealous in saying that the graphics could have been better, it's still pretty good Welcoming a destroyer to this world The camera is quite flexible "

												Well, 15yrs later I returnSadly, I think its a game that was probably better in the past, due to its ground breaking nature. Its lost none of the appeal however, but kept the bugs you had long forgotten!Returns are the bad formations, when your forces are slow to move and allocate firepower, that allow the AI's smaller forces deal more damage to you. Firing at salvaged ships. Building fighters that do nothing. However, you get to relive the story mode, which gives you love for the faceless race you represent. You travel the known galaxy in your attempt to see your old Homeworld. You get to feel the immense power of having a Heavy Cruiser. It really is about reliving your past with this game, is it worth the money you spent to get the game? probably not, but thats not the point of this game. You write the story as your people return home!In all, I'm enjoying the game, its nice to see a game where just building a massive force doesn't mean victory. Brute force means nothing if your taking damage from a Super Nova. Or when your larger ships become enemies versus a ghost ship. Then you get to try to fight enemies on your terms, using your tactics...which mostly involve salvage corvettes....I would say get the game, its past of your past, and with Steam Workshop, the endless mods should add hours of gameplay.Pro'sImpressive and heartwarming storylineA 3D enviroment Con'sDodgy formations which can give the enemy the advantageStrange ship discissionsHarvasting system is very strange and just plain annoying, as they spend ages getting place to place. and when you hyperspace, you are given ALL the RU's on the map, making the harvasting of little point (the hyperspace tip is fantastic for the super nova mission, where you can lose all harvasters)			"

I  have finished HW! remastered version and the bugs  drove me crazy. All the bugs you have read about elsewhere on the internet are true. On top of that it is not the original game, why remove fighter fuel? it added so much tactical depth.

This is Ender's Game meets Civilization by way of Starcraft-all the way back in 1999.For those of you who played the originals, it's Homeworld with better graphics.Very intuitive controls, and you have the option to play the originals OR the remastered versions.The AI can be somewhat wonky, but it isn't a deal-breaker.Having played the original Homeworld a lot back in the day, it's refreshing to play it again after a long hiatus.  The reason why my time is so low on this is because Steam doesn't register playtime when I'm not hooked up to the internet.I definitely recommend it.   "

												If you're searching for a good RTS with full 3 dimensional battleground, or simply a really good RTS, it's the one.If you have the heart of a warrior and won't go down without a fight, Homeworld also have great campaign story.It's a good RTSThe remastered collection come with the classical version wich I recommend too for their original gameplay.The remastered have really nice graphics, true to the classic version wich bring majesty to endless space.And before I forgot, it's a good RTS.It also have an immersiv audio that really let you feel deserted space,  epic battle and sorrowAnd one BIG feature : mods ! lots of fun mods with some that completly change the game to make it another great game on its own.

												I remember when I first played Homeworld in 99. It impressed with it's captivating storytelling, visuals and soundtrack. It was the best space 3d RTS anyone knew at that time.Remastered version has all the great aspects of the game intact (mechanics, UI friendliness and controls of HW2, epic soundtrack) but where it really delivers is even more tuned narration and suberb graphical overhaul (light rays, shaders, textures of immense quality, motion blur, bloom and depth of field effects).This is a legendary gem, carefully polished and brought out to public once more to grace it's status of still being one of the, if not the best space 3d RTS game made to date. Homeworld is deep, captivating, incredibly atmospheric and now stunningly beautiful aswell with Steam multiplayer support. Only downside is that Cataclysm (standalone expansion of original game) has not been remastered and classic version is not included in the package. Homeworld is one of the best games I have ever played and still is unbeaten champion in it's genre 16 years from its original release. Use the chance to experience the game in all of its glory. It is that good! /props to Gearbox9.5/10			"

												I played the original game way back in 2000. I played the two sequels when they came out, as well. I loved them to bits. But then I heard Gearbox was doing a remastering of the games. Say what you will about Gearbox, they hit it out of the park with this collection. I nearly cried when I started Homeworld up for the first time in a decade and a half.The good: Basically everything. The audio was remastered based on the original recordings and it all sounds incredible. The graphics have been updated and look gorgeous. The UI now using the Homeworld 2 UI for both games, which is a massive improvement over the original Homeworld.The bad: No one knows what happened to the source code for Homeworld: Cataclysm, which was a cool, albeit strange, spin off from Barking Dog Stuidios. Therefore, the Collection is, in my opinion, incomplete. Maybe we'll get lucky and the source code will turn up.The takeaway: I had felt that Homeworld had held up pretty well, given it's age. I still think that, but the Remastered Collection brought the game to being as close to perfect as a game can get.			"

												I cannot in good conscience recommend this ""remaster"" of Homeworld 1 & 2. The new graphics are fantastic (when they aren't glitching out) but the game takes a step backwards in almost every other regard.Fuel consumption is gone, which while convenient, almost entirely negates the necessity of support frigates and carriers. Fighter screens now break formation at the first sign of enemy contact, and tactical stances are seemingly nonexistent.Some aesthetic flourishes from the original have been removed, things only a vet would notice. Research stations no longer rotate idly. The game automatically collects all resources between missions, which bugs the heck out of me. One of my favorite atmospheric touches in the original was the time spent quietly and patiently gathering minerals after a fight. The sluggishness of this process gave you time to reflect on the story, made you admire the beautiful outer space vistas and felt like something a real life space commander would have to endure. It was cool. Now the game just slurps everything up after it's too late to make any use of it.The song ""Homeworld"" by Yes has also been removed from the credits, due to legal reasons. Give me a break.What bothers me the most, however, is the complete removal of title cards for in-game speech. A nifty rectangular box with a character portrait used to pop up whenever someone talked to you. Now it's just a boring line of floating text.Some of the in-game triggers no longer function. In the last mission, Captain Elson never showed up with his relief fleet and I was left to attack the enemy flagship on my own. And before I forget: Every other time I played the game I'd be greeted with flickering textures or see-through ships. No matter how many graphical options I switched on or off, raised or lowered, nothing could be done. It was distracting. Unacceptable for a release priding itself on its updated graphics.Lastly, the game just feels dumbed-down and generally easier.Basically, Gearbox just ""upgraded"" every design aspect of Homeworld 1 to that of Homeworld 2, a game which, despite the graphical overhall, inspired ship designs and stellar soundtrack, always failed to capture my imagination. The lack of manual Hyperspace is ultimately what killed it for me.Perhaps the most grievous sin in this ""remaster"" is the absense of the best game in the Homeworld series: Cataclysm. Yes, I understand they've ""lost"" the source code. How hard would it be to rip a copy off the disc and include it in the download? If you haven't played Cataclysm, you are missing out. It is one of the best real-time strategy games ever made, and probably the only title in the genre to fall under the unique label, ""horror-RTS"".If you have never played a Homeworld game then this is a must buy, as classic versions of both 1 & 2 are included. If you were already a fan, like me, skip it or wait for a proper patch.			"

												The term ""HD Remake"" is thrown around a lot these days and conveys almost the same amount of infamy as ""Early Access"". Homeworld Remastered, however, is an absolute exception. Gearbox seemed to have made it their goal to stay as true to the original as possible, while still carrying it over to 2015. Very successfully so, I might add!Quick overview:Homeworld's core game mechanics have been entirely preserved for Homeworld Remastered, down the smallest detail. It is delightful to see how extremely well Homeworld's rather unique approach to 3D real time strategy has aged.Graphics have been revamped while absolutely keeping in line with the game's distinctive art style. It's beyond anything I expected. NB: The original Homeworld 1 user interface has been forfeited in favour of Homeworld 2's much leaner and less cluttered UI. Smart move, really.Sound and music, both in terms of recording quality and ingame sound engine, had major overhauls. Very noticeable. After all, they got none other than Paul Ruskay himself, who scored Homeworld's original soundtrack.This ""remastered"" version was clearly done by people who appreciated the original game for what it represented back in 1999 (and many years to follow). They gave it a loving, respectful, much desired and much needed facelift to bring it to modern systems.The result is nothing short of stunning. Players new to the series are absolutely recommended to take a closer look at the revival of an RTS cult classic; Homeworld veterans will immediately feel at home and - as in my case - nostalgic as hell.10/10, easily.

												TLDR: Wait a few months for gearbox to fix it or for the mod community to fix it.If you were a huge fan like myself you may be dissappointed with the First homeworld remastered game. As that was the main one I was looking forward to. It makes a great first impression till you start to realize that the hotkeys are now more complicated then they were in the past. So it feels like you are trying to dance with the keyboard. Having units autotarget friendlies and enemies is a tedieous task. The worst example is with repair vessels. Before you could tell them to fix any damaged ships you selected. Now they only focus on a single ship till you tell them to change. Sphere formations guarding a vunerable ship was a great startegy in the past. Not anymore. If you tell a ship to guard another. It would be distracted by something as a single probe and forget about its target you told to guard. Because of this I have the odd feeling that is why they decreased the number of enemy ships you have to fight on some missions. Because they must have been like  ""Oh crap we made this game harder then the orignial to play. Maybe we should give them a tiny bit of slack if we want them to micromanaged every single ship. Also you know how you could easily select formation of ships in the orignal as well? not anymore. Now you select every single ship of that type on screen when you double click. And not just the formation you want to seperatly move. That is all I found so far before I gave up and replayed the orignal to make sure my memory of how it controlled and played was the same. Sure enough the orignal plays as great as it always has but this remastered edition feels like 1 step forward and 2 steps back. Wait a month or two before buying and maybe gearbox might patch some of the old gameplay features back in. If not we will have to rely on the mod community to help fix the remastered versions. So far they been doing a good job but to fix everything is going to take awhile. If they ever make a homeworld 3 I will not buy it because gearbox tricked me into thinking it would be fun. They made it look pretty but not fun. If you don't beleive me and having troubles with the remastered version. Go give the orignal version a try and you will see how much better it controls.Only nice thing with this collection is the inclusion of the orignal 2 games to make up for the fact they dropped the ball in various areas.

												Where to begin? Homeworld 1 and 2 probably form the basis for the late THQ's success in the RTS genre; an excellent story driven campaign, X,Y,Z axis space combat, an epic sense of scale in relation to said combat and one of the best soundtracks to any game, not to mention the stylish cut scenes that convey the story to the player. However the remastered collection has reworked both titles (HW1 and HW2) in an improved homeworld 2 engine and thus delivers what we all wanted; HW1 in high definition jaw dropping glory. Also players can now enjoy a combined multiplayer experience with the factions from both games available to play against one another; so if you ever wondered who was the more hard core out of the Tiadan and the Vagyr you can now find out! Last and by no means least the steam workshop adds mods from many diverse sci fi franchises such as star wars, star trek, BSG, mass effect, wing commander etc etc. Therefore in conclusion I am rather grateful that nothing crazy like Homeworld 3 was attempted as the original two games have been unsurpassed for over a decade - until now.

												The good-Mothership-A classic restored. Homeworld is a gem i regret missing out back in its hey day. There is a reason why its the Granddaddy of space RTS.-RTS is rock solid. You assign control groups into several different formations. There is a good reason to delay finishing a mission to harvest resources. Surviving untis carry over to the next mission and each has a purpose, some have abilities, but each has strenghs and weakness to consider. -Each level bring a unique obstacle to overcome. -Some enemy units and tactics can feel cheap but preperation and good strategy will always win out. It helps to be patient and methodical and it feels tremendous when you overcome.-Tactical overlay is awesome and i wish more space RTS had it. -Strong narrative. The lore is an interesting take on space fantasy and the far future. Its dramatic, somber, compelling and well paced.-Remastered visuals are pretty. Explosions are vibrant and explody. Wear and tear show up on selected ships and debris liters space. You can pause the action to take snapshots if compelled.-The audio is outstanding. The voice work, sound effects, the OST in particular is, in my opinion, the best in this genre.The bad-The game can and will crash. Its a given with games today sure but when you're  30mins+ into a mission that's going well nothing is more irratating than an unexpected crash.-Unit management can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. Despite ordering a group to be defensive and gaurd another unit (which you assume they would hold their ground and fire at incoming enemy) they'll go off and chase an enemy and get slaughtered.You really have to consider what all units are doing at once which gets tricky when the fighting heats up. Just know that units you assign to gaurd WILL fly off to assault what the gaurded is ordered to attack. Formations is key.-♥♥♥♥ the Junkyard Dog.-Some mission objectives might not register despite having done excatly as instructed forcing you to restart Steam or at worst redo the whole mission.The ugly-My system more than meets the requirements but the game can get glitchy in long play sessons. RUs and captured units can dissapear from the screen but be in game.-Units can freeze in place-Acheivements, whether you care or not, might not unlock forcing you to redo missions. Despite the bugs if you're an RTS fan, Homeworld is definitely worth playing and worth the price of admission. Thank you Gearbox and Blackbird for restoring this classic. Thank you Relic			"

												Homeworld is two games I have spent hours and hours playing. From the (incredible) main campaigns to the excellent mods for them. So Remastered comes and polishes them up (and ports HW1 to the HW2 engine) which seems like the perfect of perfects. Except its not. Except it is.HW1 mechanics are flawed. Badly. Sometimes hilariously. The port of the game over to the HW2 engine is not as smooth as I hoped it would be. They nerfed the salvette everything strategy, but the HW2 AI is kind of laughable in HW1's tactical situations anyway, plus the addition of default ""jump with all map resources"" from HW2 takes out the need for fleet tooling and resource op micromanagement which was kind of a staple for me in the first game. But it does (largely) function like it should. Homeworld 1 still feels like Homeworld 1. And it. is. glorious. But where remastered really shines is with Homeworld 2. Designed for the engine already the gameplay and visuals are just absolutely flooring if you've played the game back in the day. It's easily the best looking space RTS. Even beating out Sins. Gearbox nailed the graphics and sound for both packages and the game is gorgeous and plays very well on my system, even in large engagements. There's rough areas, MP is broken, it took a while for me to even get the game to launch, and HW1's mechanics are iffy at parts. However this is still the Homeworld I remember, redone in highest quality that could command AAA prices. I have no personal ties to Cataclysm though, so I can't comment on that too much. I know its some kind of hugemassive problem for some people. They shouldn't look this gifthorse in the mouth though. 10/10 AI still reks me at mission 3 of HW2 :|			"

												As much reverence as I have for Homeworld, this game feels like it's in beta.Broken damage from ion cannons and capital ships, pitifully low salvage corvette cap, fighter pathing issues that will make you throw your monitor, dumbed down missions, dumbed down resource collection (rendered moot after misison five due to auto collect), dumbed down AI (refusing to use capital ships to defend primary missions objectives, not using gravity well generators, not using cloak generators), and most importantly, the game RANDOMLY HAVING MISSION OBJECTIVES GO BLANK, which renders your current mission unable to be completed.That was fun, after I took three hours to capture the entire enemy fleet on mission 14, Bridge of Sighs, and my objectives went blank, refusing to let me finish the mission despite destroying the inhibitor array.The game feels watered down and panders to the ""can't be bothered to figure it out"" type of gamer. Much as I dislike badmouthing studios, this is the reason gearbox is sketchy. It honestly feels like an EA product: well intentioned but relentlessly frustrating. If steam had better customer support I'd try to get my money back.The pretty skins and good memories of creepy space don't outweigh the absolute frustration of trying to bumble my way through this trainwreck.

												(only addressing HW1R, not the others in the set)A beautiful reskin of the original, but a surprising amount of gameplay bugs are pretty readily apparent:- formations do not work AT ALL: ships can be moved into one, but they disintegrate entirely upon combat, and strike craft are now almost a complete waste of money since they get individually picked off way too fast.- no evasive tactics mode to harass/delay enemy units- salvaged ships can't be retired until the next map- friendly units will fire on ships on their way to be salvaged- salvage corvettes can't intelligently divide up multi-ship captures anymore- healing units don't watch over not-yet-damaged units correctlyOther surprising design choices:- research cost a bit of money now (OK)- LOTS more resources on maps, including salvagable capital wreck scap, means things feel MUCH easier now- strike craft no longer use fuel, reducing need for forward support frigate/carrier deploymentThis game need one or more patches BADLY.I will be happy to change my review to recommend it once the issues get fixed, since it's still a solid design at its core.

												Be careful before you buy.If you were expecting a complete port of the original homeworld with a graphical update then this is not the game you're looking for, save your money and play the classic version. There's features in the remastered HW1 that aren't working as intended, Tactics and Formations are broken and are (apparently) not likely to be fixed. It is impossible for anyone who played HW1 to not notice that these things are broken and any claim that they're working as intended, or that it doesn't negatively effect gameplay is patently false. Listen, I'm not a purist but the developers had to of known this wasn't working correctly. Why they couldn't have been up front with people and say that there were certain things they couldn't port and let us decide whether or not we wanted to make the trade offs for the better graphics? Probably because they now have my 30 dollars and don't really give a crap. That sort of dishonest buy-now-patch-later crap is what is ruining PC gaming.The game is playable although buggy, and from what I am reading HW2 is working as intended, but not going to lie when I say that HW1 remaster is a let down.

												I know there are far more detailed reviews out there, and far more emotional, too. I'm not trying to compete with those, just expressing my personal feelings.For those that haven't played HW1, just two words: go ahead. This won't disappoint, and you won't even notice the things us ♥♥♥♥♥♥s are unhappy about. For the likes of me, however, here's what to expect.First off, this is not Homeworld 1. Close, much closer than expected, but still no. All those tiny details will make you feel something isn't quite right, no matter how well or poorly you remember the original. The UI, of course, is probably the worst offender, feeling too modern, too... I just don't know the right words. I guess the UI aesthetics have changed greatly over time, and I am sad to see Gearbox going the HW2 route when it came to styling (hopefully, it's not as clunky as HW2 was, but the overall UI art is on the same track). But this is a minor issue, and once you get over it, you will notice it is quite playable. Make no mistake, the old one wasn't perfect either, it was just much more ""in theme"".Next thing you notice (unless, you crash on mission load as I did numerous times, in that case make sure you aren't overgenerous selecting texture quality), it looks gorgeous (albeit, a bit too ""sleek"" when compared to the first game. That is just a feeling, and it comes from the game defaulting to HW2 colour scheme, nothing else. Once you select original HW1 colours you're back with the old feel of ""newbies to space"". It is a great thing, really.They did choose to port HW1 into HW2 engine, which made the game lose some of its original features, like simulated projectiles, and it fails miserably at holding formations, plus there are differences in resources available, ship costs, oh, and research now costs too. That all said, I am glad to say I didn't pick most of these things till I've been told about them. And, what's most important to me, the original feeling of being alone out there, a small island of life in the middle of cold indifferent space, it all has translated well into the remake.Furthermore, most of these changes weren't there to ""make the game better"", rather because the new engine wasn't capable of supporting these things (although, research costs seem like a strange thing, it's not that difficult to set cost to 0, while timers are all there already). And, while it may be a minor thing to some, fighters SHOULD cost 55, not 100.And assault frigates were at 625, unless I'm mistaken.Ok, enough, I'm just being too picky. This is a fine remake, none the less. It actually tries hard to be as close to the original as possible (although, heaven knows, we'd love to see nothing but new textures here). It is far more honest to the original than X-COM was to its grandfather, X-COM: Enemy Unknown, the latter I'd call a major disappointment - you don't make an excellent game better by screwing with it. This one isn't screwed nearly as much.In the end, is it worth playing? It sure is for me - I did try to replay the original again, but that game has aged visually far too much. There are two space games for me that define the 90's. MOO II and HW1. Sadly, 3D does age faster. Playing this doesn't make me cringe as bad, as trying the original would. And yes, it is an enjoyment. Maybe there is this uncanny valley for remakes as well, when the original and the remake are just too close to be called a different game, yet are still not 100% the same, and this would fall into it. But, again, HW:Rem is almost where the original is. X-COM was right in the middle of that abyss.Be a bit more open-minded about it, and you'll love it. Just don't forget you can't enter the same water twice.			"

												Really short review. Probably won't update in the future.The whole package is great, especially for me since I'd never played the originals. It's important to note for Classic players, though, that there are a few changes to ship behavior and mission structure in HW1R(remastered). Aggressive/Evasive tactics are out, literally removed, and some of the missions appear to have been nerfed for some reason, the Kadesh in particular. The game also hosts a dynamic difficulty setting based on your fleet size, though the specifics of its behavior evade me. Strike group behavior is also altered, making behaviors like setting a Defender squadron to Sphere Formation and guard your target behave differently from Classic. The way damage and accuracy are rolled when ships fire are also different (iirc, it's based far more on dice rolling now).Why is it like that? Well, HW1R runs in the HW2 engine.That being said, I enjoyed HW1R a lot. The story is very vague and built on a lot of mysticism and prophetic themes. The game itself was enjoyable, although I wish that the AI on ships were far more intelligent. You do have to babysit your units (in HW2, too).HW2's a lot better as a gameplay experience though, although its story is a bit less interesting. I felt like a greater number of my ships were valuable throughout the course of the game, vs HW1, where the majority of the units you can build become obsolete very quickly.HW1 had a huge pacing problem because there was no form of time-compression to harvest resources, leading to post-mission lulls lasting over 30 minutes at a time where all you're doing is waiting for utility ships to mine up the money. HW2 solved the problem by crediting you with the resources when a mission was completed, and its overall campaign pacing is much more intense and demanding, definitely welcome, than HW1.I wish Cataclysm was in the remaster pack, but apparently Gearbox couldn't secure the source code for the game.Lastly, I haven't played multiplayer.

												I sit here at my computer desk in the wee hours of the morning after just completing the first part of the Homeworld: Remastered games that were recently released on Steam, and as I type away I find it hard to come to the correct words for what I just experienced, so here’s me trying to sum it up for you with what to me is no longer a game, or a footnote on a sheet to check out and play sometime in the future without really ever getting to it, but an idea that was realised in it’s fullest potential and is now at the public’s door once again.Let’s get one thing out the door right away, I never played the original Homeworld. I was too young at the time to really decide what I wanted to play, and what I did play was mostly Starcraft: Brood War (Still in my top games of all time) or rummage through the bucket of Lego in my corner.  So when the news that Homeworld was getting a remaster… I didn’t really celebrate at all and I certainly did not pre-order out the door like I do for way too many games.  Though as the ball kept turning and the time of it’s release drew nearer and nearer I grew infatuated with Homeworld, it’s lore and story that drew me instantly into it, and the sheer scale and effort being put into a game that was cracking on by now.  So this Monday, which is Monday the 2nd of March (I am writing this review on the 7th, in the early hours) I bought it as soon as I could, and here is the result.Homeworld is now what I consider the best story told in gaming.Or at least up there with the greats, of course.The way it was told to me, and how it slowly started to show me this lore that spanned back millions of years in the games universe, the different races and characters I met along the way all felt amazing and diverse, each one beautifully voice acted and all done with space ships on a screen.  There’s no portraits, we aren’t given a face, it’s voices we go on in this experience, and holy hell it knocks it out of the park with that regard.It’s game play (While frustrating at times) is brilliant fun to toy with, there’s nothing more satisfying then launching a full Missile Destroyer attack on the unsuspecting foe below as your attack bombers soar in to deal the final blow, it’s god damned addicting and the fun just comes from finding the ways to out manoeuvre your enemies in the slyest of ways.And finally it’s the music, and how it complements each scene perfectly to the point I was left in awe at what was beset upon my eyes, to the point where this game brought me to tears with the myriad of feelings it produced.  Emotion is key with this tittle, and for the first time in a good long while I was feeling it while playing a game, the twinge of my heart as my favourite Frigate bit the dust, or the cut scenes I will not spoil.Homeworld is an experience for everyone, RTS and non RTS fan alike need to play this game and make it through to the end for the most satisfying ending in gaming.  This game gets my rating of ‘Bury it with me so I can take it to hell’			"

Homeworld 1 Classic & RemasteredThe original unaltered Homeworld 1 Classic is part of the collection & worth every cent. Homeworld Classic is a masterpiece. Homeworld Remastered is a mess. Gearbox Software threw HW1 models into HW2 engine & looked what sticked. The result is one amazingly good looking game with game mechanics broken beyond repair. HW Remastered is a broken, quick & dirty assembled piece of scrapmetal.Homeworld 2 Classic & RemasteredThe only game in this collection that benefits from the Remaster is Homeworld 2. You can play HW2 Classic & HW2 Remastered & you won't see any difference in game mechanics but can enjoy prettier graphics.ConclusionYou have two options here. You either buy the Remaster on a very high discount & only play the original games, or you give Gearbox the middle finger and don’t support their business philosophy to screw their customers over every freaking time.

												I just want to thank you, Gearbox, for messing with one of the best game that I had played in my life! Indeed you improved greatly the graphics, but in exchange you broke the AI. Formation, for example, only work when the ships are standing, but at the first shot the ships start to doing whatever they want, and this will gonna ruin any tactic that you had planned. And there is the Repair Corvette, whose dream is to be a fighter at all cost, even you giving the guard command repeatedly. If you are a fan of HW, prepare to get disappointed and, probably, you gonna pay $35 for playing HW classic version (that I already have in CD).			"

												I love Homeworld. I read about, and waited for the original. I managed to get into the original beta (I have the CD framed). I played this game for hours and days on end. I was depressed when it turned out that the remote turrets were op in mass, and a created nearly unbeatable playing strategy. I felt like a hero when I found a way to beat it. I endured many losses, and more victories playing friends online. I once managed to steal an entire enemy players capital ship fleet with my own fleet of salvage corvettes and a cloaking frigate. THIS, This was Homeworld. Strategy, intuitive interface, as may ships as your computer could handle, and ships that did what you told them.This is not what Gearbox released. They didn't understand the game they were remastering, and because of this, they created an atrocity compare to the original. It is as if they tried to recreate the Mona Lisa using Crayons. They didn't get it. I was afraid this was going to happen when Team Pixel lost the bid for the THQ Bankruptcy. They got it, they understood what made this game so amazing. I was right to fear. GearBox didn't understand; they thought that they could just make it pretty, and as simple as possible. They didn't get that what made Homeworld great wasn't the beauty of the game (though it was spectacular visually), but rather the way everything functioned. If you never played the original, you won't know what you are missing. You will probably enjoy the game just fine.  If you did, don't bother, this game will just make you sad. It will kill off part of your youth. P.S. Most of the hours I have played were just trying to get the game to work on three monitors. "

												I still remember big awe when I first time saw Homeworld game, many years ago. To my surprise at the time, even run comfortably on my computer at the time, which made it even more special. So, this review will be somewhat biased, as this game combines 2 things I love in games - strategy and space. Controls are simplified, but still easy to do everything you have to. Updated graphics in remastered version are impressive, specially if you start classic version that comes with it. Great voices, including late Campbell Lane, who's voice of Bentusi was memorable, well done.Achievements are given for each tutorial and mission, making it easy to collected them all, without too much grind.Only one thing that was disappointment: Homeworld Cataclysm is not in collection?? I loved that story and still have CD somewhere. In any case, I would suggest to everyone to get this game and play it. It is great experience, great story and well worth the time.			"

Graphics and audio are really well done and atmospherical however unit AI, formations and controls are just as wonky and 2000 like the original. Hell even the Salvage-Corvette powerplay to trick the force-limit has been carried over. All in all 9/10. Would have wished for a bit more improvement on the AI and Interface-Front but for 30 bucks I can't complain too much.

												The original games are included.The remake is good but doesn't quite manage to recreate all of the good features of the original.  Some aspects of HW1 can't be recreated because they changed the engine to HW2, and apparently it handles some mechanics differently.  Decide whether it's worth playing the game without formations, evasive tactics mode, and hit detection.  Then add in dynamic difficulty, useless strike craft, and units balanced for multiplayer changing the campaign balance.The harvesters still take about 45min to an hour, real time, to finish harvesting a map, so that hasn't changed.  But they do give up every so often, so you need to renew their orders.			"

												In the past I've heard a bit about how cool Homeworld was, and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. Being a big fan of the RTS genre, when I heard about this game I immediately wanted to try it out, but alas, it was unavailable. So when I saw ""Homeworld Remastered"" on Steam's front page a few weeks ago it went straight to my wishlist, and I ended up buying it the day before release.I was concerned that I might have impulsively spent $30 on something that wasn't really worth it, but now I have no idea why.Having played around 4 hours of this game over the two days since release, I've only gotten more endeared to the game and how epic it feels. Building a huge fleet of frigates, destroyers, and battlecruisers and then proceeding to wipe out some poor AI... Awesome.Some Quick Pros and ConsPROS:-- Phenomenal feel, moving ships around in 3D space doesn't feel confusing or difficult. While I have yet to employ it significantly, I'm sure it will make things quite interesting.-- AI is, for the most part, pretty smart. While it makes some dumb moves from time to time it doesn't give up unless all is lost.-- Oh my word, the visuals are incredible! Next time you have a large group of fighters engaging the enemy, select one of them, focus and zoom in. Large-scale, small-scale, everything looks beautiful, even on my puny GT 630.CONS:-- There's some minor bugs, like when moving ships I'll occasionally lose my mouse cursor for a second or two. Every so often the sound skips and repeats 1-2 second snippets of a clip.NEUTRAL:-- Gameplay moves a bit slower. It requires patience to build up a sizable attack force and deploy it to wipe out the enemy, but once that combat starts you really grasp the benefit of taking the time to work.I may expand on this review as I spend more time playing the game, but if you're still doubting whether you want to buy this, let me eliminate any doubt. The Homeworld Remastered Collection is an awesome piece of work. For $35, you get an incredible RTS, its sequel, and the remastered versions of both. Hopefully Gearbox will provide a demo at some point, but if you're a fan of the RTS genre, purchasing this shouldn't be a question.			"

												An epic and artful strategy with finely tuned mechanics and plenty of replay value. Includes 2 distinct single-player campaigns and 4 (but more like 3) playable races in multiplayer mode. Recent updates have helped to clarify the roles of each unit in the game and to allow for different play styles. Though the online community is relatively small compared to other AAA titles, the game rewards those who come back to it with depth and variety, making it worth the asking price in my opinion.			"

												The entire feel of the orginal games has been lost in a failed attempt at remastering them. Somehow even after considerable time after its release, the collection still feels broken. Pros: -Everything is beautiful compared to the very aged graphics of the originals.Cons: -The AI is buggy at best. HW 1, Mission 5 I had enemy intereceptors doing loops across the map endlessly. Other times, your own units failed to listen to orders at random. -Somehow units are defaulting themselves to passive stance, and while they do stay in formation, all they do is stay, and die. -In HW1 remastered, you are punished unexpectingly for building up your fleet in the previous mission. Mission 3: Captured a bunch of Turanic Raider corvettes in previous mission only to find 6 Taiidan assault frigates obliterating the cryopods I was to save. Redid mission 2, scrapped all corvettes, 2 frigates in mission 3 second time around. Wtf? This happens again in mission 5 where the AI throws 5+ destroyers at you when you cannot even build one at all. Well, that escalated quickly, so much for preparing ahead of time for the battle. -There are many other cons I haven't the time to write a novel to explain.			"

												Home World series had (The only real one) the new genre (back the late '90) and the last so far. It was an amazing sure the space didn't have the up and down, but the 3 Homeworld games had an addictive playablity. Also, it had the best, and most enjoyable game. I played it fron start to finish a couple of dosen times.This, the remastered one, is truly, brought it up to date. The game is basically the same as it did, except for the quality and some ""additions""/""improvte"" in the game. I had my doubts, but a few hours playing and it really worth the price( a bit low if any).  The are a few ""bugs"" in the game, but nothing I saw that caused it to crash. The 93% may have been the old one, but I'd say with things, over 85% at least!			"

												I honestly don't see how anyone could not recommend this game, unless they're some opinionated COD kiddo who wants everything handed to them.This is without a doubt, the best game of the decade 10/10(I'll probably even rank it higher than Fallout 4, if that game ever comes).pros:- difficult gameplay, actually strategy required.- ships. lots. of. ships.- customization- new graphics(the game was already fantastic graphically wise back in 2003 - HW2)- campaign isn't recurring missions like most RTS games now a days. Every mission is unique.- 3D gameworld. I honestly can't think of another RTS with a 3D gameworld(besides Star Ruler, but even that isn't really a 3D field). The closest thing otherwise is EVE Online(by 3D I mean, ships aren't locked to a single axis-field, such as sins of a solar empire would have).- [-VFG-] Approved!cons:- stock up on food, you may lose your job and never want to leave your computer, despite your bloodshot, blistering eyes.- You aren't handed thing. You actually have to think(This is why COD kiddos would negative rate the game...)- old mods like Homeworld 2 Complex, don't work on the remaster... yet....			"

												I have had a great time so far with this game. Kind of Battlestat Galactica-ish. After watching BSG on NetFlix I like to play a few rounds of this game.

												What can I say....I played Homeworld 15 years ago and now I remember why it was one of the best games of that era.I can say that on a 980ti hybrid SLI configuration this game is even more incredible in the highest settings at 4k UHD. No other game captures my imagination like Homeworld. I can almost see all the desperate people in those ships as I help them reach their final destination. My advice would be to read the back story from the original manual that shipped with the game 15 years ago. It has a complete history leading up to the events in the game.Homeworld is one of the reasons we call games works of art.			"

												Before I get into the review I want to address the criticisms of the game's units. There's been a long standing criticism that the game's ""rock, paper, scissors"" gameplay, where everything has a counter. It appears some people are pretty irritated about that. Well, here's the thing: that's warfare. Look at modern militaries today. Everything has a counter. Infantry carry shoulder fired missile systems to destroy vehicles and hard points to remove those threats. Tanks carry both AP and HE rounds to deal with infantry and vehicles. Aircraft can be shot down like nothing by guided missile and surface to air missile systems. Everything has a counter. The game's system for units is actually the more realistic one, believe it or not. So, I don't understand the gripes about it. Just make sure you've got solid recon and you're fine. It's important to note though that even modern militaries have combined arms forces, so don't think that just because you've got the counter to something that you won't get your ♥♥♥ kicked. A well rounded, combined arms force, regardless of its composition, is still a big part of your overall fleet strategy. The next thing I want to address is a big gripe I've seen about fighter strategies. With the hindrance given to fighters in the remastered edition, interceptors no longer play a large role in the battle. They're weaker, and that's also realistic. One thing that should be understood is that air superiority and interceptor aircraft are made for a single purpose: to fight other aircraft. Unless a large ship has no support, there's really no reason why you should be using interceptors to attack a large vessel. The fact of the matter is that you're not going to make a dent in the hull of a ship with a massive superstructure, and a hull designed to both take weapons fire and the force of gravity, in the vacuum of space where a hull breach vents an entire compartment, and possibly an explosive decompression. It just isn't logical to believe that you can make that happen. Historically, the Japanese in world war 2 would run suicide kamikaze attack against a large ship, because that's really the only way a fighter can cause a severe amount of damage against something that big, unless it's carrying bombs. The same goes for any unit in the game, where every unit has a purpose, be it specialized attacks against certain kinds of unit or support for the important vessels in your fleet. But, I digress. If you're looking for a deeply strategic and tactical space simulation with an excellent storyline and back story (seriously, it's fantastic!), then you've come to the right place. With mods being ported over to the Remastered collection, you won't have to wait long for your replay ability value to skyrocket. It's even better that, as I write this review, the game is discounted for the winter sales. You should already have this game in your steam library. As far as I'm concerned, it's blown games like Sins of a Solar Empire off the planet.			"

												Gearbox TOTALLY f'd up quite a few mechanics and missions in the remastered version.  Things that were easy fixes, that they didnt care to get right.  That said, its very pretty, and still Homeworld, my fav game of all time.If youve never played the game before, buy it now.  If you played old homeworld like me, it WILL irk you, ESPECIALLY gardens of kadesh and supernova station.  But I still think its pretty good.  Worth 35$? For HW vets maybe not, for new players VERY much so.Make your own decision, but its still one of the best RTS games of all time.			"

The needle ships you will see in the Garden of Kadesh and Caherdral of Kadesh missions are not as deadly as they were in the original campaing. Overall, the 3-D map combined with epic looking warfare, tons of units and multiple different factions and Ships makes for a great time.

												Homeworlds 1 and 2 are among the best games ever made for PC. This ""Remastered"" version does a good job of preserving that legacy and also adds increased graphic fidelity and performance. The single player missions are engaging, the original's voice acting and artwork remain haunting and first class, the storyline is compelling. If you love science fiction and don't get goose bumps at least once, there is something wrong with you. My sole complaint is that for a game which championed free movement in three dimensional space, that element of strategy is often overlooked in the campaign: like Kahn, your enemies suffer from two-dimensional thinking. But if you've never played Homeworld and you see this game on sale, don't hesitate.Meanwhile multiplayer remains a shabby amateur mess with horrific balance issues, even after a one year wait for patches, and the bulk of the ""community"" is toxic beyond belief, but this is Gearbox and Steam, so you already knew that.

												I missed Homeworld the first time around and I absolutely do not regret picking up the remastered collection. This game is a must for RTS fans for the campaign alone. Having units, tech, and resources arry over from mission to mission makes the campaign feel connected rather than random instances. You actually feel attatched to your mothership in way. The story is actually worth paying attention to and is aided by some great voice-acting, scoring, and a beautiful graphical update. The UI take a bit to get used to but is solid and has options to make long-time Homeworld players feel at home. The implementation of actual 3-D space isn't just for show either, it had me thinking about formations and unit placement in a whole new way.TLDR; There's a reason this game is often considered the best RTS of all time and it isn't nostalgia.

Looks amazing, plays amazing and the remastered soundtrack is incredible and i really appreciated the little details that they put in such as the little gun ports on the motherships and carriers where in the original game they just fired from the walls,  as far as bugs go... there were a few on the ship graveyard level (i hate the junkyard dog) but nothing gamebreaking or unfixable by either restarting the level or just quick docking at the end. as far as everything else is concerned, there isnt much to say this is essentially the original games made to look really pretty (and by god does it look good) sound better, but still play the same as the originals with some UI tweaks here and thereone thing i wish they had implemented though is time compression for HW1...would have cut my mining time down alotand while im at it, would have been nice to choose the colour and race of my fleet like the original did but that being said perhaps i didnt see it.if you liked the original Homeworld games.

												I was about 12 when the original came. I had a friend who would go on and on about it to me, at the time I was silly enough to have no interest in sci-fi though and was too absorbed in Age of Empires 2. That certainly changed in time!I knew I'd love this game because it was conceived by Relic and, as a long time RTS fan, I'd never played one set in space before!One minor grievance is probably simply that the callouts for nearly every unit are identical and spoken in a rather monotone voice and the dialogue lacks any humour or personal touch, from my experience. The music is the absolute opposite though, beautiful and with a uniquely middle eastern flavour! I'm definitely lucky enough to be perhaps one of the rarer people here who are able to enjoy these masterpieces now for the first time, with shiny graphics! "

												Most real-time strategy games I've played are quite lacking in storytelling.  This is not one of those games.  The original creators of this game, Relic (known for the Company of Heroes and Dawn of War Series) are masters of blending storytelling with real-time strategy while not ignoring the importance of replayability through multiplayer.  Homeworld probably has the most poignant stories I've ever seen without the need for fully animated, fully voiced, lip synched characters.Without revealing the plot, I can tell you that you will feel invested for the safety of the people you are commanding and fighting for.On the more technical side, this game was way ahead of its time in 1999 and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old.  The graphical improvements are a welcome change and a more modern, post-dialup era multiplayer lobby is also welcome.  The voice acting of the narrator, the Mothership's computer, and all your units is outstanding and has not changed from the original.The music also deserves an honorable mention for its ability to add to the feeling of every cutscene, every battle, and every dialogue you encounter.  Top notch stuff.  Especially if you like ambient electronic music.The game is not perfect, however.  Like most RTS games from the 90's, it can be heavy in the micromanaging department.    I also have to dock the games for having somewhat clumsy default controls, a UI that leaves a lot to be desired, and a rather steep learning curve.Another con for some may be the rock-paper-scissor formula that Relic is known for throughout their games.  In this game, there are units that are simply a hard counter to another unit.  In later Relic RTS games, you can see where they added in more unit versatility and soft counters through combined arms.  This leads to some rather spammy gameplay that might be a turn-off for some.			"

At the time of this writing there are no campaign missions though, only skirmishes. Generally there are quite a few total conversions available for skirmish play.Starting off with HW 1.What is Homeworld? It's a space RTS game taking place on a 3 dimensional plane. The maps are always round and you can order your ships ""up"" and ""down"". You can either do that on the normal game screen, which is pretty beautiful in the Remastered edition, or you can bring up a tactical view, which makes it a bit easier. The camera can be freely rotated, but zooming on the other hand is pretty limited and finicky thanks to the 3D aspect. Basically you have to anchor yourself to a unit in order to make the most out of zoom. I guess pro players will mainly use the tac display anyway.So far so good. The interface is pretty decent now (uses the HW 2 one I think). Since there aren't too many different combat units (variation of fighters, bombers, different corvettes, frigates and destroyers as well as a heavy cruiser class), there's not that much micro management, although letting your bombers attack into a multi attack corvette screen is generally considered to be a bad idea, which brings me to my first point of critique: The smaller strike craft feel almost useless later on in the game when destroyers and heavy cruisers are in play and you have some interceptors or stealth fighters or said multi attack corvettes...maybe even drone frigates; there's a lot of sturdier bigger craft that can fulfill the role of anti-fighter and anti-capital better than investing in easily destroyed strike craft. Maybe I'm just bad, definitely possible, but the game also never really explains what benefits certain ""formations"" have. I found out by accident that the ""sphere"" formation is a very bad idea for bombers or fighters, since then they remain stationary and surround the target. They work in conjunction and soak up a lot of the damage, but I found myself replacing them almost constantly, while my bigger craft were mostly untouched.Next critique: The game's UI needs work, seriously. There is a button that displays what kind of craft you have and how many, but there is not button to select these craft. For example, try finding a particular craft, perhaps a resource collector, quickly and you're almost despairing. Speaking of resource collectors: Those buggers never seem to mine automatically, mining takes ages and then you need several resource controllers so they don't have to make the trek back home to your mothership every time, which takes, again, ages. And now we've moved on to the glacial pace this game can evolve to. In the later stages, trying to get your capital ships ANYWHERE can easily take 15 to 20 minutes. They turn and move really really slowly. Yes, that feels epic, but sitting there, waiting quarter of an hour for your ships to go SOMEWHERE is the antithesis of fun.Graphics and sound are pretty decent, however, you are either going to dig or hate the music. It's very space epic-esque.The campaign: Homeworld 1 consists of 16 missions (plus 1 bonus mission that can be found in the extra missions section of the main menu...no idea why they cut this one from the main game, because it fits right in there after mission 4 or so and is actually quite fun). Yes, fun, that's something that varies a lot in this campaign. To understand how the campaign works you need to realize that your goal is to reach your Homeworld (who would have thought) with your Mothership, which cannot move during a mission. Neither does it have any weapons...it just sits there and dies if you're not careful, but who cares, since you rarely get attacked anyway. In any case, your units are permanent, meaning, you take them with you to the next mission if they don't get destroyed. This bit is important, since that can either make the campaign really easy or pretty difficult. There is no difficulty setting, but even so I found myself challenged only a handful of times, but once your armada gets big enough, you should not have any problems at all. Some missions are gimicky, destroying asteroids in your way, moving in areas to avoid radiation. Those are pretty interesting, however, the main issue is that they are either over very quickly (mission 15 literally takes 3 minutes to complete...it's a timed defense mission...what!?!? That should have been part of a bigger mission), or take ages to complete, while you slowly crawl your way forward with your big capital ships of which you can only build so many before the supply limit stops you. Haha, BUT you can always capture more and just get a ridiculously large armada. I think I had 6 Heavy Cruisers, about 8 destroyers and 4 missile destroyers or so...while the game only allows you to have 3, 6 and 2 respectively. Add to that 21 frigates (mostly Ion), a full complement of multi attack corvettes as well as some 70 almost useless strike craft and the enemies did not stand a chance. This is the campaign in a nutshell...the story is pretty threadbare, neatly presented in kinda animtated, but still static images and moderately good voice over (all very downtrodden), but it barely makes sense and you're not even rooting for your own team, you don't feel resentment towards the enemies and there are no characters to identify with. Took me 9 hours to complete, but I had to repeat some stuff, and I guess at least 50% of that time was spent building stuff and waiting. By the way, all unmined resources will automatically transfer to your account after a mission ends, but that doesn't mean you should not replace any lost craft before you jump away, since the next mission can literally drop you in a terrible situation in which you need every ship you can get...Actually that happens quite often...MP is well, I dunno, in HW 1 all races seem to have the same units, so...what's the point besides different designs? All in all HW 1 is a good game, but by no means is it as good as people make it out to be. Unfortunately, if you're into this kind of genre, there's not much else, at least nothing contemporary. Sins of a Solar Empire comes to mind first, but that does not have a campaign either and is a 4x cross breed rather than a true RTS.HW 2:You can expect the same engine and gameplay, but in the campaign as well as the MP there are some serious changes. Also for some reason it just looks better to me. Weird.- I find the campaign to be more engaging to be honest. It's also a bit more cohesive, but it's still space opera and in the end you have more questions than answers- The backdrops are just GORGEOUS- The music is more space nomady than space opera now. Better imho- Small ships (anything not capital or special) are now built as a squad, which makes micro managing your ♥♥♥♥ing fighters and corvettes a lot easier now. Also these ships are now stronger in my opinion. They still die relatively quickly in large fights, but at least they do what they are supposed to do and you can rebuild them quicker.- Resource collectors have taken over the job of the repair corvettes, because resource collection in the campaign doesn't matter anyway- Salvage corvettes are now marine frigates and utterly useless (at least in campaign), since easily destroyed, have to remain stationary for ages to board a vessel and if you already have the max no of vessels you can't claim any more- The game FINALLY auto saves- Missions end automatically, which is bad, since you can no longer replenish your fleet after a big battle, which may mean instant failure of the next mission...stupidAll in all cool campaign, but some design decisions are questionable...

												*Note This is a work in progress review, it will change if devs address the major issues with a few of the mechanics.Even though the graphics, audio and UI redesigns are good I cannot recommend this game right now. It seems like gearbox has broken gameplay mechanics entirely in the remaster of HW1 because of the porting of engine to HW2 engine. Here are just a few of the issues:-The formations are wonky and don't work. You need formations to strike enemy ships effectively. In these games they just use their own flight patterns after they get close to enemy and don't stay in formation.-Game is not using balistic system of the original and instead uses rng, so there are too much hard counters to everything. It is not physics based.-Support frigates are useless unless you get them to follow around and make sure they are healing targets.-Capturing mechanics broken, it is too easy.-salvage corvettes easily capture enemy corvettes because evasion mechanics disabled(they are not part of the rng system)-Salvage ships not showing their beam animation-Why is queues limited to 2?-Collision system is broke, stuff like resource collecters and other ship crash into astroids or other objects and then attempt to push through them instead of moving back.-Some shortcuts do work but its inconsistent, like some keys open certain menus but don't close them when pressed again, while others close when pressed again. Its weird.EDIT:Seems I was wrong with some of the UI mechanics. You can highlight and then choose what ships to select, or you can double click a selected ship and it will highlight all similar ships nearby. You can also select military only ships to be highlighted.This is a very good UI mechanic in the game, just wish they would explain in the tutorials.			"

												Reliving my younger years, one of the best games I have played. But my laptop cant run the remastered collection, my fault and for that I will have to wait for a better computer to really see the difference. However, bugs have stopped me in my tracks with the classics. Cant pass lvl 10 because theres a bug that wont let me complete, last patch was supposed to have a fix, but I will have to wait for yet another patch. Once this happened, went to Homeworld 2, changed the resolution to get started and found half the screen off the monitor and no way to change the resolution back. Contacted support and left with having to wait for both issues to be resolved. Disappointing to say the least.			"

												While I think the UI still needs a bit of work compared to the Classic version, this really brings back some memories. I think even someone new to the game will enjoy it's gameplay and story. This Remastered game is truly Remastered in my view. Yes there are just a few items I could complain about verses the classic but all in all you can tell the developers really took their time and put their hearts into the remastering of this game. Beautiful Artwork redesign well thought out UI redesign.Gameplay is almost exactly what it was in the classic versions, the strategy involved is fighting with the correct units not out building you adversary (especially in HW2 even if you cheat with cheat-engine it will populate the enemy to match you in the storyline).

The opening sequence of mission 1 still leaves me grinning and shivers in mission 3 where Karen says 'No-one's left, everyone's gone.

												This game basically invented 3d space rts games and is still the best game like that out there. Game is great, some mechanics from Homeworld don't translate well in the Homeworld 2 engine so there's some issues like formations not working like it used to, repair mechanics nerfed, but hopefully a simple patch can fix that. No other mayor issues that I've encountered, but I would like if ships had more hitpoints because sometimes they just die too fast.

Not only are you basically buying 4 games for 35$ but you get to play how you want, Gearbox did a really good job and i would reccomend anyone that loves the original Homeworld series to get this and I will continue to suggest this to any RTS fan. Updates are releasing regularly and the fanbase are working like mad to update all the wonderful mods for this game. So really combined the 4 games at purchase and the modding community? you have hundreds of hours of gameplay to look forward to spanning homeworld, star trek, star wars, stargate, mass effect, robotech, babylon 5, and on and on.

												I was (am) an owner of the original games, hw1, hw Cataclyism, hw where you play as the tuscan raiders & hw 2.  I love the games, and I was very happy when I heard about and purchased the re-released, updated version of HW1 & 2.However good they are, they are not without their fault, these faults only exist in the remastered versions however.The graphics are very pretty indeed, a lot of time has clearly gone into redoing it all, I would say that it's a bit of a system hog, I've got a very good, top of the range gaming laptop and the fps dips horrendously if everything is maxed during a firefight - however it's still in Beta and I've no problem dropping my settings a little, and I'll gladly update this review once the game is no longer in the beta stage.  Storyline hasn't changed, it could easily be made into a series or movie, that's how good it is.  Nor has the sound fx or music been amended, this isn't a bad thing as both capture the situations perfectly.  There are still a few bugs here, but again, it's Beta.The single player campaigns are the same, 16 missions for each game, plus the beta multiplayer.  The whole game is still beta though really, lets not fool ourselves here.  In terms of gameplay the first is (was) more difficult and required more patience, finesse etc.  That feeling has gone and now the game feels somewhat dumbed down, the UI is simpler, easier, it's not something I approve of as previously in HW1 you were able to assign your ships different tactics, more power to engines or weapons at the cost of the other, or the middle ground.  On top of this you were also able to assign formations, these have gone, what remains is something that's an insult to previous games here.  I don't know why they didn't keep it because it brings in whole new dimensions, particulalry in multi player.  It is however the Beta and so perhaps they will re introduce them.  Whilst these things were only present in HW1, the sequal and the muiltiplayer would be vastly improved if included.  Yet are not, why Gearbox, WHY?There are still balacing issues with the ships, for example in multiplayer you have the choice of either being Taiidan or Kushan from HW1, or Vagyr or Hiigarian from HW2.  There are pros and cons to each, but the latter 2 are more superior in the long run, and are easier for new players to get to grips with the game.  Whilst these ship balancing problems are by no means game breaking they are a little ridiculous.  For example the laser corvettes from the vagyr are specifically designed to destory frigates and capital ships, and they do this very well...the problem is that it's a little too well.  Whilst there are ships designed to destroy them, you can't help but feel there still many issues that need to be addressed. The game may also crash if you click your mouse during the multplayer loading screen, post lobby.  I suppose that one is game breaking.  Just don't click and you'll be fine :) I'm sure Gearbox will fix the issues as they have made numerous improvements so far.  It's merely a question of when, not if. To summerise, this is still a fantasic game the graphics are ""ooohhh aaaaa"" pretty, the ships are very detailed.  Graphics, sound fx, story, all very good.I'd happily give the original versions of hw1 & hw2 a 9/10....but these are not the originals.  Even if there were no bugs I'd still only give this game a solid 7.5/10.Why?  The redesigned UI, I don't like it, they have thrown out a really important part of the game :(Should you buy this game?  Oh yes, but remember that there are numerous bugs that will likely ♥♥♥♥ you off, and the UI is still dumbed down to the point that my cat could quite easily give you a half decent game.Once the game is no longer in Beta I will rereview.Cheers.

												Was looking forward enormously to playing this game again after all these years.Unfortunately this ""Remaster"" has developed bugs i don't remember being in the original.Homeworld Remastered, Drone frigates do nothing except miss constantly at the fighters they're supposed to ""obliterate"", this makes some fighter heavy missions very difficult, particularly the enourmous swarm of fighters bit...Homeworld Classic Mission 10 has serious amounts of Gamekiller bugs which won't let you complete the mission.In reading up on this bug i discovered a slew of people complaining about other serious bugs throughout the game...I'm not even going to bother trying out Homeworld 2 remastered.I'm going to forget i bought this and dig my discs out of the loft, i suggest you do the same...or eBay it, the original Homeworld and Homeworld:Cataclysm are more than worth it (which is not present in this collection) This isn't.If the developers fix the problems i would be more than Happy to recommend it, after all it's one of the most amazing games to have ever been created, at least as far as i can remember..

The Homeworld Remastered Collection features everything included in Homeworld and Homeworld 2, with a modern UI and vastly improved graphics.Pros:Multiplayer thus far is working well.AI is FAR more sophisticated and difficult than in the older games.Campaign cinematics have been updated.Sound design is greatly improved, with many of the old familiar effects redone.Game setup options are greatly increased over the original.Classic Homeworld complexity and gameplay.Cons:Menu lag persists, but developers seem to be patching often.Multiplayer is still in beta, and can still crash.Some minor graphical glitches at release.Overal: Definitely reccomend.

												I was a big fan of the original, so i'm wondering wtf have Gearbox done? It's the fact that it's shipped in massively buggy state for a start. The tutorial asks you to click the ok button when it isn't there, the fact I replayed mission 2 (!) some four times before it would complete which doesn't bode well for the rest of the game although I did manage to struggle up to mission 5.I was stuffed at that point as part way in, the game crashed to desktop losing all my progress. So I fired up the DLC original, which crashed after 30 seconds of play.Unnacceptable. The QA on this was non-existant and frankly needs a major patch and another three months of effort on this. In it's current state (as of 1st March 2015), I would recommend you avoid.			"

												I love homeworld, and nothing has ever been close to the beauty and enjoyment of this game.  I always want to slow down fighting and watch in a thousand different angles of the fighters weaving in and out while capital ships turn broadside to unload their deadly payloads. No space game has ever been remotely close to being like homeworld. Even sins was vastly different.  Something about homeworld is simply original and stunning.  The remastered version brings the UI of Homeworld 2 to Homeworld 1 which works. My only complaint is build and research menus can consume what feels like a third of the screen.  Beyond that the game runs so very fluid, like a interstellar ballet.The combat chatter is excelent, though build reminders can become repetative if you are building fast constructing ships that cause the voice to repeatedly remind you that an interceptor is completed.

												One of the best games from the late 90's has been overhauled and finally been given the look that the game deserves. Not only has this game sent me back to my own youth but its also rekindled an unhealthy relationship with the game series that I spent most of my teens playing, mainly when I should have been doing my homework! Homeworld Remastered beings homeworld 1 and homeworld 2 into today with vastly improved graphics and a remastered audio track. The look and feel of the game is very similar to homeworld 2 as both the remastered games use an upgraded version of the HW2 game engine but with upgrades to improve the look.Neither game however have lost anything but only gained. Infact homeworld 1 now plays with the options you had in homeworld 2. Homeworld 1 remastered even let you build in single units rather than small groups of fighters as you do in 2.The campaigns are better than ever with the storyline not changed, the increasingly difficult missions of HW1 gets transfered over in homeworld remastered nicely. The player vs CPU, or skirmish mode has a stange feel to it, but has been upgraded to feature some new modes including tasks such as harvest x resources for a bonus; and crates. However the best feature allows you to pit HW1 factions against HW2. Although in BETA at the time of writing this review, the multiplayer mode shows some promise.I do feel that the pitting of sides from HW1 and HW2 against eachother is a nice feature, it does need some ironing out. So far the HW2 sides seem to have the edge on the HW1 sides. It would be nice to see some new features other than game modes. Maybe some more maps, special units for skirmish, maybe even a turanic raiders or kadeshi faction to play in skirmish/multiplayer.Not only do you get the remastered games, the classic versions are also here too for that ultimate look back.I do have to admit though, it was nice to play the entire game in a few days and it took me back a fair few years. I can highly recommend. If you loved the classic games back in the day, then remastered is for you.			"

												The remastering of the original Homeworld is at heart a modification of Homeworld 2. The places where the second's engines places limitations on the translation of the original are seemingly minor, but have a considerable effect on the gameplay. One example is the way HW1 smallcraft performance is affected. Some of you might recall that scouts and fighters in HW1 behaved in a semi-newtonian fashion, being able to change their orientation without affecting their current direction of travel. This meant that HW1 fighter formations could radically change direction very quickly; for instance fighters attacking a target in X formation would make their pass and then do the ""Starfury Flip"" a bit of a distance away from the target. This is no longer reflected in the Remaster. The result is that fighter formations are more or less useless in Homeworld Remastered. Unlike larger ships, unmodded HW2 fighters generally have to bank and turn as if in atmosphere unlike their predecessors. This means that the entire formation must wheel around to affect a change in direction, which has the affect you might expect on their ability to fight effectively. Small niggles such as these will affect your experience if you look for them. Thankfully you can compare the differences for yourself by trying out the original once again, as it is bundled with the altogether very affordable package. So long as you keep this in mind you really will not be affected, particularly due to Homeworld's gorgeous visuals. "

												One of my all-time favorite games; played both the originals when they came out.  The persistence from level to level is novel and really ties the single player campaign together: build early, build often, move it all cautiously, and zoom in after you issue orders to take in the massive battles.Word of warning, though: you can't capture Vagyr capitals in HW2.  Doing so just disables them.  Still useful, but won't net you +1 capital ship.			"

												I love homeworld, and nothing has ever been close to the beauty and enjoyment of this game.  I always want to slow down fighting and watch in a thousand different angles of the fighters weaving in and out while capital ships turn broadside to unload their deadly payloads. No space game has ever been remotely close to being like homeworld. Even sins was vastly different.  Something about homeworld is simply original and stunning.  The remastered version brings the UI of Homeworld 2 to Homeworld 1 which works. My only complaint is build and research menus can consume what feels like a third of the screen.  Beyond that the game runs so very fluid, like a interstellar ballet.The combat chatter is excelent, though build reminders can become repetative if you are building fast constructing ships that cause the voice to repeatedly remind you that an interceptor is completed. I love this game, I loved it then and I still love it now.10/10			"

												If you have never played any of the other Home World games you are in for a treat, jaw dropping graphics, beautiful visuals, astonishing audio. If you have, leave your memories at the door, they will be shattered. This is definitely not a remastered collection. This is little more than a re-imaging of HW2 with HW1 ships added in. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer lobby experience, don't come here expecting to make new ones, that key feature is totally absent and no plans are in the works currently to add one. This is definitely NOT a remastering of the originals.If you can live with those differences more power to you, me, I give it the following scores:Visuals: 5 out of 5Audio: 4.5 out of 5Controls: 2.5 out of 5Game play Single play: 3.5 out of 5Game play Multiplay: 2 out of 5**IMHO lack of a lobby seriously drops the score for multiplay, game play can be really fun, but no chance to talk with your team mates after a game or to discuss games in a lobby while waiting for games to start, really drops the longevity of the title.UPDATE:Since this original review was posted the developers surprized the community with a functioning lobby. It isn't the lobby system we had in either of the originals but it does raise the fun factor and multi-playability a tremendous amount. Now you can talk with anyone  in the main lobby or in the game lobby while waiting to get enough people to join. That alone is enough to raise the score I put for multiplay to 4 out of 5.The developers also released a major patch that fixed a lot of issues but there is still a load of work needing completion. The game is better now than it was at release and hopefully we will see the final polish put on the game in 2017.			"

												This collection is amazing. First about the collection itself, the collection has a whole bunch of content that at the time of writing I haven't even got to yet. Not only do they have the original homeworld 1 and 2, but also the re-mastered version which clearly had a lot of love put into them.Now, I know some people will call this blasphemous, but I haven't played the original versions, and I'll give a review for each game in the collection. There may be changes in the originals and remasters like the UI and apparently some unit balancing issues? Again, the changes seem small and don't seem to impact the gameplay for the casual or moderate homeworld fan.Anyway, onto the review, I'll go in order of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 had to be cut short due to me running out of characters. [grumble grumble]Homeworld was an amazing experience to go through, and gave me a feeling a game hasn't given me in awhile. This is a sense of mystery and the feeling of being a small speck in the midst of outer space. An insignificant spec, just managing to survive. But as you go along, the largest foe opposing you who seem like an unstoppable force that will wipe you out in the blink of an eye. But you just bite at the small, weak appendages of this large creature until you (hopefully) become large enough to stand a chance.But as the game goes along, and you realise you're hatred of this foe is not alone, you end up becoming stronger, as you gain more and more victories, and you become something greater than what you started, you don't feel weak against your foe, you end up feeling like you can just make it.Now, for the gameplay of the game, the gameplay is very strategic, much more strategic than what I was expecting. You can't just throw your mighty battleships at the enemy and expect to win, because since you may of destroyed their first offensive, you're heavily crippled, and it just so happens that there are, admittedly smaller, but far scarier foes awaiting just outside the range of your sensors, and they are hungry. I find myself later in the game attempting to break off their fleet in chasing something small, but leading them where my ships lay, and I have the advantage by planning the whole thing in advance. Your experience might be different but I had a blast.Now for some memorable moments from my playthrough of the game, some spoilers.The first moment I can think of is the first attack on the foe (completely forgot their name, some federation). When we warp in, my battle relay guy(?) notifies me that the hostile fleet is right ahead. Here, I'm a bit scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I saw what they can do, and even though its weakened, they still have a substantial fleet. He gave the order to exterminate the fleet. At this moment of time, I still see that fleat as an unstoppable force, and they had battlecruisers and I didn't. Did I mention I was scared? Anyway, I mass produced these vehicle extraction units (forgot the name) which basically steals ships in hopes of capturing one of the ships. However, it turned out that I overestimated the foe (which is what I always do, it's better to overestimate and crush your foe with overwhelming force them to not be prepared for a superior force) and I ended up destroying most of their ships, except for one. I then got this evil grin on my face as this carrier was trying to escape from me, I ordered my ships to shoot out the engines, and I sent in the extractors. I ended up stealing their carrier as a trophy, a claim of ""I annihilated your force and now I'm using your ship against you"" sort of fashion. That ship eventually became invaluable to the fleet, acting as a medical station for the smaller ships and as a transport bay for them as well. Protection from attack.The second moment I'll share is this moment when you enter a nebula and there is deadly radiation flooding the area. You had to plan your moves carefully to not have your ship's be dissolved in the radiation (a bit unrealistic but it's a videogame so I'll let it slide) I'm moving through this cloud and I spot a minelayer. This is the first one I encountered one, I quickly destroy it and think to myself, ""Job well done, no mines! Onwards to glory!"" but a little bit later, I found the mine field it set up, it crippled some of my most powerful ships, and when I'm getting my repair frigates ready, I spot 2 destroyers peek out from the nebula. At this point in time, I had about 3 destroyers, the carrier (the one I stole earlier) and a fleet of frigates. ""Piece of cake"" I thought to myself. Bad mistake, because with them, they had missile frigates that were staying JUST out of sight, but firing on my ships nonetheless. And whatever the hell that destroyer was made from, my whole fleet of 25 ish ships was completely and utterly obliterated by 5 ships and a few mines. Then I started planning out my path for the target, and I had an escort, and everything, finding small bands of these ships and crushing them under suprise.The third, and final moment I can share is the junkyard. During this level, you enter a creepy junkyard, with a bunch of gun platforms dotting the place, protecting...something...still don't know what it was. No biggy I thought, but something didn't feel right, so I sent my capital ships in with caution, and to obliterate the gun platform obviously. But after I sent them out, I started doing some micromanaging at base, when I heard ""one of your ships have gone missing"". ""What do you mean, 'one of your ships have gone missing'? How the hell can you lose a capital ship?"" I'm thinking to myself. then I look over, and I see the missing ship warp back into view, but it was hostile. I had no idea what was going on until I saw this one small-ish ship coming in, only known as the Junkyard Dog, and it was barreling straight for one of the capital ships. The it just snatches it and warped out at a becon. I was stunned, but also very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I restarted the level. After about 3 ish restarts, I got very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this dog and after my attempts of sending small ships through the junkyard failed miserably, I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and made ships that could freeze it. I had like 5 of them, so the dog couldn't escape. I had my whole fleet waiting nervously for any signs of the dog. And when my guard was low, it came within 1 km from one of my ships! I know, 1 kilometer seems far, but remember, these ships are several kilometers in length so that was WAY too close for comfort. I froze it and with all the might of my fleet, and about 10 minutes of continuous fire from all ships, I finally killed the dog. I was never so happy to kill a dog until now.After all the praise I gave for homeworld, you would think I would give homeworld 2 as much praise, but to be honest, it was a bit disappointing. I feel the collection is worth it for homeworld alone. So just buy it, and if you want to play homeworld 2, just do it. It's still enjoyable in a morbid way. Sadly, steam won't let me finish the review, because I have a lot of worlds for homeworld 2 that's not exactly flattering. But again, just buy it and see it for yourself. You have nothing to lose (Except for possibly your time) so just do whatever you feel is best.			"

SummaryI love this game, but it has some serious growing up to do in the genre of Sci-Fi.One thing about this game that I love is the wide variety of ships we can choose from and also the ability to customize our ships to our liking. Now the one thing that saddens me the most is the fact the Frontier Developments basically stated that they player will never be able to pilot ships as big as Farragut which puts a dampers. One the greatest feelings in space theme games is piloting a capital class ship, commanding squadrons of fighters while laying massive firepower that turns the tide of a battle or defending the ship against ambush of fighters. Eve Online brought a never ending hunger for player driven wars between two player ran corporations or alliances over vast expansions of space in attempt to control the non-settled frontiers of space. There is also player built stations, player build fortifications, player held planets, player owned solar systems, and player owned shipyards that make it feels like the galaxy is alive. For such a vast open end game, it feels like there is very little purpose for the player except for tagging along for the ride, we barely shape the galaxy.Why Capital Ships Are Unobtainable?By limiting players ability to interact with your galaxy, you are faced with the outcome that players will not be able to do much in a vast open end world that you have created. The only thing that us players do have forward to look too is playing the vast variety of ships available in the game. When you deny two ships to the players who play, Frontier Developments are hurting their ability to be flexible in their approach. Basically you are putting a artificial block on the growth of ship variety by doing this, you can never build bigger than that single capital ship. Once players hit Corvette and Cutter, they can’t advance any further while NPC have Farragut and Majestic class ships that dwarf player owned ships. It isn’t because these ships are rare and limited in numbers, in-fact they are very common because you find them throughout all conflict zones regardless of where you are in the galaxy. We should be asking why capital ships are unobtainable when they are not unique or rare?Why Can’t Players Have Groups?Groups are so important in massive multiplayer online games, it connects players together and helps them do things that they can’t normally do alone. Look at Eve Online that is built around players working together, they achieve amazing and epic accomplishments that are a envy of thousands of players while being big enough to be featured in national news articles. This advertises the game in a way that no other game has achieved because players want to be a part of this and willing to dedicate years to achieving something. By offering the ability to own solar systems, stations, shipyards, and factions; they are not only giving room for this game to grow, they are creating a environment that will advertise itself and help the game community to grow. By letting players be able to shape and expand the galaxy, Frontier Development are basically making it easier to establish the world around the players as things evolve and grow. Why must you limit the expansion of the bubble to your time schedule?The Point?So basically what I am saying is, stop trying to force the galaxy to grow, let it grow on its own by giving the tools to the players. You can shape the basic story-line which players will follow without much of a issue, but once you are trying to micro-manage a galaxy of players, you will be limited severely to the point you will practically lose steam quicker. Players love the ability to shape, choose, and control their galaxy more than  tagging along for the ride with limited options to experience it. So do yourself a favor, be more flexible.Rating: 8/10 "

Some fantastic ones (Mainly Complex 10 and Battlestar Galactica).Only slight issue is random crashes on Multiplayer for being 'Out Of Sync'. Can't work out why, is always the Player not hosting.But buy it. Buy it now.			"

												Preamble:I played HW1 a long time ago when I was too young to really appreciate it. I only had vague memories of it coming in.Homeworld 1:A simple game that still manages to make a great impact thanks to it's beautiful presentation. You really do feel like you're leading a group of nomadic exiles in search of their new home, and all the bizarre scenarios they find them selves in. I love the idea of being able to take everything with you to the next mission, although it did create some really nasty situations, especially during the Nebula missions, and the last few missions feel like a cakewalk if you over-prepared (Not that it makes the last mission any more beautifully done).Homeworld 2:Will play soon.

However, I am so glad it has been remastered, and am already enjoying reliving each story mission, every careful plan with where to put resources, the combat and even looking at the mods available as well. I've certainly missed capturing enemy frigates and destroyers with salvagers haha.Definitely a game I would recommend: A great sci-fi RTS that challenges the player and brings an awesome level of space conflict and resource acquirement.

But we also got renewed HW2, which wasnt changed in terms of gameplay as I know (didnt played R version much yet). Think they deserve likes, not hateful comments, the frunchise is alive, finally! We just get 1 great remake with stunning graphic instead of two (and a good reason to complete the second part of the game for the ones who was disappointed in it after glorius original). Ah, and no Cataclysm because of technical issues, still I wanted them to include classic version of it :/			"

												I never playd the original Homeworld as I was to small then, and when I saw Homeworld in some video game store when I was older I thought it was just another mediocre space rts game. I was really, really wrong.Has to be the most epic RTS game I've ever playd , the story is fantastic, the music is f*cking awesome , crapton of explosions and projectiles , loads of different ship types you get to play around with to feel like a fleet commander.After you are done playing both of the campaigns you can mess around in team battles VS the AI ( Which shows no dam mercy), or head straight into PvP.To anyone who is thinking about buying this, I say do it. It is worth every single euro/dollar you spend on it.			"

												I think my sentiment for this version of Homeworld echoes every single one who played the original: this game is a huge disappointment.I played the orginal Homeworld, Homeworld Cataclysm Homeworld 2 and countless mods of HW2. By far, Homeworld orginal is my favourite. The atmosphere, the feeling of panic when overwhelmed by enemies, the awe of the Graveyard... Homeworld itself was astounding. Even the music keeps you wrapped up in the HW universe; you really feel as though you are safeguarding the last of your kind with every little ship you capture or build.What has been done here is the story and script of Homeworld has been plopped into the Homeworld 2 engine, which is a completely different game. Different UI, different mapped controls, different AI.  HW2 is designed as a massive Space Battle RTS. Original Homeworld is a strategy game, but the emphasis is not always on battle; you are encouraged to use whatever strategy you need to get the better of the Taidan.The result? A very busy UI, many interfering visual elements and a flow of information completely unsuitable to the original Homworld story.What's worse is that the AI and control mechanics are awful. For example, any original HW player will tell you that the most fun strategy is capturing ships. In HW Remastered, this is completely broken. You can't just take a group of salvage corvettes with the correct number to capture, say, the Assault Frigates in Mission 3, Return to Kharak, and tell them to go capture. No, you have to pause, count the number of frigates, make a bunch of groups of 2 and tell each group to go capture ONE frigate. Totally ridiculous.All of this could be forgiven, it would be. And on top of this, the visuals aren't that fantastic. The textures and modelling are pretty bad by today's standard. The mod community had already done a fantastic job with several whole-game conversions for HW2... Now THESE are amazing, the attention to detail is crazy! Seems sad to think so little attention was paid to this.I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't get into it.			"

												HW2 Remastered's graphics are pretty and the performance/speed is indeed much better that the original. They did a decent job recreating the classic without destroying it.I am more interested in squirmish battles than the storyline so I wont review that part.  I played the original quite often with the Homeworld Complex mod by Beghins. The non modded experience is a little too simple and easy for my taste. Hardcore RTS fans might want to stick to the HW2 Classic + Complex 9.1 until the Complex mod is released for the Remastered Edition.  "

												Homeworld is one of those exceedingly rare gems in gaming that seem to get everything just right. The story is set in a rich universe with interesting races and characters. The gameplay is fun and complex without being complicated.The sound design is captivatingly immersive. The visuals are absolutely stellar. Its rare enough these days to find a game that looks, sounds and plays great all at once, but Homeworld's genius is in how well all those apects are so masterfully integrated... What does that mean? Well, without spoiling the game for you, imagine loading into a new stage:...Your fleet just emerged from hyperspace. Judging from the earlier cutscene, you are heading to the outskirts of the system, a fact now illustrated by how distant the sun has become in the 3D space. You start to feel isolated, a feeling not eased by how haunting the in game music has become. Fleet command just issued an objective: Send a ship to investigate an anomaly. In response you open up your sensors manager to get your bearings. You find some resource asteroids and send your collectors to harvest them. The collectors reply with acknowledgments, you zoom in closer to marvel at how well detailed and utilitarian the design of the resource collector is. You hear fleet command reporting that they can research a new ship model. You glance at your resource unit indicator and calculate that you can do the research and build one new ship or forgo the research and build five more weaker but more manuverable ships. You decide to go for quality than quantity. You decide to split your fleet into two groups, one to go forth and investigate the anomaly and another to stand guard and protect the Mothership. As you monitor your fleets you notice that the music is changing, something bad is going to happen! you feel your palms getting sweaty as you issue commands to your ships, strikecraft to aggressive stance, set claw formation. You open your sensors manager, you see two large groups of red pings heading towards your fleets. Your uneasiness changes into fear as you realise how outnumbered you are and wonder if your fleet will make it... Homeworld is filled with amazing moments like that, moments where you will be immersed in the game; its tension, its conflict and  in how real the stakes feel. As one tactical mistake can end in strategic failure and your losses will carry over as resources are finite and your fleet is persistent. If you lose a ship, its gone forever. This makes all the defeats all the more painful and all the victories you will achieve all the more cathartic and meaningful.To sum up; get this game! you will not regret it!  "

												Homeworld is one of those exceedingly rare gems in gaming that seem to get everything just right. The story is set in a rich universe with interesting races and characters. The gameplay is fun and complex without being complicated.The sound design is captivatingly immersive. The visuals are absolutely stellar. Its rare enough these days to find a game that looks, sounds and plays great all at once, but Homeworld's genius is in how well all those apects are so masterfully integrated... What does that mean? Well, without spoiling the game for you, imagine loading into a new stage:...Your fleet just emerged from hyperspace. Judging from the earlier cutscene, you are heading to the outskirts of the system, a fact now illustrated by how distant the sun has become in the 3D space. You start to feel isolated, a feeling not eased by how haunting the in game music has become. Fleet command just issued an objective: Send a ship to investigate an anomaly. In response you open up your sensors manager to get your bearings. You find some resource asteroids and send your collectors to harvest them. The collectors reply with acknowledgments, you zoom in closer to marvel at how well detailed and utilitarian the design of the resource collector is. You hear fleet command reporting that they can research a new ship model. You glance at your resource unit indicator and calculate that you can do the research and build one new ship or forgo the research and build five more weaker but more manuverable ships. You decide to go for quality than quantity. You decide to split your fleet into two groups, one to go forth and investigate the anomaly and another to stand guard and protect the Mothership. As you monitor your fleets you notice that the music is changing, something bad is going to happen! you feel your palms getting sweaty as you issue commands to your ships, strikecraft to aggressive stance, set claw formation. You open your sensors manager, you see two large groups of red pings heading towards your fleets. Your uneasiness changes into fear as you realise how outnumbered you are and wonder if your fleet will make it... Homeworld is filled with amazing moments like that, moments where you will be immersed in the game; its tension, its conflict and  in how real the stakes feel. As one tactical mistake can end in strategic failure and your losses will carry over as resources are finite and your fleet is persistent. If you lose a ship, its gone forever. This makes all the defeats all the more painful and all the victories you will achieve all the more cathartic and meaningful.To sum up; get this game! you will not regret it!  "

												Of all the remaster's I have encountered this is the best one by far. Gearbox didn't want to reimagine the game or reinvent it, they got the old developers back together and remade the game in all its glory. Hell if you don't want to play the remastered versions you even get the old classic versions  that have been updated to work on modern OS's.The new interface is a huge improvement and the game itself has been refined to work smoothly and painlessly. The multiplayer is still in beta but to be honest, if you buy this for the multiplayer you are going to be dissapointed, the core feature of the Homeworld series has always been about the story, the story of the Hiigarans.This game isn't just a remaster, this is the revival of a series, and it is very clear the developers didn't just want to create something the fans would love, but something they would also love, this game is a love letter to the fans to say thanks for the support.Also the mods are pretty great.

												I nominated this for Best Singleplayer Story Narrative in the make your own category. For me, at the time this came out almost twenty years ago originally around the same time frame as the first Half Life game it had a story and background elements that unfolded and left a mark in your mind as you progressed through it.I still have the retail box cd version of this tucked away in a box in the closet with a bunch of other games. The thing about this one to me was because it was a Real Time Strategy game and not a First Person Shooter that took storytelling in an original idea at the time and framed it beautifully for the kind of game it is.The introduction sequences along with the first few levels is some of the best opening gameplay of any game I have ever played. It's why I nominated this because I still remember it to this day without having played it in so long until this remastered version came out.The writing is top notch, what I liked best about it was playing and hearing all the little combat chatter from units the choices of words that were used. Similar to how I love the combat chatter from the units in the StarCraft games.Can't say the same about a lot of games I have played. It also really helps if you are a big fan of the genre in both science fiction and real time strategy games. That old classic resource gathering base building model from the command and conquer games is used to a great effect in this game. At the time this game took that formula and put into 3D space, you no longer were scrolling across a 2D map. You played this game and had 360 degree awareness all around your mothership.The guys at Relic Entertainment came up with what's called the Sensors Manager for the game to handle that extra dimension and it was mind blowing when you saw it for the first time way back then. Because it was in real-time, you didn't wait for it to load up. You tapped the space bar and toggled it on and off at will, it's a common feature now but back in the early 2000's when you first used that it was fantastic. "

												It's mixed. I loved HW1 when it was new, and I still love it, but it's mixed. This is Homeworld 2, with the HW1 levels and units imported. It works like 2, it runs like 2, it has the mechanics of 2. Anything unique to the first game, like fuel for fighters, or a moving mothership, or formations for ships, or some unique ship animations, got abandoned because they are not in the engine for 2. This is a shame, because the first game was the better game in most respects.You can still enjoy the original story and ambiance, and it's very very pretty now. But... there's something lacking. This is still a positive review overall and you might not miss what's not there if you never played the original, but I'm still saddened that I can't unequivocally favor this new version.			"

												HOLY SHEEIT they messed up the HW1 campaign, simply by making resources WAY WAY WAY TOO ABUNDANT. At one point I had nearly 70,000! In the original HW1 you really had to scavenge resources and salvage enemies whenever possible just to beat the game. Now resources are so abundant that later levels can be beat just by kamikazing your strike craft into enemies and building more (lol).Also, the ship AI often acts kind of autastic, and they never stay in formation.Still recommend though, 2 really good games (and multiplayer which people are actually playing) in one.

												So, this is my review of the Homeworld1 remastered. I have no interest in playing or trying homeworld 2 remastered because it wass pretty dull back in the day when it was launched and it propably haven`t gone any better in the last decade storywise unless some radical changes in script what i will highly doubt what is saw from the ""effort"" they put in HW1R.I`m going to list some bugs and issues from my playthrough of HW1R. (PRIOR UPDATE 1)Let`s begin.-Strikecraft fuel (so that is one gameplay mechanic removed)-Support frigates tend to bug out in groups(start spinning around in circles) and guard command does not seem to work with them(?)((only repair order)) -Military parade formation dont work (is in the game?)-Resource collector can`t seem to find resources sometimes and you have to issue scout parties to find nearby resource field + salvaging scrap metal won`t work as intented(?) all resourcers try to get the one only hunk of metal and follow single resourcer so...(i think this was issue too in the original but thought remastered would fix that??)-Once saw a invisible Heavy corvette(wow)-VOICEBUG FIX IT FIX IT(some ships leave engine sound even thought they are gone and the sound goes on)-detachment of formations while in combat(annoying to use attack bombers for example)-garden of kadeshi capital ships got stuck while retreating to kar`toba and were invicible that happened few times on level 08.-Captured carriers cannot build, only launch? (????)-Captured ships change or dont change colour(??)and it seems some change stats too. for example black ion cannon frigates after hyperspacing they change colour and stats.(woo)-Some captured ships (or most) cannot be retired before hyperspacing to next level.(so you have to scuttle them if you dont want horde of crap thrown at you on the next level)-some scripted scenes decided not to show up(???)-after cancelling hyperspace jump you cannot access sensors manager.-junkyard dog is bugged out totally(for example destroy the hyperspace gate where it is going to jump it will roll around aimlessly around non-existing gate)+ you cannot attack it when it has captured any of your capital ships except with fighters and corvettes.-invisible harvestable metal scrap-Autolaunch during beginning of every level(?)- research ship sometimes gets weird and goes to pieces in the middle of the level (like half of it docks with mothership and other half dont)-Docking issues with strikecraft during movement with carriers for example-NO TAIDAAN CAMPAIGN why?I really feel like devs could had done much better work with this franchise improving gameplay mechanics and overall enjoyment/replayability level of the game.To me this feels like they just tried to port hw1 to hw2 engine slap new UI over it and voila + the visuals ofc, but i gotta say game looks beautiful and sounds too but i feel i have much less now than with the original.No taidaan campaign was a big blow to me because i enjoyed the idea of playing both races and still no timewarp, even cataclysm had it. this is not a difficult game thanks to the HW2 style fleetsize based enemy force size manager.gameplay wise i dont think devs did anything to improve or add to the game, i wish i could`ve capture raider carrier but no or to find easter eggs i havent found before or to have something expanded to me what was not propably in the original game.this should have been called homeworld 2 remastered + homeworld 1 mod.remastered should be superior compared against original, this is not the deal here.Devs propably are not going to fix these issues.note to devs:do not try to do a remaster if you cant do it correctly.

												I write this review from the perspective of someone who did not play the original HW, or its sequel HW2. Negative reviews by old-timers seem to focus on gameplay changes from HW1 due to that Gearbox based both HW1 and HW2 in their remastered versions largely on HW2...but the lack of 'tactics' and such didn't faze me much. I also didn't rate it negatively because of it being released (I had pre-ordered) with some nagging bugs which, among others, meant that I couldn't even get in for a week after a mis-guided patch. My 'thumbs down' is because I much disliked two core game mechanics which go back to HW1, into which I get after one paragraph on what I liked.The game has a lot going for it - it's pretty, the music is nice, and the setting and writing is suitably dark scifi. I enjoyed simply watching resource harvesting; little details like the related animations show that the developers cared about making this look good. When I got to battle, I found the battles engaging and fun as well...but here's:PROBLEM 1:You don't really get to battle. In the game, you receive a spacecraft that can capture opposing spacecraft. And it's very good at it. If you're the optimizing, obsessive type (I am), this means that you build this craft and essentially nothing but this craft (to its limit of 14, but that's plenty), then go capture (almost) the entire opposing fleet. My battles looked as follows: (a) I park spacecraft I already own far away so they don't accidentally as much as shoot at the enemy, and then (b) I go hunting for the incoming ships, which, once captured, I (c) park with the rest of my fleet. That's not very epic...but the following I liked even less -PROBLEM 2:Scaling of the strength of your enemy to your own strength. You carry over your fleet from prior missions. In an early mission (MINOR SPOILER), you enter the mission seeing the enemy attack six giant habitats which hold the rest of your race. I first entered this mission facing, I believe, 4-5 enemy ships, all larger than those you can have at that time. From a roleplaying perspective, it made me sad that I could only save about 2/3 of my remaining race...so I went back, this time diligently using what I describe under Problem 1 to amass a rather large fleet before this mission. I enter feeling good about myself...then see TEN or so big ships hammer away at my habitats, far enough away that, this time, they killed 2/3 of them before I even reached them. In fact, I think I saved 1/6, even though I abandoned the 'capture only' strategy I mention above and both hammered them and captured what I could.That's just stupid. I read in forum posts regarding the original, that the cool winning strategy in the olden days was to completely dismantle your fleet at the end of a mission (you get almost all the money back; and if you captured the ships for free, it's even better), then, as soon as the next mission starts, re-build your fleet.  As the game scales to your strength, you then face puny enemies in each mission - easily captured all, added to your fleet, dismantled with it at the end of the mission, and rebuilt at the start of the next...This completely destroys any kind of immersion. I'm not a fan of scaling-to-your-strength games anyway as that lack of immersion is almost inevitable.A shame.			"

												I myself have never played the original Homeworld games till this remaster and I must say that I wish that I could rewind the time and go play them just for trash talking rights. But, this remaster is GREAT on every level. At first when I installed the game it wouldnt work on my laptop. I could hear the music playing but had a blank screen so i had to update my video drivers and that fixed the issue. Since then i've had one forced shut down of the game. But other than that it's been smooth sailing from there on out. Now, back to the game. It is a very and I mean VERY detailed game and requires LOTS of thinking. But, the graphics are GREAT and the musical score is by far the BEST i've heard in a RTS.  I give this game a 9.5/10			"

												""RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR MULTIPLAYER BETA AT THIS TIME""When this game first came out I did not have the up to date beast i have today. So I got into Red Alert 2 for my RTS fix back them. SO I was eagerly waiting for a chance to play it on a more top of the line machine(for 2015). Overall im not as pleased about the game as I was led to belive by a friend who played it 15 years ago. But i would still reccomend HW remastered becuse the game breaking bugs it does have can be fixed and likely will, after all it's only been two days.The Bad part(if actually want to play the storyline)While the game is a highly polished work of art there are game breaking crashes and bugs during the single player game that will have you redo more missions than you can count. Sometimes objectives vanish, this led to me restarting a mission a few times. 10 hours of singleplayer gave me 5 crashes to windows in single player(4 of those times redoing the same mission over again) the the 5th time I had to redo two missions.The multiplayer BETA works way better than the single player part. In fact ran so well I wondered why they even called it BETA. Hopefully the singleplayer gets fixed soon becuse the storyline is something the game is known for.			"

												Homeworld 1 was the first RTS I ever picked up seriously,  I fell in love with it finding it at a bargain bin at a Fry's Electronics.  The remastered graphics are quite stunning, and very pleasant to look at.  It brings me joy to see this game remade, the modding community of homeworld 2 was active for over a decade after it came out, not many games have that.  Currently playing through homeworld 1 remastered and it feels just at home, alebit a bit faster... Perhaps that was an old computer back in the day ya?   Other than a few bugs here and there and discrepancies from the homeworld 1 engine this is a solid remake.  10/10 can't wait for Homeworld Complex 11 to be released.			"

												Homeworld Remastered Collection is a modern HD remake of two classic sci-fi real-time strategy games, Homeworld 1 and 2. Homeworld played like many other RTS games at the time: you'll command your star fleet, harvest resources, research technologies to build more ships, and attack other enemy fleets. However, in Homeworld, the game took place entirely in three-dimensional space, resulting in units not just moving horizontally, but also vertically, adding an extra tactical layer to the combat. Watching the combat between large groups of spaceships flying around each other was a sight to behold back then and now it looks even more amazing in the Remastered Collection. Gearbox has updated the visuals to modern standards and ships now have an incredible amount of detail. Even with the enhanced graphics, the game still manages to not be too demanding on hardware and it runs smoothly without any major stability issues. The user interface has also been updated for both games and it feels cleaner and more usable now. They even remastered the audio and the cutscenes with voice overs and music sounding much clearer and the animations looking more high-definition. The entire package isn't without its faults, however.The remastered version of Homeworld 1 feels like it was ported over to the enhanced Homeworld 2 engine without properly adjusting and balancing the campaign for it. Ships won't stay in formation when attacking (might be just a bug for now), researching technologies costs resource units now, some prices for constructing ships have changed,  ship AI behavior seems to glitch out at times, and other minor differences. Worst of all, the remastered campaign seems to have borrowed the auto-balancing difficulty from the Homeworld 2 campaign. This might result in frustratingly difficult situations in some missions if you did too well in the last mission. Still, none of this is game-breaking and some might still enjoy the game and only have a few problems with it (especially those who have never played the game in the first place). All of this is sure to annoy veteran Homeworld players and hopefully Gearbox can fix some of it soon. At least the package inculdes the original ""Classic"" version of Homeworld 1 which is still very playable and fun by today's standards, even with the dated visuals.Homeworld 2 Remastered seems to be pretty well intact, but that's not really a surprise given the fact that it's running on an enhanced version of the same engine. You can play the ""classic"" version of Homeworld 2 if you want, but considering the remastered version is the exact same game with better graphics and presentation, there's not much of a reason to go back now (except for some Skirmish mode differences).  It's pretty much there for preservation and it's still a nice thing to have in the package.Which Brings me to the multiplayer mode. It's a good thing the multiplayer still has a ""BETA"" label attached to it because it does feel a bit unfinished. The multiplayer suite for the Remastered Collection is a mixture of the multiplayer modes from Homeworld 1 and 2. You can pit the two Homeworld 1 factions against the two Homeworld 2 factions now, but this results in some balance issues. The HW1 factions are underpowered compared to the HW2 factions right now and the game feels more like HW2 multiplayer with HW1 factions patched in rather than a true mix of the two games. For right now, just use HW2 factions until Gearbox decides to fix the balance issues.Despite some blemishes in the Homeworld 1 Remastered campaign and the multiplayer mode, I'd still recommend the Remastered Collection simply because there's nothing quite like Homeworld on the market right now and it's the first time the series has been on a digital platform. The gameplay still holds up very well to this day and the storylines for both games are still just as good as they once were. I'd even say this package is worth it just for Homeworld 1 Classic and Homeworld 2 Remastered alone. If you've never experienced either game and you have an interest in story-driven RTS games or massive space battles in general, you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld.			"

												After playing this game to death and Homeworld 2 I remember how this game used to look, now that Gearbox has updated it and cleaned it up it feels like a new game, even some parts are surprisingly different in terms of damage output and the way some of the ships fire their weapons like the Ion Cannon Frigate, you actually see a ion charge build up before it fires which is amazing. 10/10 for this game, haven't finished the whole campagin of Homeworld 1 and haven't even started Homeworld 2 but if the first few missions are anything to go by this is going to be a ride filled with nostalgia and wonder at all the new things in this game.

												I never played Homeworld back when it came out, I was playing Starcraft and Warcraft.  Now I'm wishing I had.  Being that I never played the original, I don't have some of the complaints that the veterans do with the changes made due to importing HW1 into the HW2 engine.  I understand why they did it and it doesn't bother me.  It shouldn't bother you either.  The game is a blast to play, the storytelling is amazing and it really looks and sounds beautiful.  Yes, there are bugs at the moment (release week) but Gearbox has said on their forums they are collecting feedback for future patches to address many of the issues the veterans have (if possible within the constraints of the engine) and should have the first bug patch ready less than a week after launch.  So long as Gearbox lives up to that, everyone should be happy.  Is it worth $35?  If you like space RTS games (of which there are pitiful few available) then yes.  If you liked Sins of a Solar Empire but wanted a campaign for it, then this is what you've always dreamed of.  Get it today.			"

Worst of all, the remastered campaign seems to have borrowed the auto-balancing difficulty from the Homeworld 2 campaign. This might result in frustratingly difficult situations in some missions if you did too well in the last mission. Still, none of this is game-breaking and some might still enjoy the game and only have a few problems with it (especially those who have never played the game in the first place). All of this is sure to annoy veteran Homeworld players and hopefully Gearbox can fix some of it soon. At least the package inculdes the original ""Classic"" version of Homeworld 1 which is still very playable and fun by today's standards, even with the dated visuals.Homeworld 2 Remastered seems to be pretty well intact, but that's not really a surprise given the fact that it's running on an enhanced version of the same engine. You can play the ""classic"" version of Homeworld 2 if you want, but considering the remastered version is the exact same game with better graphics and presentation, there's not much of a reason to go back now (except for some Skirmish mode differences).  It's pretty much there for preservation and it's still a nice thing to have in the package.Which Brings me to the multiplayer mode. It's a good thing the multiplayer still has a ""BETA"" label attached to it because it does feel a bit unfinished. The multiplayer suite for the Remastered Collection is a mixture of the multiplayer modes from Homeworld 1 and 2. You can pit the two Homeworld 1 factions against the two Homeworld 2 factions now, but this results in some balance issues. The HW1 factions are underpowered compared to the HW2 factions right now and the game feels more like HW2 multiplayer with HW1 factions patched in rather than a true mix of the two games. For right now, just use HW2 factions until Gearbox decides to fix the balance issues.Despite some blemishes in the Homeworld 1 Remastered campaign and the multiplayer mode, I'd still recommend the Remastered Collection simply because there's nothing quite like Homeworld on the market right now and it's the first time the series has been on a digital platform. The gameplay still holds up very well to this day and the storylines for both games are still just as good as they once were. I'd even say this package is worth it just for Homeworld 1 Classic and Homeworld 2 Remastered alone. If you've never experienced either game and you have an interest in story-driven RTS games or massive space battles in general, you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld.			"

												Just as I remembered it only way prettier. I don't know what else can usefully be said about Homeworld Remastered. I'm guessing that all of us who spent countless hours with these games a decade ago were on board the instant the remasters were announced and today is the glorious conclusion of our long wait. If you're not already a fan of the series but do like RTS then what are you waiting for? These games are legendary and now that they've gotten a facelift they look the part too.			"

												I really thought I'll love this games when I saw the gameplay videos, the tactical options and the gfx. Sadly, I played about 10 hrs of Homeworld 1 remastered now and I am overly disappointed. The controls are the clumsiest ever, the whole game is buggy as hell (hey, try to reassign movent control keys..), and in the campaign I really did not get any feeling of a tactical gameplay. Since formations are broken, since the movement of squads and their behavior is neither well-controllable nor has any intelligent automatism, the whole tactic decisions come down to ""the-more-the-better"". In a battle you are often required to do sort of micromanagement with your fleet of fast-flying, hardly clickable ships, to tell them one-by one that they have to repair another ship, or have to do a special attack etc. Maybe I missed something, didn't play too long, but support-frigates that don't give any support/repair to the dozens of small crafts flying around them, without clicking each single one in action? Formations, the lowest, most basic tactical setting, simply do not work? And Gearbox talked themselves out of doing anything about that? I doubt I will buy any further Gearbox game next future.. Over 20€ for a game I really  dislike because it offers one frustrating moment after another is ways too much.			"

												I think they did a good job on this re-master. I have all of these games and the missing cataclysm game. I bought this off the shelf originally before it became GOTY in 1999. I played this until the game disk broke in a move 5 years ago. It’s my all-time favorite game.  I have been a fan since the first time I played the single player campaign. What makes this special? Why should I buy this RTS? If you like RTS games, and enjoy a challenge this is the game for you. This stands alone in the RTS world for many reasons. The 3D combat is truly 3D unlike other 3d perspective RTS games.  Persistence of units in the single player campaign is another major change to other RTS games that I have never seen. If you lose a unit in one mission it is gone forever. If you build a new ship of any kind it will follow you to the next mission as long as you can keep it alive. I have never seen this in any other RTS game like this. The economy side is a little simplistic but I personally don’t think it detracts from the game.  This is a 16 year old and 11 year old game, but it’s one of the best games I’ve ever played. Well worth the cost. The atmosphere is second to none in the original. I enjoy the story in both, but the story is a little weak in the second game. The re-master is beautiful. I have not had anything bad to say so far. I wish I could give it two thumbs up.  "

												I have only played for about 48 hours (at the time of this review) and its a short time so I will update this when I have more experience.This game is absolutley wonderful, for fresh people to RTS Games or for a RTS Veteran like myself (AOE, C&C) I found the game as a breath of fresh air as I never the got the chance to play the orginal. The 3D Environment can be difficult to navigate at first but it grows on you, the story is VERY narrative and frankly brilliant, and the mutiplayer (In BETA at time of review) is also incredibly fun and flexible. I would reccomend this game anyone looking to get into the RTS genre or RTS veterans looking for a new take on the RTS genre. A true masterpiece.			"

												This deserves more than I'm going to write for now, so I'm going to add more later. But for now:tl;dr: If you enjoy RTS games, games set in space, or amazing science fiction storylines (especially space operas), buy this. Buy it so hard. You will thank me.Homeworld as a series has always been both thematically and mechanically beautiful-- I remember being in a trance watching the gameplay at a friend's house in 1999. From the agile and sleek scout ship to the mile-high Pride of Hiigara, no detail was spared. Combat was believably realistic and yet maintained a magical feeling of watching a high-tech waltz of destruction. Massive capital ships ran broadsides against each other while strike fighters battled in furballs. Flak exploded, plasma lanced, and ions beams sliced through space leaving a hot afterlight in your vision. It was everything I'd dreamed about for space battles, and Homeworld delivered above and beyond.The story is nothing short of masterful. Narration both actively and passively help to build a universe where you truly feel for the people you are guiding. You feel their motivation, their need to complete their mission, and it is hard to pull yourself away from the game-- an active effort is required.The Remastered collection is superb. Clearly, heart, soul, blood and tears went into the production, and it shows. You know how your mind's eye for the first games that you played always sharpened and enhanced as time went on? The story and graphics that you saw in your thoughts, instead of what was on screen? Remastered takes it from your head and puts it on screen. It looks, feels, and plays that well. This is what ""HD Remakes"" should consider the master model, the bar to reach for. But man, they're going to have a really, REALLY tough time grasping it at the height Gearbox/Blackbird hung it at.There are a few gripes, albeit extremely minor-- the new UI is a bit goofy, and balance in the extremely clearly Beta multiplayer is totally nonexistent. But these are vices that are both fixable and forgivable, especially in the light of what I personally feel is one of the best games to be published, ever. Homeworld is a bona fide classic. Homeworld 2, although slightly weaker in storyline, is a great follow-up. The Remastered pack is without a doubt a top tier, GOTY candidate work. If any of these words even remotely stuck with you, buy the game. Gearbox and Blackbird deserve every cent they get.			"

												Before I start I just want to mention that I’m structuring this review for three key groups: people who are looking at Homeworld for the first time, the Homeworld 1 veterans, and the Homworld 2 veterans. Overall, this Remaster does get my thumbs up BUT in its current state there are still PLENTY of problems that need to be addressed (and therefore mentioned). I would also ask that you ignore my “play time” because sadly on my older laptop I have not been able to get Homeworld working properly, but my brother has (for the entire night in a span of about 10 hours) generously let me play on his account. Now, let’s begin…The Homeworld Experience for the new:     Homeworld is a 3D RTS type game that is done in real time and on xyz grids that allow full 3D gameplay (in comparison to 2D xy grid games such as Starcraft or Command and Conquer). If you are a fan of RTS games, be it the two games I have mentioned or Sins of a Solar Empire, you should definitely try this game. In this game, you start off with your “mother ship” and resource collectors, and your goal is to mine resources and research new ship types, and then build those ships to make fleets and then blow up your opponent. During this process, your enemy(s) will be doing the same thing, and there are even possible side objectives or challenges that can be undertaken to gain more resources to help further your cause. In the original games, there were already hundreds of different strategies utilized in multiplayer, but with these new side objectives and challenges it allows for even further diversity.     Factions are also extremely interesting to note: you have the factions from both original games, Homeworld 1 and 2, merged together in the same multiplayer experience. They are, to my surprise, actually quite balanced in gameplay. The game has really brought out the “rock paper scissors” aspect of what this game was originally about, but now with all 4 of the factions present there is a lot to take in and know what counters what, it can be a bit of a learning curve to memorize it all. This, in turn, adds to the diversity of strategy and player style you will see done by the AI and (especially) other human players.      And let’s not forget the campaigns. Two 16 mission journeys that put you through breath taking scenarios, all about a race of Humanoids that must make the journey back to their ancient home (Homeworld 1) and then defend it (Homeworld 2). Each campaign mission isn’t your standard “here you are, go blow up that person” and offer varieties of gameplay, such as in Homeworld 1 there is a mission where you can only use strike craft to complete your objective, or you have three minutes to destroy a massive ship that will ram right into your mothership if it is not taken out. Homeworld 2 offers the same mission diversity, and even gives you unique ships to fight and use throughout the campaign.  On top of that, the research method through both campaigns makes ships limited to specific types as you unlock more and more by progressing through the campaign, which allows players to get used to every single ship type and see their strengths and weaknesses, making the campaign not only fun and interesting, but all in all can be boiled down to a giant tutorial of how every single thing in Homeworld works.     On a final note, if you ever get bored with the remastered game, I highly recommend playing Homeworld 1 Classic, it features the original UI and game mechanics such as no unit cap in games that can be very fun to experiment with.     Seriously, if you Love RTS or space games and have not picked this title up yet, I seriously recommend you do so. It isn’t perfect, but I assure you that you are not only getting what your money ‘s worth but also are going to really enjoy it!From the eyes of a Homeworld 1 Vet:     This section of the review focuses on the negative aspects and what has “survived” from the homeworld 1 game.     I think the biggest thing that irks me about the remastered Homeworld 1 is that they moved it to the Homeworld 2 user interface and model. In doing so they had to can a lot of Homeworld 1’s key features that made it stand out from its 2nd game, and now everyone I have talked to who preferred 1 over 2 has agreed with me that Homeworld 1 remastered just seems to be a decently gone mod for Homeworld 2. The following is a list of features that are not in the remastered from Homeworld 1:-Refueling: your strike craft can go anywhere infinitely without being tethered to anything, allowing them to operate in the game independently and much more of a threat to areas such as your resource operation.-Harvesting:  in the first game, your harvesters flew around the asteroid and made them shrink as they collected resources (as well as dust clouds could be harvested). Here in remastered, they must dock with the asteroid to extract resources because of HW2’s -Repair: ships have to dock with other ships to repair them. While this isn’t a change for strike craft, frigates, capital ships, and resource collectors could be repaired at a range in Homeworld 1-The unit cap can’t be turned off in Multiplayer. This takes out a big chunk of what made some of the craziest HW battles that crazy (we’re talking hundreds of strike craft per person duking it out for superiority in a 6 person game)     Also, formations are a little annoying, and if you don’t believe me, I want you to go onto Homeworld 1 classic, build 9 ships, and put them into wall formation. You’ll get a nice 3x3 2d wall of the ships in a nice and orderly fashion. Do the same in HW1 remastered and you’ll get this weird cross thing with random gaps, and adding more ships to it just seems to make the cross bigger. Tactics are also screwed up with formations, and ships in specific tactics won’t always behave the same in formations the same ways that you might remember it from the Classic game. There is a new learning curve here (or bugs) that do need some attention whether you like it or not. Ships also have a tendency to partially break formation while moving (especially sphere), and on a small side note, sphere formationing ships and telling them to guard something won’t automatically make them form a sphere around the guarded ship. Again, this creates a small learning curve for the vets.     And we will complain about it, but it’s Homeworld, and we will still play it and eventually get used to it. (more on the way)			"

												The Homeworld series is the prime example of a (space) RTS done right. Everything from level of detail on ships, to gameplay, to mod support, and optimization are excellent. Now, I have a terrible gaming setup, a ATI Radeon 4350 graphics card with a AMD Phenom x4 910 processor. For those of you who don't speak computer hardware, this is a low end PC from back in like 2008. A piece of junk. Homeworld 2 ran great on it, and much to my surprise, so does the remastered edition. I have yet to see any serious frame issues despite playing it on a PC that is almost worth more as scrap metal than as a trade in. Granted, this is with most of the graphical settings turned low or off, but this just goes to show that you don't even need a decent computer to run the game. But for those of you who haven't played Homeworld, here’s a little about the remastered edition of the game:Its space RTS involving 4 races with up to 8 players. Each faction gets 4 different classes of units: Fighters, Corvettes, Frigates and Capital Ships with quite a few other utility class units. There are 2 Races from Homeworld 2, and 2 from the original Homeworld. There are significant differences between both generations, which is kind of interesting, especially when you consider the fact that both games are so fundamentally different, that they basically are incompatible with each other without serious modifications. Because of this, the devs, being so considerate of the loyal fan base, even decided to throw in the original ""untouched"" versions of both Homeworld 1 AND Homeworld 2, which is absolutely amazing when you consider the fact that Homeworld 1 is so old that you can't even run it on most systems. All in all, if you are a Homeworld fan, this buy is a no brainer. If you aren't a Homeworld fan, you're getting 2 fully retextured, rebalanced, beautiful and tactical RTS games with their original untouched (and now playable on your PC) versions. This game is a true classic, and I can't wait to see what mods make it to the Steam Workshop!10/10, Why don't you own this game yet?			"

												Overall this remaster is great and definitely worth buying if you like RTS games.  I rank it my 2nd favorite RTS of all time behind the original Starcraft and its expansion.  Heres my review of it:The good:The art is amazing.  The remastered textures, sounds, music, and models are all more than I had hoped for.  The new visual effects make the game as impressive today as it was when it was first released (the HW1 graphics were amazing for when it came out in 99).  Playing through the story is as fun and enjoyable as I remember it being.  I'll be spending a lot more time playing this for the next few weeks.  I like how my capital ships stay grouped up and in formation after hyperspacing from one mission to the next, that saves a lot of time setting them up.I haven't gotten around to Homeworld 2's campaign yet, but I doubt I'll be disappointed there.  That game is still easy to pick up and play today as it was 10 years ago.  So the graphical update to it will do little but make everything better.The Bad:While the remaster is great there are many changes from HW1->HWRM.  There are a lot of core changes to gameplay when the game was translated over to the new engine, many of which affected the strength of support craft, fighters, and corvettes in negative ways.  Such as: * Fighter/corvette formations having no effect on their behavior in a fight.  Corvettes don't face their targets when circling, meaning certain types of corvettes only use half of their guns in a fight.  This hurts Kushan the most because of the way their guns are laid out.* Guard works completely differently making it impossible to form defensive corvette walls and fighter balls.* Support craft healing abilities require them to be right next to the craft they are healing, as opposed to a comfortable distance away.  Making them both slower to heal because they have to maneuver into position and less effective because they cannot respond as quickly.  It also means two support frigates cannot heal each other.  They just circle around each other trying to sniff each others butts, like a pair of dogs.* Ships have wierd accuracy issues.  Many times their shots are no where near their targets, even when their target is stationary.* You can only build 2 units at a time.  In the original you could build 2-3 of each unit type simultaneously for a total 10+ units being built at one time (3 fighters, and 2 of each of the other types).  And that isn't even counting a carrier.* Research now costs RU and having multiple research vessels does not let you research multiple technologies at once.  Previously research was free and you could designate either a single or multiple research vessels to either research multiple things at once or one or two things very quickly.* Resource collectors will sometimes completely ignore patches of resources and claim that the map is dry.* Everything is less reponsive.  I think this is due to the engine, but I every click and command was crisp and responsive from the original.  In the new engine everything just feels more floaty.  Kinda like Starcraft 1 -> Starcraft 2 responsiveness.  I don't know why this is so hard to achieve in newer games but its something I've noticed.Because of that, the game plays about 60-70% accurate to the original.The Ugly:Of the new remastered graphics I'm very impressed with the missile effects ... when zoomed in.  When zoomed out they aren't there, and you can barely tell where the missiles are by the small missile pods.  In the original you could clearly see missile trails even when fully zoomed out.  And the ending credits are missing the music from Yes, but I heard that was due to a licensing issue.  If you want to see the original credits in their glory just visit youtube.  I have crashed once, and when getting back in game it completely screwed up my hotkeys in a mission where I really needed them to work from the start.  And finally, you need a ""Shift"" account to play multiplayer.  Its completely pointless to make one because they then force you to link it to your steam account before you can play.  Why couldn't you just use my steam account to begin with?I definitely recommend this game, but if you don't mind old graphics for HW1 you will find the original actually plays much better than the remaster.  As for HW2 its probably a direct upgrade, since this is just a modified HW2 engine the game is running on.			"

												Neat, I still have my original homeworld game disc played it many times over the years. This remake was about 90% of orginal game play. like missing the hotkey to select a group of your ships AND then hotkey and mouse highlet a group of enemy ships to attack. Was limited to only attacking one ship at a time but after they would attack any nearby ship. So it is still workable.Who knows they may still make updates after this post.New overlay of interface screen was a great improvement with info mouse overs. After 18 hrs I am am on stage 14, it is worth and eqaul to the game play price. Then I will countinueing on to the Homeworld 2 addition half of the game. I play a few stages and look forward to any game creation stuff if they include that. :) Cheers			"

												I have played the original Homeworld & Homeworld 2 since years back and I am really happy that they made a remaster of both of the games. I recently finished the Homeworld & Homeworld 2 remastered campaign and it was absolutely brilliant. Imagine your greatest gaming moments returned to life with better graphics and smoother gameplay. The nostalgia may play a big part in why I like this game, but I'll try my best to tell you the about the remastered version and the differences between the remastered versions and classic versions.+ The three dimensional movement & combat is astonishing to look at and easy to control.+ The story is great and really gives the game an amazing atmosphere around it while you play it.+ The updated Homeworld 2 UI (which is used in both remastered version of the game) is easy to understand and use.+ They captured the emptiness of space perfectly and it really sets the mood while you are playing the game.+ The multiplayer has also been updated. You are able to play as Taiidan, Vaygr, Kushan and Hiigaran on restored maps with new bonuses and game modes that I've had loads of fun with after the campaign.+ The game is slower paced than games like Starcraft, which means, you don't have to have super fast micro managing skills to be able to play well.+ The game is easy to mod and uses steam workshop.-+ The fuel system has been removed from the remastered versions (This was a system that could be seen as annoying or just another gameplay element depending on what the player thinks. The reason that the gameplay element was removed was probably because of the annoyance of having your ships becoming completely static in the middle of combat.)- The Homeworld & Homeworld 2 races are a bit unbalanced against eachother in multiplayer (Keep in mind that the multiplayer is still development).- The Resource collecting can be a bit buggy sometimes (when recource collecters want to collect debris from shipwrecks for example)- Some cool and useful attack patterns and strategies have been changed since the both remastered versions are runing on an updated Homeworld 2 engine.Overall, this game is truly a RTS masterpiece and is, AT LEAST, a must try for those who enjoy RTS.

												I can't recommend the game in it's current state. Sure, it looks pretty but beneath it's rotten to the core.I played the original Homeworld and understand how dated the original UI is. However, I would expect an improvement in a remaster. This is quite simply a giant mess. The UI is clunky and sometimes only lists certain ships you need in sub-menus. There is no master list for all production so you constantly have to shuffle through your build orders. Overall the UI is ugly, poorly implemented and does a bad job of differentiating ship classes. It's a chore.....AI is far inferior to the originals. Mobile refineries often don't work, Tactics have been totally removed. There's plenty of glitches, odd AI behavior and random crashes 6 months in as well...Do yourself a favor and get the originals or play Sins of a Solar Empire.  Maybe they will eventually fix the game but I'm not optimistic.			"

												I wish I'd knew this franchise since the beginning. Of course I've heard about Homeworld just managed to ignore this fantastic game for a long time.+ Old shool RTS with revolutionised 3D map and controls+ the feeling that you are actually in deep space, all alone with your enemies+ graphics+ gameplay+ very interesting story(telling) - useless formations (tried the classics, OMG what a difference, especially HW1)I recommend it to all RTS positive gamers out there!

												Homeworld Remastered Collection is truly a unique game.The story is captivating, the graphics are great (nice lighting effects, very detailled ships), and the modding community is already active.The game is running fine most of the time, i've only experienced 1/2 crashes, but nothing game breaking, a steady 70fps with a gtx660.Haven't tried the MP yet, but judging by the quality of the SP, i can only assume it's great.So do i recommend this game ?Yes, oh god yes, a really big surprise for me.

												Homeworld is a great game, a great franchise that deserved this great remaster. That being said, you must note that HW1 was basically ported to HW2, so if you are a HW veteran that absolutely despised the HW2 gameplay mechanics, you might find yourself disappointed.For everyone else, including those who never played any Homeworld game, this will be no problem at all - it's mostly a matter of personal taste.Only real downside to the game at this point: The balance. I have played through the HW1 SP campaign so far and I must say that after you get the strongest type of warship available, the game does get too easy. But Gearbox has assured us that balance (esp. in Multiplayer) is not final and will be worked on. (Thus Multiplayer BETA)And if all else fails, there will certainly be mods. HW2 has a very active and ingenious modding community and the remaster has been tendered to offer good mod support. So please don't take this warning as a turnoff, because otherwise, you would be missing out on a great RTS game like no other. Definitive recommendation from me.			"

												HW is easily one of my favorite games ever since it came out. Played it as a kid and still played HW1, Cataclysm, and HW2 over and over and would LAN it with my friends. Now with the remastered version I almost cried from just how great the ships look and the backdrops of space and planets look. Everything came out extremely well polished and awesome.If you have never played this game or a fan of the classic versions, definitely pick this up as it is amazing and always will be. Picked up the collectors edition as soon as it hit amazon a year ago and easily got my moneys worth already and more when people start to MOD the game and when multiplayer is finished.Love this game. Ok, back to playing it!			"

												Disclaimer: last 2 day, 3 patches... I hope it's not going to stop and Gearbox fixes the game issues. Summary: Pros: Homeworld 1 Classic runs, which is great. Homeworld 2 as Remastered is great too.Homeworld 1 Remastered eliminates a HW1 limitation: enemy ships target the first ship on sight and do not change target until it destroyed or docked. (and yes, that is all)Cons: Homeworld Cataclysm - where I you? I still miss you and don't give a darn about ""canon"". Homeworld 1 Remasterd is Homeworld 0.8. Too many things on the scewed up/missing list. Starting with the formation, pathfinding, tactics mess, ending with that Remastered misses the iconic words: ""All ships autolaunching.""Gerarbox changed HW1 mid-mission animations in HW1:R. Not about making engine exhausts more glaring, but changing scene and the text.Occasional crashes, 6+ GB memory usage on HW1 Remastered on Mission 14. The long one (TL;DR):Homeworld 1 Remastered screws: - Mission timings, craft speeds, game speed, map sizes as a whole. Game is too fast and far too easy. Starting with time needed for the resource collector to fill up it's internal storage bay. I do not feel even the craft speeds proper... - I had difficulties to use special actions on multiple unit at once in HW1 remastered. - Gearbox altered the between mission animations, sound track, sound effects, noises. And some of the changes simply make no sense, like the Guidestone. - Maximum zoom in and hear the difference of the Taidan fighter craft sound. - This needs checking: but for me it seems that some sounds and effects come from the Cataclysm to the HW1:R.- HW1:R lacks formation & tactics as a whole as other reviewers said. So if Gearbox decided cripple Homeworld 1, why did not they add time compression? - HW1:R UI is an utter disappointment for me. Homeworld Classics runs 1600*900 resolution and UI is far nicer.  This is personal: some ships are nicer in the HW1 Classics than the Remastered. And this is valid for some parts of the space. HW2: Would not say too much about it. For me HW2 Classic was an utter disappointment in gameplay, story and found it ""too epic"". Too many things unexplained in the storyline and I'm fed up with referencing recent navy technology to spaceships (torpedo frigate - master degree in lack creativity). And meanwhile there was the Homeworld Cataclysm... Please check the videos on Youtube about HW Cataclysm. See story depth, the grimm and bloody fight against the Beast and I'm pretty sure that you will also find HW2 weightless.(Not to mention that most of the Cataclysm videos are shot on normal difficulty and using 8-10% of the game's strategic and tactical offering.)

												In 1999 I played a game that would forever impress meWhen I opened the box I was presented with a beautiful manual/lore book full of information and background for the game I was playing.It was beautifulThen I loaded the game up.I was stunned by the gorgeousness of the graphicsI marvelled at how times had come along so much that this piece of art was now in my possessionWhen I played the game the intricacies of the strategy and the challenge of keeping your fleet in one piece and seeing it grow, remembering that old ion array frigate in the last mission that you acquired in the third mission, the epic story as you fought for the right to regain your homeworld and I thought it couldn’t get any better.I was wrongA year later Cataclysm was released, a standalone expansion from the original, it used the same engine but it was altered in a way that changed the rules, following a story set 15 years after landfall on the homeworld, you follow a family of miners who uncover a dark secret and a parasitic virus and you must race to stop it. Again it expanded on the visuals, tactics and story, again I thought it could not get better, and again I was wrong…Homeworld 2 was released in 2003, and with it a rewritten engine, stunning visuals that reminded me of the opening scene from revenge of the sith, and a slightly retconned but no less epic story.100 years after reclaiming your homeworld, the old enemy have arisen under a new leader. Using the artefact of an ancient super powerful hyperspace engine, But you have one too, and there are legends of a third. To reclaim your homeworld once again, you must liberate the second core, find the third and unite the cores to end the threat once and for all. Can it get better?Yes, Homeworld remastered is all of these games (with the exception of cataclysm, which I hope they add at some point) with updated engines and even better stunning hi definition visuals. It’s an epic experience. If you have played the original and loved them, buy it. If you’re a fan of epic sci fi, buy it. If you like strategy games, buy it.Just buy it, go on click add to cart and put your money where it belongs.			"

												I'm still amazed on this game. I played it about 6-7 yrs ago from 1-2 and Cataclysm. At the time I was like why I never heard of this such great game before then was wishing a sequel. I enjoyed an old classic game back then. Now it's back again as remastered. Now it is far greater and better graphics but funny 'coz I forgot how to play this game when I first tried it as I have skipped the turorial. I find it hard to play as I dont understand it anymore for first time again that made me decide to quit right away. But last night I have tried to play it again by going through the tutorial so I can remember how did I enjoyed this game back then. Was 9:30PM when I started playing through and guess what, the next time I looked at the clock it's already 5:35 AM in the morning @.@ that's how did I enjoyed playing this game without noticing the time.PROS:+ Engaging Story and voice narrative+ Music is really captivating+ Detailed gameplay+ Strategic in play+ Lots of ship varieties - it's a big space fleet you're gonna create and command. I'm ENDER!+ Great graphics+ Camera focus - I just like seeing the battle upclose or following the specific group engage into battle/sction+ 3D, you can go make your ships go up, down and angled. Not just a tabletop!+ Four games in this bundle remastered collection(including the classic.)+ w/ Mod support+ w/ AchievementsCONS:- Controls can sometimes be frustrating specially when moving units going down/up y-axis or I'm just terrible with it.- Slow pace, moving from point to point can be slow other than hyper jumping some of your ships- Damn no trading cards! Zzzz..- I notice some bugs to be honest but ain't game breaking.NOTES & TIPS:- Go through the tutorial first if you don't understand how to play it at first. I know some of us just wanna get right into the action like I did but it sometimes end up terrible until you just say f** this game I'm going play cod or csgo. lolMY RATING9 / 10 - Highly Recommend if you like this type of game!

												On first hearing the news that Gearbox had purchased the rights to 'Homeworld' I was livid as they had just released the botched 'AVP Colonial Marines' Homeworld is one of my Top 10 games of all time. I can breath a sigh of reflief because this remaster is ""Phenomenal"" (I don't think I've ever said that in a game review before).

												Note - This review is ONLY for Homeworld 1 Remastered, I haven't started playing HW2 yet.'Breathtaking'  is a word I wouldn't normally apply to an RTS, but I think it genuinely fits here.  The audiovisual presentation of Homeworld : Remastered immerses you in the vastness of space, and manages to make each stage in the empty void feel varied and colorful.  Gameplay wise, you've got a fairly difficult single player campaign that forces you to learn the ins and outs of the various spaceships so you can counter your enemies in a rock paper scissors like fashion.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but it is balanced quite well, and generally feels logical and fair.  The story this game tells is also genuinely interesting, and unique.  I have yet to finish the single player campaign but I am already curious to see where things are going and what the truth is about the various factions I have encountered thus far. So .. yeah.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing beautiful looking RTS,  and likes a good story.   I'm not going to compare it to the original homeworld because I never actually played HW1 ( only HW2 ).   Compared to the original HW2, the remaster of HW1 feels similar, but it's been like 10 years since I played it, so take that with a grain of salt :)Well done Gearbox!			"

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!The ""Homeworld Remastered Collection"" was once a great game enjoyed by many, but after recent updates provided by the developers at ""Gearbox Software"" and enforced by ""Steam"" the game has become dysfunctional.

At the time purchase this product was of an acceptable standard and retained the original value, gameplay and mechanics of the Homeworld series, however after the latest update I find the game to be completely unplayable as it has ruined my gaming experience.

Further more the developers at ""Gearbox Software"" refuse to offer any support in relation to this matter, simply dismissing any requests or tickets by responding with a standard template stating ""We'll make sure to pass your feelings along to the team so that they are aware!""

The code that went into recent updates was sloppy and mangled in an undesirable fashion to make the game more appealing to current non-existent users as an attempt to maximize profit.


For classic Homeworld enthusiasts the developers even went as far as to change several core mechanics of the game, you can't even Research Level 2 upgrades with ""Hiigaran"" races any more, in affect making the ""Advanced Research Module"" completely useless.

The Developers went beyond a ""Remastering"" when they started interfering with the core mechanics and gameplay.


It's a mess with several performance and gameplay issues, a poorly scaled UI and multiple crashes.

From a gamers point of view the developers have ruined a great game that I paid good money for.

From a programmers point of view they.. Completely used up all the bug spay and broke the swatter (use your imagination).


For those of you that have heard of ""Homeworld Deserts of Kharak"" don't be fooled this is not Homeworld 3, this is simply yet another failure by ""Gearbox software""

I do not recommend buying any games from ""Gearbox Software""


Don't waste your money on this purchase, it will only bring you disappointment and frustration! "

												*Gregorian Chants fill the expanse of space as the light of a distant star filters through the red gas clouds of the local nebula*For those of you who played Homeworld or Homeworld 2...you know why you should buy this.  For those of you who have never had the priveledge...this game is still considered by many experts of the RTS genre to be the defining RTS experience.  One of the most polished, best story-driven RTS games ever made, AND the sequel.It is a space saga...an epic journey of a people to reclaim their homeworld...and then...an aeon later, to flee said homeworld before destruction rains down upon them.It is...the most beautiful RTS I have ever seen.   Even before the remaster, I would've said so.  Now...it is updated in every way one could hope for, without ANY changes to the core mechanics.  The story is the same, but the voice acting is all-new, from the same actors who voiced the original.  The graphics are modernized, and the game feels...fresh.  It feels as it should;  essentially unchanged, but better than ever before!I recommend this game to anyone who seriously wishes to give the RTS genre a genuine try.   If you don't like this, you probably won't like many other RTS games. On the other hand; If you like RTS games, this will likely be the jewel of your collection.			"

												Ive only been able to play the classic home world and that doesnt even work properly. So im sitting there playing the classic home world game and i just start the new campaign. it gives me a objective to destroy the training drones and I proceed. After veiwing the fight for the first 3 seconds the game justs crashes. I tryed this over and over for multiple times but still the same outcome. For the time being whenever i try to launch the other 3 games from the launcher it just doesnt do anything. untill its fixed I wouldnt recomend that you buy it.			"

												I have always been a fan of space based fleet combat. Since homeworld 1 came out I have yet to see any game capture the strategic genius that is the Homewolrd series. The modding community is great and I am really excited about the re-release of the game in a higher def. IMHO... it's the best RTS ever made. If you haven't played it yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest games ofall time.			"

												Is this game worth buying? Maybe, if you've never played Homeworld or Homeworld before. This is definitely not a remaster. The homeworld 1 models and campaign were imported into the HW2 engine, ruining many features of the game. Apart from the multiplayer, which requires a special Gearbox account, there is just the updated textures and models. There were mods that could do this, for free. But this costs money. Pick up homeworld 2 for $10 online and you'll have the same experience, for cheaper.			"

												If you've never played the original Homeworld game, you'll probably still love this game. However, this game deviates from the original game's style and gameplay mechanics for me to recommend it to a fan.Why I think it's a bad adaptation:1: The hit-detection has been replaced with RNG and it's annoying and doesn't feel right2: Tactics no longer affect formations- units break formation when in combat regardless of tactic3: Captial class ships too tanky and ion beams are overpowered compared to the original game- fighters used to be viable against capital-class ships, this is no longer the case.4: Selection boxes are bigger than the model, this is lazy and the original game handled it perfectlyVERDICT: Get the original from Ebay, it's better and cheaper. AND you get a physical box. Not to mention that the original boxed versions still have multiplayer (unlike classic in the remastred collection)			"

												I don't recommend buying this until they get it fixed. Even after 11 updates (one just a day ago) it still doesn't work right. Formations (particularly the parade formation) still don't work, and without the parade formation, you haven't got any way to tell your ships to group up together by type, so selecting all the ships of a particular type to hot-key is next to impossible. Even figuring out what ships you've got is hard. I don't understand why Gearbox refuses to fix this aspect of the game. I'll update my review when (if) they get it fixed, but for now, either avoid it or know that playing it at the moment is a chore.			"

												The remaster for HW1 is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately in so doing they gutted the deep AI system for the strike craft.  So one of the most engaging aspects of the original game is gone and it makes the early missions where you more or less rely on strike craft tedious.  I'm disappointed with the port on a lot of levels, but then I remember it's from Gearbox so I'm sure this means that Borderlands 3 will be better off. I was on the fence on whether to vote yes or no on this considering the original games are ported in their unaltered form.  I'd recommend getting it on sale just to experience the classics (so long as you don't mind the graphics or the UI being a little rough.)  Otherwise I'd say no, give this one a pass.			"

												It seems unfair to write a (negative) review with just a few hours spent, but the game simply doesn't impress me. This goes for the remastered versions, I haven't tried the classics yet.+ Beautiful. Nice settings, nice backgrounds, nice ships. All good.+ Sound/music. Some people might argue that there shouldn't be any explosions or sounds in space but...not me.+ User interface. Very easy to handle, gives you all the information you need. Very intuitive.+ Real 3D space battles. This is the one aspect that I still have a lot to learn of.+ There's a limited amount of resources on each map and you carry your surplus with you to the next mission.- Each battle feels like I just mass my ships and plunge them in there. No thrill, no excitement, no fun. Maybe I'm a natural at composing fleets that'll crush all opposition, but I don't know... The missions I've played so far has just been me waiting for my fleets to destroy the enemy and retreating damaged ships for repairs. And carrying tens of thousands of resources from each map means that I can build 2-3 new fleets if I should get my fleet wiped out.In conclusion, the game looks great and feels great but just doesn't give you a proper challenge. I would recommend the game if you are unfamiliar to the genre.			"

												I loved the Homeworld games when I was younger, but unfortunately Gearbox ruined a lot with the remaster.

												One of the best remaster's Gearbox has made. It's beatiful graphics are breathless especially coming from a 15 year old game which back then had 16-Bit pologon graphics form to make 3D models. It's audio remade into something that you would hear nowadays on most AAA games. The soundtrack is well remade and nostalgic for veterans like me and most of the other dedicated fans and players of this franchise. The story is well told and it's lore interesting and it's antagonists really likable to go up against.There are bugs like any other game and some odd design choices which can put off some gamers. It's diffiult to control at first but you'll get the hang of it after a few plays. The A.I. is pretty smart and clever and will be a challenge for players especially in campaign. The strategies and tips used from the classics unfortunatle are obsolete in the remastered so the missions are to be unexpected as we still don't understand how the game can be played in the players favor: where in the classics there was an exploit which used right would give the player great advantage over the A.I. in the campaign. A lot of the veterans complain saying its rather dissappointing and buggy and not worked out. I beg to differ. It's a really good rts game even if its buggy at it's release and realistically speaking almost every game thats released has bugs and complications upon release but it's not so bad as other games released recently by big name companies. In due time hoipefully things will get patched up and mods worked on and created to where this game is even MORE enjoyable.Pros-Amazing graphics-Great audio remake-Aamazing OST-Story-A.I.-Interesting factions to play-Mods-CommunityCons--Formations broken-Damges done to certain crafts especially frigates bug out and become shooting dummies-Tactics broken-Some minor visual glitches here and there from time to time-Crashes after hours of continous gameplay-Pop cap(Is that really necessary to have especially since modern machines are powerful enough to hold massive fleets.)-Multiplayer in BetaOverall this is a wonderful masterpiece from an underrated game. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in space battles,rts's,tactics etc. or anyone starting out with rts games. For those new to the franchise or never heard of it. They also included the classic first to games to play on as well to compare and try out as well and it's also for the veterans who lost their copy(like me :( ) as getting ahold of a physical copy of this game is like a needle in a haystack nowadays so why hassle your time in finding a physical copy of the older two games when it's included in this digital bundle.9/10P.S.-It's a shame that Cataclysm can't be remastered(source code is missing and is unable to be found) as that was a good game as well that was part of the Homeworld franchise and that too is difficult to get ahold of a physical copy.

												(Disclaimer: This is for those who played and loved the very first Homeworld)Update; Now there is this ""General Failure"" crash plaguing the remastered that prevents mods and half the vanilla game. Did some digging and this crash has been happening for almost a year with no sign of a patch..... Still a buggy mess...I love the Homeworld series. It is beautiful in story and visuals, and fantastic gameplay and mechanics in the classics.(Homeworld 1 RM review)In short:I was fanboying over the visuals and sound and was having fun until I encounted more and more bugs and poor design decisions. I got too disappointed with the quality of the game as a whole to continue playing. It is Gearbox trying to mash Homeworld 1 into Homeworld 2's engine and failed, and feels rushed.In long:Homeworld RM is a HUGE upgrade in visuals and quality (stupid sexy Taiidan Heavy Cruiser)Sounds are cleaned up and sounds so much clearer and textures are great in HD (again Taidan Heavy Cruiser, I can't get over it!). UI was also updated and now a little bit more user friendly, no longer do you need to go to a WHOLE other screen for research, construction and hanger.However, it is not without its bugs, and there are lots of bugs and poor design decisions.Formations and Stances do not work as intended (I.E. Sphere formation do not surround targets, strike craft just break formations rendering formations useless. Stances do not give appropriate buffs like increased speed for evasive and increased fire power for aggressive.)Some units are unnecessarily changed (I.E repair units must now ""Dock"" with their targets to repair instead of repairing from a range.)Unit A.I. isn't all that good (I.E. strike craft tend to crash into asteroids and other objects in some missions)Units lifespan seems to be significantly shortened (I.E. A whole strike group of frigates won't last five minutes against a single heavy cruiser, same for strike strike craft to frigates. Rendering smaller ships hard to use or even worth using)Sound bugs (I.E. strike craft engines won't disappear if you hear them while docking)First experience with Homeworld with steam workshop mod support and sound just ceased to exist and gameplay was barely playable.And the most game breaking bug is RANDOM DESKTOP CRASHESit seems that Gearbox was trying to mash Homeworld 1 and 2 together when them both use very different mechanics and really messed up Homeworld 1 RM. Homeworld 1 IS NOT homeworld 2.I understand this is still new and update are incoming but for right now and my opinion is subject to change to updates. Until the game is more polished up and bugs ironed out, I just can't recommend this remaster in its current state. I still perfer to play the CD versions because it is much more stable. Even though this is just Homeworld 1 RM review, it is still half the package.			"

A worthy remake of the epic space opera that pioneered the three-dimensional strategy genreI remember playing the original Homeworld in 1999 and marvelling at the fidelity and amazing graphics. Launching the ""Classic"" version today – only possible thanks to Gearbox recompiling the original code to run on modern operating systems – isn't quite as impressive as it was back in the day. How fortunate then, that they have done a stellar (pardon the pun) job with the Remastered versions of the two main games in the series.The graphics are top notch, with some incredibly detailed textures, impressive explosions and beautiful galactic backdrops. Both games now run in the same engine, however I would highly recommend playing Homeworld Remastered before Homeworld 2 Remastered if you're aiming to experience both, since the latter has even better graphics and many more polygons. The new and improved interface (used in both Remastered versions) also gets slightly more cluttered in the sequel, so you might appreciate the easier learning curve of beginning with the first game.Maneuvering a battlefield that goes in all directions can be a bit confusing at times, even when you've memorized all the controls. Occasionally you may find yourself fully zoomed in on an asteroid when all you wanted to do was to check up on your harvesters. If this happens, remember that you can use the Pause button to freeze the action until you find your orientation again. By all means, remember to use the Pause button even when you're not doing close inspections of rocks since it can (and will) seriously help with giving orders in the midst of hundreds of spaceships trying to destroy eachother. Also, a paused battle looks absolutely stunning with all the missiles, ion beams and explosions quietly suspended in space.Storywise there are a lot of things going on, with both campaigns more or less revolving around the Kushan (player faction) homeworld, Hiigara. While there is a cutscene between every mission that give brief explanations of past and current events, and frequent mentions of (and interactions with) other factions during the campaign, one generally feels a bit disconnected from the universe. The Kushan certainly seem familiar with the the friendly and technologically advanced Bentusi from the start, but who are they anyway? What do they look like, and where do they come from? What do they want? Naturally, those who are interested will find out more on the internet, but players shouldn't expect the games to pique that interest.While certainly not without it's (minor) flaws, if you're into space, strategy and/or Adagio for Strings, the Homeworld series is well worth your time and money. Not just because it started a new genre, but more importantly because it is undoubtedly still the king of said genre.			"

												Frigate lost. Frigate lost. Frigate lost. Group one reports victory. Ooh, nostalgia! For me personally this is still one of the best RTS series out there. Still a great story. Still great gameplay. Still great voice acting. Still phenomenal sounddesign and music. Why still? Well, be advised: If you buy this remastered version it may happen that you run into some bugs. Minor ones (i.e. units are not correctly displayed while docked to the mothership) and major ones like the well known 'general failure' crash-to-desktop. The latter was fixed for me as gearbox stated in one of their news from february 2015 that it would be REQUIRED(!) to update to the latest ati/nvidia graphics drivers. Otherwise the game would not run stable. But, still...11/10.			"

												Well now that I actually can play this game I can give it a review. I love RTS games, and it's amazing to see people still trying to keep them alive.This is a must play for anyone who likes RTS games. The remastered edition gives the game a much needed facelift(well the first one, HW2 was pretty decent even at it's current age)A lot of times you can look at an older game, know that it's an amazing game, but can't play it because it's so dated that you have a very hard time going from SUPER HD to old school graphics that gave me a headache from time to time, and the interface is so clunky that your fighting it the entire time. So if you like RTS games and especially a very good single player game this is for you, it doesn't even feel like a retro game with this remastered edition.			"

												This is a game that I really really want to like. I love strategy and have played strategy games for well over a decade, both old and new. I love titles such as Sins of a Solar Empire, Command and Conquer (EA is teh debil) and Age of Empires. This game has a very clunky feeling control scheme that I cannot seem to get past, I don't believe I've ever really played this game more than a couple hours, I have a bad habit of clicking on it, seeing the launcher pop up and forgetting about it. I simply cannot get excited about this game. I have only played one skirmish to completion and despite the honestly, very interesting story, I can't bear to keep progressing past the first mission. I feel this game is something that old fans will enjoy, but for those of us who have never experienced Homeworld before it may be something you pass on until you see a -75% off sale.			"

												Since the vast majority of negative reviews here are misleading and either nitpick or make vague and uninformative complaints about failed launches, I figured I would give you guys a more comprehensive first impression of Homeworld Remastered. Before I start though, know that I haven't played the original Homeworlds and am new to the series. Also, the in-depth review will come a bit later, given that I've only played for a couple of hours. Here's a quick summary of the game's pro's and con's. Pros: + Satisfyingly simple yet beautiful visuals+ Ease of use [I was reticent about how easy it would be to control fleets given the scope of the game and my inability to micro efficiently but the controls are spot on].+ Audio---I can't stress this enough. Gearbox got the original developpers to contribute their original audio files—UNCOMPRESSED—for the remastered game. If you have headphones that are half decent or, ideally, have dolby 7.1, you're in for a treat. Also, the zoom level will give you access to different levels of audio. Zoomed out? You have the audio of high ranked officers and frigates. Zoomed in? You hear the dogfighting grunt screaming for his life as he's blown up. + Story: The narrative does a good job at not holding your hand too much. It drew me right in during the first few missions, and combined with the audio and headache free controls, nothing is really in the way of you experiencing the story without any hassles. +Depth. Again, I can't stress this enough. Try to imagine a complicated hierarchy of ships and tiers, combine that with coordinated strikeforces which utilize altitude and formations, combined with a great two tier command system of macro and micro commands, and you get a fantastically intricate rts which flirts with becoming overwhelming but never quite gets there. Cons:- While the graphics are satisfying, there are certain elements that seem a little oldschool. While I know this was done to maintain the nostalgiac visuals of the original, you get some weird combination of amazing textures on the mothership with odd and clunky parts. - The learning curve. If you're not into strategy games or are looking for something to easily jump into, this might not be the game for you. It's not a simple point and click. Like I mentioned, you have a 3d plane of combat, so you have to worry about attacks from above and below, as well as front, back and side. Also, if you weren't really into space themed games, distinguishing a corvette from a frigate from a carrier will take some memorization. Honestly, forget these chumps who are using steam reviews as a support or troubleshooting forum. They don't post specs, probally haven't even attempted to take the most basic steps in fixing these problems, and are just firing off ""Not Recommended"" left and right. While I acknowledge that my experience, however seamless, won't be the same for others, I think that a certain level of patience is in order given that it's launch day. I've seen AAA titles have much more horrific launches than this gem of a game.A B-List gamers review. Check us out on the Curators page for similar reviews.			"

But when you do...you will again dream about Hiigara. As you certainly did when the game was originally released.About the whole ""Remastered"" thing. It is done very good.

												Was a fantastic game and franchise over ten years ago that never left my mind. I had been disappointed for years by the seemingly endless licensing hell the IP had fallen into  and was one of the people ecstatic by the idea that Blackbird would be carrying the torch with the Shipbreakers IP. Then when Gearbox accuired the HW IP and began working with blackbird all my christmases came at once.The remastered edition is all that the original games were with better graphics. They have tweaked some gameplay elements (some for the worse) but overall it is a very tight and beautiful package that captures much of the magic of the original game. The depth of the gameplay is somewhat lacking by todays standards while still true to the original but this being a remaster that cannot be considered a fault.Mod support and the all but promise of a Homeworld 3 if this remaster did well made this purchase a no-brainer. I look forward to many more years of enjoyment with this IP which captured my imagination and love of Sci-Fi when I was young.			"

												It seems unfair to write a (negative) review with just a few hours spent, but the game simply doesn't impress me. This goes for the remastered versions, I haven't tried the classics yet.+ Beautiful. Nice settings, nice backgrounds, nice ships. All good.+ Sound/music. Some people might argue that there shouldn't be any explosions or sounds in space but...not me.+ User interface. Very easy to handle, gives you all the information you need. Very intuitive.+ Real 3D space battles. This is the one aspect that I still have a lot to learn of.+ There's a limited amount of resources on each map and you carry your surplus with you to the next mission.- Each battle feels like I just mass my ships and plunge them in there. No thrill, no excitement, no fun. Maybe I'm a natural at composing fleets that'll crush all opposition, but I don't know... The missions I've played so far has just been me waiting for my fleets to destroy the enemy and retreating damaged ships for repairs. And carrying tens of thousands of resources from each map means that I can build 2-3 new fleets if I should get my fleet wiped out.In conclusion, the game looks great and feels great but just doesn't give you a proper challenge. I would recommend the game if you are unfamiliar to the genre.			"

While it is possible to play vs the cpu in original homeworld with this set, it is NOT possible (currently) to play vs other people unless you play homeworld 2 version of homeworld 1.

												--- I haven't played HW2R yet so my ""not recommended"" only refers to HW1R. ---I'm only at Mission 5 and I already encountered numerous game breaking bugs.- Screen goes black when a cutscene should start/end. (6 times)- Destroy the carrier -> carrier explodes -> 2 seconds later mission failed -> another 2 seconds later ""we successfully destroyed the carrier....blah"" in the background -> load savegame or quit .... happend twice .... 3rd time worked....- Screen suddenly goes black during normal gameplay (still sound and radio messages when you click somewhere, but stays black no matter what you do-> taskmanager -> kill)- Mission objective completed ... nothing happens ... just goes on forever -> load savegame- Ships don't take commands anymore (especially ressource controller)- Arrival of Bentusi mothership screws up the game -> load savegame or stare at the mothership and wait for something to happen for a few hoursSeems like I have to play every fight at least twice to ""succeed"" ... very annoying.In addition .... like many other reviewers already mentioned.... formations for fighters hardly make sense + some were removed + they removed fuel and they changed projectiles in a bad way ... I hope the game gets fixed and many great mods.As a fan of the original HW1 and after many positive reviews I'm quite disappointed and can't recommend HW1R it in its current state.HW2R may be better, but I'm not in the mood for giving it a try right now. But even if it turned out to be great ... it's still only half of the package, so my verdict would still be ""not recommended""			"

As someone who played the originals I can say that I absolutely adore the remake. The graphics and attention to detail are incredible, as is the retooled sound. The story though, is where homeworld really takes the cake. A classic space opera that introduces you to a huge galaxy, and then has you kill half of it.Overall this game is very enjoyable, and is something I can come back to again and again.			"

No thrill, no excitement, no fun. Maybe I'm a natural at composing fleets that'll crush all opposition, but I don't know... The missions I've played so far has just been me waiting for my fleets to destroy the enemy and retreating damaged ships for repairs. And carrying tens of thousands of resources from each map means that I can build 2-3 new fleets if I should get my fleet wiped out.In conclusion, the game looks great and feels great but just doesn't give you a proper challenge. I would recommend the game if you are unfamiliar to the genre.			"

												In my opinion Homeworld II is rather slow and the build options were quite limited.I did think it had an interesting design in terms of unit research and production being tied to installed modules on capital ships. The controls were inuitive but quite clunky and did not work correctly in all cases.Would pick it up for a fiver or tenner at max. But I think I have seen enough to not really want it.			"

												Early BETA status at best. Feature incomplete. Have not completed a single mission without game breaking bugs forcing me to start over at least once. This is an early release game that was not advertised as such. Pretty sad to release a update to a 15 year old game in such a poor condition that you're better off playing the original.			"

												Avoid.Should be great, but riddled with bugs, constant crashes for no reason mid mission, multiple failure of missions because the ""sucess"" criteria does not register. No formations in HW2 because of transition to HW2 engine, no tactics in HW1 because fo transition to HW2 engine.Campaign in HW1 is practially unplayable in places.It looks great, the texture work is top quality, and when it does work its enjoyable and a good port....but too many bugs, too unstable. Its pretty much unplayable in my opinion.			"

												Best space based RTS? definately in the top five,Homeworld Remastered Collection takes two of the best RTSes of all time and remaster them in a package completely worth your money,featuring some of the best space battles to date and an impressive story about a journey and the defence of a promised land. if you enjoy Real Time Strategy games and HD remasters then this one is a must have since its not just a mere upscaled ""Remastered"" they actually remade the cutscenes,added new sound effects and each ship got a new higher-res model that stands up to this date. great job Gearbox.

												I bought, played, and enjoyed Homeworld when it came out and Homeworld 2 as soon as it came out. Excited about the remaster? Yes!Happy with it? No ♥♥♥♥ing way.Homeworld 1 Remastered...Pro's: the graphics have been updated.Con's: special abilities are ♥♥♥♥ed (salvaging? useful repairs?), pathfinding is rubbish, the AI is usless, for some reason resources have increased tenfold. Formations barely work, the ships sort of move and then go YOLO as soon as an enemy ship appears. Most of the keyboard commands don't work. They have used the HW2 engine, so none of the fabulous features of HW1 have remained, but at the same time, none of the features of HW2 have been implemented.I bought this remaster without reading any reviews or criticisms, DESPITE having the original game installed and recently played. I never once thought that a 'remaster' would LOSE FEATURES. It plays like a buggy, poor thought out beta version. It has none of the easy playability of the 1999 release.If this review is unclear, I would like to state: there are very, very few gaming experiences that have been as disappointing as this.			"

												I'll be up front and not wax prose when not needed: This is one of the most stunningly beautiful games I've ever seen. I loved Homeworld when it first came out, and hotly anticipated this release. There is no disappointment whatsoever. The 3 dimensional space combat is gorgeous and occurs to a breathtaking scale. The balance is still incredible. There are a few levels that you kindof have to game still, and sometimes the mouse goes crazy, but this game still remains possibly the most satisfying RTS I've ever played. It is engaging and relaxing all at once. I cannot recommend this game enough. Get it now, you're actually getting 2 games that will bring you to tears at once.			"

Still great gameplay. Still great voice acting. Still phenomenal sounddesign and music. Why still? Well, be advised: If you buy this remastered version it may happen that you run into some bugs. Minor ones (i.e. units are not correctly displayed while docked to the mothership) and major ones like the well known 'general failure' crash-to-desktop. The latter was fixed for me as gearbox stated in one of their news from february 2015 that it would be REQUIRED(!) to update to the latest ati/nvidia graphics drivers. Otherwise the game would not run stable. But, still...11/10.			"

A worthy remake of the epic space opera that pioneered the three-dimensional strategy genreI remember playing the original Homeworld in 1999 and marvelling at the fidelity and amazing graphics. Launching the ""Classic"" version today – only possible thanks to Gearbox recompiling the original code to run on modern operating systems – isn't quite as impressive as it was back in the day. How fortunate then, that they have done a stellar (pardon the pun) job with the Remastered versions of the two main games in the series.The graphics are top notch, with some incredibly detailed textures, impressive explosions and beautiful galactic backdrops. Both games now run in the same engine, however I would highly recommend playing Homeworld Remastered before Homeworld 2 Remastered if you're aiming to experience both, since the latter has even better graphics and many more polygons. The new and improved interface (used in both Remastered versions) also gets slightly more cluttered in the sequel, so you might appreciate the easier learning curve of beginning with the first game.Maneuvering a battlefield that goes in all directions can be a bit confusing at times, even when you've memorized all the controls. Occasionally you may find yourself fully zoomed in on an asteroid when all you wanted to do was to check up on your harvesters. If this happens, remember that you can use the Pause button to freeze the action until you find your orientation again. By all means, remember to use the Pause button even when you're not doing close inspections of rocks since it can (and will) seriously help with giving orders in the midst of hundreds of spaceships trying to destroy eachother. Also, a paused battle looks absolutely stunning with all the missiles, ion beams and explosions quietly suspended in space.Storywise there are a lot of things going on, with both campaigns more or less revolving around the Kushan (player faction) homeworld, Hiigara. While there is a cutscene between every mission that give brief explanations of past and current events, and frequent mentions of (and interactions with) other factions during the campaign, one generally feels a bit disconnected from the universe. The Kushan certainly seem familiar with the the friendly and technologically advanced Bentusi from the start, but who are they anyway? What do they look like, and where do they come from? What do they want? Naturally, those who are interested will find out more on the internet, but players shouldn't expect the games to pique that interest.While certainly not without it's (minor) flaws, if you're into space, strategy and/or Adagio for Strings, the Homeworld series is well worth your time and money. Not just because it started a new genre, but more importantly because it is undoubtedly still the king of said genre.			"

												Homeworld Remastered is genuinely a breath of fresh air in the RTS genre all over again. Gearbox have done a fantastic job of reviving this classic series of 3DRTS action, with a beta multiplayer to boot. At the time of writing this, the multiplayer needs severe balancing and bug fixing, but it shows great potential. All four races (kush, taiidan, hiigaran, vaygr) are now all available in the multiplayer, however the homeworld 1 races need the most adjustments.The remastered collection runs in the Homeworld 2 engine, with revamped graphics and the formations of homeworld 1 are now implemented into the game (however I don't think they function as gearbox intended, most likely will need fixing).The collection also comes with the classic editions of both games if you feel like a trip down nostalgia lane, or if you just want to see the difference between the original games and the remastered editions.If you enjoyed the original games, or have just come across this for the first time, I highly recommend purchasing it.

												Wow. What a delightful surprise. I played HW1 casually when I was a kid, but when I picked up this remaster as an adult, the graphics, voice acting, and soundtrack blew me away.Never have I played an RTS and experienced so much beauty that I just had to sit there and gawk at the screen for extended periods of time. I found myself locking the camera on fighters and rooting for them in massive battles. After a while, I felt like I was spending the night stargazing and admiring the beauty of the cosmos, not playing a video game. In a break in the action, I thought to myself, ""I think I just had a spiritual experience in a video game...""			"

But now that it graphics have  been improved and brought up to modern graphics standards, complete with UI optimizations that reduce screen clutter; one's view of Homeworld's epic space battles as they unfold is unfettered and rendered in sharp and breathtaking detail. It's absolutely gorgeous to behold and there hasn't been an RTS game to match its theme and style in 16 years! If you're an RTS fan and you haven't had a chance to give this title a shot in the past, you owe it to yourself to pick this legendary title up now!

												Homeworld Remastered is a redone, from the ground up, version of Homeworld, released back in 1999 or thereabouts. Gearbox has nailed it, with the graphics and sound being truly immersive, and gameplay even better.Once humanity discovers warp drives, and unknowingly breaks a millenia-old treaty with an intergalactic community, aliens are now tasked with erasing all of humanity with you being our only hope. You command the last human stronghold, a huge elliptical ship tasked with taking the fight back to them, and perhaps reign dominant or become at peace.			"

												For those who wanted to play Homeword 1 with a new coat of paint and maybe a some UI (User Interface) improvements, this ain't it. Instead what you get is a half ♥♥♥♥♥ mod of the Homeworld 1 capaign for Homeworld 2. Almost nothing works as expected. The UI looks awful, feels awful and is in most ways no improvement over the original one. There is a reason there was no Homeworld 3.The graphics look good. They did a fine job remodeling the ships. Unfortunately with none of the actual behavior modeled, the ships feel like empty husks. Turrets of corvettes don't seem to independently track and shoot enemy ships like they used to, and when big ships fire their giant cannons, there is no recoil on the turret. Everything feels like a 3d-Max model making pew pew sounds.Formations don't work. Instead of the giant walls of capital ships surrounded by spheres of corvettes and wings of fighters you get to choose between a few different amorphous blobs and any time the ships move or see an enemy, the blog disintegrates.Battles don't work. If you follow a fighter, you see that it couldn't hit a side of a mothership if it was docked inside it, making fights between fighters and corvettes take forever. On the other hand, assault frigates swat fighters out of the sky like so many flies. It's obvious Gearbox didn't even slightly try to match the balance of the original game.Salvaging enemy ships doesn't work. Or one could argue that in all their bugginess they work too well. Just make a few of these and capture the whole enemy fleet: fighters, corvettes, everything, and you are done. Just don't build any of your own ships because they will shoot at the captured ships. You see, Homeworld 2 had boarding frigates that captured the targeted ships in place, so the engine doesn't actually support salvage ships that take their prey back into the mothership, and it's obvious that Gearbox didn't want to make any actual changes to the engine, or do any testing.Homeworld 1 classic works. Too bad you don't get any graphical updates or UI features while playing it. Although, it's probably for the best since Gearbox doesn't seem to care about the things that made this classic great. Homeworld 1 is still a fantastic game and doesn't look nearly as dated as they make it look in their comparison videos. All they needed to do was these things:- Use the original physics and game simulation engine.- Update the 3d rendering engine to support modern resolutions and shadows. Although if that was too hard, updating just the models and textures would have been fine too.- Increase the simulation steps per second to at least 30.- Add time control.Instead of doing these things, they made some nice looking ship models for Homeworld 2. Hence the turd that is Homeworld Remastered.			"

												I am very pleased to get a working copy of HW on my system again and to play it at 4k UHD.  Unfortunetly, I have crashed a dozen times, had weird graphical glitches that resolved themselves with lowering graphical settings and restarting the client repeatedly and the story line missions are buggy as all get out.  MAKE SURE TO SAVE BEFORE JUMPING TO THE NEXT SYSTEM.  And saving between major events helps too.  If you restart a mission for whatever reason, or it crashed, using the auto-generated saves the mission often won't flag completion, you'll miss research and you will be very frustrated.All in all, the graphics are beautiful, controls intuitive, and the game nostolgic.  With all the bugs, this REMASTERing feels more like a visually pretty but unstable beta product.  They may fix the problems over time, but, I am quite dissappointed that my '99 experience of HW was more stable then this remake.*EDIT* On Mission 12 of HW1:RMI have reached a Can Not Continue bug where the mission objectives are not completing and the cloaked ships are not spawning.  HW1:RM is much too easy and not giving the same replability of Classic.  Lacking controls, UI, tactics and difficulty. Very disillusioned.HW2:RM feels much more integrated and even prettier then it was originally. I would suggest waiting for Steam Summer Sale and get HW:RM for 50%.  Hopefully they will have fixed the bugs, problems and multiplayer by then.			"

												Of the many games I have played over the years, this is one of those that stands out in my memories. Being a person that has little patience or time to complete games, I would normally use trainers to get through various sequences of a game to finish it as quickly as possible while absorbing the story. Not this one. It always had a certain 'spark' that kept me on the right path to follow it through to the very end. Few have done this for me.In my opinion, it deserved remastering and hats off to them - they stayed true to the original and gave it an incredible polish. The story, music, in-game interface, narration, graphics and attention to detail are as close to perfect that I can imagine.My only regret is not being able to purchase the collectors edition.			"

It feels like it was developed this year, the visuals are crispy, the controls are improved as well as the interface.And this game has not changed. The story is still amazing. The music is still haunting. It will still kick your butt. This isn't your classic 'turtle and hoard' RTS. You're going to lose a few missions. You're going to have to adapt your strategies.

Before the remastered version was even heard of i was still happily playing it with friends. But i always had a thought in the back of my head that this game needed so much work just to be even playable on my rig. So so many crashes, so many bugs that made the game impossible to play, so many times i'd stop playing too out of frustration to then come back later after realizing their is no other game out there quite like homeworld 2.To finally be able to play HW2 without error, without issues arising every time i load a single player map, or unable to connect to a friend to compete against due to incompatibility issues. Its  finally all over. i now have to simply press a few buttons and am away with the ships in a far away galaxy.The remarstered game is everything that i personally hoped for. These bugs that people are complaining about i personally haven't seen and even if i did i wouldnt care because at the end of the day a game 15+ years old finally getting the love and dedication it deserves trounces all that. I could never play the first homeworld and right now i've just completed the first games campaign and it was amazing. if you never touched the game before you'll love it. Its a hefty price for a great game, but entirely justified. They truely remastered the franchise and i hope that any company in the future hoping to relaunch a franchise will look up to gearboxes great example. Gearbox managed to keep everything the Fans loved, fixed everything we hated and added everything we wanted. Bravo to the team who did this!!			"

												Of the many games I have played over the years, this is one of those that stands out in my memories. Being a person that has little patience or time to complete games, I would normally use trainers to get through various sequences of a game to finish it as quickly as possible while absorbing the story. Not this one. It always had a certain 'spark' that kept me on the right path to follow it through to the very end. Few have done this for me.In my opinion, it deserved remastering and hats off to them - they stayed true to the original and gave it an incredible polish. The story, music, in-game interface, narration, graphics and attention to detail are as close to perfect that I can imagine.My only regret is not being able to purchase the collectors edition.			"

												Homeworld 2 absorbed my time for quite a while, and I regretted not having beat Homeworld 1, but the game was just too old and felt too clunky to hold my interest. So I bought this. Honestly this is hands down the best 'remaster' of any game I've ever played. It feels like it was developed this year, the visuals are crispy, the controls are improved as well as the interface.And this game has not changed. The story is still amazing. The music is still haunting. It will still kick your butt. This isn't your classic 'turtle and hoard' RTS. You're going to lose a few missions. You're going to have to adapt your strategies. In other words, its Real Time, clench your cheeks and make with the Strategy. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the genre, and to anyone looking to try the genre.			"

												Event though they have fixed some of the deal breaking issues, it's still far from a great game. I loved the originals for their gameplay, their different mission types and the (then awesome) graphics. Just a few updated textures, perhaps some new triangles, but still, this feels very old. for the price of 28 EUR, I'd have expected way more improvements. I wouldn't buy this again.			"

												(As of this writing I have only played Homeworld Remastered, not 2)I was a bit hesitant to purchase this due to the fear that these games weren't as great as I had remembered. I was relieved to find out that Homeworld holds up to the test of time and in this remastered version it looks better than ever.The one thing I remembered about Homeworld was the atmosphere which is enhanced ten fold thanks to the remastering. Nothing compares to sending in a large armada full of fighters, corvettes, ion frigates and destroyers against another force of equal measure and watching the battle play out. Fighters whip around in the void dodging fire and letting loose upon the opposition. Destroyers fire heavy volleys of missles and projectiles which crash into the enemy's ranks. Ships flame out and tumble into an explosion when destroyed or in the case of capital ships they spin around and emit a huge fireball complete with debris. When the battle seems lost you can order your remaining fighters to kamikaze in a last ditch attempt to save the mothership. The backdrops are incredibly beautiful and stunning to look at. This remastered edition makes the game look like I remember it looking.Now with all that being said there is a bit of jank. Scripting has a tendancy to break. Movement commands get a little fuddled sometimes. I have had a handful of weird audio bugs as well. The zooming in and out via the mousewheel is a bit weird considering the setting being in 3d space you would think you could just keep zooming out to move the field of view up but you can't. A small amount of other issues have me scratching my head sometimes.Taking all that into consideration Homeworld has always had a special place in my heart. This remastered edition has me skipping and jumping for joy down memory lane as I relive all those massive space battles I remembered having. If you have any reverance for these games buy this edition right now. If this is new to you I encourage giving it a shot. If you aren't hooked before the first two hours of play you can always get a refund through Steam but I am pretty confident if you like space, explosions and strategy you will find a place in your heart for Homeworld as well.

												Homeworld is a space RTS game released in 1999, it gained popularity by not only creating the single most intuitive space strategy mechanic to date, but also had an amazing story line and one of the most beautiful music scores ever. In Homeworld and Homeworld 2, resource management is key, every resource you collect on one mission gets transferred to your next, so it is a good idea to use it wisely, often relying on salvage ships to steal enemy ships over building your own. Space combat is done on a fully 3D plane, where ships can easily move in all 3 axis, which at the time was revolutionary.Gearbox did an amazing job in remastering this great gem, the graphics is amazing, while keeping the story and the music intact the game is truly perfect now. They made some UI and control changes but in the end it results in a smoother gameplay.There are a few minor bugs such as a sound issue with ship engines when too many of them are moving at once, and the tutorial being slightly broken (you get asked to press okay to continue to the next segment but the tutorial continues on as if you already pressed it), however these are minor gripes and does nothing to ruin this wonderful title.My ratings are as follows:Graphics 8Music 10Story 10Gameplay 9 "

												A great revamp of the original and second installationBUTFor me one of the best things about the original was the ability to plan ahead for the enemy fleet - they've given the original Homeworld the same stupid AI as Homeworld 2, meaning whatever fleet you build the AI will counter it appropriately.Sounds good on paper I guess, but makes the game unbelieveable frustrating and even when you win, there's no satisfaction in it.Stick with the original.

												I'm bitterly disappointed in this remaster of Homeworld 1.  Formations are pretty much ignored and tactics...who knows?  The UI is totally revamped, which is for the most part ok.  But the basic gameplay is altered for the worse. The ""classic"" version of Homeworld is exactly that, no upgraded graphics or models.  This was a complete waste of my money.  I may try to get a refund.  I have the original disk from when the game originally launched in 1999.  This remaster adds nothing better.  The remaster just doesn't have the fidelity that the original deserves.  And I was so excited to get this.  What a waste.			"

												Is it a cash grab? Most remasters, absolutely. This remaster, however, shows an incredible amount of care given to the resurrection of a timeless classic, an IP that still has a great deal of potential. In order to make such an incredibly faithful remastering, key artists from the original art team were hired to breath new life into the graphics and the original composer was brought in to touch up the soundtrack. As such, everything has been retouched with an incredible amount of care and respect. True, some mechanics have been changed across both games (the first one most of all). Purists will be disappointed to be missing out on some mechanics, such as strikecreaft fuel, and some missions will be changed somewhat as a result. However, I believe that those omissions that were made in the remastered editions were for the better, in order to create more consistent games over all. I haven't tried them yet, but if you really want the original experience all over again, the Classic versions are bundled along with the rest.Considering all of these things in addition to subtle improvements to the HUD in both games, full modding support, the addition of a steam-supported multiplayer, and even fleshed out options menus, I can say that Homeworld has been reborn and that it can very easily compete with many modern RTS games in terms of immersion, challenge, and depth. With any luck, this will be the jump start that the IP needs as a whole.... and now back to my fleet of salvage ships!			"

												This is a classic remastered! Sure its buggy but what the heck do you expect? They basically took and old classic and added some modern upgrades to it. Almost similar to adding modern parts to an old classic car, you are going to have your ""bugs"" and other issues, but in time you find them, fix them and soon its purring like a kitten (or you run out of money).  I look at it this way. Gearbox brought back this game to give some joy and nostalgia to those that loved this game (and of course make some money). And I am sure that it will be running right in time (fingers crossed). I still enjoy this classic even with the bugs. If you have played the game in the past, I would recommend you to turn a blind eye to the nay say'rs. Go ahead and get the game if you have the itch or wait for the sale.			"

												They could have just retextured the entire set of games.Unfortunately, they tried to fix everything that already worked in Homeworld. Now, with an embarassingly buggy game, Gearbox has succeeded to turn this classic game into garbage. The resourcers get stuck, the AI has no idea how to play, and the formations for ships simply don't work. Even getting to the main menu was a task. My screen turned black and just sat there. Turns out you need to hit the ""Escape"" key just to get to the menu. Remind me how this is an improvement? In addition, they left out Homeworld: Cataclysm (Maybe I was the only one who liked it).Don't buy this garbage until they fix it or if you enjoy what is basically an Alpha version of Homeworld.			"

												This is a classic remastered! Sure its buggy but what the heck do you expect? They basically took and old classic and added some modern upgrades to it. Almost similar to adding modern parts to an old classic car, you are going to have your ""bugs"" and other issues, but in time you find them, fix them and soon its purring like a kitten (or you run out of money).  I look at it this way. Gearbox brought back this game to give some joy and nostalgia to those that loved this game (and of course make some money). And I am sure that it will be running right in time (fingers crossed). I still enjoy this classic even with the bugs. If you have played the game in the past, I would recommend you to turn a blind eye to the nay say'rs. Go ahead and get the game if you have the itch or wait for the sale.			"

												alright, before I begin I want to point out that I played the originals a long time ago. So when This came out, I went on a nostalgia trip. But, I will try my best to be fair in this.First off, They have done an amazing job with the graphical updates. the game is beautiful. The controls are all the same as before, the general system of doing things is the same and that's awesome. My main problem with this is something that was in the originals as well. In the matches, your opponent can infinitely go up or down. with a movement system that they have, that makes pursueing them a hassle.The actual combat is very satisfying, however. when a missile impacts your battlecruiser, there's an actual hole where it hit. so as the battles progress, your ships that have been around for a long time look increasingly battered and bruised. That's a very nice touch.At the end of it, I would definitely recommend this.-----------------Oh, I almost forgot. This has a launcher that allows you to play the classic version of both games. That is a seriously nice touch.			"

												I have not been excited for a video game release for quite some time, but when this was announced I was excited.When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6th mission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me for a long time.This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.  Finally Homeworld still has one of the best stories ever delivered in a RTS, it’s hard to describe it without spoilers so I won’t, but I can’t think of another RTS that does the story aspect this well.An interstellar achievement of a game, thank you Gearbox for bringing it back.

												I played the original game, Cataclysm and HW2 and loved them dearly.  These are some of the games that made me a diehard PC Gamer.  I have tried to reinstall the games over the past few years in an effort to capture some of that nostalgia and joy, when they wouldn't install I thought them lost forever.  When the pre-order came out I jumped at the chance, with a great deal of hope and a bit of anxiety at the prospect of this game coming back. My fear are assuaged, this is a beautiful, truly authentic re-master of the original.  I am so happy that Gearbox took the chance to do this, and more so that they did it right. If you have any reservations about this being worth it, whether you played the original or not, please give it a chance you will not be disappointed. "

												I've played Homeworld and Homeworld 2 several times since their release. With Remastered's release, I find myself fighting the interface more than the enemy.  Certain actions, such as repair, or capture, refuse to target mulitple targets as you could with both of the original games. One-command sending of a swarm of salvage corvettes against a pair of destroyers was one of my joys, which simply can't be done now, to say nothing of the removal of Military Parade formation (an easy way of getting your fleet back under control when it's all scattered) I have repeatedly lost simple battles simply because the revamped interface is so... difficult to work with, compared to the original games. It is non intuitive, unlike the original.Skip this iteration until it's been patched, possibly even a few times.			"

This ambience is destroyed by a weird voice acting.I don't recommend this game until the issues are fixed.			"

												I'm a diehard Homeworld fan, but this ""Remastered"" collection is very disappointing so far in playing my first several hours.  It is riddled with bugs, even more than the original (which is saying something).  Even with Gearbox saying they rewrote the engine, I see some extremely similar issues to the old game.  I can deal with minor change such as ship costs (and apparently Fuel is no longer a resource for Strike craft), and I'm still a fan of the plodding pace and solitary atmosphere, but the issues I'm going to talk about make the price tag of this remake painful to have forked over.  It's amazing this was released in this state and I'm having a hard time believing that much work really went into it.Here is my current laundry list after playing for about 7 hours today (release day):Hotkeys and information.  Some ships have ""special attacks""; good luck finding out what those are or whether they exist, until you find the hotkey for it and try it.  There are no more detailed info panes for ships now, at least that I can find, so you have very limited info on anything's capabilities.  Also, this game causes some kind of interference with system hotkeys... including preventing my ability to use in-game Shadowplay, which is what I use for videos and streaming.  UI for units currently selected is very small, slow and klutzy.Queueing up multiple Research ship pieces will result in only one being built.Capturing and Salvaging problems.  Salvage Corvettes will fight over the same pieces, following each other around.  You cannot tell a group of them to capture a group of enemies either; you must pick them one at a time.  Friendly units will happily open fire on any unit you have in tow, even though it is on its way to the mothership to be assimilated and poses no threat.  Harvesters will also fight with them over carried salvage.  Salvage Corvettes or Harvesters carrying salvage will clump up and prevent each other from delivering anything to a Carrier or Mothership.  Likewise as above, you cannot target groups of salvage to gather with a group of ships; it must be one at a time, or waiting for Harvesters to try and do it on their own.  Finally, a personal gripe; why do they make it hard to distinguish what ships you own after capturing them?  At least they could have changed the color of the exhaust trails or something to make it easier to know what's happening in a battle.Pathfinding.  There are clipping issues and other bits of forgiveable things, but sometimes ships of any kind will lose their minds and do a dance in place until you figure out what direction they need to get free.  When you need groups of ships to engage combat quickly, sometimes they will spend 5-15 seconds trying to recover their formation before they'll engage.  Also, as with the original game, rarely (but comically, at least if you're not playing) a ship you ordered to move (whether part of a group or not) will decide to go off in some completely random direction and will not stop.  Ever.Asteroids.  Oh god, these are horrible... This was always a frustrating level, but now when destroying asteroids, they fade away for a moment, and then slowly create a few dangerous new ones that can't be shot at right away.  The biggest problem there is that you can't select these new ones to attack half the time; if you try, sometimes your idiot ships will just start driving straight into them.  Ships will do no defensive or proactive fire whatsoever against the asteroids.  To boot, when you start the mission, if your carrier ships are on Auto-launch, all your little brittle ships will line up in perfect parade order to get themselves killed.  Finally, when you lose the first dodge-the-asteroid mission, the screen fades to black, but the rest of the game keeps running.  No end screen or anything like that, and you can hear your actions on the keyboard still having effects.Drones.  These little morons will kamikaze into your own ships whenever you activate or deactivate them.  Oh by the way, how do you activate them, you say?  Must be a button or something convenient, right?  Nope:  It's Ctrl-Shift-D.  And you'd never know unless you went through the game options for the key bindings.  I also had issues getting a group of Drone Frigates to respond to this command when deactivating; I often had to do it for each one individually.Repairing.  Pathfinding issues aside, it doesn't appear any Repair Corvettes or Frigates will repair some corvettes that you've captured from the enemy, at least some of the time.  Groups of repair ships will also have the same arguing issues between themselves as Salvage Corvette/Harvesters when trying to patch up the same ship.I'm going to keep playing it to get my money's worth, but I'm afraid I can't recommend this remake at all, as compared to just going out there and getting free or almost-free copies of the original games.  The graphics are much prettier but they aren't mind-blowing for 15 years of progress, and certainly not worth this price.  I'll probably find more issues as I go along, but I'll try to stay optimistic.			"

												The ""remastered"" part is well done. Graphics, UI and all that, but I do not remember this many obvious bugs in the old Homeworld.- My research vessel for example is completly invulnerable. I just had 30 enemy fighters and a Heavy Cruiser (!) firing at it and it just kept repairing itself at about 40% health.- Then there is this shrieking sound that seems to come from Corvette and Frigate class ships. It stays even if you move away. Pausing and continueing the game is a workarround.- Captured Taiidan carriers are somehow unable to build anything. Capturing them is semi-useless that way.- Captured ships seem to play the lottery when it comes to their paintjobs. Some stay in Taiidan-yellow while others shine in Kushan-grey. (Edit: I even got one with pink stripes. YMCA-Cruiser!)And this is just Homeworld 1 to about half the missions. None of it is totally gamebreaking, like CTDs or crashes, but it shows a rather unpolished release.Gearbox also couldn't keep their hands off changing things. For example, Fighters don't require fuel anymore, making the Khadesh fuel ships obsolete. While the reasoning behind this is debateable (probably for HW 1&2 multiplayer compatibility), they were somehow unable to fix lacks in the user commands, for example letting Repair Corvettes guard a group of Salvage Corvettes so that they pick targets to repair automatically. This was okay 15 years ago, but today it feels really really annoying to have to micromanagement everything yourself instead of enjoying the broader strategy game in a true three-dimensional environment.Edit: Okay, now that I played through Homeworld 1 I can only say I'm shocked. This is a typical Gearbox game. The beginning is alright and due to the story events epic, but after about half the game it becomes a static ""move there and jump"". Its like the enemy AI is turned off. At the end I had 7 Heavy Cruisers, not of them built, and also 12 Destroyers. And guess what, the Taiidan rebels gifted me two more, like it wasn't easy enough yet.It was said the enemy fleet scales with what the player has, so I was hoping for an epic battle at the end. What I got was 3 enemy Heavy Cruisers. You can guess how epic that was.Another AI shutdown happend at the giant hyperspace inhibitor 2 missions before the finale. There are three jumpgates which you are supposed to destroy, because they'd send reinforcements otherwise. Thing is, there are no reinforcements, EXCEPT when you go for the gates. But then you are already there to destroy whatever comes through. If you leave the gates in peace, you can do your thing without the AI trying to stop you.This was the easiest RTS I've ever played in 20 years since Dune 2, simply because the AI does absolutly nothing. Combined with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying sound bug, Homeworld Remastered 1 is a complete waste of time!			"

												Much has been written about the improved graphics in the game. The screenshots speak for themselves. But, unfortunately, apart from enchanced graphics there are few positive moments to notice.The in-game speech seems to be recorded anew. I liked Makaan's voice. Fleet Command and Cpt. Soban are good, too. Karan is a bit… not like herself. But you won't probably notice that. Planet Killers theme from the last HW2 mission I've been anticipating the most is just absent. All the other aspects of sound and music are ok.Cutscenes are renedered in 1080p and look just awesome. But the in-game video player is implemented poorly: horrifying lags are obvious, while Media Player Classic plays the same smoothly even at x4 speed, let alone at normal.That is all for the good part. Now the bad part.First, despite nice textures, all the animations and VFx are left as it was. No new interesting additions (such as docking bays holding grip of resource collectors while unloading resource units or a destroyer losing a part of hull being heavily damaged). The repair beams and welding flashes stay as they were, while the soul craves for something more spectacular and immersive. Some of capital ships just don't fit the Mothership docking bay, going through textures. The Junkyard Dog turns ships in space as if they were made of near-weightless thin indestructible cardboard!. Hiigaran miners dock ""through"" Vaygr refineries, piercing the solid metal with antennas. Damage model is exactly as it was in Homeworld 2 — weird and unimpressive. And so on. Nothing positive has been done here since the Classics.Procedure of taking a ""clean"" screenshot is spectacular. To do that, you must manually disable all the HUD elements and deselect all ships, and having taken a screenshot set everything back as it was. All in all, nearly 10 key presses are necesarry to make a screenshot.As the game is about playing, not watching, and the Homeworld series is a thrilling experience to play through, in 20-30 minutes you will completely forget about graphics and concentrate all efforts and attention on gameplay.Hotkeys map seems to remain at the initial state. Most keystrokes are 2 or 3 keys combinations, scattered all over the keyboard without pretty much structuring. Learning and using those is a piano challenge. Nothing has been done to improve the keyboard controls.The campaign felt hopelessly easy. Closer to the end of the game (each one) the resource pool grows to 6-digit magnitude. That causes ""why don't I build a full fleet of these and try them on something hopelessly well defended"" thoughts. The overall state of the campaing indicates that by the time of release no one of the developers had taken a notepad and made a full playthrough of the campaign, marking bugs. When the junkyard Dog at Karos snatches a ship, you are supposed to lose contact with it, but you do not. The ships are supposed to be disabled after that, but sometimes they are not. Sometimes the Dog just tries to place the second ship to where the first is located, thus getting stuck. The Karos Proximity sensors Net is composed of freshly-painted sensors with Hiigaran insignia on them.... I have spotted a swarm of such mistakes during the playthrough.Enemy AI can make a grown man cry. No cooperation between ships is observed, and any signs of intellectual activity within the enemy ranks seem absent. Sending frigates wave after wave into the same minefield is just an example of a typical AI routine. The multiplayer AI seemed a bit better to me. In campaign there is none.Ship behavior is untouched (or even wasted a little). Single corvettes are ineffective (due to special placement of their turrets). That concerns all other ship types as well, so the ships with high coverage ratio are the most powerful ones.  Optimal attack patterns or any means to assign them manually are absent: a bomber can grind a resource collector just standing in one place, but instead it will move at max speed, and on the second run won't shot a single round because of asteroids blocking the shot. So, fighters and corvettes are a pity to watch at (especially single ones, with no squads and poor coverage). Whenever a ship escapes to safety through Hyperspace, rest assured: all your forces will target the enemy base to avenge the humiliation. Repair corvettes and minelayers will go in the lead, as the most agressive and eager to fight. The Gehenna border outpost will be as tough a target for a bomber aqs before: the start of the attack run is a fixed radius, the end is hear the enemy hull. So, the length of the run is negligible here and no real damage will be done. And that is instead of standing and grinding the target. There are worse things. Sometimes resource collectors just get stuck in place cutely blinking the engines instead of mining. Sometimes one of the ships boosts to 4000 speed or so and goes darting to the enemy lines or making enormous circles. My opponent once said his collecors are stuck inside one another and unable to move. Sometimes two corvettes try to repair each other, so they can't dock and go waltzing up to the uppermost boung of the map.  Gravitation Wells do not affect Vaygr corvettes, and Assault fighters had the kamikaze damage compared to a full-sized frigate each (has been corrected on 05-03-2015)The user interface. The only thing I did not expect of it is to get this much worse. The largest button on the screen is ""Menu"" — the button to be used 5-10 times in total. The next one in size toggles sensor view and is never used, as it is bound to the Space key (which is extremely convenient). Right under it is an enormous control group panel that does nothing. Fleet build queue reacts poorly (especially the pause button) and takes 3 keystrokes to open (3 more whenever a build-capable ship is built or lost). The lower right corner is occupied by never-used basic action commands, such as Attack or Move.  Everything listed above and to be listed below is to be scaled manually: extremely small on dtfault and clumsy and self-intersected on larger scales. Build and Research queues provide as few useful information as possible, and have to be scrolled due to the command panel below. Selection and commands do not work near UI objects, selection mechanism is suboptimal, so in combat situations the UI is bound to fail you constantly. Building 50 fighters take 50 clicks. 50 more whenever you change your mind. Overall element placement inUI and credits sequence indicate it has probably been done by a secondary school boy in exchange for a day off school. There is (maybe was corrected on 19-03-2015) a place where one of the names was covered with the white frame around a picture. I haven't even started a talk about possible improvements of the original: robust and fast probe deployment, fast access to compact build options, advanced formation and beharior tweaks (must be implemented in ""real life"", not only on the GUI.Balancing factions is a great work. Great work yet to be done, as the task seems untouched by the developers. This task is in tight relations with ship behavior, so I don't even know where to start. Stealth figters are worth a special mention: being the most advanced Kushan tech, they have less DPS than a scout, move slower, can't hit smaller targets at all, and can't do real damage to larger ones. With feaures this outstanding they should be permanently cloaked without decloak on attack.SUMMARY: to be straight and honest — this is an alpha. Totally raw; loads of aspects haven't received due attention. Multiplayer platform is good and priceless for seasoned players. Textures and models are great. Everything else has been neglected with or spoiled. And it is not the graphics what makes a really good game.			"

												Homeworld 1 is completely broken and not at all like the original. There are numerous bugs in the campaign, and the whole feel of combat is off. It honestly feels like HW1 was a cheap attempt at a port of the missions into a different engine with little attention to the details that made it such a great game.			"

												The only concern I have is that the names of various locations and charaters in Homeworld RM: 2 are inconsistent in their pronunciations.Other than that, everything works together well in the single-player story. The music, however is a work of art in itself. I sit and listen to the soundtrack and it brings back memories of playing the game. (Diamond Shoals, how you torment me!). The modding community is really great, too with the ability to play races from the entire universe. The Kadeshi are the best, though. "

												Feels sloppy. Basic things are broken. B is the hot-key to the build menu, hitting that while it is up does not toggle it. R is the research menu, that does toggle. You can't adjust the mouse sensitivity.I try move actions 5 times before it works.The only way repairing seems to work is to select what you want to heal and then right click on the ship that repairs. There is an action for repair, it doesn't seem to do anything.Not much is explained. A formation is good is all the tutorial says. Good for what? Why are there different ones?Why can't I select all ships of the same type?I'm not going to fight a game to play it.			"

												Simpy put, Excellent game(s). While the originals were epic in their own right, the remastered version changes interface, the graphics (including new features like ""battle scars""), and several bug fixes. Plus, it doesn't change the story (at least  didn't notice any changes). another thing, is that it adds the ability to play both the first gen units AND the second gen units, in the same match. So those players that do the whole ""oh, X Gen was better than X Gen"". you can literally, fight them with those units to settle the score. Another thing is that thier are plenty of mods that change the way the game looks. that way, if you don't like the interface or the way an icon/emblem/ect looks, you can change it.			"

												I bought this under the assumption that the original game engine is intact, and that this is only a gfx overhaul. However, the game physics is dumbed down, the true projectiles of the original game is replaced by dumb dice rolls to calculate damage, and the formations are broken. Shame on you, Gearbox, and shame on you, reviewers like Total Biscuit and others who had only words of praise for this game.			"

												As I have never played the original Homeworld series before, my comments made here are based on my feelings playing this game as a new player, and not on whether this is a good remake of the original series.In this game, basically what the player needs to do is pretty much like all the other RTS games, such as harvesting the resource, creating a fleet, researching new technology, defending the mothership, and destroying all enemy spaceships, etc.The differences between this game and other RTS games include:1) There is only one type of resource in this game. It's simple but quite boring.2) The battlefield is in the outer space; there is no topographic features of any kind in this game. That is, no roads, no lakes, no mountains, no nothing to speed up or slow down the moving speed of your units. Futhermore, you can't hide behind anything to dodge fire; you can't plan ambush; and you can't make a detour or anything. You just go directly toward the enemy then fight, and so is the enemy. 3) When you assign multiple units in a fleet, you can specify its formation. However, there is no tutorial or hints to tell you what are the advantages and disadvantages of each formation. In fact, after several hours of play, I still have no idea at all whether the selection of formation will affect the attacking or defending ability of the fleet or not.4) Although the player can command a specfic unit to attack a selected enemy, normally you won't have time to do so, as you cannot pause the game and there are simply too many enemy to target and you got so many spaceships to control. As a matter of fact, the program always hung up whenever I continuously move my units around the map. I'm not sure whether it's the problem of my computer (which I bought around a year ago to perform some computationally intensive numerical simulation) or there actually is a bug in this program. As a result, all I did in this game was to produce spaceships, group them as a fleet, assign them to attack, then they will move straightforward to the enemy to kill or get killed.5) The strength of your enemy in each mission is scaled to match the strength of your army at the end of previous mission. You are triumphant to have won a tremendous victory in a mission? You probably won't laugh for long because in the next mission a much stronger enemy is waiting to greet you. 6) The research is boring too. There is no such thing as tech tree in this game. Basically you just click on the research tab whenever the game tells you that there is a new tech available for you to research. And in maybe 30 seconds, the system informs you that the research is completed, and then, you are done. Oh, I almost forget to mention that they didn't even bother to design the icons for the technologies. It's just a text box; you click on the box whenever the system reminds you to do new research.Of course there are some nice features that enable the game to have received an overwhelmingly good review from the players. However, if I were to know those game settings/features as listed above, I would not waste my time or money on this remastered game.			"

												Only buy this if u never played Homeworld and wanna try Homeworld originals(not the ""remastered"" ones).Why ?Because the ""remastered"" games lack many important features and has so many mechanics bugs you are gonna spend wholesessions trying to fix what units are supposed to do.Exemples :-I wanna capture this nice Cruiser, so i order my ships to NOT fire at it...FAIL : the ""passive"" order is broken, so they fire at it""'cose he shot at us yeah""(which is how DEFEND posture is supposed to work, not ""passive"") and explode it while i was reaching 95% capture ...-I finaly manage to capture the nice cruiser, good i ll use it against my enemy !...FAIL : Game isnt happy ""because u got one more than dumb programmed fleet limitations allows"", so...PUFF! it disappears when next mission begins !to resume, they kept the worst flaws from original Homeword2 and broke the good mechanics the game had...In fact, after 1h game, u realize they made this game-remake to grab $ , not for gamers fun, not to improve Homeworld games : they are the exact OPPOSITE of Relic Team's spirit, back in the 90's.

												FULL OF BUGS and Original Homeworld 1 Gameplay mechanics removed. WAIT FOR THEM TO FIX IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT !!!Both of these things turn what should be a beautiful remaster into a frustrating game.List of bugs in order of appearance:Level 1 - Game camera Went BLACK permanently after a cutscene. I had to restart the level. (This was like 4 minutes into the game, seriously Gearbox have you never heard of BETA TESTING !!!)- 2nd Resource collector I built dissappeared on level 1 after I sent it to harvest some resources. THERE ARE NO ENEMIES ON THAT LEVEL !!!- When the game asks you to stop a Turnanic Carrier from escaping, I destroyed it promptly and it said MISSION FAILED and the Hyperspace button appeared to complete the mission but I could only use the restart the mission button....- Encounter with Bentusi to trade. Bentusi ship and Mothership have a Star Trek esque standoff right in front of each other. This blocks your Mothership from undocking Capital class vessels from its 'side door', so had the mobile resource unit I just built stuck for about 10 minutes.- Support ships fail to dock with resource collectors resulting in a very bizzare dance of the 2 ships which left both ships blown up on the Radiation field level.- Black Camera AGAIN !!!! when you're on the edge of the Homeworld system to destroy a hyperspace inhibitor. Yet another Mission restart.I haven't even completed the game yet but I believe that this prompt review/WARNING was warranted.This severe lack of bug testing tells me that the game was hurried into release, whereas all other assets point to what should be an amazing remake. The Retextures and new graphics look spectacular and really do look amazing.This game needs some serious patching and even more bug testing.			"

												Homeworld. It used to be considered one of best RTS's ever made set in space combat. After it was remastered it still is one of best RTS's ever created. I have never played original games, bought the game during recent steam sale. Money well spent. The game is just amazing. Homeworld 1 Remastered feels like one is playing Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009). On the other hand Homeworld 2 Remastered is more of war story while keeping up mysticism of 1st game.First thing I can tell you now the game is not easy, You need to learn its controls and how it works otherwise you will keep loosing. When you learn ropes of the game its extremely pleasant to play and most importantly enemy will still outnumber you, i.e. in 2nd game the enemy will have 10 battlecruisers while you have a cap allowing you to build 2 bc's. Quite unfair considering their firepower but frigates are perfect cannon fodder for that :PStory of two games is just amazing, both cause you feel rush and despair. Graphics in comparison to original game imporved really well fitting modern standards (including 4k if u can handle it). The soundtrack is purely amazing and is used in appropriate moments to affect us as players when necessary. Adagio for Strings choral by Samuel Barber is actually one of most beautiful songs ever created in our history. Yes, its used in best moments in the Homeworld 1 Remastered! Other soundtrack is also amazing but this very specific song is purest masterpiece of all, Gameplay. It's great. Cant say anything more. Combat is balanced, fights are challanging and its easy to loose if you're not using the thing in ur head at all. This is defiently not casual game where you hop in and immediately become a god in it (like designers of modern games do nowadays with games is just wrong!) Nothing beats sight of full scale fleet vs fleet combat. Bloody yet stunning.Homeworld Remastered Collection is great offer. You get 4 games (2 original + 2 remastered games) and if you are considering to buy it, do not hesitate. You will not regret spending your money on the game (sale or normally). Right now I feel like a thief for buying on summer sale. This game is worth way more than I've paid for it. I feel like I want to keep returning to the game to play it over and over. It is that good, great replayability value and satisfaction from it.To sum things up:+ Nicely improved graphics that fits modern standards+ Masterpiece soundtrack (and im quite hard to impress with music)+ Great Gameplay and replayability value+ Great story that actually makes you feel desperate, in rush+ Want more!+ Not casual...- ... which for some console peasants will be a bad thing.- some bugs - not well explained graphic settings in the video settings			"

												Experience so far with HW1:R     1. Played tutorial to brush up on game. Computer would proceed to next step without me hitting the proceed button. Fixed that by enabling subtitles. Oddly, received achievement for finishing HW2:R tutorials.     2. Had to restart mission 3 three times as my salvage frigates were on enemy fighter but would not bring it back to mothership. If I would not already own and have played the originals, would never have known this was a mission advancement bug.     3. Destroyed enemy carrier at end of mission 4, game went to mission failed, yet computer was telling me I completed it and the hyperspace button was showing behind the mission failed window. Did entire mission again and it worked.     4. Stopped playing at this point, as I didn't want to waste time playing and hitting another mission advancement bug. Will definately keep going, but knowing that is a possibility is a turn off.     Is it fun? Yes. Does it look good? Yes. Does it(and by that I mean HW1:R) feel like it wasn't fully tested and rushed? Yes.      I bought two copies. One for me and one for my son. We both had same issues on two different computers.      Should you buy? Up to you. I got my codes off Amazon for less than Steam's preorder pricing, after release, and after I read great reviews. Would I buy again? Knowing what I know now, I would wait for it to go on sale. But that's just me. Hopefully they will fix the bugs.     That being said, as I said before, it IS fun, but knowing I might hit an advancement bug ruins some of that enjoyment. Graphic bugs, etc., I can accept, but not something that keeps the game from moving forward.     Edit: Finished mission 5 without a glitch, although it seems much easier than the original. Just basically spammed and sent ships out to the enemy. No real tactics involved other than that.			"

If you turn it off the fighters launch after jump anyway. Fighters/Corvettes won't all fit into the mothership (no carriers yet). Attack groups develope ""strays"" that don't move. Ships fall out of formation. Resource collector goes dormant from time to time.  Ships won't target asteroids in the mission after GW. No way to tell how many fighters in a group above 24. I've played the old Homeworld numerous times on much worse computers and never came upon any of these glitches.Sorry, the enhanced graphics aren't worth the agravation.

												I didn't play the originals like many reviewers have and have just completed the H1:R campaign, havent even touched the second one yet. I will post a review of HW2:R seperately.I will start off by saying I only leave reviews in cases of extreme, has to be so good or so bad to illicit a review. This game is definitely not the latter. I have played many RTS games through my life and very few were able to tell such a tale as well  as this one has. The journey was enthralling and gripping and has so many interesting events along the way. The combat is great and while the scenery leaves room for improvemnet it is hardly missed when your fleet engages the enemy and capital ships trade blows while fighters and corvettes dance through a three dimensional space. I enjoyed every mission many of which had different obstacles and goals to keep you interested and sometimes force you to use very different approaches, spamming a ton of two units wont get you far like many RTS out there. A must buy for anyone who enjoys RTS or space games, seriously get it.11/10 would make the journey again.			"

												There is a single reason i cannot reccomend this game. Dynamic difficulty. What is that? You have ships of total power 5, the next encounter has enemy ships of 7 power. You have total power 7? The encounter will be of power 9. You have 10 power? You go against enemy power 13. And so on. You always deal with a supreme force. A fleet equal to yours and somewhat better to counter the human brain superiority against CPU AI.The main supportive idea behind that is that you cannot focus on build a massive fleet and win by numbers. You have to use 'real strategy' and 'real tactics' to win. At least that is what they majority of fans are saying.Well i disagree. And the reason is simple. Firstly, i beat the game and without any save-load-try again stuff. Not a big deal, most players can do, if not they need some retries and that is all. Really, since when load and retry is a deep strategy and tactic?!?! On top of that, why build a lot of ships? The game does not count your stored resources for adjusting difficulty. You go with few ships, face few ships, build a few more and keep going. If that is strategy and tactic i am Napoleon.Not to mention the salvage corvette thing. Two corvette class ships can disable and salvage a frigate (and larger classes) but 2 combet class corvettes cannot take down a frigate. The salvage class ships would make sence if they salvage disabled or heavy damaged ships. This looks like a cheat to me and not a tactic.To make a long story short, do not build many ships, have 2-4-6 and so on salvage corvs, build few ships after the encounter has spawned and you are good for the entire game. Do not use your resources to build ships in advance before you hyperspace. 'To be prepared' obviously is not this game's motto. 'Play dead' is more like it.Nice experience from a view, i do not rememeber any other RTS punishing the hard prepared folks.			"

												The good:Using a Win 7 gaming rig, the game looks gorgeous, plays exactly as the old games did and I'm having ZERO issues (so far). Exactly what Homeworld should be.The bad:At launch point there seems to be a few complaints in the forums that Win 8 and higher machines are having issues of various types and certain bits of high end hardware are causing issues. I'm sure these problems will be patched asap but it is noteworthy if you are using newer PCs. In short, maybe hold off a little till it's patched.Personally I could not be happier with the game. Gearbox delivered and hopefully they rebuild Homeworld into the game series it deserved to be, It's certainly gives me hope that more classic games will be picked up and remastered for the modern gamer (such as xwing + tie fighter titles).

												I've been a huge RTS fan for the longest time, since I was but a mere child. I played Empire Earth, Age of Empires, Sins of a Solar Empire, the original Starcraft and, last but not least, Homeworld 1 & 2 and Cataclysm. I adore these types of games. I live, breathe these types of games, but recently there has been such a drought of RTS games, except the phenomenal Grey Goo. But here, here we have it; the pinnicale of the past; one of the greatest games remastered and available on a digital platform. I can only exclaim, YES.Now, that my rant is over. I wanna name a few of my favorite aspects of Homeworld. Firstly, the music is to die for. It's glorious, epic, space ambient music with new age singing overlapping. As a huge fan of music, but mostly of metal, I can say this OST rivals many classics. The visuals are another strong point, there's something to be said about a game that can make spaceships docking into a hull fun to look at and experience, and the awesome ""focus"" feature which allows you to zoom in to see battles close up. The style/aesthetic is another fantastic point, sci-fi RTS games are rare but this one is easily one of the best. Most of all, though, I love the story. The story is a breathtaking space opera of epic proportions, it offers questions and makes an imagination run wild, it makes you sad and unkempt, but picks you right back up more hopeful than ever. It's a rollercoaster.This version isn't complete yet, though, since bugs are rather rampant. I hope Gearbox takes heed and fixes 'em but be warned, this game still has some problems/glitches. I will omit this paragraph as soon as these are fixed.That said, BRB, gonna relive my childhood.			"

It's simplicity and complexity, atmosphere, brilliant story, and a work of art immersive soundtrack!But I feel we are missing 2 things:1. Homeworld Cataclysm 2. Official soundtrackWhere are they?!

												An unexpected example of a remake done right, other companies should take notes. The game looks beautiful, it runs great on low-end systems too, lower than the minimum specified specs.They are rewritting the multiplayer code as BETA goes, which means it will be less and less laggy, it's already much better compared to originals.  There is workshop support.You also have the original versions included working on modern O/S if you are truly nostalgic. I think it's useless to further comment about what this game is and how it plays, since we all played it years ago already.Totally worth the price. You should buy it already.			"

												I bought this when it was in the Autumn sale, hoping for a better, more up-to-date experience than the original. Both the remastered and original versions are included. The graphics are indeed very good but then it goes downhill... The audio (music) is very similar but some of the voices have been altered - I prefer the originals. On my original PC this pushed the limits performance-wise so I was pleased when I could now push everything up to 11 - and it all worked well (only occasional crashes). But what has utterly ruined it is the interface. It's clunky, some of the key combinations dont work when they are supposed to, the key bindings have changed from the original game - and some of them cant be re-assigned. Coupled with the lack of *Military (the default) ship formation for setting up squadrons, this makes it sooo hard to play and keep track of everything. I gave up after a couple of hours and got my money back (thanks to the Steam refund policy).I'f you've never played Homeworld you may like it and you would accept it as it is, not knowing any better. Unfortunately if you remember the original as fondly as I do then you are likely to be dissapointed.*You can get the Military formation by docking then re-launching all your ships immediately - but its a faff.

												Seeing how this game's price has completely crashed during the Autumn sale, I figured I would add in my own two cents.My dad introduced me to the original Homeworld when I was about 7 years old. That was about 13 years ago, and even after playing every single spaceship-related game I could get my hands on, I never found anything which went into quite as much depth with story, lore and gameplay as Homeworld. Now believe me I was just as hyped as the next person when Homeworld: Remastered was announced - in fact my dad would tell you I nearly brought the ceiling down with my enthusiasm, especially when I discovered that it was Gearbox, well-known for producing the Borderlands series (which I am also a HUGE fan of) was in charge of spearheading the project and bringing it to us. When it came out I didn't really see much of the shtick it got for myself, but after taking more time to play it since I have unearthed its little issues that the original game lacks. The good thing about this though is that you get the original games bundled with the remastered versions, so if the Remastered versions' issues become a bit much for you, you can easily revert to them to take a break. Now I'll give a breakdown of my own personal pros and cons, make of them what you will!PROS - - The game is, of course, remastered - graphically speaking, the game is stunning - the lighting is perfection, the backgrounds of matches are perfect, and the various ships look beautiful with their new models - the frigates even have moving turrets, which I think was lacking in the original game. There is not a single flaw in the graphical side of the remastering, at least in my opinion.- The campaigns for both games have remained pretty much untouched - but a new GUI allows for easier interaction with the game world and better control over what comes into your mothership and what leaves it. - The ship upgrade system located under the research section allows players to upgrade the stats of their various ships, including damage, defense, health and occasionally speed. They can also be used to teach some ships new abilities. In the campaign mode you are limited to when you get these upgrades however as many of them tie into the story in various ways.- The addition of mod support, although often shaky at times, does allow for the addition of custom races, ship logos, maps and I think even gameplay modes. Some of these mods can even be used in online play, which I think is fantastic. - While the original Homeworld soundtrack has been left untouched and rightly so, the Homeworld 2 soundtrack recieved a remastering which has drastically improved the sound of its music, which was in the original game something of a partial failure (Some of the songs sounded shoddy or rushed for example but these issues have been fixed in the remastered soundtrack).- The lore is extensive and beautiful for this game, but many people are often unaware of this without having access to the original Homeworld manual, which was a hand-me-down from my dad which I still read regularly. The details contained within the manual are available on the Homeworld wikia for those who are curious about learning the extensive background of this universe, as much of it isn't actually mentioned in-game or at least not in a way that some people would really understand or remember. CONS - - The original game didn't have any bugs or glitches that I can remember. This one has a great deal of them, however - simple things like unresponsive ships, the occasional crash and other silly things you could perhaps expect from a game, but still annoying due to how flawless the original felt. - Mods often deselect themselves and don't load after being used in-game for only one match. Sometimes mods don't work at all or crash the game, which is appearntly a very common occurrence.- The patches do help but often don't fix the really important issues, such as common issues with multiplayer and mods.- Some gameplay aspects that people really enjoyed were for some reason removed, such as the ability to Salvage (why they even bothered leaving the poor little Salvage Corvette in the game is beyond me, considering that in the main storyline of Homeworld 1 they are practically useless after the 3rd chapter now and just sit there collecting dust until destroyed by enemies) and also the need to refuel ships. While I actually think of this as a good thing, there have been complaints about it and I can imagine that for some people it must have taken some of the survivability element away from them. - Although I have no solid proof at this time, I've heard that there are serious issues with multiplayer on occasion. Multiplayer also allows you to play as any of the races from the two games, which in some cases could be a little unfair as the races from Homeworld 2 have packs of Interceptors rather than one Interceptor per construction (just an example, I know there are others too), as well as having better ships overall. Overall I'd say this game is worth its sale price, but maybe is only worth its true retail price to the hardcore fans who will appreciate it and can ignore its flaws indefinitely. Also another tip: If you are one of the owners of the original CD of the game which came with the soundtrack on CD, you don't need to buy the Homeworld 1 Remastered Soundtrack. It's literally the same music. If your CD is still around or in good condition, use that instead and save your money :P However the Homeworld 2 Remastered Soundtrack is different from the original as stated above and is very much worth the money in my opinion.

												Really fun Blanced Game. The game as it stands currently looks great, easy to learn and just all around fun to play with your friends or to changllege yourself. But some of the con's are once one side or the other really gets a supeiror fleet up it ends up being a snowball effect unless you are good with hitting them where they don't expect it or if you have a friend to back you up. Also the game really acts like a rock, paper, sissors game with the fact that each ship class is good against other ship classes. But don't let that get you down about the game, it is still a load of fun to play and the more people we get the more people we will have to mod the living H out of it to make the game even better.

												After falling in love with the original game, I jumped at this when it became availible.  The redesigned interface and beautiful storyline and game engine is such a joy.  I played a few missions from the single player campaign and heard there were a lot of bugs (I bought it day one) that I put it away and played other games until I was told by some friends when it had been fixed.Well, I reloaded this game a week ago and wow, what a difference.  Totally a train wreck of a game now.  The game 'dynamically' creates an enemy that will just curb stomp you no matter how well you build up.  The more you build up, the worse the enemy force will attack you.  Players have few choices now on how to approach the enemy.  This current game (single player campaign) is horrible.  Only one tactic can be used, you have to 'steal' as many of the higher end ships in order to win the objective.  Rubbish game now and stupid design since you can not adjust the difficulty even if you just want to 'learn' this, now lame, game.What a shame, the story is what made this game great.  If you prevent new players from experience it, you might as well close the store.Avoid this game like the palague...			"

												Homeworld is a very niche game. If you like space battles and want to see the absolute best there is on offer from any game to be frank, you'd want this game. The actual game itself here is a bit of a rough diamond. The gameplay involves a spherical map where you can move your ships in basically any direction up or down as well as in the horizontal plane, which in theory would open up tactics and such. In practice, its mostly a minor annoyance, for all it is technically impressive. It is tactically useless, for the most part. You could the vast scope of the map, particularly its height to hide, but hiding is never practical to be honest - unless you're gimping yourself against the AI and carefully setting it up,  you're not making a battlestar galactica style comeback if you get smashed early on. The gameplay boils down to who has the best fleet and the best target acquisition.  You select everything, and send it into the fray all at the same time and then click the enemy to death. The aesthetics are really down to your taste but personally I hate the design of the HW2 ships pretty much across the board while the Kushan in HW1 are in the same boat as looking awful (fighters look like flying ice cream tubs)  the Taidann look far more convincing and the only ships I really enjoy looking at. The NPC races in the campaign look pretty atmospheric and fitting as well. The HW1 campaign is in the vein of traditional RTS games, where there are some missions with some absurd challenge that you need to try multiple times, which is a double edged sword but I think generally it works. It makes the game more interesting and about learning rather than turtling and then sending the biggest possible fleet at something. If you want the best experience, I'd never reload a save, (but you will spend hours waiting for resources to collect or fleets to build) and the reason for this is that with the gimmicky missions there's generally a key lesson that you'll learn or figure out on the first go, so the second attempt is really easy. In one mission, you'll find your small craft will almost always get wiped out due to overwhelming firepower. The solution is to just dock them in your carrier/mothership. Units carry over between missions. In the original game, this meant that if you spent hours waiting to collect all resources before moving on, you'd have a significant advantage in the next mission. In remastered, you get all resources all over the map at the start of the next mission. There's a clear reason why Gearbox has made this change but it makes the last few levels ♥♥♥♥ easy.The last 2-3 missions stop being unique like this and essentially become move and attack fests where you move your death fleet across the map and slowly destroy everything. The enemy fleets don't scale well to your own superfleet that is carried between missions and just about the most challenging large fleet action is in one later mission  where you effectively have to leave a small force of  capital ships behind to defend your mothership from flankers while you win the mission.HW2's campaign is better designed such that a few of these problems are less significant or non-existent. The difficulty is more consistent throughout unlike in the first game where the difficulty is far worse at the beginning of the campaign. The story elements in both games aren't anything overwhelmingly special but are pretty decent and get the job done. In terms of the remastered elements, Gearbox didn't totally screw it up, but they did do a pretty ♥♥♥♥ poor job. If, like me, you have a fairly new AMD card with the latest drivers, you can't play either of the classic games as they will instantly CTD on launch. This issue has been around for several months and hasn't been fixed, and likely won't ever be fixed.  One graphical issue I've seen involves ships becoming completely see-through. This has been around since release and hasn't been fixed definitively, though there is a solution - its as overwhelming basic as changing the properties on the HW shortcut, so its pretty pathetic that its still around. In terms of campaign bugs, some missions or objectives fail to complete and particularly the infamous asteroid mission has artificial difficulty stemming from the stupidity of the pathfinding AI literally flying into rocks, and the long pause between being able to target split up asteroids. One of the main reasons you may want to get it is because of the brilliant mods made for classic that are being ported to remastered (though extremely slowly - none of the major ones have yet made the transition) that literally serve to make Homeworld a platform for simulating any space warfare universe imaginable. There's Freespace 2, Halo, BSG, Star Wars, Star Trek, even Wing Commander amongst other things. I'd say the game is still worth getting on sale, even despite all these faults. There is a net gain in enjoyment from playing this game, though be warned if you have an AMD card.  I'd give the game about a 7/10 on a scale where 5 is *the* average game, and not an ""average game"".  "

												I'm only a few hours in, but wow. I never played the originals, despite being 31 years old and owning an extensive collection of games in all genres. Somehow, this series completely passed me by. After two solid hours of playing the remastered version of the first game, I am in love. The UI and controls are intuitive and smart, and the game systems are rock solid. To anyone in my situation contemplating whether or not this is worth the money, I'd say go for it. What truly makes this stand out to me is that it feels like a space opera. The story has grabbed me right from the get-go, and the immersion is like nothing I've ever experienced before. What really does it, in my view, is that with each new mission/objective, you keep your fleet and resources throughout the campaign. I don't know of another RTS game which does this anywhere near as well. The game feels like a journey home, and reminds me of the (later) 2006 series, Battlestar Galactica. It's fantastically written, the soundtrack is incredible and the world feels gigantic.Probably the best <£30 game I have bought in years. Very, very highly recommended.			"

												Itt's good for what it is. Fairly bug ""free"" and very well optimized. BUT the remastered first game, Homworld, is pretty un true to it's roots. It's the liittle thing that totally change the wayy it plays and thus the overall experience. Formations are UTTERLY useless, fighters degrade into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ sworm of bees instead of attacking in formation. There are no longer any ""stances"" which determine how ships fight while IN a fight. They only inform what they do while not fighting. Which is totally useless. I'd say buy it if it's on sale. You can find plenty of information on how many things have changed in the porting of the first Homeworld into the Homeworld 2 engine, which was regarded by most fans as inferior. While I appreciate the revival of the series and did have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun with the game these little things still irk me. Let alone the 2 original games that come with the title STILL do not work for me. Won't even launch.EDIT: It's clear what I was saying about HW 1 being totally different from original in terms of how ships operate. As devs spent nearly a year patching in the best fix possible. I thank the devs for their dedication to trying to get it right. Muchh appreciated and I will now purchase any and all games from them that I'm interested in. Game works MUCH better now too. Strike craft will actually form up sphherical formations around enemies now. Instead of doing straffing runs. And around friendly ships. The original games also launch now.			"

Its one of the few games that I won't mind going back in to spend a few extra hours in every now and then. I also won't mind replaying the single player campaigns again and again. p/s: If you haven't purchased this game and planning to purchase this, then you should get the prequel homeworld: deserts of kharak (out in jan 2016) and get homeworld:remastered free as a preorder bonus.

												Lack of time management makes the game slow and boring (I play while watching TV, or playing another game on console, pausing between commands).  Actually, I'm writing this review while doing some manoeuvres in game.On a technical point of view : The tutorial is bugged. The controls do not always answer as expected (ie: selecting a carrier selects the mothership instead ? And goes back working normally a few reloads.)On the good, it's pretty and the music are nice.			"

												Outstanding space strategy game.I'm not real big on scifi geared games, however this gem is too good not to pass up. Gorgeous visuals, intense space battles, and great mod support that allows many different reskins (Star Wars, Star Gate, Star Trek, BattleStar Galactica, etc.) all which improve the longevity of this title.I highly recommend this title.

Great soundtracks and the story is something different for this type of game.Great gramphics gr8 gramplay.Intresting units, some are alittle usless, then there are the battleships, the sexiest things.Mechanics are pretty good, I havent even tried the second one, which a friend said is way better.Skirmishes are ok, I would stick with the story, way more entertaining.Multiplayer is...you know, its one of those games.Ill edit later, I dont care.

												This game was a unique concept for a RTS or a mobile fleet as base, you don't make buildings, you make ships and can move or ""teleport"" you fleet around the map at your convenience, make an entire new word of RTS possibility there.Took long enough for this game get to Steam, but the Remastered edition is just great, a must have for any old Homeworld fans and a game that any RTS fan should try.

												When I was a tiny child, all I could do was just play the original Homeworld, and I played it every day for hours on end. I finished the campaign maybe only twice, though. On account that I wasn't very good at strategy at the time. When I found out that they made a second game, I also quickly got that one, and played it just as much, although I was never able to finish it at the time. In time, I moved onto other games, and I have long since lost the disks for both of these games.Every once in a while, I would check up on the status of the IP for the Homeworld series and would always be disappointed when I saw that it was tossed between companies, never to have a third game in the series. However, once I found out that it ended up with Gearbox and that they were going to be doing a remaster, I was ecstatic. At the time, many people were upset with the fact that Gearbox, who don't have a very good reputation with games, ended up with the franchise. I found no reason to doubt how good it would be, though. They would have actually TRIED to ruin a legitimate remaster in order to make it bad.Once the game came out, I quickly pre-ordered, and discovered that it lived up to expectations. Some parts were lacking, including tactics and some balance issues with multiplayer (to be expected. it's still a beta!) but besides that, the rich story was all the same. It still holds the special place in my heart as my favorite game series ever, and I'm excited to see where Gearbox goes with this next (I'm so excited for Sands of Kharak.)tl;dr: This game is very good. Please buy it. It's truly a classic and its story is incredibly rich and I recommend it to everyone!			"

												When remastered came out it was an insta-buy for me. For those who have not played homeworld before, you should definitely buy it if you like space ships and epic space battles. Its one of the few games that I won't mind going back in to spend a few extra hours in every now and then. I also won't mind replaying the single player campaigns again and again. p/s: If you haven't purchased this game and planning to purchase this, then you should get the prequel homeworld: deserts of kharak (out in jan 2016) and get homeworld:remastered free as a preorder bonus.

												This game is absolutely amazing. If this had released in 2015 for the first time and not as a remaster you wouldnt ever know. The graphics are amazing, better than sins for sure. Watching turrets independently target different enemies is an epic sight. As for strategy, there is a lot more flexibility than traditional ground based RTS's. For instance in a multiplayer battle I played today, I immediately constructed a mobile refinery, and placed it where my mothership was. Then I proceeded to fly my mother ship straight up way out of sight, and then flew it over my enemies base and built up a massive fleet above them. They wiped out my resource collecting spot but I had already pumped out several Heavy Cruisers and had plenty of RU's to spare. Thinking I was done they fought my teammates. I then sent about 100 fighters,25 corvettes, 2HC's, some destroyers, and my frigates away from my mother ship and then descended on them in order to hide the true position of my ship. I completely wiped out one of the players, but by this time I was the last alive on my team and they searched endlessly for my position. Well...turns out one of my resource collectors survived and decided to return to base from across the map and through enemy territory but I didnt notice it. It was at this time, thinking I was safely hidden, I went to get a drink. I came back to see the resource collector being followed by an enemy fighter squadron right to my mothership. Shortly thereafter 3 enemy battlecruisers hyperspaced in, right next to it and quickly ended my existence in a glorious flash of light...But it was awesome. Buy this game!			"

What I liked:  3D space RTS ( no other game does this well or at all)  Captures the theme of space to a nice degree ( think 2001 space odyssey if it was a game)  The balance of the game ( advanced rock paper scissors style)  The soundtrack has some great relaxing tribal instrumental music  Your fleet carries from beginning to end(no other game does this, why haven't they it's so cool)What You Need to Know:  Played this when I was a kid( but this review is not biased because of nostalgia)  Game is very slow paced and story isn't strong at all ( big maps don't help this either)  No branching tech tree, just simple upgrades to new tech  Flanking is real in this game, 3D flanking bro  This game is so easy to understand, and isn't like a 4X stratergy game  All units have counters, it's not asymmetricMy Score:A+Paid: $14 HW 1 completed in:  11 hoursHW 2 completed in:  8 hoursGames similar:   Supreme Commander   Star Wars Empire at War Shallow Space Improvements and Changes in the sequel
 Game speed is way faster as units move faster  Squadrons are now used for anything smaller than a frigate ( makes game easier to manage, and more epic)  You use boarding ships to capture and some units gain abilities that gets rid of some ships  You get a villian now, but the mission designs to me are just kill everything on map, ( less unknown suprises )  Research and upgrading is improved with small upgrades every ship, instead of just tech upgrades to unlock new shipsI know the first game is very slow, if you don't like it. Just skip it and go to the second one. You don't want to miss the best space RTS do you			"

												I don't usually bother reviewing  games on steam but this one ugh the graphics are very good but the control system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥ed there is a bug in the outskirts of kharak if you send in a salvage collector before fleet command tells you then the mission doesn't complete and you have to do it all over again and in the diamond shoals your ships just fly straight into the asteroids and what happened to evasive maneuvers?  The rain of death from sphere and claw formation has gone and the ships don't seem to stay in formation properly either and sometimes if you change the formation of one group the other groups change formation as well.. weird.  All sorts of details just annoy.

												Thank you Gearbox for staying true to the game. The remastered edition is BEAUTIFUL. It also does NOT take away from the original games at all. If anything it makes it more glorious. Any true fan of the homeworld games would do themselves a service by grabbing this game. Heck if you don't like the remastered versions you can play the originals!Epic. Simply Epic.If you have never played homeworld, what you get is a FANTASTIC story, with great game play and a really cool skirmish vs cpu modes. 3d space strategy at it's finest. This is a must own for any strategy gamer.			"

												Not much can be said - if you're an old game and played Homeworld in the past, you'll love how much this game has improved. This is a remastering that actually adds considerable quality to the game.Add to that that the game's single player, originally, was fantastic, and that all the best parts of Homeworld 1 and 2 have remained since then, then this is an auto-buy if you ever played or liked the originals.It's not here, but I wish Homeworld: Cataclysm was in this collection- and that is my only regret- though I still purchased it knowing that.

												As someone who has never played any of the original Homeworld games, I can't comment on the changes made and if they are bad or good. That said, this game is amazing! Stunning models and graphics, great story and cut-scenes, and easy to learn controls are just the tip of the iceberg.  The skirmish mode lets you play with huge fleets in large scale wars which is a blast. The great mods being uploaded to the Steam Workshop only enhance that experience.While some people, probably most of the veteran players, dislike that both games in the collection (HW1 and HW2) are built in the HW2 engine, as a newcomer to Homeworld, I felt it made the whole experience more intuitive.  The transition between the two games was easy as it all felt the same. Two seperate engines might has disrupted the flow as players who just got accustomed to HW1's engine would now have to figure out the small changes made in HW2 and force a change in their mindset.All in all, an amazing, amazing game.

												I don't usually bother reviewing  games on steam but this one ugh the graphics are very good but the control system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥ed there is a bug in the outskirts of kharak if you send in a salvage collector before fleet command tells you then the mission doesn't complete and you have to do it all over again and in the diamond shoals your ships just fly straight into the asteroids and what happened to evasive maneuvers?  The rain of death from sphere and claw formation has gone and the ships don't seem to stay in formation properly either and sometimes if you change the formation of one group the other groups change formation as well.. weird.  All sorts of details just annoy. So totally annoyed but I should have listened to my own advice - don't buy rehashed franchises of games that have been played down to the wire if they do this to cataclysm that is what it will be.  ♥♥♥♥♥ with my keys man!

												Homeworld.This is a game I enjoyed a lot playing the game for the first time, the brilliance of the attack plan which included jumping straight into the enemy (a friend who has never let me forget this) every single ship I owned. This was immediately followed by ""wait. Mayber that wasn't such a good idea"" then ""OOOPS"" as I watched the Mothership blow to pieces.This was my first experience at Homeworld Two, which despite my poor tactical skills at the time ended up setting me on a road of playing that game to the point of obsession. Until windows 7 and the game became incompatible with my computer and with a developer which no longer existed, pretty muched ended it there.So what does Homeworld Remastered Edition offer apart from a game that actually runs on a computer that isn't running windows XP? Better graphics for one and a crisper UI. As well as the oportunity to play multi-player over steam. In terms of selling the game, very little will make a difference if you haven't play Homeworld before. But if you haven't played it before, a ""meh"" before moving on isn't doing it justice.Would it have been possible for me to write this review without mentioning my experience playing it: No, it has simply shaped to much of my playing style in other games that to not mention this would be wrong.

												I just spent the last six hours ( thought it was three ) playing this game.I say, they have recreated this game in probably the best way I think could ever be done.I played a lot of Homeworld, and none of it online.  I spent a lot of time in the campaign, and in botmatches.  I even tried playing with the modding for a bit.  It was amazing.And now we have this.Coming from only having played Homeworld Remastered, not 2, or the Classics, or the multiplayer, I can say it is... exactly how it was.It even played performance-wise the same way!  I have a 550 Ti, and this this thing managed to pull a reliable 30 fps through 80% of the game, but there was a bit of dip in combat, so it was just like old times on my crappy Celeron PC back in the ages.Now, the remastered version uses the Homeworld 2 engine, so if you only ever played Homeworld 1, you might be a little bit confused.  I think the changes to the engine are a nice touch.  I spent quite a lot of time admiring that all the ships look exactly the same, but just... better.  The small details are REALLY nice, and I haven't even begun to touch them yet.  I have to work tomorrow. ...maybe...For instance, when the Turanic Raiders are encountered, focus on one of corvettes' missiles. You'll see.Anyway, there's any number of tangents I can go on, but basically, this game lives up to the hype machine that was created for it.  I only got to mission 5, and I already don't reget buying this as a pre-order.  I wouldn't regret buying it again for a different computer at full price.  If you loved either Homeworld game, but especially both of them, buy this.It will not be a game you regret buying. I look forward to fragging some of you in multiplayer.  :)Cons:  Still no Cataclysm.			"

												Homeworld remastered is exactly that, the original homeworld with slightly improved wrapping. While this is generally a good thing and if you liked the originals (like I did, a lot) then buying this makes sense. You will get the same game with updated visuals and sounds.However there are some negatives, most of them are just missed opportunities, but they still count as negatives:- Models are extremely low poly for a 2015 game- objects (mostly ships) could be much more detailed - Textures look low res as well- effects look 5-6 year old at least (like engine glow as such)- voices are a bit more bland then the original, they seem more like script read than a person saying them.In general it is an improvement on the original for sure, but the original was revolutionary for its time, this is passable at best for 2015			"

												Rose tinted glasses is a risk with the 'golden oldies'. Homeworld was a fantastic game back in the day, and to get that out of the way immediately: It still is. So, I recommend the game. But it is worth knowing ahead of buying that it is not a perfect game. It looks like a 2015 game. The game doesn't play like it, though. The campaign has a great story, but it has an unforgiving side and as your fleet stays with you throughout the game, it can be punishing or require loading. In that regard it's quite 'oldschool'. That is not necessarily bad - or good - but is something you should be aware of. As for the multiplayer, there's some region limiting that can be worked around, but you don't get more epic space battles than multiplayer Homeworld. Nothing even compares. I note that a lot mention bugs. I haven't run into any, for what it's worth.			"

												Please help, Kiwi is upside down in space and his sensors just keep flashing ""♥♥♥♥ you"" over and over again. There's some pretty ships that flew by a few hours ago and his radio is playing pretty music. This would probably make a nice story, but knowing Kiwi's luck, it'd get a sequel where there's a squad of ships instead.			"

												I just spent the last six hours ( thought it was three ) playing this game.I say, they have recreated this game in probably the best way I think could ever be done.I played a lot of Homeworld, and none of it online.  I spent a lot of time in the campaign, and in botmatches.  I even tried playing with the modding for a bit.  It was amazing.And now we have this.Coming from only having played Homeworld Remastered, not 2, or the Classics, or the multiplayer, I can say it is... exactly how it was.It even played performance-wise the same way!  I have a 550 Ti, and this this thing managed to pull a reliable 30 fps through 80% of the game, but there was a bit of dip in combat, so it was just like old times on my crappy Celeron PC back in the ages.Now, the remastered version uses the Homeworld 2 engine, so if you only ever played Homeworld 1, you might be a little bit confused.  I think the changes to the engine are a nice touch.  I spent quite a lot of time admiring that all the ships look exactly the same, but just... better.  The small details are REALLY nice, and I haven't even begun to touch them yet.  I have to work tomorrow. ...maybe...For instance, when the Turanic Raiders are encountered, focus on one of corvettes' missiles. You'll see.Anyway, there's any number of tangents I can go on, but basically, this game lives up to the hype machine that was created for it.  I only got to mission 5, and I already don't reget buying this as a pre-order.  I wouldn't regret buying it again for a different computer at full price.  If you loved either Homeworld game, but especially both of them, buy this.It will not be a game you regret buying. I look forward to fragging some of you in multiplayer.  :)Cons:  Still no Cataclysm.			"

												This reminds me how well made games can be.  The gameplay stands up well to the test of time and is still as enjoyable and clever as ever.  The graphics are very good and the improvements really suit thins kind of game, with much more detailed textures and higher resolutions.  Downsides- well only 2 so far. A minor crashing bug has hit me twice.  And sometimes I will need to stop playing to go and eat. Highly recommended!			"

												Even after 16 years Homeworld remains the king of the RTS genre. Tactically complex, beautifully imagined, and now lovingly restored for modern systems, it has lost none of its charm or fire. The new textures, sounds, and effects are stunning and the gameplay holds up as if it was new this year. If you're a fan of games like Starcraft, Dawn of War, or Supreme Commander you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld. If you're a fan of Homeworld than the only reason you should be reading this is because you're waiting for the download to finish.			"

												What can I say? I first encountered the Homeworld Series back in 2006 when I was out in Boston for a month with nothing to do. Standing in ""Comp-USA"" I wondered if I could play what seemed like this ulimatly, beautiful game on my laptop that was even a few years behind on it's own.Luckily, it did fine with it.This started a game I played religiously as much as I could. The beautiful space-scapes, entrancing music, and full sound for it's time where amazing.Homeworld: Remastered Collection honors everything I loved about the game and brings it to the table with new, updated graphics and all in one glorious package. While I've only gotten a few hours in now since launch, all of it has been worth it so far. If my opinion changes I will update this review, but for now, I am happy, and I am greatful that I can finally play this amazing game once more.			"

												I haven't played these games since the early 2000's.  Just the soundtrack brought me flying back to those days.  Battlecruisers and Frigates blasting the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of each other in a glorious fashion.  Now, it's like Gearbox went, took the old games and cranked the awesome factor up to 11.  Having all four of the old factions fighting on one map at once???  Nothing but supreme carnage and mayhem.  I LOVE IT.Also, Taidan mothership's voice is AMAZEBALLS.  The combination of Satan and Alduin being broadcast through a evil robot.So would i recommend this game???  Does a bear ♥♥♥♥ in the woods???  Does Alduin hate all living creatures of Skyrim???

												Homewolrd was on of those games where you either loved it or hated it. From my personal experience with the game, I really love it, had to really drag myself away from it at 2am this morning to et some rest for work later today.The game being re-mastered has managed to keep is atmosphere and environment, the story really pulls you in. Multitasking and designating your squads to defend carriers as well sending other squads to deal with the enemy carriers while you continuously harvest more resources and research. There is so much going on.The ui is slightly different, personally I liked the old UI but this new UI all it takes is getting used to.The PVP part of the game is where I think it will really make or break the game for the future. Personally I like the hyperdrive element brings in so many strategies like a decoy attack to the front of an enemy base while your team mate hyperdrives behind the enemy base and nukes.This game is awesome, if your in to RTS even as a solo player I would defo recommended it, the skirmishes against the CPU can be quite fun as well if you don’t like PVP.

												Okay, there are some issues with bugs and random crashes for many, but not all. Let's get that out of the way. Does it make the game ""broken""? No, but there ARE issues to be addressed by Gearbox.I won't go into the graphics, story etc. as many reviews have covered this. Let me instead look at the game's 'difficulty' for the new RTS gamer.If you do not strategise and plan in 3D, which was revolutionary at the time (and still is, to my mind) you're going to have a hard time. When I played the original on release in my early thirties I DID find some of the mssions HARD, but then I wasn't used to this type of RTS. The delight was in solving the strategy for myself and finally 'getting it'! I hadn't come across this since ""X-Wing"", which really was a mix of simulator anbd puzzle solving (take out X bombers to pretect Hospital Ship - if you don't in a certain order you fail).So, it all comes down to planning and working out exactly what you need for each mission. ""Tank Rushing"" just will not work, and those with the biggest and baddest fleet, that takes sometimes far too much time and resources, will see you fail time and again (except in skirmish - which we didn't have back then).This game(s) requires thought, and aside from it's beauty (the original still looks marvellous), the strategy required is compelling. You'll hit your keyboard and close the game down in frustration sometimes, but your mind will keep churning over strategies until you come back and try again (and you will).""Brilliant and innovative"" barely describes this title even today.

												10/10 for updated sound and graphics, 1/10 for trying to remake Homeworld missions on the Homeworld 2 engine (which was used for this remaster). The second game had severely different mechanics and because of that, the original missions are full of bugs, balancing issues and AI problems.Also, where is the god damned song which used to play over the ending credits? You know, the one specifically written for this game. The one that brought a tear to my eye everytime I managed to beat the final mission, with pieces of plastic piercing the skin around my knuckles from repeatedly punching the keyboard in fury. Those were the times, man.As for the HW2 campaing, it plays out just fine, so eat that sh!t up because it's still awesome and on top of that, it looks like a million bucks.			"

												The first thing I want to say is the Homeworld series is by far my favorite set of games ever.I completely recommend this purchase for anyone who likes SciFi in general, the space genre, and strategy fans.Update*  Original version contained bugs.  As of version 1.2 all bugs are gone as far as I can tell.  Game experience is exactly as it was all those years ago.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games of ALL TIME!!This franchise and me go back a ways...i was a younger teen when Homeworld came out and I had to have it!  The game was the first of its kind. at least it was for me anyways...Unfortunately the consoles started to show their faces, and I was taken from pc to consoles.It would be years before I would buy a pc again and I bought a laptop. Good thing im a game horder, because I still had my copy of Homeworld. Got back into the game and relived soo many memories.....and soon I would stumble upon Homeworld 2....""What?"" I had no idea that there was a sequel....as I said it had been years....so I magicaly found a copy online and man was this a even BETTER experiance than the original!....Alas...It would be short lived as my laptop would die, and I found myself once more sucked into the next console generation.....As fate would have it...some more years would go by and this new next gen of consoles would be emerging...and I would not be suckered by this so called ""NEW NEXT GEN""...So I went and got myself a high end gaming pc....the bad news is that I would not be able to enjoy my Homeworld games any more....well not to the extent that they once did...as the game did not support higher res grapgics that are out now.But GearBox has done something special by REMASTERING a MASTERPIECE! and once again I can enjoy this amazing franchise once more!!Well done GearBox!...there was alot of bad hype that this company was recieving. But this was done right in soo many ways!Thank you,10/10!!!			"

												It's a remastering of two old games, so there are limits to what you can expect. Saying that the old games in question are classics so the having access to them again on new hardware was worth the cost from my point of view.The update also comes with improved graphics so the 3d models now look great at 2560x1400 on a 27"" monitor, much in the same way that I remember how goood the originals looked at 1280x1024 on a 21"" monitor. If you have played the original games (and can still remember back that far) you are looking at around 30 hours of game play to complete the included missions. beyond that there are PvC skirmish modes and a PvP system in beta.

												Just finished the Remastered Homeworld and it was a great experience.However there is some things to be aware of:There is only the one dificulty level so when you have finished the campaign I don't see much reason to replay it.The fleet is preserved during the campaign this means that some of the later levels become too easy beacuse your fleet is too good or the level is impossible because your fleet is too small...I had to restart the campaign because I just barely  made one level to be totally crushed in the next. However after the restart I steamrolled the later leves.The space view sometimes turns black for unknown reasons and it's impossible to do anything, if this happens save and reload and the view is back.If MSI Afterburner is running there are lots of graphical glitches so don't.The game crashed once and lvl 6 didn't have any objectives once so it was impossible to finish the map (worked after restart of map) but other than that I think the game was pretty solid.Oh and the Junkyard dog stopped stealing my ships after a while I don't know if this was a glitch or by design.

												This is a cautious recommendation.The game is playable with some minor bugs in the remastered versions. Three of the Four games included work as they should. As of today (3/1/15) the price for the game is $34.99.The problem with one of the games, Homeworld Remastered, is that formations with a couple of craft don't work as they did in the classics. It's not game breaking as players could work around the issues presented by the different engine. Even though this problem does exist, the original Homeworld is also bundled in the package, but I'm a little saddened that my experience of Homeworld 1 Remastered is going to be half baked.The rest of the games in my experience work as they should. I think Homeworld 2 Classic still has the emblems of the ships glowing a different shade from the rest of the ships on my GTX780, but Homeworld 2 Remastered has no such problem.For the price they're asking for, I think this purchase is just. They could have easily copped out a console asking price of $60 dollars, but they didn't.$10 for every working game, and $4.99 for Homeworld 1 Remastered			"

												I didn't like this as much as I thought I would.  I never played the original version, so I'm just now experiencing Homeworld in the Remastered Collection.It does seem to be a good 3D RTS engine and watching the ships in combat is amazing.  The storyline and plot is also interesting, at least as far as I played.  Is probably a game worth looking into or trying at least once, if its on sale.  But I think in today's RTS world, its a bit behind, even with the updated graphics.  I stopped playing at about the 6th mission for several reasons:1.  Even playing normal difficulty, the AI is brutal throwing in larger ships like Frigates and even Destroyers very soon in the game, I think about the 4th or 5th mission.  Before you have even had a chance to build more than a few of them.  So unless you have researched and crank out some serious frigates, you will be toast.  I think its the I've read some walkthroughs and you can ""cheese"" your way through these missions by capturing with salvage frigates, but that seems cheesy and more like an exploit, then winning with combat. 2.  Resources are limited and always seem to be on the same place in the map,  A group of asteroids or a cloud of interstellar gas - always in about the same places.   it makes it kind of boring and also makes the game a bit unforgiving, if you mess up and lose to many ships or make a mistake, the campaign mission is pretty much over, or the next campaign mission will be impossible because you don't have enough resources to build new ships or do research.3.  I got bored with the space theme.  It looks beautiful flying around for a while and watching ship combat, but then after a bit its boring to me, compared to land based RTS games.  In the land based ones, you can use the terrain to your advantage in attacking and setting up bases, and building defenses.  But in Homeworld, you are pretty much thrown into a system with your unmovable base ship stuck in one place.  With tons of empty space around you.  I just found that the combat got kind of boring because its mostly scrambling around to send groups of ships to certain places, without much strategy or base defense building involved.			"

												I was born in 1990. When the original Homeworld came out, I was too young to understand or appreciate what this game was. I felt compelled to write this review after completing the remastered edition. This game is a masterpiece. An enrapturing odyssey encapsulating a simple yet beautiful story, a haunting score and thoughtful, refined gameplay. From the first mission of the campaign, I found myself entranced by a narrative that transcended any need for painstakingly rendered cutscenes or lengthy dialogue. Homeworld is an illustrative example of what creativity in the RTS genre is capable of achieving - in both storytelling and interactive components. On the cusp of the new milennium, Relic created a game which was so far beyond its time that it feels cutting edge more than 15 years after its initial release (obviously subject to graphical updates). Watching beams of light slice through a stunning galactic backdrop as huge fleets engage each other is an unparalleled experience. This game is a perfect 10.			"

												Oh my god.  Homeworld's back.  I never thought I'd see this day.  I don't know how many hours I put into the originals.So far, not many bugs on release other than a couple crashes.  If you crash, lower the texture quality a notch.  Even at 2048 texture size, it's beautifulTo top it off, this is NOT one of those games that looks better through nostalgia glasses.  Between all the engine improvements, HD textures, etc, it's BETTER.I remember playing HW1 when I was a kid and getting destroyed.  15 years later, with an adult mind, it feels like a different game.  I know how to manage resources better, I know the strengths and weaknesses of ships better, and try to organize my fleet instead of throwing units against the enemy hoping to get a kill.EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE RTS, GIVE THIS GAME A TRY.  It looks like another overcomplicated space RTS, but it's really not.  It's complicated in its own ways, but very easy to learn the basic tactics and rock-paper-scissor mechanics between all the different ships.This isn't like other RTSs.  It's very easy to pick up and play, hard to master against real players, but the selling point is the beautiful campaigns of HW1 and 2.  Not to mention the massive battles, with fighters zipping everywhere with their glowing contrails, and massive capital ships hammering at each other with cannons and ion beems.Good lord, it's been a long time.  It's more beautiful than I remember; with the Remastered engine, it's more than just a polished up HW2 engine.  Check out any comparison videos.This game has gotten *BETTER* with time.  How many series/remakes can say that?			"

												Just to start i must stat that im a huge fan of the homeworld series (owning all 3 big box editions of the original games in all their glory) when i found out about this i preorderd the special edition.To start the game is beautiful with new stunning skins, great new sound effects, cleaned up audio for the voice acting and wonderful draw cutscenes, not to mention the easier to use UI of homeworld 2 that makes homeworld 1 singleplayer that much easier and fun to play. These games hold their own on gameplay alone (dont believe me?, try the classic editions bundled into the collection!) but the remaster really does make the places you play in that much more special. The multiplayer (against bots for the moment) is also fun, being able to use any of the 4 major races across both games is really intreasting and gives alot more replayability.Its not all good news tho as this games does have bugs, so far iv noticed certain ships clipping through each other, ships not dissappearing after hyperdrive, the overview map not working at times, and crashes to name a few. However i still recommend this game as it is, with gearbox supporting modding for this game and a huge modding community already around, as well as possibility of (decent!) DLC and bug fixes, its a bright intergalactic future for Homeworld.			"

I had been thinking about getting them from amazon, and wishing they were on steam, when one day I saw this in the updates and was overjoyed at seeing it with all its remastered graphical glory!These 2 games are definitly two of the best space rts games I have ever played. With the graphics update that they have received in their remastering, they are the best looking space rts games I have played. These games make me wish I had a pc good enough to run it at high graphics, let alone the glory of max graphics at 4k resolution. as they are beautiful at the low settings I have to run them (blasted craptop).

												I've owned this game since launch and a lot of the bugs have been ironed out. There are still some there though. Gearbox did a lot right with this and it's a fantastic title for those looking for nostalgia. With the UI updates, the Remastered version plays like a 2015 game, making it playable for a wide audience.			"

												So, this is it: The good old days are coming back.A new Master of Orion has been anounced, Fallout 4 knocks on the door and Gearbox released a remastered version of Homeworld 1 and 2 combined including a multiplayer mode combining both AND including the old versions, and that is what Iwant to write about here.This IS almost exactly the old Homeworld just with ditched up GFX.The changesGearbox made are mostly positive- like getting rid of the fuel limitation of strikecraft in HW1.One might saythe carrier is almost useless now, and I agree, but refuling the fighters was mostly just annoying.The bad things have mostly returned as well, like the horrible difficulty spikes of HW2. I am a very experienced player and I just don't get past the third mission where I am to protect the shipyard... Maybe there's a trick that Ijust fail to spot.The Multiplayer is still in Beta, but honestly, Idon't see any problems with it after three long skirmishes, it worked perfectly well. I had more Issues with HW1rm where the sound went on the fritz horribly in the last mission.It is really sad, that cataclysm is not includet - it's because the game files have been lost during the transition from barking dog to gearbox or something alike. I really hope they turn up soon and cataclysm will be includet here, because it was rad!So what to say? You loved Homeworld 1 and/or Homeworld 2? Go get this! It's great!			"

												Since this game is actually four games in one, or more accurately, two games and two remasters, I'll be reviewing each one individually. I will also play the remasters first before I go and play the classic editions. The classic edition reviews will be more of a compare and contrast to the remasters in things like HUD, tactical options, balance, etc. Since I don't stand a chance in hell in putting all four reviews on one review, I'll have four separate Pastebin links, of which I will be writing reviews for each game as I complete them.

												Favorite game of all time. A few bugs to start of with but withing an hour they had a new update out to take care of some of them.Homeworld RM is amazing, the high detail on the ships from rotating canons to the laser lights reflected across the ships and objects in space, to the remastered sound, which is amazing if you turn it all the way up.The 3D evironment in which you can move ships is so amazing and just like  I remember it. Overall the best game out. Well done Gearbox.To everyone complaining about the little bugs. It was know beforehand that there would be bugs. Gearbox wanted people to play and find all the bugs so that they could fix them. If you watch all the videos on the developers, you can see that they really are keen to keep this game going and fix all the bugs, so get off there backs and give them time to fix things. Rewriting code and troubleshooting is not easy most of the time. For the amount of time they\ve spent on this, which is surpising little. It's amazing!			"

												A classic game updated with care to feel almost completely modern. It looks great, sounds great, and continues to play great to this day even without gameplay changes. It's RTS-inspired, but doesn't require you to count APM or plan build queues. The campaigns are tough and can be unforgiving, but the story makes the struggle worthwhile. Highly recommended.			"

												Feeling nostalgia for this game since 1999. Remastered version brings back warm memories and enhance them. New Homeworld 1 models are superb, I didn't expect that Gearbox would make old, almost two decades old models, so detailed, fighters look amazing.Of course, there are few bugs, but mainly they're caused by port of Homeworld 1 content to Homeworld 2 engine. Campaign doesn't roll as it used to, autobalance ""feature"" ruins old tactics I used to beat HW1 campaign. But at the same time it makes old campaign look new. Game runs perfectly on highest settings with average strength high end rig.			"

												When i saw this series for the first time, it caught my eye. why? it was the sheer beauty of it. and im not even talking about the remastered version, or the graphics of the games, remastered or not. it was the concept, the story, and the level of pure thought that goes into every moment of gameplay. The story is a classic tale of an odyssey across the stars to find your one true home, and along the way you meet friends, and monsters. You find those who have simply strayed from their paths, and those who want nothing more to see you burn. you must use your 3 dimensional battlefield to your advantage, and plot every move, for one slip up can cost you your fleet. The game is very well put together overall, and the originals are well preserved, the remastered ones however are not entirely true to the classic versions. In some instances you face more enemies than in the original, or Certain events do not occur at the right time or in the right spot. these are minor changes at best, but a sound strategy that worked in the classics, may not work in the remastered ones. Older fans will not be dissapointed, and new fans will hardly notice the difference. Despite these gripes i have to say it is still one of the best strategy games i have ever played, and certainly my favorite.			"

												Updated:  Make sure to read the bottom edit.The countless hours I spent on this series as a youngster were some of my fondest memories of gaming. I completed the campaign for Homeworld at least 3 times, HW2 twice, and Cataclysm (somewhat non-canon, but still good) a few times as well. I've only reached the fifth mission in this HW1 Remastered campaign, but it appears Gearbox did the series proud. It's beautiful without compromising the original art, the updated interface is mostly an improvement (I'm not crazy about the different hotkeys) and the sound updates are amazing. There are nuances to the sounds that I never picked up in all the time I used to play the game.One change that had me absolutely giddy is that it's now (much more) possible for salvage frigates to capture Turanic Raider ships. I always wanted a fleet of Missile Corvettes, and now it's possible to nab them all!Overall, I'm blown away by this remaster. I'm overjoyed at how well it's done. If you never played the Homeworld games and you're an RTS or space fan, do yourself a favor and play this game, now.Edit: There are some serious issues with the game that I hope will be fixed soon. These are:1) Harvesting resources in HW1R is buggy, and requires babysitting and constantly reassigning the harvesters. They will stop harvesting, even when there are additional resources 30 seconds away.2) Strike Craft Formations and Tactics are useless and broken: Moving HW1 content to the HW2 engine clearly broke these, and they are critical to making strike craft useful. As they are right now, you will constantly lose all your strike craft due to the unit AI's inability to utilize tactics and formations. It forces you to just boat captured Assault Frigate swarms and other Frigate/Capital ships instead. This is a major and disappointing issue, and possibly the worst of the list.3) The projectile system was dropped in favor of the ""dice roll"" system of HW2. This was one of the coolest parts of HW1, and was amazing to watch in action. Projectiles were actually fired and could hit targets on the other side of the target by accident. This led to strike craft being much more useful, as they could dodge rounds coming towards them, allowing them to overwhelm large capital ships. Now, Heavy Cruisers, Destroyers and Assault Frigates wipe out dozens of fighters without breaking a sweat. The best anti-everything weapon is just a mass of capital ships, in all circumstances. Forget attack bombers and defenders. The only reason to builds scouts and interceptors is as a cheap meat shield or disposable scouting element.4) Time to Kill is INSANE. INSANE. Take two heavy cruisers or destroyers, and have them start shooting at each other. They die in like 30 seconds. It used to take twice that long, turning capital ship fights into epic slugging matches. Now, it's all just one giant, stupid deathball.5) Scaled difficulty is broken: Just collect a few dozen ships, and by mission 10, you'll see what I mean. If you're familiar with the original HW, you'll see that they have more than quadrupled the number of enemy ships guarding the ghost ship. It's hilarious and game breaking.I really hope they fix these issues, as HW is one of my favorite franchises, ever. It pains me to say this, but HW1R is not worth playing until most of the bugs get fixed. I haven't played HW2R enough to see, but I'm sure it's fine as it's in the same engine. If you want to play HW1, stick to the classic version. I pray it doesn't have the same issues.			"

												+ Breathtaking story and atmosphere (music and voiceacting take a great part in this)+ Better graphics / sound+ Still works on older machines (My notebook is 4Y old and I can max out almost every setting)+ Almost 1:1 to the original+ New UI is imo much better in terms of usefulness+ Voice acting is very good, also for the new lines+ Cutscenes are beautiful+ Auto collect at the end of a mission (thank you so much!)Small minuses:- UI (...) is good but not perfect. I miss my list of ships and list of enemy ships in sight. It's much harder to see what you're up against compared to the original.- Well even tho I love how they tried to change as little as possible I would have been very happy if they implemented one or two more comfort functions from the other games. Namely: An option to 8x game speed (HW Cataclysm)Some issues that might (hopefully) get fixed:- Support fregates have to move very close to a larger ship (i.e. destroyer) for repairs. Sometimes the ships circle around each other and the support fregate isn't able to ""dock"" until the repair target is destroyed. This makes them completely useless in combat for everything above corvettes. Most of my ships died before the fregates could get in position. In the original they flew behind the ships and it was no problem.Edit: After a few missions I completely quit to build them. Useless and extremely frustrating.- Formations don't work. Not even if the ships are idle. Thats not a wall!- Same goes for the tactics. Example: Ships will often attack enemies that are being salvaged. That also happens sometimes even if tactics is set on Passive and you give a movement order in the opposite direction- Harvesters randomly idle even if there are still resources left (extremely irritating)- AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell, also your ships often move or realign in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way possible.It's critic on a high niveau. Still a very good game with a few flaws that will make you tear your hairs out.			"

												Disclosure, im did play both Homeworlds' back when they were released so i cant rule out any nostalgiacolouring my opinions. However with that in mind i do think they honestly made the best remastering of anold game that i've seen even rumoured to date anywhere.It stays true to the original with changes being obvious ones like strike craft refuels gone (Fellas theres a reason it did not make the cut in HW2). The original HW UI has indeed been replaced with a slightly improved HW2 UI for the original aswell which is a great damned thing indeed.Graphics wise, its incredibly well done. Consistent style and very wide range of options to tune it so it'll stay fresh for quite a number of years. (Yes you can actually get it to hog up any but the mightiest GPU's if you do a big fleet battle)Even more striking in my opinion is the audio rework since the originals had some quite hefty restrictions on their fidelity based on the technology on most PC's back then.Absolutely a must buy for any serious RTS and Sci-fi fans. Though i suspect folks fond of todays hyperactive RTS(RTT really) genre might not cope with it well what with you requiring to actually devise stratagems instead of just micromanaging and outexpanding your opponent.

												The game that defined space RTS, remastered in glorious HD. I cannot express with words what this game evokes in me, pure joy and pleasure of once again guiding a people across a vast galaxy to defeat a foe that is far superior in every way.This is a game that any RTS and/or space junkie should play in his lifetime, not because it looks good and runs superb on practically any modern PC. But because the story and narrative of the game is so well written and executed that by the end of the game you feel connected to it, to the characters and to the ships you've commanded. The remastering done is simply put amazing, both the visual quality, sound fidelity and atmosphere is superb. Detailed ships, nebulas, asteroid belts and clusters of light all basked in the beautiful galactic background - SPACE.The mechanics of the original game are intact, all the clever ways to manipulate the outcome of battles is there. The balance of things has been brought in-line and the type of units matter. The mechanics are much clearer when it comes to unit types, don't expect a flurry of ion cannot frigates to easily defeat a destroyer or heavy cruiser, likewise assault frigates do big damage to slower moving corvettes and struggle with fast interceptors. The utility units are now really useful in big fights and a gravitywell generator and a cloak generator do wonders to turn the battle, especially if you are being bombarded by fighters and corvettes. Capital ships perform as they should, massive firepower and generally low speed, they will decimate every frigate and likewise because of their heavy armor are much harder to kill by frigates.As of this writing the game is at v1.2, the only problems that I've encountered are minor AI bugs. Specifically resource collectors will not automatically harvest resources if their nearest asteroid/cloud is out of range they just stop and you have to re-issue the harvest command. Ships sometimes fail to follow/guard another ship, they simple stop and you have to either re-issue the guard command or manually move them nearby. There have been a few slowdowns where the mouse and map freeze for a few secs, but those were no more than 5 in the whole campaign.Generally none of the above bugs affect the actual gameplay and you can be certain that they are not game breaking.

I had more Issues with HW1rm where the sound went on the fritz horribly in the last mission.It is really sad, that cataclysm is not includet - it's because the game files have been lost during the transition from barking dog to gearbox or something alike. I really hope they turn up soon and cataclysm will be includet here, because it was rad!So what to say? You loved Homeworld 1 and/or Homeworld 2? Go get this! It's great!			"

Make it look fresh and new, and it does look very fresh and new, it looks like, and in many cases better than, a game that was released within the last year.They did not mess with the formula, they did not try to ""reboot"" it, they just made it live again fresh and whole for the enjoyment of a whole new generation.

												I've played this new shiny version 82 minutes. This equals the settings and tutorial. After all, it was years since I played HW last time. But so far I'm VERY happy with this. I do not have the strongest of computers. But it is far from weak either. But everything simply flows. Very little hickups. No crashing. But my antivirus quarantined the exe file for some strange reason. This is an exellent remaster. This is the way ALL remasters should be done. With care! It is simply put fantastic. Graphics superb. Sound great. Game mechanics oh so easy. This moves Homeworld from classic to everlasting in my mind. A place forever owned by this great scifi RTS title. Worth every second and money it cost. So what are you waiting for? Go get it. Vote with your  money. Show that this IS what we want and what a good work the creators have done. Do I reccomend this game? Hell yes! :-D			"

												The beautiful thing about Homeworld is that the original game, before being remastered, aged extremely well.  I played through it (the unremastered version) earlier this year actually and it was very hard to believe that the game was 15 years old.  So given that it now looks absolutely stunning, it feels very, very modern.  In terms of quality, this game (in my opinion) would easily worth a lot more than it's current price tag if it was a new game releasing for the first time.  So if you haven't played Homeworld before and are wondering if it's still worth playing now,  I'd highly recommend you go ahead and pick this up because this is a game that has survived the test of time and plays just as well today as it did back when it first released.  It is not one of those remastered releases where the gameplay mechanics aged badly despite some pretty new textures.For those of you who are already fans of the original Homeworld and are just reading these reviews to find out if this remastered version is worth picking up, the answer is yes.  You can rest easy knowing they didn't break the game or try to change it or somehow ruin it doing something stupid, it  feels, and plays exactly like the original game, and visually, it maintains the original look and feel so well that despite having far more advanced visuals than the original, in a sense it looks exactly how our nostalgic brains probably think we ""remember"" the first looking, back when it's visuals blew us away oh so long ago.

												Feeling nostalgia for this game since 1999. Remastered version brings back warm memories and enhance them. New Homeworld 1 models are superb, I didn't expect that Gearbox would make old, almost two decades old models, so detailed, fighters look amazing.Of course, there are few bugs, but mainly they're caused by port of Homeworld 1 content to Homeworld 2 engine. Campaign doesn't roll as it used to, autobalance ""feature"" ruins old tactics I used to beat HW1 campaign. But at the same time it makes old campaign look new. Game runs perfectly on highest settings with average strength high end rig.			"

												It is with both sadness and joy I think back on the bankruptcy of THQ. On the one hand it meant Metro passed from competent hands into the unknown abyss, but at the same time the Homeworld franchise got hit by the defib.  Relic and Sierra both pretty much went bust after Homeworld 2. The title was sold then sold again and that was it. Stuck in economical limbo by a company that did not want to touch it with a five foot stick and rightly so, because how to tackle such a game without creating another Colonial Marines?But it was revived, by Gearbox of all people, and again hope felt lost. Perhaps it is still lost, but this remastered edition of the original masterpieces shows competence from a company mainly associated with cellshaded gore. There's some funky voiceacting in some places, and you can tell sometimes which voicerecordings are old and which are new, but never has the Mothership looked better.I know there's a lot of people who complain about broken mechanics, such as formations, but I have had no such issues. 15 hours to move through the main campaign at my own speed and not a single gamebreaking issue has surfaced. No broken combat mechanics, no broken triggers, both HW 1 and 2 formations work for me. There are some graphical highjinxes though, such as commandeered taiidani ships randomly changing colours between missions, but nothing eyesore-noteworthy was had. Whatever issues people may have with random crashes it hasn't happened to me. Homeworld was a near flawless experience when it was released, one of the absolutely best strategy games ever made. What this remastered edition brings though is so much more than just a higher available resolution and support for inherent 64-bit systems. The graphics are now current generation level. Same with the sound and the classic cinematic sequences. To get that kind of update is like turning Quake into Crysis 3. The difference IS that big. Another great addition is the remade UI, the greatest improvement over the old HW 1 system. And of course let us not forget the updated multiplayer with quite a fair amount of new mechanics to spice things up. I would say it's not just a remastered edition of the original games, but this is exactly what should be expected from a remastered edition. This is what a remastered edition of any game should actually do. It's not just a relabel of the game; it's what would be expected of an RTS title released today. But then again, this is Homeworld. It was already a real-time strategy diamond and credit to Gearbox for all the hard work that went into this. They know what they're doing. They WANT this to be every bit as good as it can be, and it shows.			"

												To put it simply - Homeworld literally revolutionized the RTS genre when it was first released over 15 years ago. I bought the original game and throughout the years, it was always a deep regret that this great game was not available on Steam for everyone else to discover... until now! This remastered version is not just putting the original game on the Steam store - every part of the game has been improved and updated, surpassing all expectations for such a classic reborn. This digital collection is a great opportunity to experience what made Homeworld such an enduring game. The amazing fanbase which has kept this game alive all these years finally prompted the original developers to update and release it on Steam. If you are a fan of the Star Wars movies or gigantic space battles with epic scenery, this is definitely something that you should check out. Homeworld is quite different and special compared to other RTS games - it has an original outlook on space combat with a game engine capitalizing on the beauty of combat in space, which has never been as successfully captured in any other games. The game is so beautiful that you could make movies from the gameplay footage if you wanted - in fact, there are several fan-made movies out there with Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica mods, simulating the original look of the various ships in their respective franchise.The story and sound effects are very immersive, contributing to a chilling cinematic atmostphere where you can feel the loneliness of your civilization lost in space as you build your fleet while preparing for explorations and enemy encounters. The learning curve is easy compared to other strategy games so feel free to give it a try. It's worth it!			"

If you enjoyed these two Space Operas when they came out 15 years ago, the updated graphics will have you thrilled.  The detail work is so good that it seems that I could actually climb into the Interceptor and fly it myself.I had some issues early on getting my desktop graphics card to work properly.  With a bit of helpful advice from the online forum folk,  I was able to navigate to the .exe file and click ONE BOX and PRESTO...the game worked.If you have never played this game and like strategy games: get it.If you played it before, but enjoy the quality of today's games on today's graphics cards: get it.

												I've been a fan of this series since my early childhood back in the 1990s. the fact that it has been brought back and updated with the latest technology feels like a dream come true. adding in the new interfaces and game mechanics that allow Kushan and Taiidan to operate with Hiigaran and Vaygr in multiplayer simultaneously, the way they normally do is fantastic! a huge thanks to gearbox for bringing back and reviving such a masterpiece!

												All the glory of the original but refined graphics and seemingly more stable all around. Really solid.			"

												Great remake.  It's a little rough around the edges but they did a fantastic job recapturing the feeling of the original.  If you were a fan of the original you should check this out.			"

												I want to post something hilarious about this, but Gearbox finally did a good job and did an amazing remaster of an already perfect game.  Gearbox truly brought the Higaarans home.			"

												Just for the classics alone this is absolutely worth it, not to mention these classics are mod compatible just as the cd versions were, or if you had a copy of a less than legal pirated digital version...			"

												There are a hundred or so games that claim to be remastered versions, HD releases, revamped and so forth.This isn't so much of a remastering as a true restoration.Call it nostalgia goggles, but when you sit down and Watch the intro in glorious 1080p, with the crackle of the old sounds removed...Its a masterpeice.

												My partner received this game and has played it thoroughly, but she did not get a chance to finish it.  I can tell you, for a fact, that she loved the original game and was overjoyed when she had the opportunity to play this.The graphics are superb, and she loved every minute that she played of it.  Here is the review that she asked me to copy for the game.Pros:  The graphics- the graphics will melt your eyeballs directly into your head.  The brightness of the sun as it pans into your viewscreen would turn any vampire into dust immediately.  They are THAT realistic.Gameplay- Combat happens quickly, and it cannot be paused.  You can restart any time that you wish from a quick saved game, but who wants to do that?  Death and destruction is part of the galaxy, folks, and you will see plenty of it.Audio- Your neighbors will insist that the Apocolypse has arrived, centered in your living room.  Even at the lowest volume, if you have downstairs neighbors then they will be pounding on their ceiling for you to turn it down.  The explosions rattled my teeth and killed my pet skunk.  Not before he sprayed his gunk everywhere, though.Battlefield size- The best game that I ever played that comes close to this is Sins of a Solar Empire.  If you've played that, imagine each battlefield to be as large as an ultra large galaxy map in its entirety.  Battlefields are in true 4D space, and combat happens from up, down, sideways, behind you, diagonally, etc.  TRUE 4D.  The only way it could be better would be if you could actually feel the heat from the explosions, but then your couch would be melted and you would be dead.  I suppose we should stick with 4D.Cons: Length.  Too short.  I spent (as many hours as it showed I played) and didn't even come close to finishing it, but I knew how many missions there were.  I made it to (check my achievement history) before I couldn't play anymore, and it is the high point of my last half year.  Knowing that the end of the game was coming mad me sad, and I wanted to cry.  Then why did I say it's too short?  Because it will come to an end, eventually.  I wholeheartedly endorse this game, and this is the largest review that I've ever written for any game in my library.  That means a lot.************************That ends her review, and I agree.  I watched her play, and was mesmerized by the storyline and the action.  I never played the game before, so it was all new to me.  This game is not going to be a waste of your time or money, I promise.			"

												Oh my god.  Homeworld's back.  I never thought I'd see this day.  I don't know how many hours I put into the originals.So far, not many bugs on release other than a couple crashes.  If you crash, lower the texture quality a notch.  Even at 2048 texture size, it's beautifulTo top it off, this is NOT one of those games that looks better through nostalgia glasses.  Between all the engine improvements, HD textures, etc, it's BETTER.I remember playing HW1 when I was a kid and getting destroyed.  15 years later, with an adult mind, it feels like a different game.  I know how to manage resources better, I know the strengths and weaknesses of ships better, and try to organize my fleet instead of throwing units against the enemy hoping to get a kill.EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE RTS, GIVE THIS GAME A TRY.  It looks like another overcomplicated space RTS, but it's really not.  It's complicated in its own ways, but very easy to learn the basic tactics and rock-paper-scissor mechanics between all the different ships.This isn't like other RTSs.  It's very easy to pick up and play, hard to master against real players, but the selling point is the beautiful campaigns of HW1 and 2.  Not to mention the massive battles, with fighters zipping everywhere with their glowing contrails, and massive capital ships hammering at each other with cannons and ion beems.Good lord, it's been a long time.  It's more beautiful than I remember; with the Remastered engine, it's more than just a polished up HW2 engine.  Check out any comparison videos.This game has gotten *BETTER* with time.  How many series/remakes can say that?			"

												This came out when i was 10. and i have yet to find anything that is as good, It treats you a real space commander, and expects that you think in all directions, attacks can come from above you or below. The new graphics make this worth buying even if you still own an old copy. with the changes to the UI, the improvements on sound and visuals, they nailed it. I cant see what space rts game you could put next to this and homeworld not come out on top.10/10.			"
