												I really don't always want to be the first guy to downvote popular games, but honestly, in this state the physics and especially the collision system make this game an experience with way more frustration potential than it should have.If it were priced $10, the very gimmicky nature of this title would probably mandate a negative review anyway.At the very friendly $4 price point seen here, the lacking depth and optimisation (try throwing 100-200 plushies into the air at decent gfx settings!) certainly are bearable, however to be classified moderately jolly, some improvements are needed.That pillows are rigid bodies is a questionable design choice deeply ingrated into the design of many of the game levels, however it's very much immersion-breaking, and trying to shove a stuffed animal through a tight pillow funnel of unbendable durasteel is simply not fun. There's also the potential of them getting stuck inbetween pillows, as well as for animals to be on the floor in unreachable areas.Victory conditions are glitchy (I've had levels end with tanks still on the bed, or with plushies moving in mid-air), and on hard mode, the fail condition comes with bugs like not resetting (but instead just suspending all animation) when an animal is on the night stand.Plushies also have entirely different physics behaviour if you are controlling them versus if you are moving them by pushing them -- for example, a ginormous hippo is light like a feather if you just push it with something else, or a Scaredy Cat doesn't get nervous if it's pushed towards something that should set it off by another object. This might be by design for puzzle purposes, but like the pillow-rocks, it's not fun.What is fun, however, are the nice voice-overs and the animal names (even if ""MSP"" should probably be a bit more colourful, like a pink/blue checkers pattern).With a lot more polish, this could well turn into a positive review (extra bonus points for fluffy pillows!).

												Cute rag-doll physics puzzle game.I expect somebody thought ""my kids don't play with dolls"" and instead made a game based on ""rag animal physics"". You have 40 puzzles where teddy bears need to snuggle up to each other, cats jump away if you move something next to them (and hippos make everyone jump away), ""Mr Stinkypants"" who needs to be kept away from everyone else, unmovable pillow obstacles that you're not allowed to cross, and in two of the three difficulty levels, the floor is lava. It took me ~4 hours to do and re-do each of the 40 puzzles on each difficulty level to get the achievements.These 40 puzzles would actually be suitable for small children, but the rag doll physics are not. It is never clear where you're grabbing the animal that you're moving, it seems to be attached to the pointer by a weak spring that elongates itself, which means accurate placement is nearly impossible, and sometimes you can grab animals mid-air and sometimes you can't. This lack of precision means that most of the time I've been fighting the physics instead of solving the puzzle. (And why don't I get the achievement for completing all levels on normal when I completed them on hard?) Sure, the children's voices are a nice touch, but I don't really know to whom I could recommend this game. Well, here goes:If you like to fiddle with ragdoll physics, and if you like stuffed animals and childrens' voices, this is the game you've been waiting for. If you don't, it's probably not.			"

A simple but fun and adorable gameI love teddies, mostly why the game caught my eye :DPros:+ Adorable!+ Cute graphics+ Under £1 on sale+ Variety of teddies and toys+ 40 puzzle levels and 3 difficulties+ Leaderboards if you are the competitive type+ Colorblind mode, not my thing but nice for those who are colorblind + Play room or freeplay mode, where you can spawn what you like and mess around Cons:- Repetitive- Lacking in content- Only one room to play in- Frame rate can drop quick when spawning a lot in play room modeDownload Size: 101mbAchievement Difficulty: Easy to 100% but a little bit challenging at times Hours to 100%: 2-3Rating: 6.5/10Recommendation: Worth a go, best grab it on sale thoughMy Opinion:All in all I like the game and think it is good, I think I got the game for like 70p or so, cheap and fun. But I would not pay over £1 for the game myself, the game is nice and lovely but theres not much to do, and will get repetitive real quick. Also you are stuck in the one room, no change of scenary which I didn't like too much, different themes would of been nice. I advise getting it on sale.			"

												This game really helped me plan the seating arrangements for my wedding.  My overly sensitive friend can't sit next to my vulgar drunk friend, and my friend who doesn't know anybody has to sit by my friend who's outgoing but not overbearing.  My cousins can't sit next to my future husband's cousins because of mild racism, and his uncle will hit on his mom's friend.  Thanks for Plush planning all of this was a breeze!  Rarely does a game prepare you for real world problems like this does.			"

												Plush is light fun. Cute as. The toys are ragdoll style and need to be placed carefully around the bed. The hard part is holding your left mouse down hard as you convince the toy to go where it needs to be. and also the placement of the cats.If you want a perfect game score you have to play through 3 times easy, normal and hard. You may need to keep track of which number layout you are up to as the screen does not tell you, and the game only keeps track of your first playthrough.Enjoy the colour and innocence of Plush.			"

												Definitely one of the more unique games I have played, the combination of plushies and puzzles is oddly addicting, I gurantee you'll be playing until you've completed them all. Towards the end levels it gets a little tricky, and it's harder than it looks. I think It's a cute game, and in the Playroom option you are literally a child in a toy shop again, I really enjoyed it and it looks great ^^			"

												Very cute game. It's a fun puzzle and is very easy to learn. My biggest gripe is the little kid that makes comments continuously as I am going through levels. It's just incredibly annoying. I understand it's based around placing stuffed animals on a child's bed, but said child does not need to say ""why are ponies so silly?"" and ""it's Mr. Biggenbottom!"" 75000 times when I'm trying to focus on arrangement. I can only play the game in very short intervals because I find the kid so annoying. Maybe there's a way to turn it off but I haven't found it yet. Overall, great game. It's very fun and relaxing while still posing some challenges. Difficulty is adjustible.			"

												Unique puzzle game with 3 difficulties, each just a little bit of a step up from the other. The puzzles are fun and cute at the same time with the child voiceover. I managed to complete this game with all of the achievements in 1hr14mins and I do not see much re-playability. The length of the game is disappointing, though on the other hand throwing in more levels would be tiresome also.When thinking about buying this game consider how much 1 hour of gameplay is worth to you as that is all you will most likely get out of this title.Although short I can definitely recommend this title as a great and unique puzzler.

												Charming and creative puzzle game. Ultimately gets a bit dull and the controls/physics are a bit dodgy, but a fun time if you can grab it on sale or in a bundle. The hilarious chaos of spawning tons of animals to get some of the easier achievements is worth a play all on its own.			"

												A perfect game for teaching your children all about intolerance. Unicorns only like ponies and hate everything else, including other unicorns. Cats hate hippos. Tanks hate little girls. And everybody hates skunks. Man, I don't envy the person who has to place them all on a bed together the right distances from one another so that a little girl can finally go to sleep!... What?... I  have to do that?! WHOA SHIIIIIIIIIIII...Plush is a ragdoll physics game set in a small girl's room at bedtime. She can't sleep unless all her plush toys are arranged on her bed in exactly the way they prefer, and each of them have their own picky preferences. The goal is to move the toys around the bed and place them according to their preferences, taking care not to knock any of them on the floor and lose the round. There's a little bit more nuance to it, but that's basically the overall gist of the 40 stages this game contains.I played through the first tutorial stages on Normal difficulty then restarted on Hard once I got the idea, taking about an hour to complete every challenge. There's an additional Play Room mode available from the very start that allows you to place any number of any toy you want on the bed (limited only by the power of your computer) and see what happens, but it's pretty much just a physics demo with little else to really do beside some mildly amusing chaos. And that's all the content there is for the game.It's presented in a nice enough way with adequate visuals and some really nice, relaxing music, and the little girl's voice-over is adorable. The narrator/father(?) isn't quite so lovable, though, and sounds a little gruff and not exactly what you'd immediately imagine being the soothing voice for a bedtime story. I'm guessing the voice work was done by the developer and his daughter? If that is the case then it makes sense and I guess adds a certain charm to it. But if they were outside help hired for the job then it seems an odd choice.The biggest complaint I have about this game, though, is the controls. It's done entirely with the mouse as you click on a toy and drag it around, but there's a huge disconnect between cursor and toy, and often you'll find the former getting far ahead of the latter as you try to drag a plush around, get it jammed in something, then struggle as it either fails to respond at all, or else suddenly flies off wildly and causes you to drop it and lose the round. You can essentially take any notion of precision you have and check it in at the door, coz you won't be needing it for this game.As hugely irritating as that was, I did still love the basic premise and breezed through it quickly enough to not stay too mad at it. Although I feel the price is a little steep for what it is and couldn't recommend it for any more than half the current €4 asking price. More content or modes would have been nice, but if you have the patience for the controls and want some cute little puzzles to solve, this is worth trying out.			"

												If someone had come up to me and asked me to play a game about arranging soft-toys on a bed, i would have laughed. That was until i played Plush. Its just a wonderful idea and possibly therapeutic as well. Each toy type has rules about what will make it happy so in each level you make all the soft toys happy to win that level. So what's great about that? Well everything about it relaxes you, from the music, to the lovable toy designs - unicorns are my fav - to the level of challenge. It provides just enough challenge but never gets frantic or frustrating.If you've had too much shooting, killing and blowing up stuff, and need to calm down, making soft toys happy is just what I'd recommend :)			"

												Plush, while a relatively simple game probably aimed towards children, is still enjoyable for older gamers. The graphics are both cute but pretty well done, and the little girl's voice reactions really add some charm. Most of the levels are relatively easy, but they do get more difficult the further into the game you get, to the point where you need to be very careful in how you move that hippo unless you want all of your other stuffed animals all over the floor.The only problems I really had with the game were the controls. When you pick up an animal, you never know if you're going to grab an arm, a leg, or their butt, and when you drag your mouse, the animal follows behind it like it's tethered to a bungee cord. While you learn to adapt to it, the gameplay would be much better with more precise controls. Otherwise, it's pretty fun just to fling stuffed animals all over the place.Buy it on sale and enjoy a relaxing casual game.			"
