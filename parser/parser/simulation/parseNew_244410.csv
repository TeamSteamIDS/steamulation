												I hate to ""hate"" on an otherwise good game, but it's such a HUGE part of WWII, that without it, this is way off from being Grand Stratagy. The tech tree is good, battles are a little boring, but all in all, good. There is NO supply chain though. There is for your forces on the ground (local level), but not in the big picture (country level). When Germany needs more oil, it can just get it instantly from Mexico, or anyone else who will sell it to them. Like wise, the German U-boats serve no real purpose (the Battle for the Atlantic doesn't exist) as you can't sink cargo ships and attack convoys as they don't exist. There is no real point to having/building/researching any submarines as they pretty much ineffective in game. But this single point is a show stopper for me.Update to this from Battlegoat:""While Supreme Ruler 1936 simulates the wide span of WWII, like other games of the genre we have strengths and weaknesses to what we can simulate in high detail. Naval is currently not a ""specialty"" of SR1936, though we do have every intention of continuing to improve this area.-- George / BattleGoat.""From page 2 of the descusion from link:http://steamcommunity.com/app/244410/discussions/0/630802344410551969/UPDATE  OCT 20, 2016I realize this is way late and likely to not be read, but I wanted to write it anyway. It seems there is some serious issues with balance and economy in the game. Unemployment goes down and never comes back. (I know low unemployment is typicaly a good thing, but too low means you have no workforce to work if you build anything). I played a game as Brazil and after taking over most all of S. America by 1947, my UnEmpl. is 2.1% and never recovering despite growing in pop by over a million a day due to to immagration.

												OK,  I love this game,  I stumbled upon it years back now and I was so happy to find it. The game is very In depth and is the type of game where you can do anything you want in the game. There is alot to it so take your time but you can learn it. Not everyone is goin to like it, but if you like strategy games, like C&C or othe planetary control type games this is what you have been waiting for, I mean everything from government control, resource management and development, diplomacy, trading, military, soical spending, space race, researching units and tech on huge tech tree of detail and scale and to top it off, you can be any country in the world from the small island nations to the USA, China, Russia, France, and England - and there resepcted colonies of the time, also there is many other small and medium sized countires which are independent and playable from a very unique perspective. Military production and personell are under your direct control or you can let the AI do the work, you have a load of options on how they approach through user controlled to cpu/minister control also there is options for how agressive and how many casualities you should sustain during battle. There  is setup-up options galore for the map, you can win by economic, military, sphere, complete and many more options so the game is playable at many angles and replayable (try being Ireland, Liberia, Haiti, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and more) Also the historically acurate points of hisotry will/should kick in i.e. 1939 invasion of Poland, Austrian takeover, Rhineland re-occupy, Invasion of france and Russia, now For military building and deployment there is a very thorough and detailed unit line up with historically accurate units of the period army, navy, airforce. check out my youtube intro video :

												They've been releasing the 'Supreme Ruler' title ever since 1983 and the original Z-80/DOS version.  That version is the only one they've ever finished.  SR 1936 here was 'fully released and finished' just a couple months ago (summer 2014) and in many peoples opinions is far from finished.  Not to worry though, they've already got SR Ultimate on Early Release.. this'll be about the 5th iteration of the title and just as unlikely to be actually a finished game as the others.			"

												I stumbled upon Supreme Ruler 2010 years ago and ever since then I have been hooked on the Supreme Ruler series. Having played the previous titles and almost 60 hours of 1936 I can say the game is great so far even with the current beta issues. The issues which are to be expected as the game is still in beta do render the game unplayable and require you to start over but when the issues’ happen you can report them and usually find a way to avoid it in the next game until a patch is released. I myself have reported a few issues and made a few suggestions all of which the developers took note of and added to their system. The gameplay in of itself can seem overwhelming to new players but if you spend the time learning to manage your economy, military, technology and diplomatic relations you will find the game very rewarding and challenging. My favorite aspects about the Supreme Ruler 1936 excluding the gameplay right now would have to be the ability to mod the game, the ability to communicate directly with the developers, the amazing community, and the lack of any anti-piracy system screwing up or limiting my ability to enjoy the game.

												I have many hundreds of hours into SR 2020 from before the time of Steam. I have bought 2 of the newer versions of Supreme Ruler on Steam... Cold War and 1936. Both of which seem to be unfinished versions of the same game they continue to re release every few years with a new and improved version. Ultimate being the newest version. Is the game bad? No... but it will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth when you realize the limitations of the game and the seemingly lack of desire of the devs to actually make the game work like it should. If you have never played a Supreme Ruler game then the newest version might not be too bad of an investment... but dont be bitter when they decide to make Super Ultimate version and leave your copy unfinished and unsatisfying.

												supreme ruler 1936 is a rough gem, i would recommend it to people who love RTT games like command and conquer.the good;-extended tech tree with technologies and units that go to around 2150.-good simple and very functional economy, though it takes a while to understand it.-good logistics system that may be a little obscure to understandthe bad;-unit controls, it still suffers badly from a lack of good management option for your units, your battlegroups are overly simplistic and it can take hours to create a functional OOB for a major nation only to see it destroyed within a few days of combat as the units throw themselves away against entrenched defenders one by one.

												The game isvery unique and very in-depth however there are just a few things i can't deal with while playing it.- Tons of bugs and crashes; be prepared.- Few updates. They made this game and updated it a little and now they are working on supreme ruler *ULTIMATE* which they ask another 30$ for. So don't expect♥♥♥♥♥♥to change unless you buy the new game which may or may not carry all the bugs and crashes with it.- Ai is dumb. If you like to micro some parts of your country and let the ai do the rest you will get screwed. Expecially if your ai control your military. They will suicide ships and♥♥♥♥♥♥- Diplomacy is really bad. Ai will spam you the same trade offer multiple times even though you decline it. Also, trading is unfair.- The speed meter thing is really bad. If you get like a year into the game the fastest speed lags and becomes really slow. Give it a few more years and it'll slow down to be unplayable. Even with a really good computer don't expect anything different.- Going back to the ai being dumb, don't expect them to be challanging.I can't recommend this game because it feels like an early access game. Also I feel jipped that they released this game gave it a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates then went off to make another game. I also own Supreme ruler 2020 and I do not recommend that either. If you go off to buy the ultimate version expect it to be unfinished and buggy too. "

												The Supreme Ruler series is one of the best grand strategy games you can find on Steam.I started out with Supreme Ruler 2020 and played the hell out of it before and even after the Gold version came to Steam. With Supreme Ruler 1936 you not only get a better optimezed engine that can handle even more units and events than the previous one, but you get a time period that is extremely interesting to play in the Grand strategy scenario. While the game might not look like much (graphics wise), it makes up for it with its superb and in-depth gameplay. You are the ruler of a nation, you take all the important decisions and even command your troops into battle as you take the territory of your enemy bit by bit. What I like about this game compared to other Grand Strategy games is that while it is hex based, the style in which your units or the enemy units capture a territory is shown in a more interactive way making it feel like your actions truly have a great impact on the world. The tech tree is also something to be amazed of, each tech you unlock as you progress through the years has a significant impact on the game and how you play the game and if you are able to survive the onslaught of enemies. The economy is also complex and at times quite hard to manage, luckily the difficulty level can be adjusted to give new players an easier start on managing their resources. The buildings you can construct to help your economy range from simple wood managing complex to uranium mines. The economy also plays an important role on your armies, without petroleum your units will not move, without ammunition they will not fire, without construction materials you will not be able to build new structures and without food your population and army reservers will die. The game is a must own to all Grand Strategy players, the game not only offers a singleplayer campaign and different skirmish / scenarios to play but also a multiplayer mode where you can fight with other players that control their own nations in real time.

												What els can I say? You can invade the world as the nazis, colonize Europe and manage to actually beat the USSR. You can beat the Americans to the nuclear bomb, be the first into space, make the internet and land on mars! You can also mod the game and have a modern world or a fictional one. {THIS IS THE SHORT REVIEW}{NOW TIME FOR THE BIG REVIEW}The AI has been improved A LOT compared to the 2020 AI and Cold War AI. Still has the bugs and Frame Rate problems, but eh, it's a good game.The military system is good and your ministers tend to send random units to Siberia, where they will stay there for the rest of the game, unsupplied. But if get far enough with tech and get some decent supply planes, then bobs your uncle. But the unit would be a T-26 and useless.The supply system isn't that great, I prefer the 2020 one. I don't have 2020 in my steam games, because I bought it off Amazon and I put over 500 hours into 2020 and I loved the supply system. The supply system in 2020 was really... well, just put a few supply depots around the country and build some roads and most of your country will be supplied really well. It's a different story in 1936, it doesn't spread as well as it did in 2020.Every game has their cons, even a game like this that I play a lot. The tutorial isn't really helpful, it's complicated, doesn't really explain much and just a mind boggle really. It's like they translated the tutorial from Russian to German to Arabic and then back to German and then English. So I suggest watching people play the game or you can just go exploring the game yourself. The game feels like it's not finished and the AI still isn't amazing. Battlegoat are trying tho and I hope they spend a few years on making the new Supreme Ruler so they can really improve the AI and improve the FPS and reduce the lag. (And I like the graphics the way they are)The economic system is meh, but I hate it when the ministers try lowering the taxes on the resources to 0%, so you have  lock them out of it and when you lock a minister from the resources, you lock them from trading. Yes, you can trade on the world market manually, but you have to keep an eye on the prices too see if they go down or up. And oil in this game, the production of oil is so small. You have to literally spam oil derricks until you get arthritis so you can be self-sufficent in petrol.Even with all the bugs this game has, it's still fun and good. Deserves more attention for it to be a great game. I already got 4 people into the game they got more people into the game.The game is good for wasting time, playing with friends and Role Playing. I suggest getting modes for it, because it can get boring playing the same scenario. I rate this game a 7/10 Please share the Supreme Ruler series with your friends and guide them to be world dominators so they can teach others.			"

												  So far, I think you guys are definitely heading in the right direction :) I have loved and enjoyed playing all of your previous supreme ruler games and this doesn't let up at all. In fact, this is my favorite time period so I was very happy you guys decided to start at 1936 :) I hope one day, and yes I am thinking far ahead but I can dream, that you make a world war 1 scenario or maybe a world war 1 expansion/dlc. Of course I understand that won't be for a year or more but I think the mechanics of this game would also work really well for world war 1. The OOB structuring for this game can be very complicated and I just wish you made the whole set up a bit easier. Maybe a whole new interface option to organize all of your units better. I would also like to see more scripted events and will you be adding anymore historical units such as the nkvd, imperial guard, ss, etc...?   Another good idea would be giant infrasctucture projects like the five year plan that the soviets had with the farm collectivisation. This could add more economy to your nation before 1939 that otherwise you might not get right and screw up very easily and then have to start over. Most players will be new and even the old ones like me still are learning from this game. It would be nice to get a little help in the scenarios. The autobahn could be a major project that would cost a certain amount of money to build a unique road in germany that gives really fast movement for their troops that no other nation has. This will give them the advantage that they had back then. The giant steelworks projects and farm collecting the soviets did could also have an event that adds a lot of farms in ukraineand metal mines back by the urals. Also, Japan building the yamamoto. You can have an option to build it but it would put a big strain on the economy althought you would have the best and biggest battleship in the pacific til the end of the war practically. England can get the option to build an intelligence center which has the ability to crack german codes which would slow your overall tech research down to gain the best counterintelligence/espionage of any nation. It will also have options to boost your spying capabilities. Amrerica can obviously get massive industrial, consumer, and military supplies production. You can go to a lot of areas with this idea. I think it would really add more uniqueness to the major sides than it already has. My final say. THUMBS UP. It is in good working condition right now. Anything from here on out is just adding more to an already working game. So come join the community and play and help make it even better. They need new ideas like how I mentioned a ww1 scenario and also more scripted events that could add unique unit as well as certain PROJECTS that nations will be allowed to do :)			"

												I have only put 30 hours into this game, but have easily put 500 hours into the series in total. My opinion? Stay away. If you want large scale strategy based around modern/semi modern warfare, get Hearts of Iron 3. It is a better game in almost every way.The SR series of games are large scale stragey games based in the 20/21st centruries.You control the economy, diplomacy, government and military of any nation you choose.The problems with this game:1)There is no tutorial (or at least not a very good tutorial). Be prepared to spend plenty of time trying to figure out how the game works (The economy is especially convoluted)2)The territory system is a mess. conquering a country will often result in it being broken up and divided in the most nonsensical way possible. 3)The AI is abysmal. For Example: As Canada, I helped France obliterate Germany, barely having to cede land at any point (Hard/Hard/Hard), not because of skill, but because the AI does not understand how to use their armies properly.4)As the game progresses, the performance gradually gets worse, until the game is unplayable. I have never been able to ""finish"" a game because of this, usually after 6 years the game runs so poorly that I have to quit.The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that once you figure it out, the economic system is somewhat entertaining. You aren't able to transform a fledgeling nation into a super power overnight, and resources have to be carefully managed and balanced.I like the concept of the SR series, but the games are not rewarding or challenging in a fun way. If you are thinking of getting this game, or any game in the SR series, make sure you try Hearts of Iron first. It is better in nearly every way imaginable.			"

												This game is one of the most complex strategy games I've ever played. I mean, I needed 12 hrs. of playtime only for the Tutorial. *lol*Supreme Ruler 1936 is a global political-warfare simulation that begins in early 1936 and can be played into the 2070s. Yes, the 2070s. That is when the tech tree runs out. You can literally start the game with biplanes, and end up fighting with Mechs. You have the ability to play as any major or minor power, with thousands of possible unit designs to select from. Complex economic system and technology tree. You can choose between 54 different countries in the sandbox modus. World Ruler with Liberia? No problem in this game. xDGameplay is fairly simple; it is basically a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. Controls are standard for most RTS games—the ability to select large numbers of units at once, and other basic RTS controls. Furthermore, selections can be screened for specific unit types (air, naval or land) allowing for mass movement of forces. Land units are further divided in general categories—artillery, infantry, transport, armor, etc. Technology is fairly straightforward. Some can be traded or bought from other countries, while some have to be researched by each country individually and are non-tradable. Diplomacy is fairly detailed, with a wide variety of agreements possible, but given the scope of the game can be somewhat odd at times.The combat system in SR36 is really the shining achievement of the game. “Chaos” perhaps describes it best—explosions, units advancing and retreating, the roar of naval gunfire, strafing aircraft, often at the same time. Units have detailed statistics outlining everything from their defense rating to weapons ranges.Supreme Ruler 1936 is an unique game and if you like detailed warfare strategy games then try it out!

												Okay...to start I'd like to say this game is still in beta, and although not the prettiest of games it is one of the funnest and in depth Political RTS's I could find and be more than willing to pay for again. The game is regularly updated as well so no need to worry about support. The economic portion of the game is very quick to learn, there is a slight learning curve at first but if you're used to the Genre or have played any of the other Supreme Ruler games (I haven't) you'll probably love it and ask for even more! The one thing that really bugs me sometimes is the troop movement and the supply lines...obviously if you have enemy troops cutting off supply lines that's one thing, but if you do have open supply lines and your troops still aren't getting the supplies you do have available it gets a bit tedious and annoying (you'll have ships or troops stranded in the ocean or enroute to take an opposing countries capital and just be completely stuck until another unit comes with supplies). Overall I'd give the game a 7 maybe 8 out of 10 with a strong reccomendation with more to come and several campaigns and only one scenario at the moment, multiplayer and much more in store for this game. Please help them out by buying it early and posting in the forums!			"

												First off, i've been playing Supreme Ruler games since 2020, and all Supreme ruler games are TIME CONSUMING if you have that ""Dominate the world"" mindset. I'll get right to the pros and cons of the gamePros____- VERY strategic, at times, actually difficult. (I think thats a good thing.)- Military research tree has a lot of units- Economic system is semi complex and polished out. (Nothing new if you've played the other SR games, though.)- More options in Diplomacy tabs.- Axis and Allied powers that CAN be shifted (Example: Russia became axis rather than ally, I succeeded in becoming an allied power in the game as Japan)Cons____- Clunky UI- Lots of bugs- If you don't have oil you are useless. (I have to spend about 5-6 months trading majority of my cash money on oil and get a HUGE stockpile (16 mil barrels or so.) just before i decide to go to war. - Game AI is STUPID. You need to handle everything yourself, which can make you feel overwhelmed- Your troops run out of fuel very easily, making them USELESS.- Dont expect updates for this game.- other countries always spam trade requests that usually suck for you. usually.- Some countries are absolutely useless.- Some Graphic cards make this game unplayable (Example :NVIDIA GEFORCE) they havent been able to play in 2020, though i havent tested this in SR 1936, but i would expect the results to be the same so if you have a Geforce do some research first.ALL IN ALL 6.5/10			"

												its a very good game. i think people should stop looking at it for its bugs or problems and start looking at the good points.     1st: it has a very detailed hex map, most games like HOI4 would have provinces the equivellant of 7 hex's together.     2nd: the economy management is very detailed     3rd: research&development goes from 1914 to the future. which is an impressive amount of effort, that needs to be                      awarded    4th: there is no restrictions to whatever you want to do, for example you could backstab your allies, demand 1billions worth of goods from your allies and pay only like a couple hundred million     5th: it simulates how your millitary performs, affects your evonomy. like if you have built too much units, the maintanance will take up your profits, and if you increase taxes, your gdp will slow down increasing/ start to go down.     6th: infrastructure is physical and can be seen whereas in HOI4, its just a value in its condition, so like if i wanted my enemy to lose all i have to do is bomb their land production.     7th: interesting things happen, random events happen to different countries. on one of my saves, america went into a 97 billion dollar debt, another one japans mainland got invaed by china, another one romania invaded russia while germany only pushed at infantry speed. another, finland gained ground on england, ireland took back the north (but later lost though, sad), america invaded all of the american continent, england became facist, south africa became facist, hungary invaded yugoslavia. and to be honest it gets interesting as time goes on, all of the above in the 7th category are from sandbox though.     8th: russia invaded germany(me) and i built a wall to keep them out, but they went around it, invading hungary, romania, italy and went through the austrian-italian border to get to me.                                                                                          CONS    1st: files go corrupt    2nd: there is only 1 explosion animation    3rd: at about 1940-50 you cant keep up with the demand for consumer goods and eventually you have to buy them, then a bit more, then alot, and then youve no money to buy them.    4th: countries dont send you help, but if your lucky youll get that 1, ww1 infantry that gets blown up before it can touch the enemy    5th: if your not a middle eastern country or romania, or russia, say gg to getting oil.    6th: austria doesnt agree to the annexation thing, as far as i know it wasnt an invasion by germany but a contract handing austria to germany.(sandbox)    7th: japan loses the chinese war (sandbox)                                                                                 CONCLUSIONa gernerally good game, i give it a 9/11, i would only be able to keep playing if my saves would not corrupt themselves			"

As for the game itself, Runs much smoother then previous tittles. A must have for any RTS/WW2/Military sim gamer. The worst thing I can say about the game is its in WW2, I prefered the 2020 scenario myself. but many may not find that to be a negative. There are mods out there that can make this game play with modern weaponry. Or you can play your WW2 game into modern weapons (the devs included all units from prevous tittles to the year 2090 or somthing like that). Again support this game, this genre.			"

												I'm a long time Civ player but SC36 takes the prize as the ultimate management game imo.  It's so complex that it takes a while to figure out but it's worth it.  Players have complete control over every aspect of the game: industrialization, research, social investment, diplomacy, espionage, militarization, theater strategy, tactics, and more.  You can play as whichever country you want (Uruguay, New Zealand,...), however you want.  The game has an outstanding underlying economic model that's intricate, well balanced, and challenging to manage.  Nation development is throttled but in a realistic way rather than the ""you're just holding me back"" methods other games use to slow us down.  The enemy AIs are also fairly decent though I've not let my advisors have much control so I can't speak for the intelligence of your helpers.  With this level of complexity, the UI can be clumsy at times but Red Goat seems to be improving it with intelligent patches.  In the meantime, you'll want to save often because one mis-click can completely ruin a game and if you like to control every aspect of the game like I do, a game can take a very long time.  Overall, it's just a very challenging, very fun game!			"

												What a game ...Battlegoat, I salute you. I've been a fan of your Supreme Ruler IP, for better or worse, for many years. This incarnation fixes all my major grievances with the series. Island capture isn't game-breaking, AI is more intelligent and seems independent from player actions (so, more like real-world, less like script or poor geopolitical logic).I could go on and on, but for fear of sounding like some kind of fan-boy, which im not, i'll leave it at this:The series is awesome. This Supreme Ruler, as a pre-1.0 version, is better than any of the other versions in their final development patches. Performance++, Immersion++, Fun++. Pat yourselfs on the back for me, because a plane ticket is expensive, and some random guy showing up and touching all of you would be creepy, anyway.So bravo, and /slowclapinawe. Good work. Thanks for this, and keep it up.			"

												This game is unfinished, and because they've made a new game they've stopped updating this unfinished game, I feel somewhat cheated because they announced that they were making Ultimate shortly after they released 1936, and so 36 remains buggy and sadly it suffers because of it, but it's still pretty fun, especially if you get mods.Dont buy this, buy ultimate, maybe it's better.

												Ruined by the combat mechanic or lack of.    An otherwise good game is simply ruined by the combat.   There's no strategy involved, simply drag a box around your units and order them to attack somewhere.    Every video posted is simply drag a box around everything and attack some country.   The series is in a bad need of a combat overhall, some hierarchy structure is needed and I'd suggest unit cards similiar to hearts of iron using either icon or nato symbols.  Can't recommend the game until the combat is overhauled, which I doubt we will see as BG keeps trying to milk the cow doing the same thing game after game.   It's a shame because supreme ruler (all of them) could have been so much more if it only had more strategical combat.			"

												Well, I am very excited to have finally downloaded and played the game.  I spent a long time figuring out what I am supposed to do and I think tha this is a super fun war simulation game that brings back a lot of memories from games I liked back in the day and crossed my fingers for something like it to come out.  However, I can't really figure out the game totally because the ""tutorial"" option is for some reason grayed out and says that it's unavailable.  Without an actual manual, I don't think I'll ever pass beyond any point to actually unlock the tutorial.  Personally, I'd prefer to be forced into playing the tuturial, then being allowed to play the actual game.  Not the other way around.  If anyone has any pointers, please let me know.  Because this game seems like it would be pretty cool.			"

												The game at first, strikes you as the same as SRCW, then the reality hits. The ticks are much improved. I let this run for almost 2 days now and the ticks are still fairly quick at the fastest setting. Unlike the old days of my SR2020 games where I'd alt tab it into the background for weeks on end and when you did go back to check, the ticks would take forever. sometimes 1-2 minutes per tick or more. There is a lot of work to do yet, that I can see. But for the most part I like it. Some things I've found:- When you play as a country that isn't a known tech powerhouse, you are limited. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but playing as Mexico, I have not been able to get tanks. I can't even trade for them. - I wish I could minimize the tool bars. I play on a 14"" alienware and with all the clutter I don't have much of a window to see things.- Somtimes things just seem to pause when building. Buildings, tech research, and unit building. They just freeze. I found if you pause, then unpause or save and then resume it fixes this. - A lot of pathing issues to resolve yet I see too. As Mexico I was invading Germany, then I invaded Romania. I was then attacked by France, so for some reason, my units decided to hit the coast near Constanta and turned into merchant vessels and just sat there spinning. I clicked on them and told them to unload at the port there and everything was fixed at that point. - The BG forums themselves are having problems these days too. I went to log in and it said there was no record of my account. So I made a new one. I never got the activation email after 12 hours so I clicked to send a new one. Again it says no record of account. So again I try to make a new one and now it says I can't cause an account already exists. It's a circle of frustration. - The next game, I'd like to see this SR format where you can go from a caveman society to future tech. With expanding influence/country borders like SR offers.			"

												Axis and Allies the Board Game is better.   Wait what am I saying that game is awesome regardless.  I found at a Strategic Level the game is pretty well idiot proof.  Build Units, Click, Tell them to Point A or B and the AI just takes care of the rest.  This isn't much strategy outside trying to stay technologically a head of everyone else and planning a war not actually commanding and fighting a war.    It's just build armies, build up the economy, build factories, build more troops.  I found myself bored after conquering my first two countries.   I see this game would of been much better as a Turn Based Strategy game, but sadly even then there are already better games out there which are Turn Based.  Over all it's just pointlessly time consuming and not really all that entertaining.  Though on the Plus side, I did enjoy how you captured territories, it was slightly entertaining at first watching my armies fight, rooting them on as I tried to reinforcements to them in time.  But in general, it became quite old fast.   I may find myself revisiting this game later down the line when it's finished completely.   As it is in BETA still, but as it is now... it isn't worth spending money on in my opinion.			"

												A Wonderful combo of SR2020 and SR Cold War. It takes the best elements of each game into account and makes it own new innovations. The map is high def and nice to look at and the zoomed out army squares are helpful in troop movement and knowing who is in what shape and doing what, not to mention the Airforce logos to tell where your planes are.Sandbox is still a fun all out war land with the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" nations being alive and well and the strategy aspect being as good as ever with having to think every single move you make. Super Power Nations are still powerful and small nations still arent giving the challenge when playing a smaller nation.The Campaign is of course still in development but what you can play is in more depth then previous games and works very well, playing as a german influenced Italy.Multiplayer needs flushing out, its the same system which works to a degree but is somewhat meh, I know its a beta but even still, I'd rather an easier way to link with my friends and online games that are open.all in all a great game, I highly reccommend picking up even the Beta.

												This game can be fun, but it is completely broke. The economic system doesn't work at all, and it's very annoying when you can't conquer the Australian outback only because your troops run out of reinforcements after 30 seconds in the desert. Also the production of new equipment doesn't work at all, for example my factories produced thousands of platoon bridges instead of tiger tanks. I would rather recommend to buy Hearts of Iron, or at least Supreme Ruler Ultimate, because this game gets updates.(neither Supreme Ruler 1936 nor Cold War does)			"

												PROS: A decent economy model.   You build factories that supply both the consumer and military, anywhere from timber, coal, consumer goods, electricity, etc.  Supply works much better than in HOI3.  There is no shortage of units or unit types with no significant lag.  The game is easy to mod.  AI ministers can take over almost all aspects of the game, eliminating undesired micromangement.  The game has a lot going for it under the hood, most of it working well.  Battlegoat has a good reputation for supporting its games and the developers are active and involved with the community.CONS: No decent manual and inadequate explanations on how things work.  While the game isn't difficult to navigate, you suffer a lack of information about the technology trees (some techs are dead ends).   The sub war vs convoys isn't in the game.  The naval war takes a backseat to the land and air war.   Factory repair particularly with colonies is a complete mystery.  Faction balancing needs to be addressed particularly with Russia who seems to get beat up by Romania as ridicious as it sounds unless you start the 1940 campaign.  Gibraltar does not stop the Italian navy from leaving the Mediterraen as silly as that is.			"

The AI in singleplayer is sadly not as smart as i had hoped but what made me crave more was the fact that the AI could actually invade islands now (due to the fact that they automatically get into ships, in 2020 you needed to build ships especially) Sure its hard to lose in singleplayer even if you are a poor player but that is why for better players you can turn of the automatic movement of LAND SEA AND AIR.

This is an issue as i must send my entire military to assist in the defence of Korea. Also the butchering of history. Germany's flag was a swastika, not the standard german flag. This angers me quite a bit as it is illogical that they wouldnt follow historical guidelines that must be met in any and all games relating to the past. it'd be as if you made the Soviet flag without the hammer and sickle.

												I was really looking forward to this game but having downloaded it two days ago I must say I am very very dispointed.The game appears to be neither a strategic level (control the army/corps/whatever organisational unit) as the AI appears to do odd things (naval units appear to wander aimlessly around the map) and there is no ability to set up an organisational structure or introduce combined arms tactics, or a squad leader type game as units appear incapable of any type of real control authority.Now you could say this is like real life, and I suppose to some extent it might be, but I don't want real life.  Its a game for goodness sake.  I want to feel in command, I want to organise my units as I see fit.  I want them to do as they are told (within reason).If the game is pretending to be strategic, with the AI controlling individual units (and by the way nobody has as yet produced a computer based wargame that can cope adequately with the AI involved in such a demanding task) then let the player order divisions/corps around and let the AI try and do the unit grunt work ( and good luck with the outcome) or lets control the units and their deployment and play at unit level( then the AI is not so important.As it is I find the game not only disapointing but very frustrating.And please, please give us NATO symblos instead of the silly little cartoon type icons ( they suck), or at least a choice.This purchase was money badly spent.  Don't buy this game.			"

												I personally love games that make you think and not just click around. I am also a big fan of Masters of the World by Eversim however their games are bugged really bad.Supreme Ruler 1936 has great potential to be a very indepth game if the developers make it as such. I honestly feel this game  could use way more content, i dont really like the fact they named limited themselfs to the 1936 era, instead this should have been like a scenario. Developers should add more to the game to make it feel like you truely are changing the world. Perhaps a UN where you can vote and veto laws of necualer weapons use, or to stop a country from getting too powerful. But overall this is a review for the game, and i definatly recommend it. Games such as this are rare and deserve every penny of finacial support to succeed futher.			"

												Started as UK. Took Ireland. Tried for ages to get alliances for WW2 but no one would help. Germany got bigger and bigger, then allied with Italy. France attacked Germany alone. I attacked Germany alone. I kicked the s*** out of Germany then annexed it. Just as I put all my units into reserve, USSR attacked me. I kicked the s*** out of them too and took Moscow. Then the election came and I lost it and became dictator. Then the trouble started......Love it!			"

												First of all, the game is generally a good strategy game, eventhough there are several weak points.I would like to point out some of the weaknesses that I think need attention:1. The game is running too slow, though you have the option to change the time cycle, but it is still not significatly helping the game's time frame. When it is running slow, it can make you bored at some point.2. You will find it hard to replenish or reinforce your current forces, as it takes a while to train and produce your war machines.It will be better to shorten the time needed to produce a unit.3. Battle could be pretty boring, since there is no option for you to have a detailed direct control of the units while battling the enemy.4. Relationships between countries could be tricky to maintain and I could say that it is not historically correct. For those who prefer their own stories, then it does not really matter, but if you are looking for something that historically accurate, then the game should have an option for that.In conclusion, the game is pretty good, though it has several weak points, but I still recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy game.Developer please improve the game wherever possible! Thank you.			"

												When I first played this game I had no idea what to do(the tutorial was not helpful). So I had to figure the game out on my own and it was tricky. However, it may have taken me alot of time to figure things out, but when i figured out how to play the game it was worth the frustration. I don't think I've masterd everything but I have figuerd out how to get Estonia(small country next to USSR)to beat Germany, Itally, USSR, Egypt, the balkans, Poland, and France(not because I declared war beacuse Itally took it over). There was a glich that I used, but still, for me that's impressive to have all this land when i started out with less than Ohio(I didn't messure but it's problly close).Overall the game is challanging and complex. If you're looking for a game that's easy and friendly, well than, look somewhere else.Hail Estonia!!!			"

												Hey all! I've been playing this game non-stop its really fun! It is a great game for strategy gamers and WW2 geeks alike(I will admit im a pretty big one myself!). For it allows you to go with historical events or just flat-out destroy them. I recommend this game to any strategy gamers that might be interested in this wonderfully created game. The diplomatic system is pretty balanced and economics are good too. But my favorite part is the combat, you can steamroll your enemy with brute force or you can play crafty with airborne troops. Speaking of combat the units are really well balanced. I can not lie though that the game can be hard at times but that is one of the parts that makes it fun and really interesting. So now i leave it to you to deside to get the game and lead you nation through the horors of WW2 and beyond.			"

												Maybe its because I´m new to the Supreme-Ruler-series, but I cannot recommend this game. For long-time strategy players like me its just to arcade-like in its warfare part. But its easier to make a list anyway.PROs- the economic side is cool. You can built and reinforce your economic sectors in six categories and three manufactured goods. Plus you trade surplus and buy things you lack with ease.- the builtup for war is easy. Units are built with land-/naval-/aircraft-factories in different cities. Plus you can hold them in reserve so they don´t clutter the map and cost immense resources- I like the importance of recon units and the extra range of artillery. Makes the tactical combat fun.CONs- research is far reaching, but the easy way to trade it, destroys the fun. If you have researched the general tech, you can trade or buy unit-schemes from friends (or just anybody) for next to nothing. As Italy I ended up with advanced carriers of Japanese design and cool German recon units. Plus I think that there should be far more not tradeable research areas, so it´s more difficult to excel in research as a minor nation. - producing units is very cheap, so you end up piling up units in reserve. which leads to:- in my view your armies are far to vast to really control them properly in all theatres. So you end up losing small or prestigious units somewhere without even noticing it right away. Even units like carriers can be destroyed in seconds (which I did) or four submarine in a wolfpack are oblitarated in a glimpse. Its better in land and air combat, but naval combat just goes on to fast.- the AI is not useless, but not very clever either. For example: As Germany attacked Poland the Western front to France was unguarded. Later it tried an invasion of Britain only with (zillions) of transports risking a good portion of its army. Fortunatly for Germany the British navy drove around aimlessly.- the manual does not explain very much. So I looked in forums and learned much the ""hard way"" via losing.For me Supreme Ruler 1936 has many fun aspects, but it´s not properly balanced and too confusing in large scale combat. The AI is not clever enough to watch theatres for you (not mentioning your Allies) so you win mostly by sheer numbers.			"

If your new to title id recomend starting with 2020 and once you have 2020 down you will find that 1936 is not as complex as when you frist played it. Also one of the thing that frist put my off about the title was how crap the garphics are, but when 20 nations are all fielding 7500 units you will quickly understaned why they are crap.			"

(or No-A.i) dont do almost nothing.  Is WW2, and USA dont attack no one, With germany i conquered all europe, and at 1944 Was i who declared to USA.... The A.i. (Or No-A.i.) make the game boring, if is not multiplayer.And they promise Steam Integration on this one, untill now, and developer say to me:   ""We never say that would be Steam integration"" - But at realease they promise that.http://www.bgforums.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=23289Happy gaming, Refund me plz.Edit: Another update but nothing major fixed, now they only work on SR ultimate...

												A bad engine doesn't get better if you add a few units. All Supreme Rulers before had been horrible and so is this! It is a modification of the games of that series before, not more. Supreme Ruler could be the game every grand strategy gamer is wishing for, but for whatever reason, the designers seem to give the game the finger.

												As a veteran of games like the Hearts of Iron series I am no stranger to complex strategy games.  Indeed looking at the vidoes of this game I thouogbt I was going to love it.  Boy was I wrong.The game is bewilderingly complex with little or no help to overcome this.  The tutorial was pointless at explaining anything, only highlighting my confusion.   There are just too many things to do in too much detail that might or might not matter very much.  Where should I put this oil well?  Well there are glowing lines on the map which presumably matter... and there is some sort of produciton chain but I was unclear on if that had any geographical significance. BUTThat all becomes trivial when I engaged, or should I say 'watched', my first battle.  Troops literally wander around all over the place...I am sure this game is amazing once you get into it, or if you have played their games before.  As a newcomer and hard core strategy games veteran I honestly couldn't be bothered...1/5			"

												Absolutely no improvement on the User Interface, Interface, Game Mechanics, Performance or Graphics from the previous SR 2020 and SR CW (Which I own both).Forums are almost deserted and you could see the dustdevils in the modding section.During the game No relevant information is immediately available to player and even the most basic tasks require multiple clicks.Stay away from it unless they reduce the price to something along the lines of $12-15, for all of the Supreme Ruler games.

												The game is very difficult to understand.  The Tutorial mission is kind of pointless as in it tells you to do a few varied things but doesn't really explain why you should be doing them.  You don't have a feel for how long it takes things to construct, or what order they're going to contruct in.  I set up 10-15 things to build and had no idea what order they were going to happen.  As for the buildings, what are the benefits of each and why should you build them?  I was looking for something a bit more straight forward for construction management such as in the games Civ. 4 or Civ 5.  After spending 3 hours with a game I expect to understand the basic game mechanics... but this game still eludes me.  The ""manual"" off the website does little to clear up these issues and is far from complete.The concept has promise.  With a drastic overhaul to the menu system it might be enjoyable.  As is, if you've never played this series before DON""T BUY IT because you won't understand how to play.  I rate this game a 4 out of 10.			"

												Though this game can probably be very enjoyable, in it's current state I don't recommend it to new players to the Supreme Ruler series. Basic game mechanics are explained only superficially in a short tutorial. Understanding warfare, diplomacy, research and how to manage your economy and population will require you to wade through a wiki made for other games in the Supreme Ruler series, which isn't completely applicable to Supreme Ruler 1936. The Steam community luckily is helpful to a point, however a game company can't just leave the responsibility of getting to know the basics of a game to the community.IMHO a game company delivers an incomplete product, when it doesn't give you an adequate manual or at least a decent tutorial with the full release of a game. This holds especially true for a complex game like Supreme Ruler 1936. Instead you are left to mostly figure the game out for yourself.			"

												Recondmended if on sale only...read on....I have played every one of this games editions. I am not alone in the long term community when I say, this may be the worst one yet. Sadly that would make this 2 in a row since Cold War was worse than 2020. It is still worth playing but nothing like the previous entries. It appears some of the tech is missing, not even sure if this game was really ready for release but here it is. If you do play, play one of the larger countries as you will find playing sandbox as a small nation a big let down. The tech trees only appear to be done for USA, Germany ect. If you want to be Peru or something, your out of luck. Controlling your battle has gotten much worse than previous titles. It is pretty much, click goto war button and then just let it play out and hope for the best. You can achieve some control by altering the theatre of war settings for the various locals but all that achieves is telling your AI to attack a general area. If you gather troops and send direct, it will almost always end in a disaster since the AI system has ZERO intelligence written into it. This leaves one last choice of controlling each unit individually, but who the hell wants to control thousands of units by hand???  The diplomacy system is still wacked. You can get just about anyone to sell you tech regardless of what it is. But a few things in this area has been improved with this title in this area. Basically this game over the past titles have gone the way certain developers have wanted, the community have been asking for things, the devs have ignored them. If you goto thier forums and post anything negative your banned. And one of the devs feels it is within his place to tell customers here on steam that our opinion(the customers) dont count. So this is the end result of what happens when devs build the game ""they"" want. Sometimes it doesn't turn out the way customers want. The game is worth about 20 bucks as that is about the amount of enjoyment you will get. Be prepared for patches during the next 2 years as at least this company generally continues to support the titles after release for awhile. 2020 would be scored 7 of 10, Cold War 6 of 10...I would score this game 5 of 10.

												I want to love this game, but there seems to be ether a lack of information, and or some annoying bugs, as well as weird AI. Game I am currently playing as I write this. I am Ethiopia, at war with Italy. I has swept Italy off Africa with almost no opposition.Every single town I came a across, had not a single garrison defence, so basically I was capturing town including capital cities, with almost no difficulty. I might add since it was my first game, I left the difficulty of military on normal, so I would be expecting at least some type of challange, especially being I am Ethiopia fighting Italy.So yeah for a game that is suppose to be no longer in beta, it is kinda got some major flaws.To add, my troops, I give them an order to go from a, to b. they move half way, then just sit there... looking for a safe rout, and wont move at all tille I order them to move again. THey have full fuel, full supplies... But they just sit there, no enemies between them.Worse is the fact that when another nation captures land (yours or others) all the stuff gets damaged, BUt they AI never repairs them, this has to be the worst of the series I have played so far.

												Its a great game but VERY glitchy i can tell i like it but i want these fixed 1. my units never actually take capitals they just wait outside2. it is almost impossible to invade islands dont know if its designed or what i just cant do it there are no ports i guess3. just suggesting something i want to be able to take over and customize dead regions like Quebec for instance i want to be able to turn it into a millitaristic dictatorship axis alligned you know it would just take a bit of dropdown menu work (easier said than done) 4. the ability to just let go of colonies like if i want to play as france but not the most of northern afirica5. BTW all these would be sandbox only nothing against the story its pretty goodIts a great game i might check out the rest of the series now i really do love but if you did these i think it could be in my favorite games of all time list			"

												I have a bit mixed feelings about this game. Overall I would say my opinion is positive with slight mix of mild dissapointpent in later game. I did get about 30h out of this game which is pretty good number before I felt that I'm kind of losing interest. Thing is I was expecting more - the first impression of the game was very positive. There seemed to be enough wheels and buttons and complexity to keep one going for at least few hundred hours - first impression was that its even more complex than hearts of iron III with a better supply model. And it is good and challening game at the start. I started as Germany in '36 aiming to grab as much as I can without triggering the world war and then were looking forward to keep what I gain until about '66 while securing my borders and working on getting as self sufficient resources wise as I can. And it was all nice until about '39 when the first cracks of the AI started showing in the event and diplo system. Some of the events felt a bit forced, I opted to not fire the events for throwing an ultimatum to Poland. That in turn seemed to freeze the diplomatic AI of the allies who just got seemingly frozen up in some indecisive state ignoring me taking out balkan, greece, egypt and saudi arabia in short sucession until in the end Japan triggered some kind of scripted event at the end of '41 making US to get inolved in coflict. Gremany refusing to get involved with US and accepting a bunch of southern american puppets as valid war targets when defence packt with Japan triggered them made AI to go totally haywire with wars. At this point the game lost good bulk of its charm as things were no longer plausible anymore. There is no challenge to be able to declare war on Sweden and Norway without allies batting an eye and Poland sitting right nect to you doing its best to look the other way. Resrouce system and economic side is also interesting at first but the model breaks down relatively fast if you are increasing your GDP in a rapid manner by funneling majority of your resrouces into industrial expansion. There is no option to conserve manpower by using higher levels of automation or something so the demand for goods will increase faster than what the natural growth of your manpower pool (even with all the medical research you can do) is capable of coping with. I would say it is a bit simpler game than hearts of iron 3 its just that at first glance it manages to look more formidabble with higher learning curve than it actually is. I have not tried mods for this - perhaps I will return to it at a bit later date and give this thing another round if I stuble upon a promising mod. At this point it seems I'll be heading back to hearts of iron iii with historical plausibility mod to give another round of trying to get away what I described above. The combat AI - its a bit mixed bag. It's pretty competent with land units and can sort of work ok with air but it totally melts down as far as naval units go. Ships hang around solo, there is no merchant shipping to intercept so subs are sort of pointless in their traditional role. The commbat AI is capable of doing naval landings at least but unfortunately seems to be rather dumb in the way it handles it when there is opposition and it's losing transports at sea - it just ignores these losses and is happy to send your entire army against single enemy destroyer picking its nose somewhere enroute until you get involved and direct some combat ships to deal with it manually. Also - there is no naval bombers in the air section. So you cant just ignore the naval fleet side by opting instead to focus on keeping the enemy few hundred km away from your shores by building up large force of airplanes intended to attack ships. Naval balance wise - AI tends to focus on just building as many battleships as it can pretty much ignoring most other ships - cant really blame it as it stands as that seems to be the most effective tackic in this game for naval.
