												I really wanted to like this game, but I couldn't.  It suffers from the sadly all-too-common problem of being unable to decide if it wants to be serious or funny, and in trying to do both it fails to do either.  The plot is so thin that, if it is ever discovered, will revolutionalize the world of particle physics.Glueing random stuff together to make funky spaceships seems like a winning formula and it would be if it meant anything, but it doesn't.  The glue is a system of support beams to make sure that nothing ever actually touches, so your dreams of a hodge-podge junk ship quickly dillute into a flying, 3D flowchart.The missions, combat, and trivial amount of other gameplay elements cannot hope to hide that they were all added as an afterthought to the main game, and the main game is a one-trick pony.  A gimmick.  A novel idea, sure, and one that is being used in other games out there.  But it is still just a gimmick, and gimmicks do not make for good gameplay cores.So what is there besides attaching random modules to a space station, flying it around and doing a few random things to advance the ""story?""  Well, let's list them all:So now that we're done with that list, I will conclude by saying that if this is what a ""complete"" game feels like then I give up.  This would make a fine Smartphone distraction to goof around with while sipping a beer and waiting for your date to arrive and probably worth the $5 you paid for it, in such a context.  In the context of a PC game in the 21st century?  Let me put it this way: If a good PC game is like an order of nachos deluxe with all the toppings, this is game is a few saltine crackers with some cheeze whiz on top.  Not bad as a snack, but not very filling, and certainly not a real meal.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is good fun for about half an hour - you can build a wacky ship and mess around with fun weapons but that's more or less it. The flight is really difficult, though made a little easier by proper booster placement and hotkey assignment. Maybe some kind of inertial dampening block would be handy to stabilise your ship. (Edit - an ""emergency full stop"" isn't really inertial dampening...)As far as the combat goes, you clumsily maneuver yourself into a position where you MIGHT be able to attack a station and then fire your lasers - the station is dead more or less immediately without putting up a fight. You then realise your next target isn't that far away, were it not for the difficulty in getting that short distance - you will spin all the way around at least 2 or 3 times. Once you're there, same story. There isn't much incentive to build beyond your initial working ship - maybe an engineer limit based on habitat pods would be more of an incentive.Oh yes, the ship will also bump into nothing, causing a change in trajectory, when you had only just got it pointing the way you wanted.Don't get me wrong, it's fun and it has a fair amount of potential but at £11 the price is much too high for a game which offers little at this stage and has no save feature.EDIT: It's worth pointing out that by now this review is fairly old and the game will continue to develop with time. I had felt that at the time my review was fair but should have been taken with a pinch of salt because I am more than aware of how games in alpha are. It is also worth keeping in mind that with early access the old ""alpha/beta"" defining lines are somewhat blurred and ""it's an alpha"" is not a blanket excuse for exclusion of basic features. This game is fun, keep an eye on it - but be aware of the limits of early development.			"

												This is close to being a terrific game. The general idea — welding together random space junk to make a funky spaceship — is a lot of fun. But the controls are rough — you can add lots of faster engines, but you have to turn each of them on and off individually, so it makes steering and controlling your speed difficult. And when enemies attack, they don't fly in from outer space, they just appear — often in the middle of your ship! I can fight off pirates when they pull up alongside me; it's a different story when they materialize inside my ship, wiping out half of it before I can make a move. Worst of all, there's no clear way of saving the game, so you lose progress constantly. All of these issues taken together suck the fun out of what would otherwise be a terrific game.			"

								I wish i could reccomend this game I really do. After playing for a while i have noticed serious gamebreaking bugs. my ships break everytime i go to lunar orbit and ship parts constantly break off for no reason when first placed as well as the worst one which does not allow me to recruit engineers but wastes the resources and stunts all my ships stats so no matter what i add on it never changes. i have tried unistalling it and starting new saves but the bugs persist. I will continue to play this game but can't recommend it at this stage in development.			"

								Habitat is a bizarre and lovely experience.  At first it seems very simple, but a few minutes in and the depth of the experience is unavoidable.  This sandbox spacestation construction set is very slow paced but so obviously full of potential.  Be warned, if you are not a patient person, don't bother with this title.  On the other hand, if you have a little patients, and are the type of person to delve into a sandbox and make your own fun, you'll love this game.Essentially, you fly around a 2D section of space collecting garbage and attaching it to your space station.  The junk you find will range anywhere from burger joints to old retired satilites.  Within moments of firing up the game I had already attached an old sherman tank to the front of my station.  What's better is that this junk isn't just garbage, they are upgrades.  I could use the tank to fire cannon balls at other debre floating through space, for fun and also to clear a path.  Later, I found a lunar lander and tossed it on the back of my station and used it's engines for some extra speed.Many elements of Habitat remind me of RTS games.  You have resources that must be collected/generated, such as Omni (money), Electricity (power), and Fuel (more different power), and the amounts you generate depend on how you've built up your station and what junk you've attached to it.  So, rather than sending some peons to go gather coal, I attached a solar array to the back of my station so that I generated more electricity.Part of the strategy involved in this title is balancing your ship build.  If you have too much weight/mass on one side or the other, the ship will fly crooked.  This ultimately lead to constant corrections by firing my boosters on one side of the ship in bursts while the other side remained at full blast.  I realized later that I could actually adjust the individual output of each of my boosters so that all the engines could be left on simultaniously and the station would still fly straight, that is until I added more junk!Did I mention you can also control where the power in your station is distributed?  There are three catagories, Weapons, Boosters, and Power.  More energy in weapons... actually, I haven't tried that, so I don't know what it does, but more power in the Boosters makes you go faster, and more power in Power, gives a bonus to your resource generation.It is a unique experience and a lot of fun, but it definitely takes some time to get used to, and it takes even more time to accomplish anything!  As of this writing, the game is still in early release, so hopfully the pacing is tweaked a little before release, but even if not, I still wouldn't pass it up.  Good game, great experience, and I'm looking forward to watching this one come along as it gets closer to release and beyond.TL;DR?If you're patient and enjoy playing in a silly space sandbox full of junk and potential, then this game is definitely for you.  If you're not a patient gamer, and/or sandboxes and making a bit of your own fun aren't your thing, then give this one a pass.			"

												A year later (after my purchase) and the ""full release"" is upon us; but despite improvements it feels like nothing has changed, aside from features that I'm not sure anyone really asked for (More engineer micromanagement?  An engineer camera?).  It technically works, but still feels broken and unfinished.Even after improvements to the controls and tutorial, what systems there are in the game seem obtuse, and controlling your crafts is still too finicky and unpredictable to take seriously or strategically, and too slow and management-intensive to be silly and fun.  The constant building of your ship is equally too detail and control heavy to be light and easy, while the constant RE-building of your ship quickly saps at any enjoyment from the design and strategic planning (struts are not fun!).  Thankfully many of the tasks for the engineers are automated to some degree, but ordering them to do anything specific becomes an exercise in frustrating hunt-and-click vs the camera.It might still be worth it to pick up (on a heavily discounted sale) and play around with in the sandbox, but the campaign is a farce.  Which, considering the tone of the game and what little I was able to glean of the 'story' in-game, could actually be intentional in some brilliant meta-design by the creators, but I very much doubt that.  One can only hope that this game's developers will continue to support their game and all the promise the idea had, and perhaps reevaluate some of their design decisions.I'm incredibly bummed I can't get a refund for this.  I guess this is my own personal lesson on supporting Early Access games on faith and interest in a concept.			"

								*NOTE: This is an Early Access review meaning it will be a lot shorter than a normal review but will still explain what I thought about it. A full review will be published once Habitat has released. By the way, I have a lot more hours than it says, it just wouldn't calculate any of the time for me while it wasn't on the Steam Store.Habitat is a real-time, physics-driven orbital strategy game where you build, fly, and fight with the unique space stations that you create out of space debris orbiting earth. In its simplest terms it is a strategic space survival game. It is being developed by 4gency and being published by Versus Evil. It's available on Steam's Early Access - as stated above - for $14.99.Habitat was one of my most anticipated indie games of 2014 when I first saw the Kickstarter. From then I followed it to where it is today. I was able to have a review copy to review. Saying that, there were of course some bugs that have been squashed out, but none of the bugs prevent it from being playable.Habitat feels like a space sandbox where you can literally make whatever you want with the space debris orbiting around Earth. That includes thrusters, boosters, dinosaur heads, Statue of Liberty heads, anything that's there you can add. This gives players total freedom on what they want their ship to look like. For me; I put the dinosaur head on the top of my rocket ship, with boosters on either side and a controllable booster near the top. The controls are very easy to learn and do not feel clunky. Graphics are alright, but nothing spectacular, as they aren't the focus of this game. The focus is to have fun building a space ship that YOU made as well as fighting various enemies in the game. Can't wait to see what some of the people's ships look like as well as hoping for Steam Workshop!9/10 - Brilliant!			"

Early Access Review
As it is I can't recommend it.This will probably change as the game progresses.This game has issues... beginning with the tutorial.In the first mission I managed to put the two parts right next to each other  ... only one block apart ... too bad that they are bigger than one block .... and so they generated phantom forces making the ship spin out of control.Yeah it is bad in a tutorial* ... but in the real game is devastating. *= which has also the issue that it only shows the buttons that you are allowed to use instead of graying them out. That lead (in my case) to a total confusing start in the real game.Same in the 2nd tutorial ... it is a bit awkward to be shown rockets on the side and later not to know that isn't possible ... and the unlink function is disabled (aka. completely missing).There is also the issue of the camera angle ... everything in this game with this gameplay screams ""I am meant to play top down"" but the camera won't let you (probably a objection from the artist: ""but think about all those great 3D models"") ... leaving your ship in the way all the time.The other not great thing is that ship parts towed by your crew can be towed through your ship ... which should be changed in later versions so that is moved under or above your ship. ... That shouldn't be too hard.The game ends up starting throwing you unprepared in middle of literally one million things from what are more than enough enemies.The circumstance that you have to do one million things and that there is no way to slow it down seems to me as preperation for making it multiplayer. But multiplayer can lead to all sorts of problems in this kind of game.So what I am missing is a third part of the tutorial in which is everything present, but no enemies ... so that you really can learn how to build and how to use the UI.Or at least an easy mode for the game ... a ""slow"" start (in which you won't encounter enemies for at least a while after starting the game) would also do.

								I think some may misunderstand what this game really is.  A quick and dirty description of it would be an arcade game.  The game is not intended to be a long term play and you will restart the game multiple times just trying to figure out what everything does.  It isn't super intuitive which in the beginning will lead you to believe you can accomplish a number of things which will then result in you blowing up your station just because you didn't know you couldn't do that.  That kind of learning process is getting more and more common in games though (not happy about that really).  It is a good 5-60 min game that will entertain.  My rating of this game is a $4.99 game that could be worth $9.99 to someone that really likes the game.  Just remember that at $9.99 that's a roll of quarters at an arcade (i'm showing my age here).  Personally, i'd spend a roll of quarters on a different game.			"

								This game has single handedly stopped me from buying early access games. I picked this up 8 months ago when it was first released and it was unplayable. I wanted to love it, so I decided to leave it alone and give the developers more time. 8 months later it is still no where near completion. There have been some improvments to the UI and there are starting quests which help but there is still no purpose, it takes eons to move your ship and god forbid your ship is slightly off balanced from the random crap they provide because you will have to constantly turn on and off one engine to compensate for the imbalance. Overall it's not even worth $1 at this point. See you in another 8 months when it will hopefully be nearing alpha stages.			"

								This has the potential to be a pretty jolly KSP.I guess Unity must make it really easy to connect things to each other with intergalactic space ropes, or else there wouldn't be a bazillion people making games like this.Unfortunately this one too so far suffers from the fact that the performance of the default objects Unity provides you with is rather absymal by the time you hook up dozens of moving objects together. If the developer(s) can fix this, this could become something great. If they can't, it'll just be unplayable crap until we get single-threaded supercomputers in the year 2192.Really good for a first release, but see above caveat.			"

As far as items you can create with it, it's still bit limited, I personally can't wait for more capability for Workshop items -- I would want my own booster! :-)As the Linux user, I find the game very stable, and works well across different class of devices; from my good i7 machine to more capability limited laptop.

								Alright, this game has a fantastic amount of promise.  However, nothing has ever gotten me closer to throwing my laptop out of a window.  You'll flourish for about 15 minutes as you assemble your first habitat, or maybe you decide to create a second one to guard the primary HQ.  Good thinking, but it's pointless.  The first nano cloud that comes along is going to blast you into next week.  There is nothing you can do about it.  Oh, you killed the first one?  Great news, there are two more right behind it, and they are on the opposite side of your ship.  Go ahead and turn, it'll wait...and by ""wait"" I mean it will destroy your ship while you try and turn.  This game is going to be awesome.  Today it is a frustrating distraction that lasts no more than 15 minutes at a time and makes you regret the purchase.  Keep it in the back of your head though, once the balance is established, this is going to be one of the all-time greatest games.			"

Early Access Review
								It was only a matter of time until those damn machines realized their full potential. Until they realized that they didn’t need us. We dug this hole. Now our choice is to either fight our way out of it, or to lay in it.Habitat is an Early Access single player, and soon to be multiplayer, space survival game with an emphasis on strategy and a bit of action sprinkled on top. Brought to us by developer 4Gency and its publisher Versus Evil, the main idea behind this game is that you’ve been given the task of constructing and maintaining an orbital base for humanity out of the thousands of years of space junk that now surrounds the planet. Why, you may ask? At some point in the future, humanity builds nanomachines, which then turn on us. They’ve managed to nearly take over the entire planet, forcing humanity out into space. If that weren’t enough, they’re smart enough to send out little clouds of nanomachines into space to come and wipe the rest of us out.As mentioned before, this is primarily a strategy-survival kind of game. When you first start, you’re dropped off with your Habitat in a procedurally-generated sandbox full of scrap goods to use. You might find small things like a random burger shop floating around, or even the head of the Statue of Liberty (complete with fully-functional laser blasting powers!) that you can junction to your ship and use as a weapon. By junctioning this junk, you are able to provide your ship with more resources and weaponry, which you will need if humanity is to survive. In addition to adding things to your ship, you must manage your team of engineers, who are the ones who actually go out and drag and attach the various items to your ship, as well as keep maintenance.In terms of enemies you face, there’s currently not much. You have the hunter clouds that the nanomachines send, and other enemy habitats. Hunter clouds originate from the nanomachines down on Earth, and as far as I can tell, the machines just fart them out into space to kill you. They’re pretty relentless, too. Enemy habitats function similarly to you, but instead of cramming the first piece of junk they see onto their space station, they come pre-built and ready to mess up the first person that floats their way. Like I said before, 4Gency confirmed that they would be adding multiplayer later on down the development road, so it will be interesting to see how terrible other players are at controlling their habitats compared to me.One of the main problems that I ran into while playing was the lack of an in-game tutorial, so that those of us with a smaller attention span are forced to actually learn exactly through gameplay what it is they’re supposed to be doing. As of this moment, the only explanation you get is a “How To Play” option on the main menu, which just flat-out tells you through text what you are able to do. Personally, I learn gameplay mechanics better when I’m taught them during the course of the game. Another issue I had was aiming. Currently, if you have all your weapons on say, one side of your ship for some reason, and the enemy comes the opposite side, you’ll need to slowly spin your ship all the way around to face them, and then carefully line up your shot before you can begin firing. Even then, you probably won’t hit them because even after you disable your ship thrusters, your ship will continue spinning due to the fact that you’re floating around in space. It would be great if there were some way to ease up the whole process.All that aside visually the game looks good enough. The models and textures look nice, and it seems to be decently optimized, so performance shouldn’t be too much of an issue. The music is rather soothing, and the rest of the sound in general is pretty good in quality. Overall, Habitat is something that has a bit of potential as long as the developers continue working on it. You can currently find Habitat for sale on Steam for $14.99.http://wtbfun.com/habitat-an-early-look/ "

								Habitat is a really zen game, while also being incredibly absurd. If you like attaching hamburgers to your space station while a statue of liberty is right next to it, bolted on, and you have as many rocket launchers as you can find in space... you'll probably like this game. It is a very slow game, though, at least to start with so be prepared for that. It was very relaxing to slowly build up my floating junk heap though.			"

								It took me a bit to get the physics and start understanding all the pieces of space junk and their powers, but after that, it became addicting. If I didn't have other commitments I'd be playing it every day - there's a never-ending sense of creativity to this game like Legos or Spore.			"

								Habitat, is somewhat hard to explain. Sandbox meets space battles is the best one could do. The game requires alot more thought than I originally imagined. It seems simple in concept, grabbing random space debris to make a ship, then you find yourself attacked with calculations and math theory just to get your ship flying straight, Sure you can get by with guessing and such, but for the engineer wanna be, you have power levels to control, and energy to creation/expenditure manage, andmultiple ships. This game is very indepth, and with the updates this game continues to get better. I see great things for this game. Now, don't take this review as the game is extremely stellar either (See what I did there :) ) There is a fwe things still needing some work, this game is in early access, so keep that in mind. You will find somethings hard to click on, I'd say this is the worst part in the game so far (Which is rather a small thing, you have to rotate the camera a little bit sometimes) and the movement can feel a little slow at times. For a note on the best things in the game, the quests are decent challenge for starting off, and progress to mroe difficult, the tutorial is done well, and the enjoyment of finding new objects and figuring out hwo they work, with the ocassional item damaging your ship cause you didn't think it through very much is humorous.

								Interesting concept that plays on some of my biggest dreams from childhood - exploring space in my own ship, collecting space junk and making cool things from it. The gameplay starts off a little slow, but that's to be expected when you're colonizing space and wading through centuries of junk.Overall, I'm very impressed with the game as-is, and would consider it a complete sandbox. I'm excited to see what the future brings for Habitat. I did not have any issues or bugs while playing, and in-game tutorials and hints were measured but informative. My only issue with the game is that on creation of a new game, you are plopped right into the mix with no warning or opening. That's an opinion thing, though. I like a little more exposition in my games.			"

								Still early access (today is July 9, 2014), so there's plenty of time, but for me this one misses the mark.I was looking forward to a game where you could patrol space picking up resources and then building things with them.  That's not this game.Instead, this game is a wacky space comedy where you have to lash together floating cruise ships (how the hell does that happen) and mount a floating Statue of Liberty head that comes pre-fabed with lasers in her eyeballs to make an intrastellar battleship that you must send forth to attack unnamed incoming aliens.The joint system was on the fritz for me so some of my ships tore themselves to pieces and there's no plot to speak of yet.  But then again, it's Early Access.I think they should have a hanger where you can build ships out of resources you recycle (metal, solar panels, plastic, etc) from the space crap and then send the ships out to do combat on their own.  I should not have to control the ships and build their replacements all at the same time.  I'm a simple man with simple thoughts.I'll reserve judgement, but it's not looking good. And in it's current state, I think you should wait.			"

Early Access Review
								So, this is the first time I've written a review for a product on steam, and the reason I'm bothering to is because I see that this game has a lot of potential.  While it may be a very simple game in its current state, with objectives able to be beaten in under an hour, it has all the basics of a game capable of being nearly as big a game as Kerbal Space Program.So what does this game currently have to offer?  Well, in its current state, not much.  I've only got around 3 hours of game time under my belt as of writing this, but that's with completing the main objectives twice and screwing around for about an hour.  There's a distinct lack of things to do right now, other than strapping debris to your ship and blowing up 5 enemies.  If you're skilled, you can actually make two ships for yourself and try running two battles at once, or fight yourself to the death.  I'm not skilled.What will definitely improve this game would be things along the line of resources that your habitat constantly consumes that you would need to replenish (which is something planned for in the future of the game).  I know the first update they're applying is going to add electricity and fuel, which will certainly make for more interesting habitat designs.One thing I've seen a lot of people complaining about is that there is a lack of a save function, with some going so far as to say that no save option is a deal breaker.  To those people, I ask: what point is there on saving a game that can be beaten in as little as half an hour?			"

Although it's currently short on content, it's dynamic destruction and generally fun gameplay give it tons of replay value at the moment. Definitely buy!TL;DR: Kerbal Space Katamari.			"

								Incredible gameplay! There are many surprises but the challenges you face trigger the engineering mindset to figure something out with what is available to you. The physics are quite wonderful and challenging as it should be. You quickly learn how to control your stations and habitats in space. Sure I got frustrated when met with some particular objectives but it urged me to learn how to control my situation and ultimately gain wonderful insight on how to deal with physics. Highly recommended for any space enthusiast. I am proud to be part of the 509th!			"

								It is very good already for an early access game, it has so much good content for version alpha 0.1. If more content is added it could only get better. When they add things like food and oxygen and necessities like that, then it would add more gameplay to the game. Right now it is just trying to not die. I have had countless times of just smashing into a random space station while trying to turn off my engines while going full speed. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes putting giant cyborg statue of liberty heads on your spaceship and putting flame breathing t-rex heads on the side with fully functional old tanks shooting from the back of your ship.

								In its current state, Habitat is already a fresh take on the sandbox genre by integrating physics into the game. All the thrusters apply force and the acceleration and rotation characteristics of your habitat are determined by how you distribute the mass. There are a lot of static pieces you can use to beef up defenses against enemies and a number of awesome activatable items like rocket launchers, short-range lasers, and more.I'd recommend checking it out if you like sandbox style games and are curious about the possibilities of fun physics in orbit around Earth.

								Weaponized T-Rex Head. Let that soak in for a minute. Habitat is about building a space station called a habitat from space junk floating around Earth. Space junk including the aforementioned Weaponized T-Rex Head, subway cars, tanks, laser cutters, and more is waiting to be combined to turn you habitat into the most badass weaponized platform in space. Once you've got all manner of weaponry, and hopefully some way to control you creation strapped together, there are enemy stations to destroy and deadly nano machine clouds to avoid. Tackling an enemy station can be handled many ways, limited only by ship design and imagination. There are plenty of ready to use weapons waiting to be attached to your habitat, or can go a little less conventional. Detaching active rocket boosters causes them to shoot off like missles, attaching a comically large boxing glove to the front of that improvised missle just makes it all the more awesome.			"

								Pretty cool little game. I can see where it is interesting to see what kind of a blob you can make. It is one of those time sensitive / creative types though which really dont seem to go well together. I get the need to set up your habitat on the double because it is the end times, but the nano clouds make this more of an inevitable destruction. It's  good for 30 - 40 minutes at a time, but anything after that you're going to be managing too much at once. It is kinda like going to the park as a kid and playing in the sand, then seeing you can make stuff with what is around you, then some asshat kid comes and runs right through what you were doing, you can take it out on that kid or start over, sorta thing. The weight management in zero-g is interesting, and maneurvering the structure and taking care of joints is cool. I would say if they added more consent to the game and trying to either force you to do certain things, or give more prompts when a trigger event comes up would be cool, like when a structure gets split and you have the requirements for 2 habitats. Maybe making it to where you can just have the 1 and a chunk that broke off that you can disassemble and put back together, or click a button and begin a new habitat from the broken off piece, rather than assuming they're two now. But yeah, TL;DR aside, pretty relaxing track that doesnt get on the nerves, weight management and force distribution with make-shift parts makes this easy to come back to, even though theres that fat-kid nano-cloud that comes and ruins the fun.

								This game has a ton of potential and some good people that can make it fantastic. I had the pleasure of meeting the creator, Charles Cox, at RTX this past weekend and I can tell that this is his baby and he will do everything he can to make it the best it can be. We discussed everything he wants to add in future updates like a campaign and multiplayer which can really make this game amazing. I am completely on board with this game even if it is only a sandbox right now because if it does well in its early access it can and will become a fantastic game.Remember that this isn't a full release and it is only a sandbox as of this moment. But unlike some other early access games, 4gency isn't just going to take your money and never update their game. I recommend you get on board this early access and see just how amazing this game will become.			"

								I like the premise of this game a lot. It's got the apeal of a Sim-style building game, combined with movement and tower-defense aspects that keep it from bogging down the way some Sim builds can bog down. Think Sim plus Civ, in spaaaaace! So far in Early Access, I'm seeing the kinds of things I want to see, and they're done well enough that I look forward to every new release announcement to see what's been added.I've seen the developers make steady progress during Early Access, adding new ideas and keeping on top of bugs as well. I've run into some weirdness with controls and movement that I hope will be addressed in future updates. The game still needs polish, and they're still trying to balance making the game move too slowly or too fast in the early stages -- I've seen it both ways in different releases. Just lately, each new game takes a little longer than I'd like before it gets interesting. Better too slow than too fast, though.Full disclosure: I backed this game in Kickstarter and am acquainted with some of the dev team. I'd have tried the game because of those things, but I wouldn't be recommending it unless I thought it was worth your time. It definitely is worth your time.			"

								Habitat is a great sandbox game.  I know people are upset about the nano clouds. I figured out the best way to destroy them real easy. build as many engineers as you can till nano clouds get close to your HQ,  when they are close disconnect the 2 Ion boosters and clouds will stop as long as their is nothing connected. once they stop take engineers  and gather mines to put around or directly in front  and as close as you can to the nano clouds. place additional 4 mines centered and in front of the could I.E( second row of mines) once mines are placed around or in front of all three nano clouds reassemble your HQ. clouds will run into mines and blow up. took me a while to figure that out but it does work. There is three screen shots called suicide cloud 1,2, 3 that you can look at to see how to place mines. Hope this helps all those frustrated players and all the new players to come.I have had over 400 hrs of playing this game. I find it interesting. been building all kinds of ships and habitats. let your imagination run wild with your builds. 2 thumbs up to 4gency.

			Cosmic gives his first impressions of Habitat an Indie space strategy game in development by 4gency. on early access here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/299340/ Twitter -...		

 Hello once again I'm cosmic and today we are going to be taking a look at early access space strategy game Habitat. The game is being developed by 4gency who were formed in 2011 and the game itself was successfully kickstarted to the tune of $64,000 as of May 2nd 2014. The game is still currently in Alpha and as such things are subject to change.Habitat places you in the role of ensuring humanities survival in orbit of the now inhospitable planet earth. By leading a team of engineers you are able to build space stations from an array of space debris and salvage. You'll have to manage your resources throughout the game making sure you have enough fuel to move and more. That being said currently in alpha resource management is very easy and means little once you've built up a big enough habitat as you'll be gaining more resource than you'll be able to spend.Building your space stations is simple and straight forward. Each piece of debris has connector points that can be connected to adjacent buildings. There is an array of debris to use to build up your habitat including some comedic pieces including the Eiffel tower, burger restaurants and lady liberties head which has been transformed into a laser cannon. There’s no right or wrong way to build your habitats, you have the freedom to create all shapes and sizes. However movement is somewhat difficult as you'll be using an assortment of rockets and boosters which in turn with the size of your habitat could make fast manoeuvres impossible. Its often best to outfit your habitat with an array of weaponry facing all sides to make sure the enemies don't catch you in a blind spot.Exploration in habitat is currently not the easiest task to take on. The way the physics in the game work coupled with having to activate your motley assortment of rockets and boosters individually means that movement is quite slow and clunky. Precision flying is very difficult and often you have to come to a complete stop much of the time to face the direction you want to go. As you explore you'll encounter more objects to add to your ships as well as enemies to fight, some will be other space stations and others will be a insidious cloud of nanites bent on tracking you down.In terms of combat thus far in alpha there's an hilarious assortment of weapons to choose from. Everything from full battle tanks to dubstep spewing speakers are available and all have specific purposes. Combat can at times just be a complete mess especially with manoeuvring being the way it is. Its often best to build smaller attack vessels that are easier to move around and often faster so that your not just a hulking mass ready to be destroyed. With the most recent alpha update you can also send your engineers over to sabotage enemy ships though they are sitting targets that cannot take many hits.What’s good about Habitat thus far is that’s its fun, despite its current issues there is a good degree of  fun building up your wacky ships out of statue heads and school buses. Habitat does hold a certain amount of potential however whether it manages to reach that potential remains to be seen. There’s still a good amount of content yet to come into habitat including a campaign mode something which I certainly would like to see. There are a couple of things the game certainly requires at this point including more objects to build your ships with, better rockets and boosters to improve travel and ultimately I would like to see the resource management part expanded.The idea that people are living on your habitat should come more into focus. Population issues, food issues and more would be a really good thing to come into play. An example of this would be that when the population reaches its max, you need to find more debris that people can live in or when food is low you need to find debris that produces a food resource. Management aspects like this would go a long way to making the experience better overall and provide a better space simulator feel.			"

Early Access Review
								Tl;DR (Since many of my reviews are getting longer and longer): Right now I cannot recommend this game. I like the idea, I like the mix match look to it, but right now there isn't much gameplay to review. Hold off on a purchase until they work out the kinks and whatnot.Basically what it comes down to is a 15 minute gameplay where you attach some stuff to your ship, maybe destroy another ship, and then get killed by nano clouds. There's no tutorial, it's not easy to pilot, turn or aim (which is mostly by design), and the gameplay isn't really in the game yet.I would offer at least 3 major changes right out from the get go. As I'm new to the game I'm sure the devs are probably working on it, so this can be taken with that in mind.1. Allow players to start with a set of different ships, like the statue of liberty head, space shuttle, colony, etc. but something with a basic thruster that can turn, an engineer arm (or whatnot), and some attach points.2. Missions - if even a list of little things to follow to get your ""habitat"" up and running, like attach a generator, or add a gun to protect yourself, either trade with another habitat or attack it and salvage their parts, etc.3. Tone down the comic/brightly colored stuff. I like some of the goofy stuff to it, but most of the space junk is out of place and unrealistic. If the game took a more realistic look like slavaging actual space debries like sattelites (like you already can), missles, space stations, etc it would be great. The school busses, ferris wheel, etc are completely out of place. There are some things that kinda fit, like there's an amount of goofy stuff you can deal with like the Statue of Liberty head, but in other cases it makes the game look like junk. But that is my opinion, I can see how others would really like it.I think I read that the devs are going to (or already do) allow players to make their own space junk. That would be a good idea, cause it would fix #3 for me outright if I could just check a mod site and download someone else making a realistic space junk pack. At this time the game isn't really a full enough product to really play so I don't recommend it. I have hopes that a lot of the fixes and such are just down the road, so I remain optimistic about the future of the game.			"

								Cool game. Nice realistic mechanics and physics. basically you create awesome space stations and ships out of everything from a tank, lasers, rockets, tether launchers, food carts, ect. On the down side Indie has not yet created a save feature for the game yet. so each time you play you have to restart. If this game sounds like a buy, buy it now because once the game leaves Early Access the price will raise.			"

								So far, it is an interesting concept. It has alpha issues (relatively large memory leak...it finally fell over at 1.016GB memory usage, collision detection seems to be a cpu hog at this moment (game slows down to a complete crawl when engineers are dragging a building through other buildings at times) and some issues associated with destroying links you created.) But it could be a good strategy/simulation sort of game with good physics in microgravity. I'll keep checking back to see if it progresses, well, I guess I should, I bought the pre-release :)			"

								For an early acess game it's pretty good. the only problem is the gameplay, it should be more exciting than traveling to places. On the other hand you can attack enemy ships and stuff but you have to travel to a location to take on the missin and then travel again to get to the enemy. You can build multible ships which is cool and toggle between them. theres a few bugs, like my engineers dying from lack of living space when i have 4 living towers, but not many major game breaking bugs. Since they are updating it I feel like it was worth my 15$ now and will be worth it later. All i have to say is DO IT..... FOR THE BURGERS.			"

I was wrong.Yes, I know, it's early access. It's not worth $15, however.Right now it should be free. MAYBE $5. It's just not that fun at the moment.I hope this game will get better and have some more things added to it.

The game has goals, but the goals only give perks, and aren't required to advance. That being said, there isn't much advancing, story, or any real goal (except survive). I play it a lot, however, if I had to pay $15 for it, i would be dissapointed.Really what I am saying is if you have the opertunity to get this for free, or if it's on sale for less than $5, I'd go for it.

												This game sucks.  It is absolutely horrible.The tutorial explains basic movement and building, but not combat between engineers.  Sadly, the campaign quickly plunges you into combat against ""civilian engineers"" without explanation as to how to deal with them.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest.  Did I mention this game sucks?  It is absolutely abhorrent.  The designers and developers should be forced to fight each other to the death.  It would make as much sense as finding a severed chicken head on your lawn, with a note indicating ice cream was now illegal in your country.  What?  Yup, that's about as much sense as Habitat makes.This game is horrendous.  If you're thinking about buying this game, don't.  Do this instead: send an email to Steam asking them to remove Habitat from their catalog immediately.  It is absolutely criminal someone was allowed to charge money for this tripe.			"

Early Access Review
								This was a fantastic game - until a recent update made a complete mess of the ship building aspect.I used to enjoy building ships from random parts, such as submarines, cruise ships, girders, rocket launchers etc - the list goes on. Ship building was achieved by selecting parts and attaching them to other parts via a node system. So for example, you would order a Command Bridge, then attach various parts by welding the part nodes to the Command Bridge nodes. My best ships were the ones I built from submarines and girders... But sadly, those days are gone.The nodes now need to be separated by a sixty-five million mile gap (slight exaggeration) in order to be welded together. So the old ways of ship building are gone. Those submarine ships I used to build? Yeah, they were quite compact, had very small gaps between components and had quite complex welding. But they were awesome... and now they're gone.Thankfully, however, this game is still in early access, so there may still be hope. There are a few other issues as a result of the recent update in my opinion, but here's the main one - Please fix the recently-ruined node/building system!!! Please!!!			"

								This is a really good game... it's one of those see how long you can survive sort of games only in space and in order to upgrade your ship you need to grab items from around the map... The reason it's getting a bad rating from me is I survive until the second wave of enemies... until the ones that have god mode weapons and can destroy you in a matter of seconds... and here's me with a single machine gun firing into the wrong direction because I need to turn my ship using the booster and get the enemy ship in range(most weapon ranges are about 5 feet) This game is either stupidly hard or dam right impossible... I recommend you get Stardrive (http://store.steampowered.com/app/220660/) instead which plays a lot like this crossed with Civilization 5 and is very deep... So I'm voting this game as a 3.5/10, it's good to mess about with for 10 minutes...			"

								I feel that this game needs more work before its really playable. I have played for a few hours and its crashed on me twice. Also, conecting things togther can be very problematic, things wont attach for no apparent reason and I have had habitats just self destruct for adding the wrong piece. I think certain items like the weapons need more nodes to attach too, the way the nodes are now makes items hard to attach where you want them. I like the idea that there are things out in space that you have to protect yourself from, but they need to be farther away from the starting point. I kept getting my habitat the way I like it and it was destroyed before I could arm it. I really feel like this could be a fun game, but it needs more work.			"

												Look, I like weird goofy stuff, but this game is straight up not a game at all. It's not even really a sandbox. By any definition it's not good. I don't know what this is, like a comp-sci college student pumping out a unity game for some ramen and a few car payments? Probably. It's on the level of the kind of things you see available on ""free video game"" websites, but this costs money.... There's no game. There's nothing to review. You drag ""space junk"" around and assemble it into wacky vehicles and stuff. That's it. That's the whole game. Do you like sifting through your neighbor's trash can  and rubber banding wacky detritus together? Well congrats this is the perfect game for you! Otherwise, this is not the game for you, it's a game for nobody.Would that I could get a refund...			"

												What do I think about the game? Well, lettuce Taco 'bout it. The game is not worth the price as it lacks content, and it's not in early access anymore so there won't be any more things added to the game. Sorry for the short review but it's all I can think of at the moment.			"
