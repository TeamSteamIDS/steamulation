												Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook is cute and engaging, but not terribly deep. Winter comes to the quaint little town of Fairbrook, and this time you play a spoiled girl looking for love with the town's male residents while working in the town's popular flower shop. I didn't find the story quite as engaging as in its predecessor, Summer in Fairbrook, but I liked the new characters well enough and it was nice to see the old ones return. The two Flower Shop games are stand-alone titles, and you really don't need to have played Summer in Fairbrook to enjoy Winter in Fairbrook, though it probably helps as I personally found that a lot of this game's charm came because I already liked the setting and was familiar with a lot of the characters. But the endings from the first game don't carry over, even though most of the characters are still around -- including the protagonist of Summer in Fairbrook, Steve.The game is short, and the story is pretty predictable. Once again, the ""farming sim"" part of the game is only slightly relevant, though this time the money you earn growing flowers affects whether you get the standard or ""special"" endings. The anime-style artwork is cute, and the characters are mostly likeable, so it's a fun little diversion for a few hours.Steam features are well-integrated, and it's a pretty easy game to get all the achievements for (though a bit repetitive with the 2 endings per pairing.) Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook is probably worth picking up on sale or in a bundle, especially if you enjoyed the Summer in Fairbrook, or just like otome visual novels -- or cute Steam emoticons.

												Much like Summer in Fairbrook, I bought this game on sale, and yet still find it difficult to recommend to anyone, other than those firmly commited to the genre.And much like it's predecessor, Winter in Fairbrook leaves much to be desired.To say the game is bad would be like saying a small piece of chocolate cake is bad (assuming that you enjoy chocolate cake). It's still cake, it's still good, but it is grossly unsatisfying.The writing leaves much to be desired. Very much like Steve in the previous game, Natalie is a vapid, ignorant, immature, petulant, and lazy girl, who is instructed by her parents to find a job over the holidays, in the hopes of teaching her some discipline (They had already cancelled her cellphone due to bad grades, and are now threatening to take her new car away). Luckily, her room-mate just happens to be Clara from the previous game, and she sets Natalie up with Susana to work in the flower shop. Natalie must leave first thing in the morning to arrive in Fairbrook to start work the next day, but instead of packing and sleeping, she spends all night playing online games. That is our first introduction to this character, and I must say, it did not leave me wanting to spend the entire winter break with her.When she arrives in Fairbrook she thinks it's a small, dull town, and rightly so. She sleeps the day away, and then proceeds very rudely reject the dinner that was cooked for her (and continues to do so for a few weeks) and sleep in until 11 am the next day, even after being woken up by Susana at 8 am... after doing the only task asked of her, she then wanders off to check out the general store, thinking to herself that she ""wasn't told [she] needed to come right back.... once again, I am left wondering why I should care about this spoiled wretch.She improves as time goes on, of course, but I still never really cared for her at all. The choices that you get to make in the game are fairly limited. Just like it's predecessor, you start your day working in your garden. You then get to do one activity for the whole day, be it going to the store, the library, or just staying in.. there were around 5 options if I recall correctly. Every so often you would get a cut scene with one of the bachelors, and you would get to make a single choice in the entire discussion, and the rest of it was merely her awkward verbal diarrhea.As for the bachelors... well.... what can I say...Steve is still Steve, if you've played the previous game then you already know everything there is to know about him. He's slightly less lazy than before, but otherwise he's pretty much just a male version of Natalie (or she a female version of him).Jacob is sweet, charming, helpful, and shy.. oh, and he's SEVENTEEN!!! Yes, you read that right.. one of this College girl's potential mates is still in Highschool...... yeah. Add to that the fact that she thinks he looks like a twelve year old, and you've got a real winner.Trent is still trent. He's sweet, charming, attractive, and playful. Oh, and in love with someone else... just like, well, pretty much all the guys really.And Ryan, well, there's nothing that I can say about him that wouldn't sound completely biased, but I'll try. To say he's adorkable would not be giving him enough credit, though he does resemble that at times. He's intellegent, well-spoken, hard-working, reliable, cultured, and a bit of a virtuoso.... I mean, is there anything he isn't? He's also the only guy who isn't already mostly spoken for, so that's another plus for him... the only problem is, in reality, there is no way he would go for someone like Natalie... and quite frankly, most of the time it seemed like he hated her, or at the very least found her highly irritating.The good:- Art work is relatively cute- Writing is decent- Gardening mini-game is amusing- The bachelors are charmingThe bad:- The music is repetitive, and though not inharently bad, certainly grates on you after a time.- The writing is lacking in quite a few places- The gardening mini-game is much more out of place in this incarnation than in the previous title.TL;DRThis game is not really worth your time or money, even on sale. It's decent, and if you really like the genre then I won't think any less of you for buying it.Just keep in mind that even though it says I've got 12 hours played, about 80% of that was spent leaving the game open for Trading Cards. I think it took me roughly 2 hours to get 3 of the endings.			"

												I was able to play through the entire game in about an hour, the only choices are ones that lead to either an increase in a particular character's opinion of you or a decrease.  There is only one event that happens in the whole game.  You can spend your time working gardening, but there's no point, since there is literally nothing to buy except for more seeds.  I bought it on sale, and I am still hugely dissapointed			"

												If you liked the first game (Summer in Fairbrook) then you'll like this game. It's a stand alone game so you do not need to play the first but the characters are shared through both stories.You return to Fairbrook but this time as Natalie, a lazy college student who's parents have decided its time for her to get a job. Your roommate Clara recommend the flower shop her friend runs back in Fairbrook as a temp job for the holidays. You get to Fairbrook and seem to not like all the hardwork at first but upon meeting the townspeople, you start to warm up to the idea of spending the rest of your holiday vacation in Fairbrook. Along the way you meet four cute and vastly different guys all whom which you can romance.Winter in Fairbrook is a great game with cute stories and colorful, exciting visuals. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it to dating sim and visual novel fans.			"

												This otome visual novel which is a sequel to Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook feature a female protagonist Natalie who is introduced to work at the flower shop in Fairbrook over the winter by her roommate Clara who is now studying in a college in Los Angeles. At Susana's flower shop, Natalie has to help tend Susana's greenhouse by cultivating 4 different types of flowers and making a certain profit. At Fairbrook, Natalie will get to meet and interact with Jacob who now helps out at Susana's flower shop, Trent who is Susana's brother and works at the library with Marian, Steve who is currently staying with his uncle at his farmhouse and has now broken up entirely with his ex-girlfriend, Ryan a college student who is working at the general store in Fairbrook as well as additional supporting characters Clara, Susana, Marian, Sam, Orpheus and Natalie's parents.The game has plenty of save slots to enable quicker replays to reach a different romance ending, a tell-all relationship meter with any of the main characters that goes up or down depending on your dialogue or option choices, the option to skip and fast-forward already read sections and in-game hints to help the player reach a normal and special romance ending with any of the main characters.

												My feelings on this game are kind of mixed. I feel like it could have been so much better but I still love what it has.I've played many visual novels and dating sims mainly otomes of varing qualities and backgrounds, and I always enjoyed them for something. I'm gonna go right off in saying that the biggest isses with this game is it's length and difficulty.It felt way too easy. -The gardening simulation was okay but besides for getting the special endings it didn't give me any insentive to keep going once I got my goal. It's supposed to one of the big parts of the game but ends up being optional. I think this could easily be improved by adding more things to buy or atleast need money for,  a higher goal for special ends and some sort of noticable punishment for not working. -Getting the guys is another thing that felt too easy. Instead of getting hints or what not for the guys, you litterally get straight up told what stats you need to make them fall for you. It's not even sutble, they say exact stats names.another thing is there really should have been atleast one more ending per guy, and by that I mean a bad ending, so their endings wouldn't be that easy to do, mainly the special ending, which is another big problem. the ""best"" ending really should be harder to get, and for some characters be better than the normal endings.It needed more to it.-For the guys, you either get to know them way faster than you should, or by the end you only seem to have gotten the very surface layer of them. It gives the impresstion that it was a bit rushed. Like characters who were well written out had to get their story squeezed in a much smaller amount of time, and others who weren't fully developed having to have their stories artifically stretched. While saying this I did enjoyed all the characters, but the attachment to them wasn't really there due to the rushed or shollow feeling. -The story was good, the characters were wonderful but it was far too short. When I finished all the endings all I wanted to do was keep playing, I still do, I want there to be more for me to do. each guy took maybe an hour or two to finish completely, maybe 3 if it takes you a bit to figure out what to say. This is rather short for a game of this genre.Now to improve these things the simple solution would be to extend the story. Add more weeks or instead of planing each week, you plan each day. or simplely adding more endings, like friendship endings for the girls and guys, bad endings. Things like this can really add an hour or so of gameplay.- Now that we're past these issues, now to my more positive thoughts.To start with the art is really top notch, would have been nice to have a few more CGs but moore wasn't nessasary.The Interface is simple but it was more than enough for a dating sim.The main character starts off not to likeable but by the end you'll deffiantly like her. She goes through a reasonable yet still drastic change, going from childish and bratty to more thoughtful of others and mature. The differant guys make these changes more sutdle or more drastic.The other characters do go through some changes themselves that you help with, again not too great to be unrealistic but even something as simple as helping to see things a bit differantly. they do seem to evolve some in the course of the game.The story is not really complex, you're a spoiled college girl going to a small town to work for winterbreak cause your parents are making you. It felt natural, and flowed well enough. again i wish it was longer, it would have really profited from even a slightly extended story.Besides for technical issues, I must say that this is one of my favorite otomes, specially here on steam. If it wasn't for my dislike of playing male characters, I would most certainly try Spring in Fairbrook, aswell. If you're new to dating sims or your still not sure about this game, get it when it's on sale and give it a go.As for the others who are still intrested, I can't really say if it's worth paying full price. If you like other Winter Wolves titles and/ or you'r fine with splurging a bit, then go for it. "

												This was a pretty forgettable read. The game is incredibly short (12 weeks/turns, and only 1 major event besides the opening and ending). What does stick out to me though is how terrible the UI is while reading.1) The characters are drawn tall/thin and appear in the middle of the screen. Their expressions change sometimes, but their head will be towards the top of the screen while your eyes will be bottom/center focused on the dialogue.It's true that many visual novels put the character art dead center, but Kanon in example uses the space better. When you're talking to a character in Kanon, their face (rather than their body, as it is with Flower Shop) is dead center so it's like you're having a conversation rather than staring at their shirt.2) The height of the dialogue box in Flower Shop changes based on how many lines are in it, so the height of it changes frequently which is fairly annoying when reading. The dialogue box is also decorated with a sunflower graphic in the top right that stretches up/down based on how many lines there are.3) When it comes to reading dialogue, Natalie is the only character who gets a head portrait, and she only gets one when she's talking. Her thoughts don't have an accompanying portrait, nor do her thoughts don't have ()s or italics. And when another character speaks, their name only appears with their first line of dialogue. So you can start reading lines by Steve, it'll go to his second dialogue box, his name will vanish, there's no indicator that he's speaking, and the text looks exactly the same as Natalie's inner thoughts.4) The font has descending numbers (as in numbers that dip beneath the typographic baseline). It's very noticable on numbers like 3 and 4 and looks pretty wonky when those numbers are paired with other numbers that don't descend below the baseline.All in all, it's a short game that was poorly designed and was annoying to even read. As a side note, I got this game as part of an Indie Bundle that was $1.89. I couldn't imagine paying $15 on Steam or $20 on Winter Wolves's webpage for this game.			"

												The Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook, is the second game after Summer in Fairbrook, but both are stand alone games. Whereas I played and was mildly excited about Summer in Fairbrook, I enjoyed Winter in Fairbrook far more. This may have to do with my preference for female protragonists, but I also found scenes themselves more enjoyable. Each of the optainable males have unique personalities, and while they may fall hard on certain traits (shyness, bookishness) there are still surprises and they're all capable of character development.Here's the basics of the game, you can decide if they're pros or cons because I find what some people see as positive might be negative to someone else. Simple, cute story. Nothing groundbreaking, but still enjoyable. Can plant seeds and grow plants. Money is meaningless in that you can't buy anything but more seeds, but the amount you earn will affect what ending you get. (I guess it shows that you stopped being just a lazy college student?) Diverse cast with individual personalities and are capable of development. Colorful and cute visuals, especially for specific scenes at the end (if you don't get the alone ending).For $15 is it worth it? I paid that price and didn't regret it. I'm also, admittedly, very easy to please. So if you're on the line about buying it you could always wait for a sale or get a 50% off coupon for it. (People sometimes post them under Trade in Discussions.) At $7.5 I'd say it's certainly worth it.			"

												For a game rated PG, it's great. The game is very quick and simple. All the characters are decent and if you know what you're doing, you can finish a character route within an hour or so. It's a good visual novel with lovely music and no noticable grammatical errors in the text. My only complaint will be that the drama was kept tamed and that nothing really surprised me. So I would recommend this game to anyone whio is new to the otome general or anyone who wants a very casual otome game.			"

												Flower Shop : Winter in Fairbrook is the otome version / sequel of Summer in Fairbrook. While they have improoved with story writing, they still have the same other problems.The game is, as the prequel, solidly made, but too expensive without discount.Pro:- Story, even made better but still no top notch- Plantshop minigame- 9 different endings- many choices- Music- Backgrounds- Tradingcards- Achievements- 100% All ages appropiate - All characters reappear- Characters with different personalities- adorable chibi spritesCons:- Character sprites still a bit clumsy, but they are better than in the prequel (at least a bit) [they are inferiour to most novels, but i like them anyway]- €/fun/hour  as said off, perfectly fine for 66% off or higher, okay for 50% off- Often no sound- Flower growing shrinked, in prequel you had 9 plants now there are only 4 flowers, impact: 400$ or more = special ending (that is done in the 2nd week already after that you can just ignore the flowering completely..), again no achievement for being a farmingqueen or so.- No punishment for not farming / besides the 400$ goal no impact in the plantshop minigame- Many repeatable linesWhile Summer scored a 6.5 from me, this time it is 7/10 because of the improved story writing.

												When I started this game, I thought it would be terrible. I was disappointed with another game of Winter Wolves, Nicole, and think it was on the same line, so I just opened to get my achievements. Then, for my surprise I got involved with the game.It is not a deep game, but it's pretty cool to spend time. I found myself involved in the route of Ryan, and I was happy to see Natalie's maturity. At first I hated her, thinking she would be the same as Nicole, but she was growing up during the game, and I liked the result.  Another thing I think that was really cool: the protagonist of the previous game appear as  a romance option (I had hated him the other game, but in this, his route was one of my favorites). The music is very soft and cool, the system of planting too, and in this game, different from the first, you really have a reason in order to plant and save money, if you do this you get a better ending.Another really cool thing is the game of the graph. The characters are very well made and the backgrounds are nice.It is an easy game, simple, small and cool. I have nothing to complain about it (Just the fact of being small and without much depth, but I still really enjoyed it, for me it was not something that affected much).			"

												Change or be unworthy of love. Perhaps a bit harsh, but that appears to be the message of this game. You are Natalie, a lazy college student who gets a job in a flowershop because her parents want her to get a job somewhere.You arive, meet the eccentric locals, including four potential love interests. Each has two stats he likes, you must work hard to level up those stats in order to unlock their romance ending. Several of these guys will make a point of informing you (DURING your romance scene at the end) about how pleased they are you're nolonger some lazy spoilt brat, but a decent person they don't mind loving. While Steve in the previous game did have a character arc of personal growth, none of his love interests were cruel enough to point out they wouldn't have looked twice at him without it. Like Summer in Fairbrook, this is basically farmvill meets dating sim. You grow flowers, you sell flowers, you get to know and try to date guys. It sadly renders 'Summer's ending moot, as when you meet Steve here he's single (so he evidently failed to romance anyone last time) but the advantage is you could date him now if you like. The 'crisis' point midway through lacked much of the personal urgency of the one in the previous game, or perhaps that's becaues I'm not all that invested in Susanna's safety. In summary, I did enjoy this game, but it is very flawed.			"

You plan your time table once a week.There's a simple story, mainy casual but with a drama part towards the end. There's a snowball fight. Kiss scenes are cliche.

												TLDR; A shallow game with cute characters who have pretty decent stories, overall you'll get more of a kick out of it if you've played the first one. But if you're in it for some cute lines of dialogues and heartwarming true ending scenes, get it ON SALE. Full ReviewBack to Fairbrook! Only this time it's Winter!Firstly this game has little depth to it. You pick where you go each week. You can get away with going to each place once a week and on Saturday go to the place where the guy you want to woo is and spend Sunday resting. This is basically the extent of actual game play, the rest is clicking and reading. Of course the last three weeks you need to get your stat up that the guy you're going for likes. This stat is raised by visiting a specific other guy. Just make sure you visit bae enough that you trigger all his events. Twice a week should cover it.The whole gardening aspect is simple, you weed the bed so you can plant the seeds then they grow, you water them and pick bugs off them and then sell them to get more seeds. YOU GET A ""TRUE"" ENDING WITH A CHARACTER IF YOU MAKE $2,000 FROM SELLING PLANTS. It's tedious at times and when you're just trying to get endings, it's a pain. But you can either just click stop working or spam water plants to pass the time.From your selection of guys you get a decent mix of personalities. You have the ""handsome"" one who is a nice guy. The character from the previous game who is kind of a jokster. Then shy one who you need to tell to grow a pair basically. And lastly a smart one who follows the obvious cold and not good at being social archtype. If you read their dialogue they do have decent characters and have cute lines. I found myself playing through each ending, both normal and true to just get all the dialogue. That is really it to the game. If you'd don't like reading cute exchanges between characters and spamming buttons to get through stuff you already read *ahem* intro *ahem* then skip this game or get it in a bundle. But if you like cute somewhat heartwarming stories (Steve's is more touching if you played the first game) then this game is worth it... on sale. It doesn't have enough to it to pay $14.99! A major point to this game is you should follow a guide. They do spell out what two stats you need for each guy but it's hinted at subtly depending on the guy. So unless you want to end up alone, read a guide, it takes two minutes which is a lot less time than replaying through the game. "

												This visual novel is a sequel of sorts to Summer in Fairbrook. Like that game, you end up in Fairbrook to... learn responsibility. This time, though, you are pursuing the boys. Trent, Jacob, and Steve return from the previous game (which I guess assumes Steve didn't win any of the girl's hearts), and a new guy, Ryan shows up (more or less to be the voice of reason in the game). Some of the features of the prior game have also been streamlined.There are nine endings. One for ending up alone, and two for each hero. A normal ending and a special ending. The only difference between the two is that one you have $400 in your wallet at the end of the game for the specials.It is a nice game for those who like the type (Winter Wolves doesn't disappoint).

												VERY short game, (it literally took me a little over an hour to complete) not a fan of the story-lines either. Honestly, this game wasn't even worth what I paid for it, and I certainly wouldn't reccommend buying it. - The characters weren't bad, and I did actually enjoy learning about them, however little the game actually promotes their individual personalities. - The visual representations of the characters were poorly drawn however. Especially when compared to the backgrounds, as the game runs like a story. While the backgrounds were also somewhat poorly drawn, it seemed as though there was a lot more attention paid to detail when compared to the characters.- Also, sadly, the conversation flow just wasn't there. Everything seemed terribly forced, and hardly romantic. Not to mention that the main character that you play is a whiny putz (and frankly I wouldn't use any of the lines they put forth for her). As I didn't play the first game, and this is a sequel of sorts - I have nothing to compare it to other than other dating sims/games in general, so forgive the mostly Con related viewpoint of the review in that aspect. As weird as it is, I'm a big fan of dating sims and would love to try as many as possible. This game just didn't cut it for me. Luckily, I bought it when it was on sale, so if you're still wanting to try it after all that - then at least buy it on sale.			"

												A nice, simple, funny and cute hearthwarming game, i definitely enjoy it. If we speaking about cons, than i can tell that gameplay can be a little repeative and characters more or less stereotypic sometimes, some routes are more complex and interesting than others (though i guess it depends from your point of view). But game also has cute scenes, especially final ones (snow fight and last romance scenes are wonderful, you should see it yourself), nice art, funny moments and light hearthwarming atmosphere, that reminds about school\college days. Don't expect someting serious - it's a nice and little naive teen romance that definitely has its own charm for those who love such things. Still cannot say that game worth full price, i bought it on sale and recommend it for sale price.			"

												Overall, I would recommend the game because it is charming, the characters are likeable, and the artwork is good. However, there are a few things which I did not like about the game.- There is basically no point in the gardening mini-game. It is very quick to get to the amount required for the special endings- There is no difference between the special and normal endings except for getting separate achievements- There is very little interaction between characters considering how many days you have to pass through with nothing happening during the day.

												Well, the writing was so bad and so boring, it was hard for me to get to the gameplay.  And the main character is very unlikable and there are very few decisions on how she will act or respond.  Not worth the time it takes to speed read and I wouldn't play it for free.			"

												Remember Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook?My review for that went something along these lines:""This game taught me that hard work doesn't matter as long as you get 'em hoes""Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook is a huge improvement since then, so I'm going to revise my old review to match this new game. The developers have shown how they've truly taken feedback into account as well as learnt so much in the game development department from it.

												Winter in Fairbrook is a fairly simple visual novel that you can do a quick play through and have a happy experience with when you just want to kill a few hours. The gist of the story is that you, a city girl, go to work at a flower shop during your winter break at your college. Your character is a rather blunt and quick to speak (and not think) kind of individual. She makes it no secret that shes not one for hard work. But she isn't so off putting that you cannot enjoy playing her. You end up working in a small town and having regular occurrences with four males that do various things in the town. If you plan your week right, you can grow your flowers and earn a decent profit while wooing the males and getting yourself a good ending. While the story itself is rather simple, the characters are refreshing and not obviously cliche with their individual story lines. I didn't find the choices to be obvious as to what would get me brownie points with the guys. And I actually had a hard time getting a satisfying ending! The first two times I played I ended up getting the ""Alone"" ending. After doing a little research and experimentation, I found that you need to converse with the guys a lot during your week and that, while you may get their relationship bar all the way up, you wont get an ending with them unless you also have the two stats required with the male of choice at the least requirement. For example, the first male I went for was Steve and he required a stat level of 80 in intelligence, which you raise by visiting with Ryan. Hanging with one guy in order to woo another, a bit of an interesting change! His secondary stat I'm not sure of, but after looking a site, I figured it would be diligence, which only has to be raised to 60. So if you have trouble like I did, go to this link (http://sakevisual.friendhood.net/t37-winter-in-fairbrook) to get  a little more of an understanding of the correlation with the stats and your guy of choice. All in all, I'd give this game a 8/10. It was  enjoyable and I was happy spending the $7.49. But I probably wouldn't have payed $15 dollars for it since it wasn't the best visual novel I've ever played and I tend to be a little stingy with spending money on games. But the story was a good and cheerful, the art was very appealing, and the choices you were given weren't obnoxiously obvious. So I recommend it! Hopefully this will help anyone who was having a hard time deciding whether or not to buy this game like I was.			"

												It was one Christmas Night, when dear Santa came to visit. He gave me a present — a game, specifically. Yes, that present was titled 'Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook'. I was baffled, the game was a dating sim with a female protagonist. Did Santa mistook me as a girl due to my profile picture? I felt it too sad to ignore this precious gift Santa had presented me with, and so I started playing. The first time I played this game, it was horrible. I was irritated by the main protagonist (which is me). Why is she so airheaded? Can't she be more diligent like Susie? More attentive like Ryan or Sam? And so I skipped through the whole story and I reached the Alone Ending; pretty much the reasonable result.From the third run, I read and followed several walkthroughs that I can find in the internet. And thus I completed 6 other Endings. But then, I realized something. I had wasted the invaluable present from Santa. The point of this game was not about tending a flower shop, nor was it to obtain more dollars in my (the protagonist's) pocket. We visited Fairbrook to have a part-time job, but that did not have to be the end of it. We met people, we met 3 handsome guys (1 was cute, instead).And so I started anew, and I learned a lot. I learned that walkthrough was meaningless; Uncle Sam taught me all I need to get Steve's attention. I learned that it is not a General Store that increased my intelligence, it was because Ryan tutored me whenever I visited. And finally, I learned that the main protagonist is actually called Natalie. I felt happy when I reached the ending. Thank you for this great present, dear Santa.tl;dr Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook is a great visual novel. And I wish you Merry Christmas 2014.			"

												The graphics are great and the characthers were not boring. I liked the gardening system to earn money. This one is different as in that you have to get stats from two of the guys to get with one of them. I don't understand why the special ending has to do with money but whatever floats the maker's boats. It was enjoyable.			"

												I'm usually VERY easy to please; I like simplistic games, I don't mind reading/stories, I don't mind when things are repetitive. But either I missed something or this really isn't a good game.Most of my time was spent clicking on the story line. Over and over and over and over. The flower shop part of the game was pretty boring: Kill the bugs, water, plant, weed, sell, buy.I didn't do very well with the traits because I wasn't sure what I was doing (until I found a guide in the forum). So I thought I would try playing it again, maybe do a better job. Only the story line started again and my clicking finger started crying so I let it click the Exit button instead.I would say this is a good games for young (probably) girls, but I'm not sure the age I'm thinking of would be willing to sit and read through the (what is basically a) graphic novel.

												I have a rather long review of the first game Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook, and I'll cut this one short by saying that this game is pretty much like that one, except you can expect to get about half as much money from selling Flowers in the Flowershop which would be like your personal garden from the first game. Another difference, if you couldn't tell, is that you play the role of a female character this time around, the roommate of one of the girls from the last game.			"

												The game, while short and mostly straight-forward, was fairly enjoyable. It wasn't anything too outstanding, but for a simple romance visual novel with such a basic plot and route options it was fun.What I want to praise the most about the game is that I think the writers did a good job of making Natalie grow into a better and more likeable person. In the beginning it was very easy to dislike her, which I feel was the intent, but at the end of the game she was a much more responsible, kind, and selfless person.The art is nice if not the most professional looking. The sprites were very expressive and the cutscenes, for the most part, were a pleasant treat. The snowball fight cutscene was probably the most enjoyable to me.Some gripes:I wish the mini-game of working at the flowershop itself was more important in the scheme of things. Overall it just felt like a pointless thing to do every day, so it would've been a lot better for it to have more impact on the story than just helping you get special endings.I feel like the game could have been condensed from having so many weeks to avoid the numerous repeated scenarious when encountering characters, or have more unique dialogue included. In extension to this, I feel like more editing was necessary because there were a few typos and grammatical errors.There were a few errors in plot, mostly with events having to do with Trent, such as when Trent has already talked about having a job and then days later he mentioned it and Natalie was surprised: ""You work?"" Similarly, I was confused as to where Natalie's reaction of Trent comparing her to his sister all the time came from. Sure, he talks about Susana to Natalie, but doesn't really ""equate"" them to each other, so her outburst about it and being treated like a kid felt like it came out of nowhere. Then it was very strange that after Trent confessed, Natalie ran off, and if you go to the library the next day nothing's changed, it's the same event of them greeting each other and talking all afternoon like nothing happened.

												Errr....get it if it's on sale. I got it for under 10 bucks, and I honestly would have been disappointed if I had paid full price.  The good: The characters are interesting and the art is visually appealing. I absolutely love the music! What's not so good, at least, for me, is how uneventful this game is. The gardening part is seriously lacking and uninteresting, but that's only me. I'm sure others like it.I finished the game for one route, and it took me around 2 hours. But I really don't feel like playing again. When I think about all the gardening I will have to do, I don't feel like it.That's too bad.EDIT: I played a little more to get more endings. It's ok. I'm updating my review to ""recommended"" to be fair. This game is not bad, but I can't say it justifies spending 35$ on it. I played 5 hours and unlocked 70% of the game so far.			"

												First of all I would not recommend buying this game at full price, its not worth that much, even though it is cute. It doesn't take all that much time to go through the game and get all the endings. The art work is good, not great. The story is fun and there is quite the change in the main character from begining to the ending, which is only a few months long in the game. The baground charaters will tell the main character about whichever boy you want to be with, so its pretty easy to know which stats to raise in order to be with the guy. Like all games of this nature, I recomend saving, alot!  The only reasons I am not recommending  this game is the price and it was very quick for me. I don't feel like I got alot for what I paid, and I only paid 4 bucks, so I think if your interested in the game, wait till its 2 bucks or less on steam.			"

												Imagine the first game, but this time you're trying to court the guys.  If you enjoyed Summer in Fairbrook, and you're interested in trying to date the guys from it then this game is worth checking out (though once again I suggest getting it on sale).I really don't have anything to complain about this time around.  The stats are better explained by the characters ingame, so this time you don't need a walkthrough to figure out who likes what.  The gardening portion has been simplified, which kind of works because before you had about 8 seeds to choose from, but would only use 1 or 2.  They reduced the amount this time to 4 (2 cheap seeds and 2 high priced seeds).  They also made the gardening feel like it had a point this time, as you need to earn $400 to earn the special ending for each character, which they added achievements for.  You can earn that amount pretty easily, but it's nice to know there's a reason to do it.			"

												As a fan of Visual Novels, I for one, was ecstatic when I got the chance to play this particular VN. It's one I've sort of been lusting after for a couple of years now, so you can bet that as soon as I got the opporitunity to play the full thing, I took it.This VN is sort of like a typical stat-building YN; you might have to try to guess who which stat is for, but if you spend enough time with each of the guys, you'll be able to tell based on their personalities. And not only that, you need to help Susana, the owner of the flower shop that you're helping out, with the flowers. Every morning you tend to them, and it's up to you, the player, to decide which strategy to use.You do need to keep an eye on the garden and have a certain amount of money to get the ""special"" ending for each guy. There is a ""normal"" ending as well as a ""special"" ending. It's not just the money; you need to spend time with each potential romantic interest, and as Natalie, the player character, spends time with them, you get to unlock scenes. Personaly, my two favorite routes were Trent and Steve. Both guys get to see the character you play as change as the story goes on, and their endings are pretty good as well.Music: 4/5 - It's relaxing; to the point where you don't mind it going on in the background. If you dislike repetativeness of the background music, you might not like it.Sprite Art: 5/5 - They never fails to impress me. Each of the characters are different personality wise, and you can definitely tell them apart. The CGs and chibi scenes are some of my personal favorites.Story: 4.5/5 - My only gripe about this, is I would have liked to see a potential scene with Natalie's parents meeting her love interest. Other than that, some of the scenes were a bit cliche in the ""romanitc"" sence, but I didn't mind it at all.Overall: 5/5 - I really enjoyed this VN; and I find myself replaying it and smiling when I see some of the characters. I look forward to playing more Winter Wolves visual novels, since they haven't disappointed me yet.			"

												I enjoyed this one more so than it's counterpart, Flower Shop: Summer In FairbrookMaybe because I had the male choices, or maybe because the developer seemed a little more..detailed with these characters.The achievements seemed just as tedious as the other game as well, so I would suggest going for the happier endings.The artwork as usual, was beautiful and well done.The endings seemed similar at parts, but were personalized more so than I expected. This one however, even if it may be contradicting myself, felt rushed. The romance came too fast in my opinion, but I suppose it was timely considering the time being over a course of weeks.Your playtime also won't reflect well with the price, for I got all the achievements in under 10 hours. For a beginner, this is definitely a good way to start,You will get a heartfelt game with lots of love put into it, but it definitely could have had stronger points.This game was about a 6.5/10 Just for the more styled characters, they seemed less two dimensional, even though they were still quite two dimensional.But all in all, enjoyed it, the pros and cons balancing out.
