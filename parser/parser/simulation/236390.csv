												I have a hard time recommending this game right now, and I will explain why....At least here on steam, I don’t have to worry about being bullied by Gaijin for writing a critical review. I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. If you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will show you just how long I have been around flying the cyber skies. I can’t help but be amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. Listen up kidos, you can learn something from your elders. Warthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. I have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. Often you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. Recently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…So what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?I take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. They make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.Any objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. The Planes and TanksWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? The P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. The bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. ALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. The P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. The bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. Wanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. There is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. Then, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandalThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”. Hmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! Team Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. There is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. As of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. In the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. I have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. Warthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. Sadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.			"

												Just to give you an insight of the company that runs this game, Gaijin Entertainment:Some months ago the incredibly unsuccessful E100 tournament took place.Players where hyped like ****, A FREAKING E100 IS BEING ADDEDWhat people didnt know was that the E100 would only be available to less than 1200 people that won these tournaments, for which you needed to pay to get tickets to play.The tournament was badly set up and full of hackers (Shhh Gaijin doesnt want us to know there are hackers)Of course thousands of people complained in the forums, including myself.Most of my comments where removed on the context of ''flaming'', some of those comments complained about the removals.Shortly after this, they introduced a rule that didnt allow people to post in the forums, unless they had played a certain number of battles prior to posting.After receiving a warning for challenging moderation (lol) I got a message from a fellow forum user:''The rule came about shortly after they removed Simulator Battles from the game.  It wasn't to keep the trolls at a minimum, it was to reduce the workload of the moderators after such a poor decision.Scarper and Pacifica (two senior mods) are megalomaniacs.   Their egos get in the way of moderation.  Their extra comments on closed threads are often insulting and almost always condescending.  They show the community no respect at all and I believe it is only a symptom of Gaijin policy.  This was evident in the Youtube incident (if you are familiar I won't elaborate, but if you want to know more I'll elucidate)''More into this:http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/290640-community-relations-or-why-i-have-to-post-in-off-topic-discussions/http://ritastatusreport.blogspot.com/2015/07/gaijin-shuts-down-youtubers-channel.htmlhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/7/30/9068059/rogue-employee-holds-independent-youtube-channel-hostage-war-thunderMods from all around the globe are likely to downvote this, and I doubt this review will ever be viewed by many, but please, stay away from this toxic company while you can.

												I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.			"

												War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. 1.57- This might be a fiarly good patch. Tons of new maps, planes, tanks, EC changes, and increased bomb damage(?). The only thing that I dont like is the complete kills on a tanks crew. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pen a tanks hull, which means you will not get the kill if the last crew member switches to the drivers seat. I could see the mechanic being usefull for a tank with two crew, but have the guts and brains of your 6 friends splattered all over the tank would prevent me from freely moving around the cabin. It doesnt impact me much though, I only really play in the air war.Edit- Alright, I think Gaijin finally did it. They have completely killed my desire to play ground forces. Complete kills are almost as worthless as the crew locks and spawn camping. At least I can still fly my planes as long as I take off within 30 seconds...-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.   -We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.  -For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.   -They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has  to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.			"

												Don't be fooled by the high ratings of this game. As soon as you play for a longer time you will see the massive racism of the developers and sheer cheek of their pay2win greed.+The game is prettyThis is it.. it looks good and runs well. The only + in this review.-Russian biasIt's real, its totally real. Russian planes outright outperform lots of other planes and russian tanks downright deflect shells with magic armor. No surprise the developers are russian. Their response to the bias is that they have ""Secret documents"" about WW2, probably saying Russia had magic infused armor made from Stalin's bumsweat and nosehair.Time and time again the community has provided declassified documents themselves, disproving the armor effectiveness and certain nerfs on especially germans, from MANY countries, even CCCP but devs/mods just ignore it/delete it.I would also like to add that Steam moderators have CONFIRMED that russian bias exists about a month ago from writing this review.-Pay2WinCertain vehicles are behind a paywall going up to 60 euro a vehicle sometimes. These are blatantly better than their free counterparts on the same rating. Special armor, non-exploding fueltanks, the list goes on.But most irritating are the rocketlaunching tanks. The Callioppe for instance has 60 rockets mounted ontop of a Sherman, each rocket is DEVASTATING for other tanks downright riddling the crew with shrapnel. Add to that a insanely high RoF and a 10 second reload speed. Also the rockets cannot be taken out by shooting the canisters. No surprise its a 50 euro tank.-Map DesignPartially to blame for the russian bias is the map design. Most maps are made specifically for close range brawler tanks ( russian ) and aircombat always at a low enough altitude to ""justify"" the russian superiority as russian planes were best at low altitudes ( below 5 km ).Spawn camping is easily done as you only need to do a small drive of about 30 seconds on certain maps to be in enemy spawn. You have a brief spawnprotection but thats void as soon as you're alive for a few seconds. You drive out of spawn then and boom, someone shot you in your side who was hiding in a bush/behind a rock next to your spawn.-Battle RatingThe most agrivating and full on bias thing to exist in War Thunder.Vehicles are classed by a Battle Rating ( BR ) as to balance the matches so a lategame heavy tanks wont face 1920's tanks. This is broken, there is no way around it. Russian vehicles have favorable BR's to their opponents. Purposely classed lower than what theyre actually worth so they decimate other countries. ( Also outperforming specialised turnfighters with a flying russian brick and magic armor )How it is supposed to work is your highest vehicle will be chosen and put into a match with +/-1 BR or 1.3 in planes. Seeing as i fight BR 3.3 tanks in my 1.3 tanks, I cannot kill anything.-DevelopersAs said earlier they are racist towards anything what isn't russian. Disregarding anyone not speaking russian as less important. Deleting and banning alot of feedback on their own forum and having Steammods delete any negative feedback. Steammods also actively downvote negative reviews reportedly.Also I think Gaijin spies on what you say via bots as I myself have been banned from chat while ONLY talking in Squadchat with my friends, badmouthing Gaijin. 15 day chatban for hate messages. Only hate against Gaijin though.Giving russian vehicles magic abilities, nerfing all other countries to oblivion (mostly germans), banning and deleting community for feedback and having a MASSIVE P2W mentality with 50 euro blatantly overpowered vehicles.Edit: Gaijin forced a youtuber to delete a video he made with footage showing a hacker. They do not want the world to see they cannot handle hackers.Shame Gaijin, shame. We complain to you because we want to see a good WW2 game but all you do is hide behind your nationalism and hate on us.Also alot of members of the community are toxic.			"

												Played the game for months, unlocked tier V planes for every nation and reached the mid-ranks with some tanks.Then Gaijin sent me a message claiming I had used the Steam refund system to refund money on a 5000 Golden Eagles purchase MONTHS after they claim the refund had happened.  However, I have never used the Steam refund system before. I couldn't find any record of it on my bank account and had to spent €25.- in the Gaijin shop for War Thunder in order to get my account back after it got frozen.After that I' am no longer interested in playing this game. Not after the Devs showed a poor ability in communcation and made accusations which I couldn't even defend rightfully. Don't spent any money on this game, Gaijin might ask you for more after you do ;)			"

Please read before making consideration:I am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. If you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.All that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. Thanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).Update: After the latest updates I can no longer support this game. Can't change review though.			"

												War Thunder is fun, well-developed, and addicting. I hardly have any complaints about the game itself, which makes it a shame that I can no longer even stand it. The moderators of this game are the WORST I've ever encountered ANYWHERE, and that's against every website, forum, or game I've had an account on since the age of Dial-Up. The false sense of superiority and lack of basic respect that these Mods exhibit is as angering as the amount of hours I've sunk into a game that I am no longer able to play. I am still in disbelief that EVERY moderator has blown me off, with the exception of the one that replied just so he could call me a Nazi. His empty accusation isn't just offensive, but it's pathetic. I am not a Nazi and I never represented myself to be in any fashion, the mod simply formed an opinion based on my German username and refuses to believe anything different. I have been nothing but pleasant to every moderator, even offering an explanation and a solution to the man who insulted me. Unfortunately, I have received nothing but disrespect in return from the people who are refusing to reinstate my account.The bottom line is that Gaijin needs to increase their standards of who they accept as moderators before they lose even more players. You can have a perfect game, but no one will play if the people representing the game are rude and demeaning.			"

												Well 800+ hours in as a Realstic Battles player and I think I can say it's 800 hours wasted. To start out with most people will love the game, then as you slowly progress through the tech trees (unless you buy premium which is what they want, don't do it) you start to realise something is a little off. When you are in your Tiger 2 H at 6.7 BR, just minding your own business trying not to be one shot killed by a 122mm shell from an IS-2, then you see it. A little green ♥♥♥♥ driving towards you head on, it's a T-54, yes a tank from AFTER the war fighting WW2 tanks. And well tough luck because you are at his mercy and can't do ♥♥♥♥ to him. Why Gaijin think it's fine to stick post WW2 tanks against WW2 tanks I will never know. You look at this T-54 drivers stats and he has a 90% win rate and a 3.00 K/D ratio. And this isn't just with the T-54 , it's with the majority of Russian tanks. I've noticed a pattern of Russian T5 tanks having 60 and 70% win rates and 2.00 K/D ratios almost always compared to German and American tanks who tend to have 40-50% win rates and just barely over a 1.00 K/D ratio. ""There's no Russian bias!"" the Gaijin apologist fanboys cry out.... yea ♥♥♥♥ing right. If you are like me and you follow what Gaijin are up to with the development of the game, you will see that  they are completely ♥♥♥♥ing inept corrupt snow monkeys looking to get enough Rubels from their playerbase through premium currency so they can buy potatos and vodka and listen to some Russian hard bass while dancing in circles rubbing their hands together like the Jews they are. Every update is them adding a new PREMIUM vehicle that is completely broken and overpowered such as the plethora of tanks they plan to add with rockets on them. And the current rocket tank (the Calliopie) which is ridiculously priced costing £40-50 worth of premium currency and that is completely broken and overpowered. And you know what? No one asked for these, no one. And alas this brings me to my next point. Gaijin do not listen, ever. You ask for more balanced BRs on T5 tanks and they respond by giving some random T2 Russian tank some more bullets for the coaxial machine gun... They just don't give a ♥♥♥♥. If I were to pit Konami and Gaijin off in a contest to see who was the worse company it would be too close to call. Many veterans of this game have left it, many big YouTube channels (such as Jingles, Bismarck, RamJB) have stopped covering it. But yet the ♥♥♥♥s given by Gaijin are still 0. They are slowly suffocating this game to death with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This used to be a good game, I mean there is no other like it. It's damage model, looks and large variety of vehicles are really un challenged. War Thunder takes a completely different approach to tanks than what World of Tanks does and In my opinion this is the better approach, the realistic damage models and logical spotting system are just so much better (meaning if you look where a tank is it's there and not invisble because of some BS ""camo system""). Gaijin are like children, in fact I am pretty sure it's run by a bunch of chilldren, they cannot take critiscism, if you try to build a logical complaint about the game it will be dismissed on the forums by the moderators because they too are immature children indoctrinated to see only good in the game and nothing else. If I was to describe the forums I would say they are like a Russian Gulag, you really do get that impression with the much BS and censorship that goes on there. The hoards of loyal fagboys defending every broken aspect of the game regardless of what logic and reason you try to use on them. You would think a veteran player who has been playing the game from the very start would have some form of influenece on Gaijin and what they choose to do to the game? Nope. They are treated even worse than brand new players coming to the game because Gaijin realise they have lost the veteran players to the actual truth and would rather focus on brainwashing more noob players into think this is a ""good game"".Overall this game was something unique and still kind of is, I really can't play World of Tanks or any other WW2 flight game as a substitute because War Thunder sits perfectly in between the extreme hardcore flight sims and extremely arcadey flight games. Likewise with the ground combat. But this game is dying, slowly but surely. Not too long ago there were 100,000 players online during a new patch, that number dropped to 60,000 a few days later and has not gone past 60,000 since. Most days it sits around 40-45,000 players. Just goes to show how many people actually see this company for what they actually are, a money grabbing disgrace who have 0 regards for their community.TLDR - Take it from me, stay away. Gaijin will make you sick to your stomach in disgust with how they treat the community and the game.			"

 Let me start by saying this This game had potential. There was a time I was a diehard fan of this game. I had been playing since 1.27. AIR: T5 US; T5 GER; T4 UK; T5 USSR; T5 JAPGROUND: T5 US; T5 GER; T2 UK; T5 USSR; T3 JAPThis game used to be so fun. It had beautiful graphics, sounds were amazing, and the whole package was there. But as time passed, the Devs for this game have become more and more like a Russian propaganda booth. There IS a Russian Bias in this game and I’m not talking a minor one like you see in American games with American companies.  Russian Bias Russian Bias? Where is the proof?Let us start with the T-34, the BR for all the T-34’s are way too low in any and all game modes. Look at the win/loss ratio for T-34’s and its apparent across all accounts of how under-tiered this thing is. While tanks like the Tiger I sit at 5.7 (Ausf. H) and 6.0 (Ausf. E). That is one example of the whole BR skew. The BR in this game is skewed with Russia being favored more than any other country. Ok is that it? Lets move on to the inaccurate models. The T-34 utilized the Christie Suspension. This made it mobile for its time but it lacked  SHOCK ABSORBERS  which gave it horrible stability on the move and when trying to stop. This means it takes longer to line up a straight shot after moving making it either inaccurate or exposed for a few seconds before having a lined up shot. The Tiger one utilized shock absorbers but for some reason the T-34 can stabilize and line up a shot long before a Tiger I can. In-fact, the Tiger I wobbles like crazy upon trying to stop making it the exposed target upon trying to stabilize. Next lets look at the KV-2 utilizing the M-10 152MM howitzer. “KV-2 (334) – A heavy assault tank with the M-10 152 mm howitzer, the KV-2 was produced at the same time as the KV-1. Due to the size of its heavy turret and gun, the KV-2 was slower and had a much higher profile than the KV-1. Those captured and used by the German Army were known as (Sturm)Panzer kampfwagen KV-II 754(r) and often used for artillery observation due to its height. Few were produced due to its  combat ineffectiveness,  mainly the  decreased speed  due to the weight of the new gun and turret. The enlarged turret also offered a much bigger target, resulting in it being easier to hit and destroy than other KV tanks. Due to the increased turret weight due to expanded dimensions and a heavier gun, the turret traverse mechanism could work only on level ground”Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov_tank#KV_and_other_heavy_Soviet_tanks_comparedYet for some reason, this thing charges faster than an IS-1. Next is the M-10 cannons ammunition.“The G-530 could not be fired with a ""full"" charge without putting the crew at risk of having the shell explode in the barrel. A special version of the shell, the G-530Sh, was developed to allow use with the full charge.”They will not model this but they have no problem modeling in “poor quality German steel [at the end of the war]” that has an effective thickness of 95mm instead of the actual 100mm listed. I don’t count Wikipedia as a source.  <--good for you buddy, moving on. The devs. The lovely, lovely devs. Do you know what you get for voicing a genuine concern on the forums about the BR or Match Maker? You get the Internet KGB locking and removing your post as well as a warning. You know what you get for posting a video online showing hacks and the weakness of Gaijins anti-cheat software? A whole battle mode being held hostage with the price of full censorship in the game (look into phlydaily’s thing with that). This company is the same company that has had issues with censorship and blackmailing in the past. Anton Yudintsev, CEO of Gaijin Entertainment and Russian KGB is the devil of gaming himself. The whole of War Thunder is the USSR and Anton and the rest of the Devs there are the KGB. If you voice anything of concern genuine or sh*tpost, the mods come down hard on you as per “orders” from the admins and Devs. Let me say this to avoid rambling; they only care for themselves and your money. As long as you pay, and don’t bash Russia, your fine. I could stack more examples of their Behavior (unethical or otherwise) but if you really want to find out more, just google it, you won’t have a hard time finding more about it. Historical flight & tank models/accuracy and balanced gaming Most of Historical accuracy can be seen in the first section, but when your game has to keep adding end game stuff and constantly buff and nerf things on a monthly basis, is it really accurate or is balance the name priority. They have buffed and nerfed the Sabre, Mig and other end game jets like crazy. I will grant then the fact that end game jets is all around balance but at the same time, it feels more skewed the Russia. I wish I could pull up some facts but I don’t care for jets so I never bothered looking into it. The F4U, and the F6F are horribly underpowered (in engine strength) though. When the famed Hellcat with its 19:1 K/D ratio and its legendary BnZ capability, in the Pacific Theater, only outdone by the Corsair and its Pratt and Whitney engine, can be kept up too by a A6M2 Zero for the most part, there is a serious problem. For the longest while, all the F4U’s and the one F6F have had crap engine output that puts them to shame compared to their real life counterpart. The Skyraider is in the same boat being able to outperform the F8F Bearcat in real life; yet the in-game version is a brick and a half for a flight model and a toaster oven for an engine. Oh and while we’re on the topic of that, let’s not forget the TU-4 which was added in update 1.59. The engines on the stolen B-29 design were outfitted to have 200 additional HP output per engine, but the counterweight of the extra bombs and the engine itself made it almost identical to the B-29. Yet the thing might as well be flying like it had 2000HP extra. I won’t judge the TU-4 too harshly since it just came out but I would not be surprise if they didn’t change it at all. One last detail on this is the inaccurate modeling of the Maus tank turret. The front cheeks are supposed to be 240mm-250mm according to multiple sources. In-game it is only 220MM, just enough to let IS-2 tanks that  have been given post war ammunition  to penetrate the front cheeks when 100 meters of closer. This list goes on of inaccuracies that benefit Russian tech and inaccuracies that hurt everyone else’s tech. ATGM’s ATGM’s are a thing now…enough said. Conclusion I can write for days on the inaccuracies about this game that Gaijin has let pile up since the day I started playing. Don’t get me wrong, I loved this game with a burning passion but that has long since died out. I’m not a wehraboo who will try to oversell an 88MM as the spear of Longinus, and I’m all stars and stripes for kicking an axis member in the D*ck but to butcher all the nations, even the axis ones, and raise the nation of the USSR up and above is a too much for me.  The worst though is to watch my favorite game burn like it has over these past few years. It is just…depressing. It’s also why I took all this time to write this review as a warning to you, just turn back even if you came from WoT. I’ve only played a little bit of Wargaming’s stuff but I can tell you I had more fun with that then I did playing War thunder. TL;DR:  Russian bias, KGB Devs, broken models, ATGM’s. Put together make a horrible game.			"

												Update to my review at the bottom.VR support: they think the Vive is not 'gamer friendly', but they'll support it 'eventually'. Rift support still doesn't work properly. If you want a flightgame for VR look elsewhere.I'll admit, I'm hooked on this game. But I just can't recommend anyone waste money on this game in the sorry state it is in now. Any player feedback talking about bad things in the game is met with passive aggressive responses from Mods, or just downright hostility. This is just one of the reasons there is no way for player intervention to fix the biggest issues currently with the game. I'm not here to explain the basic concept of the game, just the complete trainwreck this game is becoming. I'll start with my gripes with Simulator, the biggest problem:They refuse to admit that its unfair to have third person view available for Bombers, none of the heavy bombers have cockpits at all to speak off, they basically get this virtual cockpit that makes you feel like you're flying a drone than a WWII bomber. They said they would implement bomber cockpits over 2 years ago, they started with the Pe-2/3 series aircraft, with nothing to show for it since then. Bombers in Simulator also get manual gunner control, with the same accuracy and visual awareness they get in Arcade and Simulator, while fighters in those modes also have the same accuracy and visual awareness as bombers, its not an imbalance problem per se. While back in Simulator fighters have no such luxuries, you're confined to a modeled cockpit, with no view besides what the pilot himself would see.Even today they've admitted that bomber cockpits are a 'long term goal' and that there are more important things to implement, such as more tanks post Korean War. British Tanks, Italian tech tree, More end tier jet aircraft, such as the Vampire, more bombers like the Do-17 series(With no modeled cockpit either mind you) They instead want to implement more vehicles as if that's a more pressing matter than finishing the actual vehicles already in the game. They also have no intention of changing the way bomber gunners work at all, so you'll still have that amazing third person view even with implemented cockpits. The Simulator community used to be a pretty good size when I started playing this game, most people left because they just don't do anything to improve Simulator, player counts keep dropping. They use this as an excuse to not not do anything for Simulator, because the player count is complete rubbish compared to Arcade. Like no wonder man.Talking about post Korean War stuff. They've had the issue where nobody is playing high tiers 5, the way the game is anything jet powered is in tier 5, regardless of its performance. Anything propeller driven is tier 4 or below, regardless of its performance. For a long time the Me 262, the worlds first introduced Jet fighter 1944, was facing Korean War sabres from the 1950's, it even became its own joke on the net: http://wiki.warthunder.com/images/f/f4/Me_2OP62_-_Back_to_the_Future.jpeg The War Thunder Player Council, WTPC, was made up mostly as a PR stunt with voted player representatives, designed for improving communications between Gaijin(the game developer) and the player base. They managed to do a few things, like get the overtiered Me 262 to stop facing the best Korean War vehicles out there such as the Sabre and the Mig-15bis. But everything they've done is pretty much moot following Gaijin's ""Quantatitive Restrictions"" matchmaker just in the last week, the intention being that if you have a team of weak planes, against the other team of weak planes, with 4 or so really really advanced planes on each team, that they'll end up getting all the kills and the rest are dead meat. They've basically destroyed everything the WTPC had done to fix the 'end game' as they call it. The complaints from players has always been that there was overcompression with the high tiers. But instead they just overcompress it even more, so everything from the Korean war and post is now facing WWII Jets and props. The performance devide is so big you can't get it anywhere else in the game. They've done the same with tanks too so you have what was arguably the best tank in the game, the T-10M, a Cold War tank from the Russians, facing German WWII tanks from 1944. This was all done to lower the queue times, they thought it was such an problem that people only queued in the T-10M and IS-4M, so they decide to bring the lower tiers into their games. It should have been obvious from the get go that everyone spam queued the IS-4M before they introduced the T-10M, introducing that tank was such a huge mistake. When no other nation has anything close to it.That isn't even the best part, they've even given tanks such as the tier 4; IS-2 1944, ammunition that was developed years later, the BR-412D, only ever used on the IS-3 and IS-4M, but they give the IS-2 it in the name of ""balance"", its got a similar penetration as the APCR shell the Germans in the same tiers get, APCR has no explosive filler, but this shell the Russians got has even more explosive filler than the normal shells the Germans get. Insane.All this has brown up on the forums, months ago any discussion on the ""ABuse"" of bombers in Simulator was met with a swift warning from a specific Senior Moderator and the threads locked. Guy thought he was 'helping' us by silencing our arguments, as if they didn't exist. As if enemy bombers landing on your airfieild and killing you on spawn with no way to stop it, over and over, is not abusive in any way at all. Here are youtube videos of exactly what I'm talking about: Unconventional AAA, No such thing as ABuse, Spawn Camping,all this is 100% okay according to them.The term ""ABuse"" and ""ABuser"" originates from how easy it is to do good with bombers in Simulator, where you openly have people admit on the forums and elsewhere on the internet, those that mostly play Arcade, ""Arcade Battles user"" play bombers in simulator only because its easier than in Arcade or Realistic, in order to be able to grind jets faster, and only because its easier, its much harder for fighters to take down bombers in Sim than it is in Realistic, where bad bomber pilots would be toast, while in sim even the worst pilot ever, as long as he can keep the plane in the air, can be the best player on the team.For as long as you have such incompetent 12 year olds moderating their forums who can't even punctuate properly in any form. There will be no way to even get this message across to the developers because those 12 year old moderators will outright prevent your message from reaching them. But its not just them, even the top guys doing the decisions for the game have no clue what's going on, its as if nobody at Gaijin even plays Simulator at all, or the game in general when it comes to how they're handling tier 5 stuff.I will only stick with this game for now because I'm a co-leader of a squadron in-game, and I'm not going to abandon them because the game is falling apart.EDIT: The game still advertises its self as being an MMO, its the same 32 player limit you see in TF2. is TF2 an MMO? No? Then War Thunder isn't either.Update March/April 2016: Most prominent moderator I mentioned is still a Senior Moderator. But hasn't shown his/her face in the Simulator Battles Discussion part of the forum in a long time. WTPC is non existent. They just introduced the P-61 heavy fighter, without a cockpit. Its currently the most devastating aircraft to face in Simulator. Now you get 'captured' when you land on enemy airfields. Simulator is still treated like it's just DLC.The following video explains more because I'm reaching the character limit for reviews:

												Tanks are okay until Rank 4, when the serious grind starts. Planes are easy to grind and you can get to rank 5 with sanity intact. If gameplay is all that matters then by all means play it, but if you care about how corrupt the company can be then beware.List of some things they did off the top of my head:- Sued an individual for using the domain name ""Gaijin.net"" even though the original gaijin.net predated the company by seven years.- Threatened to ruin part of the game if players didn't help them abuse youtube's DMCA strikes against youtubers that showed bad things about the game.- Completely ignores community balance suggestions, acts like their game is 100% balanced and that anyone who suggests changes is wrong.- Gaijin support is not worth contacting, they find ways to circumvent their own policies.Not that any of this affects gameplay, just thought people should know what kind company is getting the money.BONUS STORY: Started an air realistic match and as soon as it started I saw a captured P47 teamkill 3 players (one due to fire after he got kicked) then J out. I messaged him after the battle, apparently that's all he does. I said he should be perma-banned and he responded telling me to look at his stats and that he'd been TKing every match for months and received countless complaints but yet wasn't banned or even warned.

												I bet you're wondering what a person who has this much time spent playing the game is doing by not recommending it.  Well, in short, it goes a little like this:Pre-patch 1.37, the game was making incremental, but still positive steps forward.  In general, the game's biggest downfall back then was simply lack of proper flight models for a lot of the aircraft.  The economy woes from patch 1.29 had mostly been completely fixed by 1.33-1.35, and the game was just a pleasure to play and I couldn't get enough of it.  I even decided to devote my semi-successful YouTube channel completely to War Thunder.  A mistake that I'm now regretting.After patch 1.37, the game simply went to ♥♥♥♥.  While the game's flight models are now in probably their best state yet (but still not even anywhere close to perfect), nearly every other aspect of the game is has gotten 10 times worse.  The issues that I have with the game in its current state can be a bit hard to count, but I'll give it a try:Non-existant in-game economyNearly impossible grind (mostly the top two tiers, 4 and 5) for both unlocking aircraft/tanks and the aircraft/tank modules.  Forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account, and even with a premium account, tier 5 vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game.  This ""grindy"" element adds a pay to win mechanic.Horribly F'd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics.  For a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity, it's a bit odd to me that it doesn't even take history into account when creating matchups for the vehicles.  This in addition to the fact that Gaijin's system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchups, so we now have a game that's  neither historical, nor is it balanced .A completely broken and unfinished ground forces.  It wasn't ready to be released in open beta, and none of the closed beta testers were pushing for a release.  Yet they did it anyway, and now we have this broken bug-fest filled with wonky damage models, invisible tanks, tiny maps, and useless terrain.The horrible damage models is not unique to the tanks.  War Thunder now has heavy bombers flying around and taking damage as if they were the Starship Enterprise.  Not to mention the flight models of these bombers also resemble the Enterprise as well.The development team is prioritizing prototype and failure aircraft over some of the real iconic workhorse aircraft of WW2.  In addition to this, development has now made it clear that they have plans to add certain paper planes (aka blueprint planes - Stuff that was never even built).A development team that often lies to their customer base and doesn't take constructive critisism from those customers seriously.  They have a very ""The customer is always wrong"" kind of attitude, one could say.The community management team in general does a bad job of running the forums.  A lot of them are truly passionate about the game and what they do, but they don't understand the roles of a moderator/administrator.  Then again, a lot of them are just immature children (some of them literally are children) that will delete your post, put you on a mod queue, or ban you simply because they feel like it.Alright, I know those last two weren't necessesarily complaints about the actual game, but I still feel like they needed mentioning.  The consumer has to know what they're getting into before downloading a game and cetainly before spending money on that game.  That being said, I've finally thrown in the towel with this game.  I can't recommend playing it in its current state, and I would definitly advise against spending any money on it.  People come for the pretty graphics, but they stay for good gameplay.As of now, War Thunder only has one of those two.  I wish Gaijin luck in the long run, as they'll truly need it.Thanks for reading.			"

												Don't bother with this one.  Over my extensive play time, I have watched Gaijin take a promising, fun game and turn it in to something that is directly opposed to the wishes of their player base, from balance concerns to gameplay changes.  While the core gameplay is still solid and the graphics are honestly quite beautiful, the company behind this game is one of the most dishonest I've seen.  They actively censor any discussion of their game that paints it in a negative light, even going so far as to create a poll asking forum members to choose between changing core mechanics of a game mode, or issuing copyright strikes against any video that discusses hacking in War Thunder.  Add to that their absurdly draconian chat rules and the e-thug moderators that gleefully ban anyone who has the nerve to disagree with them, and you have an environment that is extremely hostile to free speech.  There are better flight games and better tank games out there.  Do not give Gaijin your money or your time.  They don't deserve it.			"

												First of all, the good;This game has amazing graphics, and is incredibly optimized. I'm barely kidding when I say this thing could probably run on a toaster.This game has a huge variety of aircraft from all of the major players of ww2.For the most part, airplane flight models are accurate and well balanced based on real life statistics.There is a gamemode for everyone, want to play a highly realistic flight simulator mimicking real life? Simulator batles for you. Want an easier time but still a challenge, realistic flight models and mouse aim? Historical/realistic (the name changed). Just want to spam the cannons and mess around while pulling top gun maneuvers with flight models being only suggestions? Arcade has you covered.There is a decent variety of maps, varying across the world.Want to drive tanks and other vehicles? Go ahead and play ground forces.Beautifully detailed aircraft exteriors and interiors.But wait, with all of this great stuff, mostly gameplay and mechanics, why don't you recommend this?And here we get to the bad;Gaijin is very slow to implement updates to their game, and have consistently ignored player feedback/ suggestionz to make the game better, for absolutely no reason.Gaijin has consistently made game decisions with the intent of making money, to the detriment of players by;      Creating a system that limits progression by forcing players to purchase six aircraft in each of the five tiers in order to      progress on to the next tier.    Adding a research system as well as the purchasing system to force players to spend more time unlocking aircraft.    Reducing the money and research points earned for each kill and assist in game.    Create an upgrade system for each aircraft requiring you to spend time researching parts for your aircraft just to get it up to the stat characteristics it historically had    Gaijin have locked country flags behind a paywall to ""prevent insults by disrespecting flags"". However these flags are easily purchasable for real money.      For all of these there is a way to speed up the progression by spending real money. Gaijin have slowed down   progression to such a degree that you are almost forced to pay real money in order to progress in a decent fashion.  There is much that needs to be improved, for instance better flight models, a vast improvement to the leveling system and tiering system. Cockpit view for bombers and other heavy aircraft. What is not needed, and what is contantly added, is more premium (and expensive) aircraft., for the past couple of years during sales gaijin will raise the base price of a game and then discount it to such a degree that the final price will be the original price before the sale. This is a shady and unethical buisness practice.The endgame for war thunder (jet aircraft) is lackluster and unfinished, providing no motivation to stay once money has been given to gaijin.Finally, the tiering system, by which players are matched up against each other, is horribly inefficient and compressed, meaning players will be competing against far superior planes, and altogether making it unenjoyable for beginners.For these reasons, I cannot recommend war thunder to players for purchase. If you can play this game without paying any money, then by all means go ahead, but it has become harder and harder to justify paying for this game.This game has so much promise, and I desperately hope that all of these problems can be solved, however on the current path, it cannot reach it's full potential.

												Do not play this game. Do not give these Con men money.The only thing this game simulates is that Gaijin does not give 2 F**ks about its community. The patch today (23/09/15) proves this as a patch that was added, that was widely criticized by old and new plays was put into effect with a massive middle finger from Gaijin.3 Years I have wasted on this game, I loved this game with 2500 hours in all (played before it was added to steam) I just cannot support them anymore this was the final nail in the coffin.

												I have been playing War Thunder since patch 1.27, well before it was on steam and I can safely say War Thunder is a great game, it has many things to offer, but I could never recommend it. The reasons I would never recommend it are simple. The Grind is too harsh in the later game unless you pay for a premium account, something I used to do but no longer will ever again. The matchmaking took a turn for the worst many patches back now and Gaijin refuse to admit their failings (the matchmaking makes the late game -tier 4-5- excrusiatingly bad). The bugs, many of which have been around as long as I have played it, are prevelant and will, I assume, never be addressed. But the be all and end all reason I could never recommend War Thunder to anyone is that Gaijin don't care about their community, they couldnt care less about anyone playing the game unless they come from Russia and lets never get in to the horrible pains of dealing with customer support (it doesnt exist). At the very least if you do play War Thunder, don't ever give the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s your money.			"

												After hundreds of hours on this, I can honestly say I cannot reccomend this game. The real issue is how ♥♥♥♥ed the battle rating system Gaijin implemented is. You may not notice it at first... but eventually it will drive you crazy. Because it will never be fixed, never. This is the second problem, the developer is actively hostile to player feedback. On the forums people's posts concerning negative aspects of the game are deleted by the moderating staff with no reason given. It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company... The payment model, while fair, is horrendously overpriced, and never on sale. The grind for this game is absolutely insane. It takes soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to grind out anything past tier 3 in aircraft that you will quickly grow sick of it. (Edit: By the way trolls, I'm saying this because I'm grinding out tier 5, not because I haven't gotten to tier 3... morons.)I wish I could reccomend this game, because at its core warthunder is one of the best flight sims out there (and when the match maker isn't being ♥♥♥♥, games can be incredibly fun) but for the reasons stated above, I simply cannot. There are developers that treat their customers with a million times the respect that gaijin shows for its playerbase. Games like Warframe really show how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaijin is about rewarding their playerbase and how bad their free to play model actually is.Save you time, save your money, play something else. Go outside, work out, you will feel a million times better about yourself than if you waste your time on this.Edit 1: To the commenters that say ""KEKEKEK Yall just suck at this game, git gud"" You will be deleted. That is not a valid criticism, and even if it were true it doesn't make any negative critique of the game invalid. I have seen frankly amazing players making the same criticisms of this game. I've been playing this game for years and have finally gotten fed up, if you are still enjoying the game I have no intention of taking that from you, I am only warning you that the things that annoy you about the game now are likely to be there for quite some time.Edit 2: I have had some time to cool down away from the game, and have even tried getting back into it for the 1.51 update. While I can say that I still have fun in this game from time to time I still cannot really reccomend it. Not yet anyway. They made some neat additions and added some cool planes, but really it's still the massive, frustrating time sink I remember. If you've only just started this game you can be forgiven for thinking that it's awesome. It is!... Until you try to be serious about progressing, then it turns from fun into literally pulling your hair out. I would reccomend trying this game, and then maybe playing for an hour or two every week but no more than that... It's hard to find a game to get your WWII flight sim fix these days, especially for free. So unfortunately it doesn't really have much in the way of competition. Once again, I wish I could reccomend this game but my opinion hasn't changed, spend your time and money on a game/developer that respects its players.			"

												I'm a professional pilot with more warthunder hours then I have real flight hours and after all these almost 800 hours of warthunder I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong I've had fun in this game in the past playing with friends and so on. But I have now reached the higher tiers of this game and I can tell you one thing. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. The devs went full retard and they will end up destroying what could've been an awesome game. I have 3 huge problems with the devs of this game and I will outline them below:1 - LACK OF BALANCE: Yes I like realism in games but to a certain extent.. games need to be fun.. and to be fun they need to be balanced. If you love playing with russian tanks and airplanes you will have a great time playing this game. If you prefer German or American and british units go ahead and buy yourself a lot of lube because they will sodomize THE LIVING S!""# OUT OF YOU.2 - RIDICULOUS MATCHMAKING: ""IN SOVIET RUSSIA YOU DO NOT CHOOSE MATCH... MATCH CHOOSES YOU"" that's right folks the matchmaking on this game is ridiculous. You can not choose which map you wanna play in. You don't even get to choose which theater of war you play in so if you take for example the TBF-AVENGER medium bomber used in the pacific 95% of the time matchmaking takes you to the battle of the bulge. And that's after you select REALISTIC battles on the matchmaking. And that's when you're lucky and they don't put you on a REALISTIC MIXED Battle against overpowered russians.3- BOMBERS: I've had a lot of fun with bombing missions in the lower tiers. So once I got around tier 3 with the brits I decided I wanted to unlock one of my fav bombers. The lancaster. So after like 700 hours of playing this game without putting money into it I decided it was maybe time to spend some money and save some time so I spent about 30 euros on golden eagles and insta-unlocked the Lancaster. What I can tell you now is that next time I'll just go outside and hand the 30 euros to someone and tell them to spit in my face and laugh out loud and call me stupid in russian because this is what Gaijin did to me. The lancaster (and any other high-tier bomber for that matter) is a great choice if you like to pleasure men. Thats what I've done on any mission I've flown with these bombers.. You spend like 10 minutes flying to a bomb target only to get intercepted by a jet fighter with enough armament that it prematurely ejaculates 1000 pounds of lead on you before your gunners even smell him cumming. 13/10 ""If you didn't hate russians before playing this game you will now ;)""			"

												Never before have I seen such repeatedly bad descisions be made by a single body. War Thunder used to be, and had the potential to remain one of the best games around. Then the devs screwed up again and again and again and again. If you're looking to find a good F2P game, this used to be it. It is no more.			"

												After 350+ hrs on Steam i can honestly not recomend this game. It sure is realistic and fun to play, but the obvious  russian bias is out of controll. The only people who deny it`s existance are A) from Russian Ethnicity, B) Gajin, C) People who play USSR just because they are OP.Gajin does not care to fix game breaking bugs exept when they affect Soviet Tanks/Planes.If they fix all those bugs i happily change my review.Ps. If you think this is a rage review then you are wrong i am at tier IV in BOTH Soviet and German Tree.			"

												So, I just feel like this needs to go on record, and to actually say something about it. Now... I like WarThunder. It's probably one of the best online, WWII multiplayer flight-sims out there. American, Russian, British, German, and Japanese aircraft all make an appearance, so you can fly anything from the P-51 Mustang, to a Bf-109, and feel like you're actually in the cockpit. Heck, they've even recently added in tank combat, and are even going to be adding in naval warfare in the near future! That said, this game has gone completely down the toilets within the past several months.Lemme explain a bit of the history of the game. Awhile ago, there were ten tiers, and you used to have a level with all of the different factions (American, Russian, British, etcetera), that determined what aircraft you could buy, due to their tier. Lets say you managed to get up to tier 4 in American aircraft, right? Well, that means you could buy any aircraft that's from tier one, to tier four, but if you're only tier 2 in Germany, you can only buy up to tier 2 German aircraft. Get the idea? Right, good. Recently, they completely revamped their level up and tier system, making it so there are only five tiers (which condenses it by quite a bit), but instead of unlocking the next tier of aircraft, you could only unlock one aircraft at a time. This isn't really a bad idea... but the problem is, this also nearly quadrupled the amount of time it will take to unlock every aircraft of a certain faction. What's worse, is they lowered (by a *lot*) the amount of experience you earn per assist or kill, forcing you to slow down your leveling even further, and enhancing the amount of free exp you get per match, which just entices you to buy their premium currency so you can use said free experience. It has turned this game into a slog of a grind that makes progression rediculously slow and boring.The method of experience is by far one of my biggest gripes, I'll admit. It's a sickeningly underhanded method of encouraging players to spend money on the game, to buy the premium currency so you can spend your free experience. I don't usually mind ""pay to progress"" games, they're usually not too terrible, but this one is rediculous. It makes World of Tanks' progression seem like a breeze.On to the next hit against this game: balancing. With the aforementioned condensing of the tier system into only five tiers, Gaijin thought it would be clever to introduce a Battle Rating system, to compensate, and to avoid having biplanes going up against end-of-war aircraft. This isn't really so bad, and it probably could have even been a good idea, had they implemented it correctly. You'd expect the Battle Rating system to be based off of the aircraft (or tank's) stats, and understanding that something like say... a P-40 Kittyhawk, or an F6F Hellcat would be a fair match against an A6M3 Zero, as they fought against one another in the actual war. Right? Well... that's a nice thought, but it's not how it works. See, their battle rating system is based entirely on the performance of the aircraft in player hands. The better someone does with an aircraft, the higher its battle rating within its own tier. This is inherently flawed; while someone might do well in an aircraft, that does not necessarily mean that it is able to go against something better than it, and still win. An A6M3 Zero can see fights against aircraft that were built several *years* after their initial development, because their battle ratings are similar. This is horribly wrong, and does not do anything to make a game fun, or balanced.And, on to the last topic of my complaints. This is actually a rather common one amongst most of the player base, and - while I'm normally not one to base something on unfounded theories and accusations, you'd think that since the majority of WarThunder's player base seems to agree on this fact, it must be true to some degree. Russian aircraft, and tanks, are given unfair advantages, and handicaps. Bet you thought I was going to say overpowered, huh? Well... I won't, because most of their aircraft did function to the specs given in WarThunder. However. This does not mean that their questionable damage models, unrealistic flight models and characteristics, and their absolutely rediculously favoritism'd battle ratings, are fair. To elaborate: Russian aircraft have damage models that seem to soak up a lot of damage without the plane actually registering said hits (players coin this term as the aircraft being made of ""Stalinium""). Russian aircraft also have very... generous climb and turn rates, and this weird ability to dive faster, accelerate faster, and keep their momentum longer, than almost every aircraft, even those that were historically faster and better in a dive, a turn, or a climb (An Ishak monoplane from 1934 diving faster than an F4U Corsair, for example). And lastly, they seem to have this... preferential treatment when it comes to their battle rating (LA-5Fn having a battle rating of 4.0 even though it's a 1944 aircraft, whereas the P-51D-30 Mustang has a battle rating of 4.7, with worse stats, armament, and durability).Despite all these bad things I said, WarThunder is still fun every now and then. Personally, I think it would be even better if they fixed all of the balancing issues and horribly slooooow progression they have going. It's gone from an interesting and exciting game, to a boring, slogfest of a grind that just isn't fun anymore. But who knows, maybe it's just me? Give it a try for yourself. Its worth the download. Just don't be surprised if it takes you several *weeks* to get out of the starting planes and/or tanks.			"

												after 500+ hours on this game i can honestly say that i dont reccomend it. As much as it pains me to say that, in the current state the game is absolutely broken, especially german tanks and planes. The german planes are broken, and the german tanks are underpowered and completely outmatched by their american and russian counterparts, and the recent update to the BR system means that uptiered rank III and IV tanks get to fight russian T-10M's and IS-4's with 120mm of armor on all sides and literally unpennable from the front. all while the starting german tier V tanks arent even that good, starting tanks on that tier are the 10.5cm Tiger II (a Tiger II (H) with a slightly bigger gun), Panther II (Panther F with a slightly bigger gun), Coelion (SPAA so useless against most tanks anyways) and the Jagdtiger (Tiger II without a rotating turret and a bigger gun) which are literally no different from their tier IV counterparts besides the armament, meaning that you can be detonated with the force of a thousand suns from any direction, while you cant pen anything from the front unless its a light tank. The planes are also unbearable because of how slow the german planes turn, it takes close to 25 seconds to make a full 360 degree turn in the fockewolf, while the BF is better its still slow, you simply cant keep up with the meanuverability of other planes and as a result you are always killed. Russian planes are overpowered, shooting gigantic rounds that detonate your plane instantaniously if it hits your plane. As much as i want this game to be good it just isnt anymore, untill the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together I cant reccomend this game.			"

												После мною сыгранных 190 часов игры,я хочу написать не большой обзор о War Thunder.Это один из лучших MMO-симуляторов которые я встречал.Боевая авиации, бронетехника и в ближайшем будущем скорее всего добавят флот.Так же на выбор есть 5 стран. Ничего схожего с этим я еще не видел.Игра на любителя,не стоит судить ее в чем-либо плохом.По ходу игры я не нашел минусов,разве что не большой дисбаланс,который никак не портит игру.Журнал «Игромания» назвал War Thunder «прорывом года»Игра сделана профессионально и достойна высшей оценки! 10/10After I played 190 hours of the game, I want to write a small review about War Thunder. This is one of the best MMO simulators I've ever met. The battle aviation, armored vehicles and in the near future are likely to add a fleet. Also, there are 5 countries to choose from.Nothing like this I have not seen. The game for an amateur, do not judge it in anything bad. In the course of the game, I found no cons, except that there is not a big imbalance that does not spoil the game. The magazine ""Igromania"" called War Thunder ""Breakthrough of the year""The game is done professionally and deserves the highest score! 10/10			"

												Been playing this game for 2 years and after patch 1.35, the devs have been making idiotic, game breaking decisions one after the other. Whats worse is that when you try to tell them about it, they either ignore you or ban you. The recent patch completely killed it for me, despite the fact that this game was the go to thing for me on a computer for the past 24 months. I actually have two and a half months of play time because I started playing it before it went on steam. It still looks great but if you use maximum visual settings ,you will be at a disadvantage in both air and especially ground battles. And if that won't kill it for you, the awful lack of balance will.			"

												After all my gameplay experience I have to admit that Russian bias is strong with this one.It was fun before the patches and nerfs because we could actually have fun with the other nations other than Soviets..Its just garbage now.If you are a fan of anything rather than Soviet Vehicles or Planes, stay away from this game. Because developers say the Soviets were literally too OP back at WW2 and theres nothing they can do about it.And just so you know, I took out a Kingtiger with my T-34.. Now I believe(!) that the propaganda video on youtube about T-34 destroying 25 Tigers is actually real... <<This, my friend is the proof of what this game turns you into.			"

												Why I liked and played this game: 1) I mostly played Ground Forces. Tanks look bad ♥♥♥. The noise of the tracks, the sound of the engine, the force of the gun. The dirt that would pile on the tank when shots landed nearby. It was awesome. 2) No health points. Your tank died once the crewmen inside it died. Either through the tank getting shot and shrapnel spraying inside the tank, or a fire/explosion caused by your ammo/fuel taking a hit.3) Disabling tanks depending on where you shot them. Depending on where you hit/or get hit, different things would happen. If the driver or engine is hit the tank can't move. If the gunner is hit the tank can't shoot. If the loader is hit the tank can't load another round. If the turret is hit you can't shoot or move it.  4)Driving around in what seemed like realistic tanks. The terrain you're driving around also looks amazing. Great graphics.What made me uninstall:Realising how horribly unbalnced the game really is and that it's never getting better. Only worse with every patch that comes out. Russian bias. Developer is a Russian company and they provide unhistorical advantages to russian vehicles. 1.Russian ammo is coded to cause more fires than american/german ammo. 2.Russian ammo is coded to have more explosions than american/german ammo. 3.Russian tanks are coded to have a less chance to explode/catch on fire than american/german tanks. 4.Russian tanks are coded to bounce more shells. 5.Other tanks will wobble and screw your aim when moving or coming to a hard stop. Not russian tanks. 6.I saw a friend go from 3-4 average tanks destroyed per match to 8-10 when he switched to Russian tanks.All of this I ignored. The cards are stacked against you if not playing Russian tanks, but It was possible to make up for it with skill, tactics, and picking the right tanks to fight them. The last few patches just proved they won't stop stacking the cards. The highest tier is unbalanced and avoided due to Russian OP tanks. Instead of fixing the problem, they patched the game and changed the matchmaking to force players from the second highest tier to fight against them. WW2 tanks forced to fight post WW2 cold war tanks. Russian WW2 tanks allowed access to post WW2 cold war ammo. And now with the latest patch they introduced a new spotting/cammo system which makes a tank practically invisible unless you spend money to buy points to spot them. Every tank has a rating that determines their chance to be spotted.  Guess who it favors more? Russian tanks have a 40% advantage compared to American/German tanks. And if that wasn't enough, they wen't and nerfed the distance at which you could aim for everyone. The way I survived and did well vs the Russian Bias was to snipe them from long distances. Now they took that away. Well that's it. I'm done with this. One of the most stupidly unbalanced/unfair games I have ever played. This game will never have a competitive scene and it's player base is declining. Don't waste your time on it.			"

Status;""LOAD OF (Insert bad word here)""Game is good but their Customer Service just ruined it and completly justified the complaints you read on the web. It took them a year to mess up and for us to have our first brush with disaster. After ignoring the many, and I repeat.... MANY complaints/reviews.... stating WarThunder has no respect, no effort, blown off, lack of responses without reading the initial complaint, ect ect... Lest... we abstained and still gave them a year of my money and time.Like always the Review Crew spends our time getting to the truth, being fair to both sides of the coin. but now... the dragon rears its ugly head.... and we had our first problem in nearly a year (171 hours)... and you will be entertained more with our writings that follow, than the game or customer service. In short, we are completly done with this company and anyone affiliated with it!!We begin our review...  as we now... ENTIRELY agree with all complaints! After giving them (WarThunder) three (3) months.... to fix a legit, screen shot proven, paper trailing, document provided.... complaint/request for assistance!Could of not had this any more obvious or proven if written in blood on a wall, with the killer standing there with a gun and a sign around his neck saying he did it! No excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people, with proven and legit reasonable request(s). Then to degrade us when they(WarThunder) were out of options! We thought ok... its time to give back to us for being so helpful and devoted in providing everything and anything requested (even if it had nothing to do with the request) we provided it. For months we tried to help WarThunder to help us, patient, super nice people that just got screwed worse than a hooker at a five and dime. Could not believe the HUGE loads (check my hands) of money we have spent, and sadly... and then the comprehensible (HOLY F*ck we what a word!)Back to the story... while away for a week with my son being born (truly freaking exciting past the point of pee!!! ), we returned as many do after many missed updates (9 to be exact in 2 weeks) We return to find all our money(gold and coin) items(planes and tanks) gone, along with all experience and funds.. just a blank account. Now to be fair, there was a post saying some updates had data dumps ect... just send us a screenshot and proof and we will do this and that.... ok... so we did.Account not compromised, black and white proof of purchases, no acitivity on my end and they did nothing! Did not even bother to read the complaint, responded with requesting this and that and then redundantly doing it over and over.. with nothing to resolve in the complaint. So what was a legit complaint now has 8 more things piled on... but now they expected us to go away... so we asked and pleaded. Stated we had proof and sent it more times over than you see boobies on TV!We received a reply that was... for the lack of a better word(s)... MOTHER EXPLATIVE EXPLATIVE... after ALL THE pateince AND respect, fulfilling request after request, for over a 3 months while unable to play!! (Listen people, you can dress a turd and call it chocolate, but its still SH*T!)It was their (WarExplative) turn to do for us! Three months enough, I believe it is reasonable not to ask any more repititious questions and cater to them. We said ""there is nothing more we can send you that we havent already."" A week later we were returned to an email bearing the surreal.... ""we dont care if you leave, your a bumb ♥♥♥ american and we have a million users that spend money, goodbye dumb American."" from SERGI. So now we research and got attorneys looking into things because of the email. They reached dead end after dead end with the same name coming up as the sole person responsible located in Russia.Explative, few more dirty words and gestures, and then sad face...!There is no need for that! Unprovoked... bah.... oh I hope Mr. Karma checks this many times over and pays SERGI and the team behind him dearly.We wont even focus much on the statement of ignorance, even if anyone does not like us for being from the USA, but hey, spread more racism and hate! Who's stopping you SERGI right? You sure like our/anyones hard earned  money tho.It proved what we read from others and didnt believe for over a year, being fair like we always are.Always two sides to the coin... but in this case and thousands of others, the complaints just keep mounting and are legit. So we call all the numbers we could find to discover one person... SERGEI... (Stupid Mother F*cker for short) handles all their USA complaints as the big man.Ok so nothing I can do, or say, but sorry I was born in a country you dont like. (Here's a gun, use it as a toothpick you racist pig.)In Closing;You would think on the business side... here is a great repeat customer, legit to our requests, patient, and proved they had all securities in place, proven NO activity on the account from anyplace on the globe, and provided what we had and spent over the past year from their (WTF) own records... so lets give these items back to him and figure out where they went... but NO... not one reply had anything to do with our request. But because he from the USA... wow... just no words.While they have the ""loose one wont break the company"" mentality, those who supported their game and company for a year and still giving them a chance... with one complaint with legit backing and proof provided... and what did we get... A HUGE D*C* in the AS* with a side order of HUGE (Plenty of follow thru) SLAP then BEATING in our face! So after this for just a polite simple request that even had humor in it, and a proven complaint with legit screenshots and purchase information, there is nothing they can do or say to justifiy it as training as more than one CS agent in all our tickets repeated the same thing.No excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people with proven legitimate complaints that were poilite, respectful and gave them everything and then some to their requests.  Sad it took us a year for our first problem to discover such terrible abuse! Dont find out what we did, it may not happen in a month or a year but if you have anything you need for your account, simple or extensive... good luck.. go talk into a fan and have someone pour acid thru the other side... it would at least give back! (ok.... dont really do it, no one should hurt themselves over these terrible people who f*ck people over daily man or woman)World of Tanks or World of War Planes or World of Warships is where your money is appreciated and respected we have also supported for years as well... at least they are fair, read the complaints, share and compare facts and still even if you are found to be somewhat incorrect or interpret something incorrect, they take care of you, no issue, no hassle in my two prior problems in six years.Discalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

												I have played this game for.. Well, an almost embarrassingly long time. Even prior to its release on steam I played this game nonstop for a number of months. It has only been in the last six or so months that the game has soured entirely. The developers, a delightful company based in Russia called Gaijin, used to put the highest focus on gameplay and balance. They listened to the community and actually handled feed back rather well. Yet, oddly, in the last several months they seem to have put their focus on more features, more glitter in their game. They have gotten rid of the community involvement in many of the groups that have formed around the game, most noteably Reddit. (The community manager with Gaijin was removed) The community as a whole has made countless attempts to bring issues with the game to the dev's attention and have repeatedly and consistently been ignored and in some cases players were banned for voicing their concerns. Game play wise, is this game fun? The answer to that question is, ""It can be."" Every once in a while you might get that golden blue moon match where you're not being completely stomped by some fellow in a KV-2 and any of the heavy Russian tanks. It could be fun depending on what you drive/fly. If you prefer US tanks or planes, I wouldn't recommend trying. The Russian and German trees are a bit more enticing if you don't want to be clubbed. The main issue with the game right now is balance, or lack thereof. Shermans against Tiger IIs, 262s against Sabres, short barreled tanks being put on maps that consist of an open field with a hill in the middle trying to play against a team of long barreled snipers. Stuff of this nature is common and expected in this game and I can't bring myself to put up with it any more. (Why I'm finally writing this review.)			"

												I started playing the Game back in 2013 (Patch 1.27) and it was great. Since then the Game gradually went downhill. The Introduction of an excruciating, unnessecary Vehicle/Module Grind (especially at High Era Vehicles) and the outright broken Battle Rating System. Combined with the sheer amount of broken Features and the dismissal behaviour of Gaijin to Community Feedback, in addition to their Soviet-/Cold War Mentality made me stop Playing the Game a long Time ago.The GrindBarely noticeable at low Level Vehicles it will soon begin to get ridiciulous at Mid to High Era Planes where some unlockable Modules will cost more RP than most of the Era 3-4 Planes.Starting with Patch 1.31, Gaijin continiously reduced the Credit/RP income which forces you at some point to buy a Premium Account and/or overpriced Premium Vehicles. Btw: Don´t bother to convert your Free RP via Gold as the Conversion Rate isn´t worth your Money (1:45 Ratio)Battle RatingsThe Battle Rating System was originally designed to replace the Static 20-Tier System but made the Gameplay with every new major Patch procedural worse as more and more Vehicles are compressing the BR Brackets, resulting in Mid-WW2 Planes sealclubbing Pre-WW2 Biplanes or Korean War Jets clubbing late WW2 Prop Planes. Since its introduction Gaijin claims that the BR System is working as designed which simply isn´t true.GaijinGaijin went from an open, transparent Company to ignorant, nationalistic Bigots who don´t give a damn about their European/American Playerbase, effectively shielded by their Forum Mods/Community Managers from any constructive Criticism and have an openly sycophancy attitude towards Gaijin. Many of those Mods often resort to trolling and outright abusing their Powers against regular Players. Even Youtuber/Streamer are affected.Historical Accuracy and BalanceTo give them Credit, Gaijin manages to recreate Aircraft/Tank Models with great Details but that´s it. On multiple occasions many Tanks and Planes were ""corrected"" via ""Secret Documents"" from unverified Russian/Soviet Sources and were thus stripped from certain Equipment Modules and/or recieved inferior Performance Characteristics compared to their Real-World Counterparts. Most of these were applied to Non-Russian Vehicles. At the same time, many Russian Vehicles recieved considerable buffs (the Best example being Post-War Ammunition added to T-34/T-44/IS-2 Tanks).This Russian Bias - which is constantly being denied by Gaijin - killed the Game for many of the Players.tl;dr - I can´t recommend this Game anymore			"

												I used to love this game but I have reached my limit. I have watched the company become gradually more and more opressive but managed to convince myself that it was just a phase. The change came when I discovered that in response to a video showing a major hack the CEO (yes, the person who runs the company) posted a poll asking us to choose between making the hack a permenant feature of the game or issuing copyright strikes agains ALL people who bring up such issues on youtube or other social media.NO MORE. I will not tolerate such blatantly (and I tried really hard to find an alternative phrasing here) Stalinist methods.Never again will I play this game. Never again will I knowingly give this company any money.For the sake of all that is right and good, DO NOT play this gameEDIT: at the request of some friends I have started playing the game again, but rest assured. I will NEVER give them any of my money.			"

												P͇r͇o͇s͇:+ Game looks awesome even on low settings+ Planes are somewhat fun+ Few last patches made even ground forces fun+ You can pretty much choose type of game depending on your skills and preferable gamestyle:You like madness, fast action and easy kills without the need of strategical thinking? Then just jump right into action and have fun in AB (Arcade battles). Gametype you want to start with to learn weakneses of enemy planes/tanks and how to do basic stuff.Are you little more experienced or you don't like arcadey experience you get in AB? Do you want to actually hide and wait for enemy without red marker over your or your enemies head, forcing you to actually look for enemy? Do you like to play more strategically depending on your vehicle, waiting for your enemy to make a mistake, so you can make your move? then RB (Realistic battles) is just for you. Vehicles in this game mode have more realistic controlls and performace.And for the most experienced players there is SB (Simulator battles). This is the most hardcore experience you can get...no markers even for your allies, so you need to be carefull what you shoot at because it can be your allie. No 3rd person view of tank/plane, only tank commader/pilot view. Realistic aiming for tanks, where you need to count with guns offset relative to the sights.

(you want to play this awesome premium tank we just put in game? No problem! You just need to buy this awesome bundle containing 2 virtual tanks and 2 virtual planes with price of the new AAA game!)- Slowly becoming ""World of prototypes"" with all the experimental and testing purpose tanks lately getting into game.- They are not focusing on adding WW2 vehicles and armored cars like they said they will after finishing Brit tank tree (almost a year now and not a single new armored car added) #PrayforPumaWith50mm- Top tier tank battles = ATGM spam now. Not a fun to play currently. - Low tier Brit tanks with APDS ruining your day no matter the armor you have. (yeah poor Ferdi with its good armor, low speed and maneuverability is so rare nowaday just thanks to brit tanks with APDS making a swiss cheeze out of it or getting ATGMed by Strv81)6/10 best game ever -IGNPs: don't forget that soviets now have cold war tank boat capable of killing almost every german tank with its post war UFO 200mm pen ammo and 7s reload at BR 5.7 which is same as Tiger I. Much wow gaijinPss: So you want to enjoy match with leopard 1? Yeah thats enemy team full of scrubs spawing in ZSU 57-2. Have fun comrade			"

												I really loved the WT while it was in open beta. It really was historically accurate with real plane statistics and I welcomed the WT as modernized IL-2 1946. However in the last few years this game went to ♥♥♥♥. Somehow russian planes have the best engines, best aerodynamics and weapons. While in reality these were one of the worst flying planes out there. Same goes for tanks. I mostly play US tanks and the fact that M36 can't penetrate T34 up front is just simply BS. Also the magical power of T34 grants you immortality since you can bounce off 128mm german shells that ripped this piece of technological disaster to pieces. No. Just no Gaijin. Stop it. You're killing your own game because some idiot in the management decided russia to be the best nation of WW2 while in reality it was one of the worst, looking both from political or technological view.The change of matchmaking makes you go with US starter tank go against T34 1942 which is balanced af. Same goes for planes and everything in the game. Once they said that there won't be any prototypes, yet Germany and Russia got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of prototypes including E-100 (Wasn't even fully constructed ever) and Maus. I don't really get why are devs sh**tingng into their own mouths with all this.Another problem is the historical accuracy at all since US planes have weak engines, UK weapons are innefective and the glorious Russian planes have best stats at everything. The fact that russian vehicles overall had many problems, for example the transmittion on T34 lasted for 30-50km after being completely damaged. The fact that T34 goes for about 30km/h on a terrain is just simple BS. it couldn't go above 15 km/h in terrain due to crappy transmittion. And to shift to 4.th gear you would need some sort of superhuman power. The fact that every russian plane can catch up to US plane is BS aswell. Most of the russian planes had problems with weak engines followed by overheating. Just play some IL-2 1946 and you'll see what I'm talking about.In overall, due to russian bias in first place, terrible matchmaking on the second place and the great responsivity of the devs I really don't reccomend this piece of WW2 russian biased BS.

												I have way more hours than Steam says, simply because I started playing before it was even on Steam. But thats not my point really.I have probably put 2 thousand hours and several hundred dollars into this game, and if you had asked me a year or 2 ago if I recommneded it, I wouldve said yes, all the way. But now, the game is a broken mess that infuriates me more than it entertains me. Where do I even begin?Country bias is strong, being a Russian game, the Russian planes are incredibly overpowered, and dont even think about getting within a kilometer of a Russian tank. The customer support base is terrible. Instead of rolling out tweaks and fixes that players have been asking for for over a year, they simply add more planes to the Russian tree and maybe a few to the others and further mess up the system that is so badly in need of balancing.To do anything above tier 3 in anything short of a human life time you will need to pay for a premium account, and even then, you better play realistic battles (which in my opinion are not nearly as fun as Arcade), AND EVEN THEN you better have paid $20+ for a Premium Aircraft.  No, this game has just become too much of a ""Pay to Win"" cash cow for Gaijin, rather than focusing on making it a fun experience for everyone, no matter what country or game type someone wants to play.I think the best line I've seen that descibes this game now is, ""Grind 'till you die...or pay up.""*EDIT*This may be a petty gripe, but I think it sums up how little the developers care about their user base.  Most online games give stuff away for the Holiday season, right?  Gaijin begs to differ. You can earn 2 very low tier vehicles.... if you complete 19 challanges that are released over 19 days. NINETEEN. And they are shoot down 30 planes in ""inset plane here"" and destroy 40 tanks in ""insert tank here.""Not only are the rewards crap, the amount of work required and amount of time you have to grind is insane. No discounts on the overpriced planes, overpriced premium accounts, or overpriced premium currency have been offered either.So Gaijin's ""Merry Christmas"" to their user base is basically a giant, grindy middle finger. A rather apt comparison to what the entire game has become over the last year.*EDIT 10/12/2015*New Matchmaking system put into tier 4.Somehow, SOMEHOW, they have found an even more unbalanced and infuriating system.On paper it sounds great, having teams put together so that they have an entire BR covrage, with a few higher BR people, middle of the rodd BR people, and lower BR people all on one team, instead of an entire team of Tigers.Theoretically it should be great, but in game it is the worst thing to happen since the implementation of the Battle Rating system.I played a total of 9 games as a 6.7 on US and USSR, and in every single game I was going up against 8.0s, and would get one shotted.What this new system means, in basic terms, is that it is garunteed that every game there will be a handful of players who will completely dominate because they have a BR advantage over almost every single other person in the game.And while that person might be you one game, I played 9 games and was always, always, ALWAYS, at the bottom of the BR list.It is terrible, no other word for it, completely and utterly terrible.I have an idea, how about games where there is 0 - 0.5 BR spread, instead of 1 BR spread, because the 1 BR spread now is completely unfair (more so than it was before, even).And of course, 90% of people in game are complaining about it, no one likes it, but the forums have an absence of this overwhelming opinion.Why? Because Gaijin is cracking down harder than ever and deleteing, locking, and banning players and posts that show any kind of displeasure with any new game additions.When Britt tanks are released I might try again.*EDIT 4/11/16So I'm still not giving War Thunder a Recommendation. Why? Because it is Crack.I hate it, and I hate what it does to me and my bank account, but I can't stop playing it, even if I play it far less than I used to I still play it several times a week.But under no circumstances would I recommend it to a friend, still.There have been some improvements, but not nearly enough to return it to its former glory.Save yourselves, don't get sucked in.

												Edit/Update: As of late 2014 and early 2015, there has been some considerable improvements on the part of the developers to adress the issues that me and many other reviewers have outlined in the past. The representatives are more involved with the English speaking community and most of the balance issues are being corrected, albeit slowly. With the addition of the US Army land forces faction as well as considerable efforts, I am not so certain of the not recommended review, the game itself has huge potential and will only get better as more content is created for it. I will leave the review as it is however do take a chance and try the game out since it is free, purchasing something is your decision of course.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------By now most of the reviews at the Store Page of this game are negative, this alone probably communicates what the community feels accurately enough. However most of the highest voted reviews were written as an outrage towards a previous patch which had changed the unlocking method for new vehicles in game. This review will hopefully touch on a different more important issue with this game.I have played and enjoyed War-thunder for more than a year now, but stopped a while a back due to bad design decisions and overall negative behaviour from the devs. I still followed the forums and various communities however in the hopes that things might get better. At it's core it is truly an incredible game. Even with many difficult issues with the developers, I still find myself missing the thrill of flying or driving well rendered WWII machines.The most glaring flaw with this could-be-incredible game is the crew behind it. On multiple occasions the team behind the game have shown that they do not respect their player base, ridiculing and mocking them at every opportunity.Recently after more than two years of outcry and demands from the players, the devs finally agreed to implement a 'Player Council' type of system, we have seen such initiatives from other devs in other games so this was a welcome change. However soon it became apparent that this was yet another PR move that ultimately ended up with an arrogant fit towards the players.The community council representative that would have been chosen by the community is required (by the devs) to play the game at minium consecutively for 90 days, every day (rumours of 7 hours per week requirement) to simply keep his position. The unacceptable demands and restrictions had began. Also as a response for the currently broken system of balancing vehicles a community manager argued (with terrible unintelligible English I might add) that the community council representative can not simply relay problems of the players, no that's not enough, instead what he has to do is to provide thousand page analysis for all the 350+ Planes in the game and their real life performance to the devs FREE OF CHARGE.That's right, the developer expects a member of the community to do their job for them free of charge to be able to simply PROPOSE changes to the inherently deeply flawed balancing system. After all that work and effort the devs reserve the right to simply ignore the proposed changes (which is their default behaviour by now)It is easy to see past their deception. They simply answer like a bully to challenge the community to come up with a better system. “Read more then come back” Funnily enough people did write long essays about certain planes being unrealistic in game, providing photographic evidence. They got mocked in their own threads which then got locked and deleted when they started to be posted around. Devs lock and delete any and all criticism from their forums to provide a 'perfect' atmosphere for new comers, instead of working on the issues that are present in this 'Open Beta' game.Another salt in the wound is that whenever a huge issues comes up and draws backlash from the players, everyone that complains gets the rough treatment, for months they are mocked and insulted by the team only for them to implement a change in line with the complaints months after, with the undertone that they came up with the idea themselves, or did it out of the kindness of their hearths.This show of arrogance bordering insulting behaviour is common place today with this game. So as much as I like what the core game represents in terms of potential, such scummy behaviour is unacceptable.  As a long time fan of this game (one that was waiting impatiently for the Navy side) and as a customer that spent money on this game; I hope this game fails, not out of spite but to demolish such a negative possible influence on future developers. No matter how good your game is, or how entitled the devs see themselves, it is completely unacceptable to insult, mock and belittle dedicated fans.Thank you for reading.			"

												Pre Patch 1.37 Rating - 8/10 GreatPost Patch 1.37 Rating - 1/10 Absolutely Horrible (Bad business ethics delevoper Gaijin)I have to give this game two ratings. One for pre-patch 1.37 and one for post-patch 1.37 which was introduced mid-Dec'13.My opinion of this game (and the Russian developer Gaijin) basically went from a full positive thumbs up to an absolute full thumbs down rating since the release of the latest patch 1.37 mainly due to the way the developer has handled it by misleading, lying and cheating their existing customer base.I have basically stopped playing what was one of my favorite games since they have released the last patch.Part of this decision is based on the in-game changes they made to the game in the patch but even more reason was the horrible way that Gaijin handled this and treated their customers and player base. To summarize, the most significant changes in latest patch 1.37 introduced some new aircraft, changed the tiering system, progression system and matchmaking for battles.While there were some positives in 1.37 like new aircraft and flight models, the negatives far outweigh the positives.They have condensed the previous aircraft tiering system from 20 levels into 5 tiers which is far less transparent in terms of leveling and has caused terrible matchmaking where you are now often flying against aircraft which are either far inferior or superior to you.The worst and most underhanded change however has been the progression system whereby you advance to unlock new aircraft. The developer Gaijin falsely advertised prior to releasing 1.37 that this new progression system would be quicker but it has been proven by many players thru posting of clear calculations and spreadsheets that it is in fact the exact opposite and much slower.Previously you leveled each country from 1 to 20 and unlocked multiple aircraft per country each level.Under the new 5 tier system, you are forced to unlock one aircraft at a time and funneled into having to use the previous aircraft in the research tree to unlock the next. As a result  the new progression system has proven to be 4-5 x slower than it was previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft in the higher levels.The result of all of this is that the developer has essentially covertly thru this patch increased the price and devalued their in-game currency (GE-Golden Eagles) by 4-5 times what it was pre-patch!!!Since it is a F2P game, it essentially means that if you decide to buy a monthly subscription it will now take you probably 4-5 months longer you need to subscribe than previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft.And I am not talking about a just a few hours here....it will now take you literaly hundreds of hours more to unlock the higher level aircraft.For newcomers who are joining after patch 1.37 you will of course not notice any of this as you have nothing to compare the current pricing and progression but just be warned that this could happen again. I would not trust this developer again!As a customer who bought a steam pack with a subscription and a lot of GE in-game currency before the new patch I feel totally ripped off!Gaijin of course has the right to change their prices post-patch. It is their own risk or reward decision. When it comes however to devaluing the in-game GE currency for people who purchased prior to the patch at an advertised rate it is downright unethical what they have done. I have stopped playing this game as a result and I guess will never use my GE left on my account unless Gaijin makes a total turnaround and admits thier very questionable business ethics and turning their backs on previous customer base.I have lost total respect for this developer Gaijin for this and also after many people complained on their website forums about these changes and posting proof of  that the new progression system was falsely advertised and the currency de-valued, they simply deleted and ignored posts.  The WT moderators here on Steam also delete any posts which are in any way critical of these very questionable business ethics of Gaijin. I've never seen such kind of crazy censorship towards their own customers as I've seen on both the Gaijin and Steam War Thunder forums in my life.I really feel this developer should be blacklisted from selling any further products on Steam unless they offer some compensation to their customers who were caught up in this scam of suddenly overnight de-valuing their in-game currency that was bought previous to the patch.UPDATE: May 14th ->I AM CLOSING THIS REVIEW FOR ANY FURTHER COMMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEW PATCH 1.39.MY REVIEW WAS BASED ON 1.37 AND DISPLEASURE WITH THE WAY GAIJIN HANDLED THAT IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND BASICALLY DE-VALUING CUSTOMERS PURCHASED GE's AND IN-GAME CURRENCY WITHOUT NOTICE OR COMPENSATION.I PERSONALLY HAVE DELETED THE GAME FROM MY PC in JANUARY AFTER 1.37 AND HAVE NO INTENTION TO RETURN AND SUPPORT THIS COMPANY EVEN IF THEY MAY HAVE FINALLY MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WISH YOU ALL GOOD GAMING!			"

Me gonna wipe out entire enemy tank company with ma anti aicraft unit armed with a death ray.2. Description will be available soon.3. Random number chances in a game about realism? They got wot!?!?! A Tiger 1 Tank? Don't worry Comrade, chances are every shot that Tiger tank does (even at historically deadly ranges of up to 2000 yards) will deflect on my T34 tank even if it is a shot at the rear of said T34 tank.4. If you still want to play the game or are relatively new to the game avoid the hours when people who play this in a near religious zeal come out to play (they all seem to come from the one time zone and their tanks majority of which in tier 2 and 3 battles are the T34 tank, they are also pimped up, in fact each tank resembles a Communist parade float and not a freaking machine of war), you will quickly find out what I am talking about.5. A Soviet T34 tank can somehow survive a close proximity shot from a Stug III F variant+, you know the vehicle designed by the Axis during the war to provide close fire support to infantry that was also used primarily to knock out pill boxes and other entrenched positions, then later it was used as a tank destroyer in combined arms Panzer divisions.6. The Pz 38t Aus F is a tier 1 tank that is well protected and you would think ""wtf is this talk about the Soviet tank bias?"" but then you quickly find out as you advance in the tiers and unlock and play with new tanks that the majority of the German Panzer tanks have the exact same armor config as the Pz38T Aus F tank and in battles consisting of tier 2 tanks (yes the very next tier), 50 by 30 by 30 armor config is not going to protect you from instant death especially against Soviet tanks that for the majority of them have deadly HE (high explosive) ammunition, said ammo can kill your entire crew (and knock your tank out) if the shell hits (keep in mind historically the Soviets up until 1942 had many different types of ammo for their tanks and for the most part they were all ineffective against German armor, this changed with the introduction of the improved T34 which also led to the rise of the MBT concept).7. There is no penalty in tank battles when someone jumps into an aircraft and does a kamikazi run on you, considering that this act is a deliberate death in an attempt to knock your unit out, also the fact that in air battle gameplay modes the killing of your own team mates deducts end game credits really begs why such a similar act in tank battles is not further frowned upon (there is in the form of bonus credits an incentive to try and make your aircraft survive until the timer runs out but the incentive is too small for most people to even bother about it). 8. Axis units progressively get worse in actual gameplay performance vs Allied nations units, an example is the paper thin armor on Japanese aircraft vs the nearly indestructible Soviet aircraft (same tier). ""Son that aint a ""heavy fighter"" at all"". Also see points 4 and 5.9. As a free 2 play game it is obvious that grinding will be included yet what does not make sense is that when you unlock a new tier of vehicles you cannot purchase (you can still research it, no problems there) a tank that you really wanted unless you have purchased the tank in the previous tier that preceded it, for example say you wanted the infamous Tiger 1 tank (tier 3) but don't like the look and bulky feel of the Panzer III M (tier 2), well bad luck then as you are forced to purchase the Panzer III M before you are allowed to purchase the Tiger 1 (the next tank in the chain).10. Victory day celebrations did not have discounts on German tanks.11. Not sure if hackers or just the weirdness of lag but sometimes you get shot at through solid rock (I have the replay to prove it).12. All the above could become moot if they would rework the matchmaking, since as it stands currently it is now only about matching similar tiers of tanks to each other, nothing is considered in regards to individual player skill (the game keeps track of your ""service record"" so why not go further and match players with like ""service records""). The game will eventually (if not already) become unfriendly to new players.13. Not really the fault of the developer but base campers ruin the game, only willing to advance forward when more experienced players are willing to do the majority of the dirty work (this could also be made moot if the dev reworked the matchmaking (see point 12)).14. This is not a net issue as I have a fiber optic connection but sudden and massive drops in FPS from sub 60 to around the ~15 frames per second mark, this happens rarely but always at the most inconvenient rage inducing times.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In conclusion, the game is visually impressive it also has (at least early on in tier 1) that ""one more game"" feel however once you advance beyond tier 1 you quickly learn just how unbalanced the game is and how some included underlying mechanics and design decisions ruin the game, Keep in mind that I have been playing video games since the late Atari 2600 days and the first ever tank game that I played was 'Conqueror' by Ocean Software (a 1988 PC game designed for 286 computers with CGA/EGA or VGA monitors), War Thunder is very similar to that game in that it is also an external camera view 3D (but with real basic low poly 3D graphics) game, however it was single player only and I must say 'Conqueror' makes much more sense then this, since in 'Conqueror' a Kv1 tank going up against a Panther or Tiger tank is 9 out of 10 times going to get wasted while in this, it is more about is the random number generator in my favor and also is the damn Soviet tank equipped with HE rounds or not?Edit: Reworked for clarification some of the points listed in the review.

												Well, after 1500 hours in this game I can't play anymore, not because there is nothing new on the game but because the developers of this game are killing it. Changing and changing game modes carrying the game to the hell, and refusing to listen to the players. Play it if you want, but you must quit right after you fall in love with it. Good luck.tl;dr: good game ♥♥♥♥ed by blind devs.			"

												I'm going to split this review into sections so it's clearer and not just one long rant. I'm going to cover the Air combat but alot of this applies to ground combat aswell.TL;DR at the bottomCommunity++++++++If I could go back to old Warthunder (Pre 5 tier system) I would still play this game daily. This started as a great game but the dev team is just so STUPID. They constantly implement pointless and unwanted features. They don't listen to their community at all and if you so much as hint at it not being good on there website you will be instantly and permenantly banned from their forums and the moderaters for the English forums barely even speak English. (Probally with a few exceptions). This game is mostly made of new players because the devs drove away all of the vets with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Now the game just feels like a pub stomp even in the ""realistic"" game mode. All of the youtubers that play this game except for a few big ones have quit because the money grabbing devs.The Never Ending Grind++++++++++++++++It was pretty obvious that they were slowing starting to move to P2W/Progress when they added the 5 tier system. The 20 tier system allowed you to actually progress in the game instead of grinding for what seems like years for a single plane. Well if it was so much better then why did they get rid of it? So you actually have a reason to give them money duh!! In the 20 tier system every time you leveled up you would get the planes for each level so if your level 5 you get all of the planes at level 5,level 6 you get the level 6 planes, ect. Well now not only to you have to grind exp for each level but you also have to grind exp for each plane ON TOP OF HAVING TO GRIND CREDITS TO BUY THE PLANE. this makes it so depending on how much you play you may need to grind for A MONTH TO GET 1 PLANE. The only way to speed up the grind is to either: buy a premium plane, buy premium time, buy credits or buy gold to convert ""Free xp"" WHICH YOU HAVE TO GRIND BY PLAYING THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. I thought it was called ""free xp"" not ""pay me money so you can use the xp you ground out already :^)"". I have around 2 Million ""free xp"" that  I could easily get a jet for but it would probally cost me anywhere from $75-150 to convert it and I refuse to give this company any money.Balancing+++++++The 5 tier system was doomed from the start. Cramming houndreds of planes into 5 different tiers of equalness makes no sense. Which is why they brilliantly implemented ""battle tiers"" /sarcasm. Basically the battle tier system takes how well a plane is performing in the average players hand and appropriately places it in a 20 level battle scale. Before I even address how flawed this system is, WHY DID THEY EVEN REMOVE THE 20 TIER SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IF THEY ARE JUST GOING TO DO THIS??? Anways this battle tier system is just so flawed, like come on. Wasn't it obvious what was going to happen Gajin? When terrible players are put in good planes and perform terrible they are placed at a lower level, then good players get in the same plane and absolutely stomp. Also the nations that are played less (lets use the Japs for example) are placed very wrong on the battle tier system. Most players start off using the Americans or Russian planes. When they learn the basics of the game from getting higher levels in these nations they gravitate to the nations that are used less. So when they do good in that nation there are not enough bad players to balance out the battle tier and the planes get placed at a higher battle rating and get put against unfair opponents. This is especially true for the Japanese in realistic battles. With planes from 1939 against planes from 1942.Every Nation is the Same+++++++++++++++++Every single nation ends with the same planes. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing Japs have a F86 Saber. Almost every nation has an iconic premium vehicle from another nation. Americans have a Spitfire, Brits have a Mustang, ect. This makes the entire game feel pointless and cheesy, when you want to play realistic battle and try to use your light and agile Zero to out perform and out turn a clunky heavy Mustang only to be greated by the 20mms of a Premium Spitfire that some 8 year old begged his mom to buy for him.Economy++++++The economy for this game makes about as much sense as Russian ww1 wave charging tactics. It's pretty similiar to the battle rating system actually. Basically it takes planes that are popular and makes the prices to rearm and repair them more exspensive. Which means that the limited planes at lower levels are ridiculously pricy and make it harder to grind past. Playing the harder game modes used to pay out a much larger reward for making the player challenge themselves, now you are just barely making more than arcade mode. It is way more rewarding to just sit in a bomber at 20000 feet and drops bombs for 10 minutes wait for a fighter to spend 5 minutes to climb up to you and then suicide in the ground and respawn then to fly around and have fun in a fighter plane.Summary++++++I spent about an hour writing this review and could easilly spend days on it because this game is just so god damn bad now. I mean yeah its fun to jump in a biplane and shoot at stuff for an hour or two but when you put some serious time into it like I have you will realize that it is just one big marble block of disapointment that could have been a grand scultpure of a great game. I have put way more hours into theis game before it was even added to steam and every time I see how much time I put into this game it makes me want to kill myself. I left out a bunch of stuff because im lazy and am sick of thinking about this game.Pro's+++-Flying is fun-Shooting is funCon's+++-Literally everything else about this game			"

												Hello my name is KingTyrone (look me up :)) and I have been playing this game for 1.5 years (was ranked #1 in kills all-time in RB) while this game was a hidden gem the changes recently cannot overshadow how much the developers have ruined the game and it is not helped by awful community managers  who don't get paid and are usually 15 year old children who barely speak english and deal permanent bans left and right for minor offenses.DO NOT PAY THEM ANY MONEY premiums are far more expensive then they were before (4-5x times more)GRIND GOT HARDER (without premium you will need 2-3 years to get all airplanes)NO COMPETETIVE GAMEPLAY (all your time will be spent in the grind)SIMULATOR BATTLES ARE BROKEN (And usually locked into russia vs germany for months at a time) HIT BOXES (completely broken at times otherwise known as SPARKS)BROKEN PROMISES (events,world war mode)Only play this game if you are bored as it is certanly better than it's competition but the question remains:""At what price?Litterally""			"

												An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating. The game is in a terrible state at the moment, and I don't see Gaijin turning anything around anytime soon. The whopping drop in playerbase over the last year (or even months) says a lot.			"

												Check your taskbar... Gajin.net? Gajin Entertainment installs malware on your PC that enables them full access to YOUR bandwidth to install updates on other players PC's. It's very hard to uninstall and will try to reinstall itself as soon as you delete it. If you are reading this I seriously reccomend you report this to Steam, and let Gajin know what you think about this behaviour. Thanks to 'dreamlot' on Reddit who gives this advice on how to disable this malware;Under the C;\users[yourusername]\appdata\local\gaijin\ Find all gjafent.exe files and DENY their permissions on all user accounts. To do this right click the file and select properties. On the security tab highlight each group/user and deny permission for all checkboxes. "

												This game is a mixed bag of epic fighter combat and poorly mismanaged company ethics.[HISTORY/GAMEPLAY] -The game itelf can be quite fun and realistic depending on the different modes to choose from. In the beginning the game had organized matches the ranged from level 1 planes to level 20, but that was thrown out the window for a poorly implemented 1-5 tier system. The effects of fighter combat is still relatively good, you can take hits in your landing gear,chip a wing, lose a flap or propeller and ""possibly"" still land it to be repaired. Aside from that it is a total clusterf**k of unorganized and biased combat.The new leveling system was implemented to ""so called"" make leveling faster, but fans pooring in data proved the latter. Leveling has become a loong grind compared to the false imformation Gaijin provided. They pretty much want you to go Premium just so you can level at the old ""normal"" speed.[ GRAPHICS ] The engine behind it is quite beautiful, almost any pc can run this game and the graphic settings can be tweaked so you can either have an intense and beautiful battle, or an optimized battle that still has decent graphics and details. So even your ""lawnmower taped to a powersupply and running off gas computer"" should be able to run it with ease given some tweaks.[ ISSUES THAT PLAGUE, AND WILL TURN AWAY LONG TIME PLAYERS ] The real issue is the constant problems with unbalanced matches, unrealistic plane mechanics, and pro russian biased company. -The 1-5 tier matching is complete garbage, You will often face planes that should not be in that tier/ or glitched using squad jumping( 4 players, 1 in a tier 2 setup, other players using tier 3).People use this method to use a higher ranked tier plane to literally slaughter underpowered tier planes in a lower tier match. The match making system is broken and has been unaddressed for months.- The plane mechanics themselves though looking beautiful dont match up to the real statistics of how that plane performed during the war.Players have made spreadsheets upon spreadsheets of data comparing both real world war data against the game and find it very off. So many planes either underperform or overperform there real world possibilities.- Finally, as an unwritten and talked about problem of WT, is how Gaijin: a russian game development company has been biased towards the russian nation in the game. As sad as it is, it has been proven by the fans of the game how badly biased the company has become. Almost ALL Russian planes throughout all tiers outperform in every aspect of combat. Russian planes can outturn, out climb, out run, and out gun every single nation aside from the japanese.Again when comparing real world plane statistics/data to the games counterpart it was far off in comparison. Not even the fire rate of the guns was even close to the real thing. So this is why I give it a thumbs down. The game is fun for a week or two but becomes quite old after being slaughtered by higher tiered planes in a lower tier match and being out performed all the time by russian biased planes.			"

												This is the game that had it all. It had great graphics, fun gameplay, a brilliant free-to-play system with only modest rewards for those willing to pay, and an easy recipe for success.Unfortunately, the Russian-based Gaijin apparently decided they no longer needed any of that in their game, and have been working tirelessly to remove any inkling of fun the game might have once had.Since the 1.37 Patch was released, the player population of the game has stagnated to the point where the only players you'll encounter are either the Die-Hard Russian fanatics or the ""too stupid to quit playing"" crowd. Up until today, I was in that latter category. No more. I've had it.The planes are ridiculous in every game mode - almost none of them bearing any sort of truthful resemblence to their real-life counterparts. The weapons are comical at best - with machine guns that literally do no damage and bombs that make you pull your hair out and wonder why the citizens of Dresden were so upset. The maps are extremely tired and repeat themselves so often that you begin to quit matches before they even load, because you know exactly what Pacific Hidden Base is going to be. The game types sound wonderful on paper, but in practice are so amazingly bad that once the honeymoon phase wears off and you begin to earnestly focus on the gameplay, you realize that these guys (the programmers) have absolutely no clue what's fun and what isn't.They're falling the way of Blizzard - where every patch removes another desperately needed piece of the ""fun"" equation. Yet unlike Blizzard, who calmly acknowledge that they're ruining their games with words like ""casual"" and ""approachability,"" these dumb Ruskies instead completely ignore their playerbase. Totally. Even mentioning a gripe with the game on their official forums will warrant you a ban - almost immediately. Have a problem with a player in game? Report them! But beware - if you report one player multiple times (for example, you notice them cheating, so you report it, then they use a racist term towards you, so you report them again) you'll be the one banned. Notice a group of players cheating? Don't even bother - the moment you start reporting multiple people in one round, you're getting banned.Do you see where I'm going with this?Couple that with the unending stream of new cheats and hacks that are coming out almost daily, and it's plain to see why the popularity of this game has rapidly decreased. Do yourself a favor and wait for something better to come along.			"

												Played this for several years, had some fun.  In game bias exists, but that is to be expected.  How they treat their community contributors however is unforgivable.  Uninstalled, and closed/canceled my account with them.   In doing so I left behind all the planes and tanks I'd earned whether they were bought with lions, eagles, or earned in events.  Any time I think of starting a new account I just look back to when they practically ordered their forum members to put copyright strikes against any contributor who reports and proves that hacking is going on in their games.  Speaking as a player who has been pilot sniped from 7km away and through a mountain, I find what they've done to be reprehensible.  Lying afterwards and saying they didn't mean it like that is just plain hilarious.  Do I recommend this game?  No, I really can't bring my self to do that, if only because of how they treat people who support them.			"

(example: in 2013 - 2,000 Golden Eagles for an Premium Aircraft was a very high price - yesterdays Release (aka 2015) introduced a Calliope Tank for 10,000 G.Eagles ~50.00€)Sure a lot of people spent their unemployment-money they never have worked for, on such things, so Gaijin makes a lot of money. The course tho is clear - Milking a Cow with prices as they already got with ""Star Conflict"". It is NOT p2win, but it s a slap in longterms customers faces to sell ONE tank at a price, one can get a FULL retail Game forNot to forget...Gaijin does not allow criticism. Every person who dislikes anything about them / their policies get simply silenced. There is no cooperation between developer and community			"

												DISCLAIMER Played WT via the launcher +300 hours, just downloaded it here to write reviewI also solemnly swear to be as unbiased as I can and will try to see the good in every humanEnd of disclaimerGeneral:I will start with this. I love WW2 themed simulator games. When i first joined up War thunder almost 3 years ago, it looked very promising. This was the first (♥♥♥ you Wowp) decent flight-sim/arcade that looked decent in a long time. War thunder is certainly a pleasure for the eye, worthy of the latest graphical standards set to date.Progression:Do you want to fly the most epic post war jets?Do you want to know what it is like to fly an me262, hunter of the late war skies?Do you want to drive those legendary king tigers and Pershings?WELL TOO BAD!! (or pay up)Progression is nonexistent. The grind is SO terrible that it if WW2 had Gajin mechanics we would still be flying biplanes to this day. The first tiers are okay i guess. But starting from mid tier 3 , things get grindy fast.  An average match in planes gets you about 1400 rp and with tanks even lower than that (excluding boosters). When you need to research this plane/tank you want and its 75k rp or more, you are about to pull your hair out. Things get worse as you progress, as you are grinding your way through 5464 of the same planes with almost no real difference between them. Really, do we need to have 20 types of bf109, 25 types of yak and 57 types of spitfire? god please. Yeeeyy i just grinded a 89k spit for 3 months only to find out that the stock version of that plane is ten times worse that your spaded spit you used to get it. THE STOCK GRIND IS ♥♥♥ WRECKING. You have to be a masochist to enjoy this. If you like wasting your time and effort, like playing for weeks/months for minimal reward, you will be thrilled by this game. Unless you pay...Yes i do realize there is alot of difference between an bf109 F2 and a G2...Balancing:The BR system was invented by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platypus. You face plane/tanks that are + 1.3 - 1.3 compared to you. However, most of the time its + - 2.3... For example: If I used a plane of BR 3.3, you are constantly matched by planes up to 5.3 or more. Happened 5 times this week alone. I suppose the gajin-lovers among  you think this is impossible and will whine to try to prove their point.The BR system is broken as f***. Unless you pay...BR distribution is foul as well. Certain german tanks/planes and japanese planes face things they should not.. which brings us flawlessly to the next point.Bias:Gajin has said there is no bias countless times. However, there just is.Tanks: The T34 and to extend the T34-85, is the single most OP tank in Gajin history, able to block shells from Tigers, Panthers and occasional King tiger. Deflection shells can happen of course, but when A T34-85 block 5 shells of a Tiger to the rear with no damage, uses his supersonic turret traverse speed to turn to you and one-shot you through the thickest part of your armor (NOT IN A WEAK SPOT) at a 30° angle, I just call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. KV's and Su's have this too, but not to the UBER-MOTHERLAND-PRIDELY way of the T34. Conclusion, don't play tanks unless you use a russian tank. Preferably a T34 or variants. If you really do have to play another nation, which isn't recommended for your mental sanity, use 50 - 60 ducks premium pay wall tanks of the Germans or Americans. Planes: Not as bad as the bias in tanks. The real problem with planes (RB) is the over-preforming UFO's like the I185. Also the big spread on the BR causes poor lower tier germans to face higher Pay to win russian premium P63 noobs.Pro's: - Swordfish          - Exit button          - AFK climbing          - Low intelligence level players, being easily offended or fooled.         - 1 byte/sec download speed gives you time to do the chores of the houseCONCLUSION: I would write down a lot more, but please refer to Crabman's review for additional information. Only three ways to fully enjoy this game:- be a pro russian rebel, with a secret shrine to Gajin and Stalin in his cellar, while doing ritual sacrifice    on innocent germans. Preferably well spoken, as you need to carry out Gajin's orders on how to mute the critics of this game. Be prepared to crush the dreams of others. One day, Gajin might send you a hair of Stalins moustache as a reward.- Be a millionaire and spend over 500 bucks on this game to get every single premium plane, soviets preferred, and buy 10 years of premium time.- be mentally unstable, and enjoy to cause pain to yourself and are ready to face depression.

												So I come from an era of War Thunder when it was not yet on Steam. I think this was around version 1.21The game was extremely fun. Ofcourse, since it was Beta it contained a lot of bugs and imbalanced planes (it was only planes back then), some of which were fixed within the week or month, others that are still not fixed today. But all was okay and the community was very relaxed so to speak.Now you got to understand one thing, War Thunder at the time had around 20 tiers, that was perfectly balanced for every plane out there and matchmaking could very much handle it the way it should but all of a sudden within a few patches they changed the Tier 20 system to a ridiculous Tier 5 system, a system that even up till today takes way more hours of grinding to get the next plane than it was ever before. Now that they hightened the grinding levels was understandable in a way because some people could grind to the latest Tiers within a few days/weeks, so they had to level it out for the whole game and paid players.But oh boy, that is also where the poo hitted the fan, because their matchmaking system, which used to be somewhat flawless now was utter crap that used ""BR ratings"" to set you up with others and even up till today people find ways to abuse this system and get with extremely good vehicles in games agains people with extremely bad vehicles. It just doesnt make any sense.Oh yeah and up untill today, they still have not fixed a lot of bugs. One of which that is very bad for a game like this, hit detection. If you fire up to 20 bullets from a plane, the connection can make it so that you only hit the other plane with 5 or 10 of them, while on your screen it can look like you hitted it with 15 or even all 20 bullets.Please stay clear of this game, but if you really want to play it, do not give/pay any money untill they do something about all the bad things.

												Let me start off by saying War Thunder is a wonderful game.  Unlike WoT, which I have played an estimated 2000 hours of,  War Thunder's tanks and airplanes actually fight like airplanes.  Hit the engine?  The tank might burst into flames but probably won't.  Hit the commander's hatch?  The tank isn't going to magically burst into flames like in WoT.  I love War Thunder, and I am so glad it exists.  The developers are nice and like to involve the community and the gameplay is significantly more interesting overall.However, they have some of the very worst business practices of any F2P I've ever known.  If you buy ""premium time"", the game will ask if you want to buy more incessantly the moment it expires.  They've doubled their prices on packs before the Summer Sale for the second year in a row (which is completely illegal).  They even made non-steam packs on their website to get around giving Steam a portion of the proceeds.When the business side of War Thunder becomes this cash-grab, no matter how much money I want to give them for making a solid game, I just can't justify it.  I can't justify giving them more money just so they can program more ways to take it away.  While this is the best tank game on the market...save your wallet.  Despite the developers wanting to make a quality game, Gaijin Entertainment has shown time and time again that their sole interest is taking as much money as possible from the consumer by any means necessary.

												Many people have said this in below reviews, but i'll make this short and brief on a critical issue. Honestly i'm writing this because the War Thunder forums are run by a very strict set of rules that don't really allow much actual discussion outside of vicious attacks against a dissatisfied playerbase by elitist, relatively new players, so I cant even post a mild suggestion that something is wrong with the staff as there is nowhere to put it within the rules.The game's moderators, forum and community suck ♥♥♥. It takes a very Russian view on the rights of the consumer when it comes to moderating.This is the reason why so many of the old guard, players who have been around since 2012, have left. People who play the game for a long time usually like to participate in the community to help the game grow. But often they are sensible people, and in Gaijin's view those people can ""disrupt new players experience"" with vile topics like ""Gaijin, can you please fix the netcode?"" (locked and hidden, 3/14/2014) and ""Beta is not an excuse"" (locked and hidden 9/08/2014).  But who are the people that protect us from these disruptive and evil comments?http://puu.sh/g5NqW/5c217d7d6d.jpg25 Year old, foreign-speaking Brony moderators. Let's elaborate on these issues using this single puush image as a base.It does not show it but this moderator, and in fact nearly ALL of them, do not speak English very well if at all. That applies to much of this game. Many patch notes and information released by moderators is written in commie and myself and other dedicated players are forced to try and decipher them with Google translate to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ they broke this time. Often the reasons given for doing something so ahistorical that it's insulting (when the game claims to try and be historically authentic) is that they found, and I kid you not, ""Secret documents in a forgotten Soviet bunker."" This is a real thing. It's even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ meme! This lack of English and information also applies to many other trivial things like ban messages and explanations. A friend of mine was banned by this very moderator for having the name ""AllahIsGreat"" and we could not figure out why this was offensive when the friend in question is actually a Muslim. Appeals are usually met with garbled, confused English that roughly translate into ""You're toxic to new players"" 90% of the time.The biggest issue with this game's hilariously strict moderation, though, is the fact that topics with criticism that the brony lords don't like can be shut down and hidden because they ""hurt new players.""This will not affect many of you, who simply wish to casually play this game and try to participate as little as possible in the mess that is the War Thunder Community. If you do, in between the bans and thread locking, you will find quite a few nice people as the European/American playerbase is wonderful. But even in the chat of public games there are Russian NKVD mods who watch intently what you say.This is not a comprehensive or even gameplay-focused review, nor a tired ""10/10 it was gud ign"" review, but you can find that in every single other review above or below me. I simply wanted to post this here considering the hilarity of permabanning a friend of mine for having an Islamic name when he is, in fact, Muslim. I do play this game a lot and enjoy it, and that is because I joined before ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan and the decade-long grind (bypassable by large sums of money) was introduced, and had all my stuff before things went bad. Seriously, you better quit your dayjob if you intend to progress in any meaningful way in this game.Thanks for reading, and hopefully I can talk more about these issues that plague War Thunder in the future.EDIT: They just made the grind even longer by removing daily bonuses and making us use this random drop system, which will most likely give you a ""Research Point Boost"" rather than an experience/currency boost which the daily bonuses gave. Other than modifications Research Points are only usable using real money.http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2xgo4v/psa_boosters_dont_multiply_missionreward_premium/ Showing how Gaijin once again screws over their players with lies and inflation.Additional Reading:http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2x8i1a/147_is_a_failure_of_a_patch_wts_failings_found/Clarification:Russian patchnotes are much larger and more detailed than the English ones.The English patchnotes only explain generalities (I.E. ""Tempest Mk II has been tuned according to data sheet"").Russian patchnotes will explain details (I.E. ""Tempest Mk II speed changed from <bad> to <worse>).And, yes, English moderators exist, but they are a staggering minority.			"

												It's with a heavy heart I lay this game to rest in the bin of uninstalled steam games. When I first began playing this game, it was a plucky contender in the air warfare scene, brought something new to it, and Gaijin Entertainment seemed to be listening and working with the community. It had its problems, but it was fun. Over time, however.... Things change.The state of the game now is... Alright. Mechanically, it's very good, aside from certian nations air rounds having more proclivity to ""spark"" (indicate a hit but do no damage) than others. However, balancing issues, along with a few bugs, remain present, and affect the game experience greatly. This alone wouldn't be enough for me to permanantly condemn the game, but Gaijin itself has also changed. Its stance towards the community has gone from acceptance, to outright ignorance, and seemingly insane greed. If you -do- get this game, never buy Golden Eagles. Their value is minimal at best these days.I could list the iunnumerable balance issues Gaijin has forced upon the game to further increase the time it takes to progress, and squeeze as much money out of you as possible, but there are plenty of people that do it much better than I can on a review. Just a suggestion, however; avoid any source that is attached to Gaijin itself. They do thier best to censor criticisms. And this is the main reason I cannot at all reccomend this game. If the company controlling it cannot bare to own up to thier own mistakes, I simply cannot see it progressing further than it has, let alone getting any better.It's a shame, really... I quite loved how the game played. Still do, in a sense. I just can't put up with the environment I'm in when I play it.			"

												this game... was good. at one point the game was mostly balenced and playable, mostly. it was one of my most loved games and now its just horrible, grindy, repetetive and all round boring gaming experiance, even at low tiers it is obvious what planes dominate the sky *cough* russians *cough* . and you cant really argue with planes such as the Yak 9 T/K exsisting, which have really only been made more overpowered after ""nerf"". The problem is that it appears that they have made the grind to long to keep interest in playing, and they have made it clear that they have a biased towards planes and nations. i do no t recomend playing this game untill one of either things happen.1: Matchmaker redesigned2:they listen to the players who are PLAYING the game and giving CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM to help move the game forward, but i highly doubt that this will happen...update 2-08-16Yup...

												This game has great potential, yet the Russian makers are extremely bias for their own country. Before 1.53, it was okay, but afterwards, the power of the German tanks has utterly been demolished. the German 88 mm gun has virtually no affect on the Russian tanks, bouncing off T-34's front slope if not placed correctly. The Russian tanks however, seem to dominate the game, with one-shots on nearly every single tank they come accross.A few years ago (before War Thunder groundforces) the American faction was experiencing the same problems. The American planes had extremely low max speeds such as the Hellcat having a max speed of 200 km/h. This was made note of many of War Thunder's fans and eventurely, (although not completely) War Thunder made American planes somewhat more operable.Hopefully by next update War Thunder won't make such another mistake, although it is unlikely.

												I'll be honest, I loved the game at first, I started playing 2 years ago and I enojyed every minute of its historical accurate gameplay. I loved trying all the new planes I earned, I loved the XP system, I enjoyed most of all of it. But than, tank battles came, and with it, an onslaught of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ admin that will literally ban you for your name because you killed them in battle. Just today my name (which I'ved been using for 9 years without a single complaint) was banned for foul language. Tell me what is vulgar about the name kittylovermybut? Its laughable more than anything else, and I've yet to play since becuase I havent been able too. This was the straw that broke the camels back. I probably won't spend another dollar in this game just becuase of this nusiance. And as for my recconmenation, I will not change it as long as Gajin keeps up this complete communist regieme. If you even so dare go on the forum to give some constructive critisizem, you are insta-perma-band and completley disespected by the community. I have way more than 800 hours though, I switched to linux and I have about 1000 hours that you cant even see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It deserves to bleed out just like every other game made by Gajin. They clearly dont understand how a free community should be run, as they make the Soviets look like good people.			"

												I hate to play the same tune as so many others, but unlike them I am taking my review and going a step further.I'm a lover of history, from as ancient as Mayan and Aztec cultures to as modern as it can get when talking current news. I love to know why things happened, the reasons, the causes, the impacts upon how we see things today, and what it can mean for those who care to enjoy their history.So, as I write this review, keep the words ""Historical"", ""Accurate"", and ""Fair"" in mind. Cause they'll be mentioned a lot.Historical planes, tanks and ships, all clashing upon one battlefield that allows players to simultaneous and fairly enjoy how these various war machines of history would have performed under the accurate scrutiny of Gaijin's developers who no doubt have the best interest of this game at heart, right? But what game are we playing, if not War Thunder? A game advertised as historically accurate and fair to all countries in how they are represented historically to players? Knowing they're targetting both a large audience who -wants- a fun combat flight simulator game which boasts accuracy; and simultaneously knowing they're targetting the history buffs and adamant learners who want to gleefully roar through the skies as a P-47 Thunderbolt over 1940's Germany. Surely! They would want to represent the lives lost, the battles won, and the ingenuity of men and women of this war accurately, right?Now, take every mention of those words I told you to notice before, and answer them with ""No"". This game was praised as the champion against other games like World of Tanks, where World of Tanks and it's corporate model is to force all players into mediocrity and a 50% win/loss range than to be fair (look up Greedy Goblin's World of Tanks article, then you will agree). Even I came in when War Thunder had almost one-quarter the number of planes is has now, and was boasted as being historically accurate.Those days are long gone, I've put in well over 300 hours of my life trying to enjoy this game. The only times I authentically enjoyed this game is when I broke down and submitted to the mentality of my close friends who call this game by it's true name: ""GLORIOUS SOVIET UNION COMRADE VICTORY SIMULATOR""*. By this, I mean, I started playing nothing but Soviet Russian planes, I watched in initial glee as my scores skyrocketted. I went from being the bottom 5 players to the top 5. Then the horror hit me. I was indoctrinated. I had spent cash to turn around from the planes I -wanted- to -desperately- enjoy, yet I can't due to the GSUCVS* and it's portrayal of Russian warplanes as nigh-unstoppable machines of complete devestation.I spent cash to enjoy the best of the United States circa 1940's era planes I always wanted to fly; I spent cash and time to work up the German Luftwaffe planes, where I finally hit my peak into indoctrination. That is when I spent cash to play Soviet Russian planes like everyone else, just so my above-average flight skills aren't being held back because a single Russian plane can endure over 1000 rounds of .50 caliber anti-air machinegun fire. So my enjoyment and money spent on my ""dud planes"" with other factions was turned around and then I learned the ""glory"" of the GSUCVS*. It's taken me some time, it really has. But I can finally say, without the shadow of any doubt...This game as made for Russians, by Russians, and most likely at gunpoint by Joseph Stalin himself, or at least by the specter of Stalin. The only hope to redeem this game would be to overhaul it, cut out the busywork of all the ""prototype"" and ""testbed"" planes that keep you from enjoying the plane you really want. Cut out the horribly overpowered and unbalaned and unfair Russian cheat engine for Russian planes. And lasty, to apologize to every player for their grievous wounds inflicted upon trying to represent ""accurate"" history.Until then, I will not recommend this game unless you understand that it is NOT an accurate game, that it is a game made to pander towards old Soviet diehards who can't see Mother Russia as anything but completely indomitable and constantly producing instant-win scenarios. Play it, but do NOT spend your cash. Play it, but do NOT bother commenting on their EU/USA forums. They will simply mock you with sock puppets while they ban your forum account.			"

												Hoo boy...where do I begin with this?As a bit of a fair warning, I am 100% NOT against the core of this game. This game is quite a solid platform, everything performs, mostly, as it should, and we're getting British Tanks soon. That's bound to appeal to more than one might imagine. The updates, for the most part? Reasonable. The amount of ridiculousness from those Yak-9s going through the roof? Yes, but this is why you get either a plane that can reasonably ensnare the little sky devils or go AAA if possible. Simulation is quite nice (Despite me sucking at them to an absolute degree), Realistic plays fine, and if you're not keen on either, Arcade will likely hold what you want. None of these are faulty.It's the moderation base and the lack of caring that make me hit ""No"" on the recommendations panel. The worst bit? They'll silence you if you speak up against them about it. For God's sake, we're trying to help you, and you shoot us down like we're nothing but scrubs? And by the way, that is even if you pay. They don't care who you are, you'll get shut up, one way or another.Another key problem is the graphics. ...what, you were expecting me to say Battle Rating? Find another review, they'll explain it. I personally find it hilarious when I gun down a plane with a BR higher than mine.Let's get this out of the way. Like the core gameplay, the core graphics are not an issue. Heck, they're some of the most beautiful to date. For those who play Realistic, I'm sure you'll agree with me on this if you play Ground Forces in Realistic or Simulator: There is an option within the game settings to turn the bushes OFF. Yeah, not down to a minimum, outright OFF. This is a huge problem that Gaijin refuses to fix, and it's impacting Realistic Ground Battles to this day. (And Simulator, but Realistic at the least) It's understandable for low-end PCs, but this is straight up an advantage for players who want to shoot you while you're not even able to see them if you have your bushes on.This, and especially the lack of a caring development base, are what make me not recommend this game. If what it takes for me to change my mind is an administrative reform at Gaijin Entertainment, then so help me Arceus, do it....on the flip side though, if you're just someone who just enjoys a good tank and plane game, once all this settles down, it's a good game. Just...don't go talking negative within the game if you expect to stay there. And hope you have fun out there.			"

												I played this game a lot and I had a lot of fun... but I fell out of love with it the last few months. I attributed it to burn-out, uninstalled it, and had no intention of leaving a review.But then I went to open Steam Friends in the taskbar. And I saw that snail icon. Gaijin has decided to make the War Thunder launcher actual, textbook malware. If you install this game, you will not get it off without manually scrubbing every file it touches off your system. Uninstall from Steam > Still ThereUninstall from Windows > Still ThereThird-Party Uninstaller > Still ThereThis wouldn't be so bad if it didn't rob your bandwidth by auto-updating whenever it pleases. Gaijin says ""this is an option, just turn it off"". But trust me, you can't. It will re-enable itself the next time you reboot. It refuses to die.Do not install this malware. Please use the flag button on the Store page to report this product, malware is completely unacceptable to be hosted by Steam and I would be surprised if defying the Steam uninstall isn't against their ToS.

												So, this is a tough one for me. I've played War Thunder for a few years now, and it has finally reached the point that I can no longer play the game in its current state. I'm going to say now that I am a JET PILOT and some of these points only apply to JET COMBAT. I'm also going to try and list the points I still like, and that I find noteworthy.Pros:-A good arcade flight experience.-A nice variety of vehicles to drive.-Fairly realistic physics.Cons:-The community moderators censor feedback, and even youtubers like MagzTv and PhlyDaily have been hit with claims, though these claims were rescinded. Simply put, only positive feedback is allowed.-Jet combat is hopelessly unbalanced for new jet pilots. If you have a MiG-15, F-86 or Hunter F1, you'll be fine. If you're just getting into jet combat, be prepared for a horrible grind, or prepare to open your wallet.-The company treats its playerbase like idiots. They refuse to share any information on the statistics they use to balance the battle ratings, claiming we won't be able to understand them. -The instructor system in realistic prevents players from gettoing out of flatspins, which can happen in midair rams. Its not a bad system, but the inability to turn it off completely without using a joystick in infuriating.-The company moderators also have the devil's own job of trying to defend the companys actions. This can lead to problems with historical accuracy. This is a quote from a community manager:""The actual performance of the Meteor and Venom in fact exceed the performace of all F-86 series aircraft""This is once again referencing the statistics that we are not allowed to see, making sweeping generalisations and in general rebuffing the requests of the community for a rebalance in battle ratings.All in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone, I have lost my faith in Gaijin entertainment, and I hope in future they fix these issues so I can give them a more positive review. Will I keep playing it? Yeah, until my premium time runs out, then it can sit in my steam library til its fixed.			"

												Ok so this is my second review for this game and propably my last. The game is now out of the open beta state so i can critisize it. So when i started playing War Thunder (about 2 years ago) i had a blast. The game was fun. The progress actually felt like you were getting somewhere and realistic battles were not ♥♥♥♥ed. But now the game is utter garbage. I have tier IV tanks of almost all nations and i can clearly say that USSR is the best one, but its the best one because it has unfair advantages with their penetrations and their magical sloped armor. For example, T34-85 has boosted penetration and sloped armor that can bounce a shell from a ♥♥♥♥ing Jagdtiger. The game is such a grind that i would have to play about 100 battles to unlock the T25 but every battle i would have to get about 1500 xp. I mean that is ♥♥♥♥ing ridicilous for one tank. To make matters worse, Gaijin likes to censore anything bad about the game on their forums with exuses like ""indicent language"". So i would recommend WT if it was in  a state when i started playing, but now.....no. War Thunder is a waste of your time and i would want those 1035 hours back every single day.			"

												Gaijin is brilliant. Straight up, no questions about it. they have created a game that is so awesome, that even when they throw historical facts out the window, thousands flock to sing its praises. This game is like no other, it has no real competitors, and therefore, Gaijin gets to do whatever the heck they want to, and we will still play. This game has a ridiculous bias, it can be overcome, but it shoudn't have to be. The fact is, if I fly a Fw190 D9, one of my best planes, I will be on par with a totally unexperienced Yak-3P pilot. There is something wrong with that. I don't mind unbalanced combat, but I sure as hell want historically accurate combat. I wouldn't mind if match making put 15 Russian players on each russian team, and 5 on the german team, but they should have those german tanks/planes historically accurate, and therefore vastly superior to their Russian counterparts.

												The latest patch 1.37 has effectively ruined the game overnight. Obviously the devs were seeing dollar signs and thought now was the perferct time to bend over the large and loyal player base that they have built up since release. The game now appears to be one gigantic grind fest, unless you are prepared to invest large sums of cash, and I do mean large sums.On top of this the new teir system has removed any fun that you may have been expecting in arcade mode. Expect to fly your 1930's era biplane against fighters from the late 40's and 50's. Kinda like taking a knife to a gun fight.It's absolutey astounding how they have managed to take what was an addictive, innovative, fun to play game and totally destroy it.Glad I didn't spend in more money on this ♥♥♥♥♥tain in the steam sale.

												EDIT: Updated for patch 1.39Patch 1.39 has changed several things. For one, all aircraft are 25% less reserch points. It still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft, but at least they're making some effort to balance the progression curve.1.39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft (and slightly dropped the price of repairs), in some cases aircraft are 1/3 of the lion price they were. Again, a step in the right direction. Original review content is below, most of the bullet points are the same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As much as I want to, I can't reccomend this game. Gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm. Progression was always a problem in the game. pre patch 1.37 money was a problem. If you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency. It was a constant complaint on the forums. Did Gajin listen? nope!Post patch 1.37 the problem is even worse. Money is still an issue, only now you have to research aircraft individually. Other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4-5x. The progression curve is broken. So broken that it's kind of pointless to switch between countries. if you want a jet before your 60th birthday, you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts.This saddens me. The game itself is wonderfully fun. The way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke. If you do play, play for free. Don't give them your money like I did.			"

												I'll just get straight to the point.Pros:- Decent game mechanics- Isn't ""Pay-to-Win"" if you can actually play well- Dev team is always adding new vehicles- Game is pretty fair game-play wise- Factions are actually pretty balanced despite the ""Russian bias"" mantra- Most players are actually very helpful and theres many beginner squadrons that players can joinCons (prepare your diddly hole):- Game mechanics can be just as buggy sometimes (i.e. SPAAs making shots that shouldn't be possible but do because their RoF overloads the server)- Golden Eagles are pretty expensive and you can't trade boosters or other things for them- Speaking of boosters, use them or lose them- The constant flow of new vehicles makes balancing the game a nightmare, and further clogs up the present grind- Speaking of the Gaijin team, they need to hire some new community moderators that won't let their SJW agendas dictate their actions- You're not allowed to speak your mind about anything in the main chat, even what you dislike about the game- Community moderators (the newer ones) take their job too seriously, chat-banning anyone for things like making harmless fun of others or stating your own opinion about a game mechanic that's inherently needing of some work- Game has one of the steepest learning curves known to man and can be easily manipulated by ""experienced"" players- Outside of vehicle balancing, there is no real balance to the game (read: map balancing is absolutely horredous at times)- Event Tournaments are just slapped together and not thoroughly tested before release, causing some major headaches for some players- Lack of Player-versus-Environment content outside of bombing static targets/tank columns (there was one event last month that was decently fun, but could have REALLY used some balancing and testing beforehand)- There's actually some bias to the Russian faction, but that's because the game mechanics play in favor of the Russian vehicles' strengths: sloped armor, speed, fragmentation, overpenetration, ""invincible"" modules, damage models, flight models- Players have seem to grown more toxic over the years, some going as far as to show their disparity in team chat with some colorful wording- Squadrons have also grown more toxic thanks to Gaijin's snatch and grab that is its ""e-sports"" tournaments- The only helpful players have either left the game entirely or rarely play anymore because there are better games out there, even if War Thunder is the only one of its kind (which it really isn't because it's slowly becoming a Wargaming.net clone)- The game is literally becoming a ""World of [Insert All Military Vehicles Here]"" clone- Did I mention the moderation team already?- Gaijin rarely listens to its players when they provide constructive feedback about all aspects of the game and will even lie about certain changes they're making- The game is not what it used to beSorry for subjecting your eyes to this, but I think it needed to be said.

												I have a very love-hate realtionship with War Thunder. Before I had a decent computer, this was the game that I looked forward to getting most. Hands down. When I got the game at last, I was very pleased.The game looks fantastic. It performs incredibly well, especially considering the graphical quality and size of the maps. Additionally, outside of a few premium vehicles, there is very little pay-to-win. Unlike World of Tanks, you cannot buy special ammunition or consumables. I cannot think of a single aspect of the gameplay itself that is bad. In fact, I can think of little in that respect that is even mediocre.So why not recommend it? 2 main things, that, between the two, ruin the game for me.The matchmaking. Basically the balancing entirely. The recent introduction of mouse-guided ATGMs on  (Surprise!) a Soviet tank broke late tier tank balancing. Similarly, there are age-old and unadressed issues with certain armor models, unrealistic shell performance, etc. that just make the game a nightmare for certain vehicles. Throw on top the bush camos that are just way too good. Even air forces has major problems. The addition of a (Surprise!) Soviet bomber that is basically the Death Star completely ruin my desire to keep grinding to the high tiers.Along with balancing is the age-old issue of Russian (aka Soviet) bias on the part of the devs. Certain vehicles are and always have been completely overperforming. This transcends modes, but it is the worst in Ground Forces. Vehicles have balancing that just makes no sense, or have unrealistic performance that is not fixed by the devs. And I don't even know what they thought with some of the early Soviet planes. Do they obey physics? I con't tell, but I'm not entirely sure.Throw on top of that the fact that, to account for shrinking player numbers, they compress the MM (which in turn means fewer players. No one saw that coming!) means that some battles are cases of give up, go back to the garage, and try again.The second gripe is Gaijin Entertainment themselves. Not only do they make decisions that seem baffling (see ""mouse-guided ATGMs"") but they behave in an almost authoritarian way. I seriously wonder if they know that this is the 21st century. They silence criticizm, they ban players, they have forum moderators that behave like kings on a self-built throne, it's atrocious. Never use their forums. Just don't. You'll be banned or your thread blocked if you do as much as fromn at Gaijin.I would say get the game for Naval Forces. I still will give it a second chance. However, my optimism is running out. In Naval Forces, I thought, was a place where the Japanese could be exceptional at something (they have no tanks yet and few aircraft), where the Soviets would not be as much of a problem. Where we could finally have land, air AND sea.Instead we get boats. I am preparing for Russian Bias as stong as the rest of their game, possibly worse. Broken machines, broken mechanics, terrible MM, and even more opportunities for these developers to pretend Gorbachev is still in power.Maybe if they sell the game to someone else, it could be fixed. It still has some of the INCREDIBLE potential that this game had in the beginning.P.S. I thought I already made a review, but it is possible Gaijin had it removed. If so I rest my case, and take that ""Mostly Positive"" as nothing more that a Gaijin advertisement.			"

												I'm very much split when it comes to WarThunder now and it's management.  I was a late player to the scene.  I didn't start playing War Thunder until a couple of months ago.  It was such a fun experience and I would play constantly.  At first things didn't seem so bad, but then I got a glimpse of what the veteran WT players were so upset about.  The system that they use for research is DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU SPEND ALL YOUR  MONEY!  At first I was unlocking things at a pretty decent rate.  Now, It's like I hit a brick wall and the only way to get past it, is to pay REAL MONEY to use the experience that I have already earned.Look gajian, I'm not a game programmer or some sort of buisness man, but you guys are really dropping the ball.  Want to know how to bring people back to your game?  Here are 3 ways.1.  Hire moderators and curators who actually have respect for both new and old players.  Based on some of the evidence brought forth by other people, your moderators are incredibly rude and drunk with the power of the banhammer.2.  I understand that free to play games need to be set up in a way so that it is still profitable, but that doesn't mean charging premium currency for as much as you can get away.  500 golden eagles to buy a national flag for your tank/plane is beyond the realm of reasonable.3. I really shouldn't have to even say this but, LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYERS!  Constructive critisism sucks, but it is better to learn from it, then to ignore the advice, do what you guys want, and say screw you to the plebs and to your own game!In conclusion:War Thunder is a terrific game.  It has features and gameplay that no other game has been able to repeat.  The problem with that, is if a company knows there is no real competition (Gajian), they are free to charge what they want, for whatever they want.  Don't get me wrong, I will still play WarThunder from time to time, but I won't be dropping another cent on this game.  When it comes to scuzzy business tactics, I don't have much empathy for a company.If you plan on playing this here and there, then disregard my review.  If however, you are someone who really wants to get into this game, be warned that you WILL BE REQUIRED to spend money unless you're cool playing 3000+ hours to unlock things naturally and don't mind having only a few crew  slots.

												This is an amazing game. Really! You will not find another game similar to this one. It is one based more on skill than anything else. No stupid reaction shots or super quick decision making. With one good shot, someone(Including you) can be killed. If not, it may take minutes to destroy a wing or light them on fire. But, then the downsides come in. Recently, they completely overhalled the matchmaking system. Maybe you've heard. They collapsed the 20 teir system into 5 teirs. And if that weren't bad enough, they changed the way of getting planes as well. Instead of leveling up a teir, which may give you 2-3 planes at once, they made  it so that you ""research"" each plane at a time. This makes it unbelievably grindy. in the end, it seems like a cheap way to get more people to buy in game ""golden eagles"" to boost research. WIth true FTP, you will be spending hours and hours just to get a planes in low teir. If you love to grind for hours with the same planes and no real sign of progression, this is the perfect game for you. I continue to play just in hopes they change it. But as for 10-19-2014, they haven't.Update on 12-21-2014As of the new update...I am speechless. Gaijin realy, really hates this game. They, for some reason, feel so pressured to release American tanks that they have not a care in the world for anything else. They put in an under-teired plane here, another OP plane over there... You get the point. The banshee...No comment. They feel that a plane that has a rediculous energy retention and almost a thousand kph top speed belongs in the lowest teir of jets. Flown correctly(not that hard) a person can defeat a whole team of German jets. The new British jet doesn't even have a finished flight model. And obviously the worst of all, they have delayed the implication of the proposed ""fix"" to the battle rating system. That would have made the game half decent again...maybe. But it doesn't matter if they keep the current cash cow of a system they currently have. I rarely...RARELY play this game anymore. It just isn't fun. I have tried realistic battles, and those are better, but seeing planes on my team that are 2 teirs under me when playing just... just isn't fair for them. Arcade, which i presume most players will spend most of their time in, just feels like a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥. All in all, I don't recomment even downloading this game at it's current state. Don't fall for the huge money trap that is War Thunder.			"

												TL;DR this game is 16 gigabytes of cancer.Gayjin can't make realistic games.Gayjin can't make balanced games.Gayjin can't make an anti-cheat. (The internet is ♥♥♥♥ing riddled with cheats from ESPs to teleporting to 152mm autoloading cannons)Gayjin can't make a game without the russians being overpowered, and americans semi-overpowered.Person on your team kills you: He gets away with it.You teamkill the teamkiller: You get kicked from the game, have to pay 5000 igm (In-game money) and can't play for 15 minutes because of ""teamkilling"".That's not justice, that's just plain ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Shoots a APCR ammo rack on a german tank: Ammunition explodes.Shoots a High Explosive ammo rack on a russian, british or american tank: Ammo rack gets damaged.The developers are russian, it shouldn't come as a surprise that you will get diagnosed with cancer.And don't forget the virus you download with this cancer, which tries to get the history from your default browser, your MAC address and your IP address.And Gayjin is wondering why nobody likes this ♥♥♥♥.

												This game is really fun at first, then you hit the unbearable grind.  So then you buy premium and a premium plane to help get tier 4 and 5.  You finally get your first jet, or your first tier 4 or 5 tank.  But guess what, you have to grind modules to make your plane or tank even worth using.  Tanks are especially the worst.  God help you if you get a tier 5 tank.  You will need to grind parts to even repair your tank, after that you need to grind again to unlock fire extinguishers.  The developers just outright ignore the community and the forums are comparable to, if not worse than early 1940's Germany.  The CEO of the game practically called all the player base ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"".  Please don't waste your time on this game.  If you read other reviews, most people with less than 500 hours like this game.  Most with over 500 don't like it.  There is a bump you hit, from the game being fun, to being horrible.			"

												Gaijin really don't know what they're doing at all. I started playing 2-3 years ago, and even back then they didn't know what they were doing, but at least they seemed like they were trying. They listened to the community sometimes, but now... too many bad changes and patches that don't seem to be letting up any time soon. Now they refuse to listen to the community. The first 6 months are fun for some due to ignorance of the grand scheme of things in terms of issues, plus the early tier planes are the most fun, but after that it spirals quickly out of control and becomes not fun anymore. Even going back and playing the old planes isn't fun for me. The matchmaking changes have been horrible, and (as much as its overstated sometimes), there's a debatable Russian bias and they straight up retcon history sometimes.I love the game to death, it has so much potential, and there's nothing more that I would love to see than this game to become what it could be, but as long as its in the hands of such an unorganized and dysfunctional development team, that won't be happening any time soon. This game is the epitome of one of those FPS's that seem promising for the first few months, and then you realize how much of a grind it really is.It's not even just the fact that it's a grind, it's not about taking forever to unlock planes, it's not about the fact that it will take the average user about a year to get their first jet, because it's possible to have fun in this game without jets. In fact, jets are one of the most unbalanced and un-fun parts of this game, besides ground forces. The early tiers are some of the most fun, in fact. That's why you so often see players with about 100 hours or less giving WarThunder positive reviews, yet as you go up through the hours, most of those players start giving negative reviews.The real issues lie in the dev team's unwillingness to listen to the community, their horrid, horrid, HORRID mod team who watch over their forums like hawks and strike down almost all criticisms of the game with impunity, it lies in the fact that they've made some painfully obvious cash grabs in the game, like making it so you have to pay for country flags because ""teamkilling was an issue."" Most of the community, if not all, wants the game to succeed. We offer criticisms and ways to fix the issues, they give us bans, longer grinds, and horrible BRs.The dev team's unwillingness to not only fix the FM issues, but even their complete failure to acknowledge them, means that the game is doomed if it continues on the path it's currently on. BRs are complete trash, if you aren't flying the flavor of the month plane then you might as well not be flying. If you're not driving a Russian tank, you might as well not be driving.Now, because of Gaijin's failures, hundreds of veterans like me, and others with even more time in the game than me, are jumping ship. Not because we don't care about the game anymore, but because Gaijin doesn't. Its sad because most  bad review of this game is from a player who has played for a long time, and most of the good ones are from complete new users who are still able to enjoy the game before they realize how truly bad the situation is.The nation balance is garbage. Japan gets screwed over soooooo much. Germany has been getting pounded on, or at least was last time I played, Russia has always had curbstomping abilities over the other nations, and the US flip flops depending on the tier. British are just everywhere. I personally stopped playing consistently about the time when ground forces started having the issue with the foliage, where you would be at a severe disadvantage (and I'm talking gamebreaking severe) if you kept your grass/foliage on. I have logged on a handful of times since, but only for 2-3 rounds and then I just get tired and sad. I want the game to be good. The sad thing is, though I have been playing for 2-3 even back then and through the years, I can never truly say the game has felt completely good. There have always been a number of broken FMs, the economy has gone through various levels of ♥♥♥♥, one nation is always curbstomping another, etc. About the time they removed the 2x bonus, that's when the crashing spiral downward in quality started.Gaijin's PR is horrible, especially with their whole ""guys, don't judge, we're still in beta"" excuse which has been a lie ever since you've been able to pay to get ahead in the game. It's been a lie ever since they started using it as an excuse to disregard their personal flaws and using it as a way to completely shift the blame from them over to the community. It's been a lie because most games in beta survey the userbase, asking for feedback, while Gaijin denies feedback at every opportunity. Ever since their PR team straight up quit the subreddit, calling it a ""toxic environment"", most likely due to the fact that they were unable to control what was said (unlike their forums, where they have total control and use that control freely), there was no hope for their PR team. A development team that will readily call their community, who offers criticisms and only wants to help the game get better (though I do concede that a lot of the players will get pissy after a bad patch, but who can really blame them?) isn't fit to run a game.I really do want this game to be good. But as long as it continues on the path it's currently treading on, I will not recommend it, or play it.			"

												There were times when I was just lyrical about this game. Somehow, I fitted right in, getting a lot of kills, unlocking plane after plane. The game was extremely friendly to it's players, I never had the feeling that I was underpowered or anything. It was just awesome, especially cooping with friends. The game breathed the love for military aviation, it was a dream come true for me. The gameplay was just heartpounding fun as you twisted and turned to get behind your opponents. The historical battles were fun too. Moreover, you had an easy custom single player mode to brush up on your flying skills offline, which was very useful, since I wanted to make the jump to Simulator difficulty. You just had so much content in this game. Had.Then along came patch 1.37. The sky is now filled with nearly invincible ME-109's and La-7's, stuffed with cannons. Arcade dogfights have lost all appeal to me. Now it is just 'fly at each other with all guns blazing'. No tactics, no teamplay, no interesting dogfights. Any one-on-one dogfights are a thing of the past, the battlefield is just a frantic swirl of flying cannonballs without logic. It has nothing to do with flying or dogfighting anymore. In fact, the more I learned about fighter-tactics, the worse I became on this game. Unlocking planes is a thing of the past as well. Researching ANY plane takes ridicilously much time. The only way to speed up the process is -of course- by paying lots of money. Oh, and should you eventually manage to research and buy a game, it will have reduced speed, agility, armor, everything, just to make sure you have to pay again to unf*** your brand new plane. Moreover, this upgrade-system makes all historical accuracy obsolete, since a plane that historically is lower in turn-rate for example, can now outturn a not upgraded airplane that should have superior turning abilities. The easy customizable missions from the single player have dissappeared altogether. Now you get to chose between flying missions with a scenario fully controlled by the game, and not the player, or flying practice missions against biplanes and real life players. The latter are usually beginners, or dudes who want to test their brand new jet on easy prey. Not much practice there. And you need it to overcome the immensely steep learning curve to Simulator battles. Because of this, almost no-one plays this mode anymore. Gaijin scared away their first fans: the flight-sim boys. Luckily, the historial battles remain, together with the events-mode. This is an oasis of relief in an ever deteriorating game. Matchmaking is seemingly more fair here, teamplay is more important, and historical accuracy is restored a little. However, there are not much players on this mode, the learning curve is very steep, the waiting time for a match is quite high, and the absence of room for mistakes makes this game mode very difficult for new players.In sum, a charm of a game has turned into a mean money-making machine, discarding it's fans of the first hour in favor of the arcade-shooter public with big wallets. The player-friendly environment has turned into a frustrating grind and totally uninteresting gameplay (in arcade mode), focused only on making money. My sad conclusion: if you like planes and dogfighting, look somewhere else. It may seem cool if this is your first time on this game, but believe me, it is nothing compared to what it once was.			"

Bad game design and developers who do not care what you want.Arcade Battle Air   Not too much to complain about as this part of the game they designed the least of. Generally you'll have a good time unless you fly Japan. Russo-Japanese War must have hit the devs hard because Japan has the worst BRs and repair prices of any other nation ground or air. You'll rarely get competitive aircraft and if you do get something competitive it's a broken UFO flight model they didn't bother to pass on to anyone with a bit of sense. I'd like to add the final bit of bull the devs like to pass on Japanese is putting horrible fantasy ammo belts filled with practice shells. This ammo problem has not been fixed since the introduction of ammo selection.Realistic Battle Air   Again not much to complain about. BRs are a problem for many aircraft. You'll have much more fun here but it's not worth it time wise in my opinion. Japanese problems persist here like horrible BR but usually allied pilots are not very smart and they'll turn with an overtiered A6M5. If they ever add Enduring Conflict RB that will be your go to for planes.Arcade Battle Ground   I could write a novel on the cons to AB tanks but what really makes it unplayable is the constant bombardment of CoD killstreaks that instantly kill any one tank they choose. To continue on that, the Maus is one of the worst tanks at its BR and yet it's still missing historical turret armor and it has an insane repair price. The one tank that can't avoid a suicide run from an attacker and it is one of the most expensive. Getting killed out of the spawn is not fun for anyone and whenever I use the bombing run I want to put ""Sorry"" in chat because of how unfun and unavoidable the mechanic is. Transmission fires. Remove them. You should not have to unlock FPE or parts and you should not have to unlock flat camos.Realistic Battle Ground   Battle Ratings are a major problem. We do not have historical match making. We do not have match making by year. What we have is match making ""based on player performance"". This is a lie. There is little rhyme or reason to some of the BRs, not to mention the spread is too high. It's already pretty hard to get a game so reducing spread really wouldn't increase queue times. You have tanks that are outright better than some with lower BRs and repair costs. Not good. Spawn killing is terrible on many maps. Russians are great at close quarters knife fights which is fine except for that fact that every capture zone required to win is placed in dense cities forcing german teams to venture into their weak zone.The Problem   The real issue with all of this is simple. It's been this way for years and it's not getting fixed. From disastrous decisions like ATGMs and the Tu-4 they really don't care. The only recent instance I can recall of a good fix would be the restriction of four bombers per team but even that isn't working correctly. Don't take my word for it. Take every top player's word for it. Countless youtube channels stopping with War Thunder content. Japanese belts will not be fixed. High tier tank and aircraft gameplay will not improve. The mods act like children and players are mostly in a bad mood. Japanese players beg tooth and nail for the H8K2 to return to the regular tree and we get a slap in the face with an insane research requirment and a FANTASY UNPAINTED CAMO.The GoodIt looks good.

												Update 4th April 2016: new pay2win elements were added to the game. Branches and leaves can now be mounted on tanks as camouflage. This addition makes tanks with sloped armor and small weak spots much stronger. Here's one example of a camouflaged tank (guess the tank): https://i.gyazo.com/e7b1d7871120928db64ba983c93c7dff.png---------I honestly can't recommend the game to new players.Here's my summary (mainly Ground Forces):- Gaijin (the developer) has no idea about game balancing.- some mechanics are completely broken, e.g. ricochets. (Gaijin doesn't care)- matchmaking is not balanced. (Gaijin doesn't care and made it even worse a few months ago)- proved bias towards a certain faction. (Gaijin doesn't care)- some premium vehicles are pay2win. (Gaijin doesn't care)- most maps suck, especially for Realistic and Simulator Battle players (Gaijin doesn't care)- experience and money gain lowered over the last few years. (Gaijin doesn't care)- Simulator Battle game mode was replaced by a bad event system. (Gaijin doesn't care)- paywall for certain things got bigger and a lottery system was introduced.- customer support is absolute ♥♥♥♥. (you can't even change your e-mail address) - broken promises and constant lies- official forum = dictatorship- censorship is real (copyright strikes on YouTube videos; forum)- Gaijin does not listen to the player base. The only thing they care about are high player numbers and money.			"

												The game as of 25th Sep 2015 is totally borked. - The developers ruin game balance and economy at every chance and never go back, no matter how bad the decision. - The developers boast historical accuracy yet give Cold War ammo to WW2 Era Tanks (e.g. B471D Ammo for the IS-2).- Premiums introduced this year have costed ridiculous amounts of money compared to previous vehicles.Great game, terrible developers;  Do not invest in this game as you would only reward them for their terrible behaviour.

												(I paid way too much money on this thing so I keep playing in vain and suffering, save yourselves)Update, 01/02/2017: Japanese Ground Forces CBT started and so many things are missing. Many bugs and historical errors, unfixed minor adjustments.Tank decorations and branches/bushes added for costumization to ground forces. Bushes/Branches makes you tank less visible or almost invisible if well placed, giving both advantage and disadvantage. Advantage-->Being be able to ambush enemies. Stay stealthy.Disadvantage-->It costs Golden Eagles (In-Game Premium Currency), so prepare to say goodbye to bucks if you want to get them. Also only one side can be hidden.Pros:-Good Graphics.-Big variety of Aircraft,Tanks from Spanish Civil War to Cold War.-Still updating mechanics such as AI Naval Vessel turret horizontal & vertical targeting.-Only skill and knowledge matters in Realistic(Merely) and Simulator Battles.-Soviet tank players are provided with Stalinium armour.-You can learn a bit russian thanks to Russians on every server as if they are making a landing to servers.-You can learn many things about armament, flight characteristics of aircrafts, components of tanks and military operations and use knowledge to your advantage.Cons:-Lack of WWII history and accuracy of the game.-A matchmaking & battle rating system that screwed up in the past 3 years.-Most of the vehicles that are being added or are planned to be added are generally unnecessary.-T-34s are the only tanks with UFP armour modelled somehow.-AI Tanks & Naval Vessels do not have inner structure (i.e: When you try to bomb naval vessels, they can simply go through them even with HE bombs and deal no damage)-Field AAA got buffed so much that you can't fly with ease when AAA is firing at you, even at 5.000 meters high because they can snipe you.-Team is unlikely to listen to the community and decisions are generally unsatisfying.-A bias you can hardly notice about U.S.A, Germans and Soviets (Because why not?).-Late war tanks of Germany and late war aircraft of Japan keeps getting matchmaked with non-WWII/Cold War things such as J7W1 ""Shinden"" vs F-84 ""Thunderjet"" which makes having victory so hard for Axis countries (Japan & Germany)-Most of the players play Arcade Battles in general, almost 80% of them.-You hardly see more than 1-2 vehicles being added to Axis while Allies get almost 3-4 or more. Especially Soviets get minimum of 2 while Japan gets nothing but premium ones mostly-Most of vehicles that are being added every update are mostly never wanted or never brought up ones. Such as T-44-122 premium that no one ever mentioned or Do 17's Z-2 variant.-You won't ever notice that you keep paying money.-Gaijin will always come up with many ideas to keep leeching money, don't get affected by those and save your wallet.-Most of U.S.A & Soviet players don't know how to play in every mode, so does small %20 percentage of Japan & Germany players and half of Britain players.

												Update 1.37 turned this once-good game into a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Get ready for even more Soviet bias, German planes made of paper, jets in low tier battles. The new research system has set the architecture for an extreme grindfest thet is obviously intended to get players to pay to unlock planes within any reasonable amount of time. Only a single plane can be researched at a time per nation, meaning the fun of unlocking several planes when leveling up a nation is gone. If you don't have a lot of planes unlocked already in this game from before patch 1.37, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.			"

												Steam prevented me to post the full sized review, so here's the SNIP. I actually have 10 days pvp time (just moved into steam). You can check my in-game profile under the same nickname.Long story short: - great engine, controls and graphics- Matchmaking is frustrating and unfair due to the +/- 1.0/1.6 spread which probably favours Premium accounts. Population can allow for better.- Ratings can be improved. But they mostly won't be.- Russian bias is a fact, anyone denying there is one is being dishonest, deal with it. It has been multiple times uncovered by able players in game data, with bloated coefficient favoring russian models and ammo. Gaijin sometimes buffs foreign units to momentary overpower just to say ""that's stronk, there no russian bias, see? )))) "" but that's not balance, it's a poor excuse for one. Meanwhile, T34s dominate with 10x the kills of other tanks and Yaks/Lavochkins are UFOs firing turbolasers. They were very good designs, severely damaged by inexperience and industrial faults, but the models that made their way into the game are just silly.Bias leads to outright nationalist cheating as it extends to filtering historical sources and crew manuals until we have discarded ""nazi propaganda"" and unshared ""sikrit dokumentz, comrade"". If Gaijin keeps on their tracks, we'll soon have articles telling the tale of the glorious motherland who singlehandedly defeated the krauts with flying tanks and absolutely no help from the cowardly allies.You can read plenty of stuff about this on the forums.- Speaking of which, the dev team NEVER answers the pesky questions and instead players face the incredibly arrogant and downright jerks composing the moderating team who ban players posting perfectly legit questions or inconvenient historical sources. This is ridiculous customer care.It could be an awesome game. It is not. Not because the devs can't fix it but because they don't want to.6/10 would NOT be forced into playing soviets again.			"

												I'll start listing the issues in a moment...When a developer deliberately lengthens in-game progression with the intent of encouraging people to buy their way through the roadblocks, I think twice about whether or not I should support their product. I think thrice when the game is still in beta and the micro-transactions store, allowing character progression, premium features, and premium aircraft, is fully implemented.War Thunder is not alone in this practise and does not go to the lengths that other games do, but this is not a valid excuse. Now, because the developer is doing all of this whilst the rest of the game is unfinished, no criticism should be reigned because it is still in beta. Following that logic, I’ll give a summary list of my gripes discovered through the 200+ hours I’ve had in the beta.The replay system is horribly unfinished. The UI for it is almost entirely missing, along with the entire in-game chat. Bomber turrets do not animate, and sounds are frequently absent. The in-game UI is poor, is often hard to see against the terrain or background, and does not do enough to convey information to the player. Useful details such as the fuel timer are inexplicably disabled by default.The game menus are an improvement, but once again, certain pieces of information are hard to see at first glance, or obscured in another menu. For example, you cannot view the historical data on your selected plane unless you enter the customisation hangar.The matchmaking system is incredibly frustrating, badly designed, and made even worse than before due to recent changes. Matchmaking will never be perfect in any game, but in War Thunder, I have nothing positive to say about this atrocious system. Games should never punish players for doing well, being skilled, or playing with their friends, yet that is exactly what this system does.The spread of planes across nations is strange, with firepower and battlefield roles varying greatly. Not every nation has access to a fighter-bomber or bomber early-on (particularly Germany), some nations have a wider variety of fighters (Russia, for example), and some fighters are too well-armed and too manoeuvrable for their level (again, a game balance issue). Some planes, such as the Swordfish, a British torpedo bi-plane, are rendered useless due to a complete absence of naval targets for their level. Some planes are the opposite - the I-153 Soviet bi-plane has unique access to rockets and bombs, which all other bi-planes do not have.Most plane names are given as easy-to-confuse number & letter designations, despite the fact that all planes had names. Even after 200+ hours, I could not remember that the Ju-87 is a Stuka! I can remember Blenheim, Swordfish, Spitfire etc, but the others? I had to correct this review because I got the Ki-53 mixed-up with the I-153, so in most matches I had no idea what I was fighting!The currency system is completely and utterly irrelevant to the game. Ammunition and repair purchasing is trivial; the currency system exists as a lever through which the developer can push their micro-transactions and progression-purchasing. The progression system, as mentioned, is deliberately slow to encourage purchasing. This is compounded by experience for each plane crew, for each nation, being different. This actively discourages players from trying other nations, and does nothing beneficial for the experience.Worthy of note is the Ace qualification. This is a plane crew upgrade which cannot be earned through the in-game currency and normal play. It is an upgrade which can only be purchased with real money and adds a significant amount of power to your plane and stacks with the other crew qualifications. Here, more than anywhere else in War Thunder, is the definition of ‘pay-to-win’, and there should be no argument. This is a purchase of power, with real money, which has a direct impact on game balance and cannot be earned through in-game progression.The patching system through the launcher is atrocious, CPU intensive, and has twice prevented me from playing for over a week. The launcher uses their own custom torrenting system which is vastly inferior to any freely-available torrent software. Because it refused to function correctly, I was unable to play War Thunder for two months since the last big patch. I had to get a copy of the game files (all in Russian) through BitTorrent in order to get it working. The fact that this system remains unchanged is beyond ridiculous.There are added problems in Historic and Full-Real Battles (or whatever they’re called now). I have encountered issues with the in-game Instructor fighting me for control of the plane. This was particularly evident during the first few attempts of Historic mode, when I would crash uncontrollably on the runway or slowly drop out of the sky. Even when disabled, the game Instructor regularly fights the player for control of the plane during a sharp but controllable turn. This causes the plane to wobble alarmingly during a turn, forcing it to turn even slower than usual.The above problem does not exist in Arcade mode, because the problem comes as part of the ‘realism’ package that makes the plane handling sluggish. There are also issues with fuel tank sizes being too small for some lower-level planes, and maps being too big (the two problems are linked, by the way).To briefly mention the Meta problems . . .I have noticed an alarming attitude with regards to the three game modes, particularly from moderators. The opinion of the invested is to snub arcade mode and those who play it as being sub-par, with the prevailing defence for complaints being: ‘you do not have a right to complain about game balance if you play arcade mode’. Frankly this is a rather disgusting attitude to have, which I suppose could be akin to some sort of elitism. I have played many hours on Historic mode and if you put the choice to me I would choose Arcade in a heartbeat. If Historic / Full-Real are “the way it’s meant to be played”, then it should actually be fun to fly the bally planes! And finally, Gaijin Entertainment is also notable for the trademark abuse and legal bullying of Brandon Harris which started in May 2013 and is STILL ongoing (I can’t link here, but I recommend you search for that). Couple this with allegations of censorship of criticism on forums they control, and you have further relevant information for anyone considering a purchase of War Thunder.So how can I conclude this?The sad part is that there is a terrific warplane simulator here, which feels great to fly, has a reliable physics engine, and has realistic damage models that put rival titles to shame. But all of this is buried under bad design decisions, micro-transactions, and a company of dubious integrity which I do not trust to fix War Thunder’s problems before launch.			"

												At the time i'm writing this review, I have about 302 hours into the game.I mained the German nation (Going on Tier 5 Planes, Going on Tier 3-4 Ground).As everyone has mentioned a russian bias in one form or another, it is real.I know 302 hours isn't much compared to other plays, but I think its a valid amount to make a comment with.Russian Bias in Application (AIR):- ALL Russian aircraft are almost impossible to shoot down even with direct hits from cannons   (E.x. I was once flying my Tier 4 Me410 U1/A4 and I hit a Tier 2 Yak with a 50mm Air Target round... The Yak survived... This has happened more than once. And for scale, a 50mm Air Target round can one shot a heavy american bomber...)- Russian aircraft, notably the Yak line, have exaggerated climb rates that arent shown on stat profiles, but are very clear in game- Russian aircraft maintain speed a lot better than others- Russian BOMBERS have incredible AI Gunner Accuracy compared to other nations- The US has a P-51 Mustang, which was also given to Russia as a premium, the exact same plane... but with a lower BR- Russian machine guns are OP as ****Russian Bias in Application (GROUND):- If you fight a russian tank in the same Tier as you, you might as well ditch your tank, theres no point in fighting, as you need at least a tier higher tank to destroy a lower tier russian tank, unless you get a good shot.- Russians will always pen your armor- Russians are more likely to set your tank on fire- Russians deflect shots that shouldn't be possible (If you can pen 200+mm of armor, why can't you pen russian 80mm effective thickness at 90 degress WITH A TIGER!Honestly and factually speaking, each nation has their own benefits and drawbacks:- USA: Very balanced play style | Just as weak as they are strong- Germany: High speed, High Climb, strong ammo, metal armored planes | Crappy turning- Brits: Good turn fighting, Climbing, Accurate guns | Crappy armor- Japanese: AMAZING turn fighting | Crappy armor (""paper armor"")- Russia.... Amazing turn fighting, Amazing Climb Rate, Amazing Armor, Accurate Guns, Amazing Ammo... everything of which is boosted and not historically accurate, as oppose to other nations which more or less are.Every patch in a NutShell:- If Germany gets new plane -> Nerf German Air- If Russa gets new plane -> Nerf German Air- If Any Nation gets buffed -> Buff RussiaI know this review seems very bias against Russia, but honestly, you WILL notice a bias towards the Russian nation if you play this game.Overall the game is very fun and interesting, but its a BIG BIG turn off when you get killed by a Russian vehicle that was shotting in the opposite direction with a gun that can't pen your armor from any angle or spot.

												Since patch 1.37 I can't recommend.Prior to 1.37 I put up with the following: A toxic 'community' that includes some of the most fanatically deceptive fanboys i've ever encountered, very heavy handed censorship of criticism on Steam & official forum, bugs that don't get fixed, highly suspect flight & damage models (particularly for Soviet planes), badly implemented game mechanics like ramming/constant 1 shot kills if you don't pay to buff crews/terrible AI crew performance even with maximum (paid) buffing, and the list could go on. Developers put no emphasis on tactics or team play which lead to games where you had entire teams chasing a single plane, just comical. Since the game has zero facility to allow for team work, games are a total free-for-all.After 1.37 all the above problems remain with MORE added: Game design punishes successful players, Tiny rewards and incentive to progress means an incredibly long grind (we are talking YEARS to reach jets), High repair costs and high purchasing costs for planes with in game currency push players to pay to advance, Developers and English speaking forum helpers actively LIE claiming 1.37 changes make grinding easier & shorter, Developers ignore customer & tester feedback, Games as short as 120 seconds thanks to base rushing, Newbies are now treated like fodder at the bottom of the pyramid with paying & long term players able to pub stomp at whim. TLDR: Avoid. Patch 1.37 turned a fun shooter into a Ponzi scheme. Its never been a good flight/historical sim, now its not even an enjoyable shooter. For newbies the initial sandbox games can be deceptively balanced with a low grind, then they get thrown to the wolves and introduced to a grind of epic proportions. Ignore those who say its not Pay 2 Win, you either pay hundreds of dollars or suffer continual stomping. Developer response? Working as intended, No refunds, Quit Whining sucker..			"

												Pros: - Fun to play in the beginning run for each tier- Graphics are beautiful- Detail on battlegrounds and tanks look and feel in place along with many tanks and planes to choose from- Occassionally you get to see great teamwork and feel like you're accomplishing something for onceCons:- Once you get to higher tiers you start to notice the horrific balancing issues of always being up-tiered by things your tank cannot even penetrate- When reach the 6.0 Battle Rating vehicles, it can take up to literal weeks to research a single tank or plane unless you wish to spend real money buying your way to it instead to skip the grind (basically 'buy our stuff or be stuck forever' ordeal)- Ever see a t-34 Go 0-60kmh in 5 seconds with a turret speed that can triple any other tank at it's rank? (Oblivious Russian Bias post)- Always that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammate in spawn who kills half your crew in realism- When playing with friends who have other faction tanks than yours, the average que time can span up to 15 minutes across US and EU for a realism match, only to drive for 5 minutes, 1 shot killed, and not have enough points to respawn so you have to angrily tuck tail back to the main menu and wait for your friends to die as well for another good 30 minutes before you start the whole process over again. - As for the tank arcade, the war thunder definition of arcade is to show everyone's location precisely on the map and play hide and peek with 30 other ♥♥♥♥♥ in a waiting game to see who will have the balls enough to cap somethingI like the game yeah.

Now here's the thing.Your cannon is so ♥♥♥♥ing op. you can actually take down a plane in 1 hit. WITHOUT HITTING ANY VITAL PARTS OR AIMING AT ANY. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing joking. And those MGs? i actually took out a pilot 800 meters away by shooting twice(6 shots that last less than a second) I am not kidding you.But that's just the start. And if i were to rant about that, you would get an essay from me.Anyway, one more thing you should note. THERE IS NO TEAMWORK IN THIS GAME. NONE. ZERO. NADA. NIL. You got a zero on your ♥♥♥? ♥♥♥♥ that, i'm gonna chase this near dead Wellington with 4 other planes on him. WT servers without friends in a nutshell. You want teamwork? You gonna need friends.

												Why negative:1) Reload time is being changed by developers they way they want, completely independently from real conditions. I am not sure if its still like this now, but 1 year ago m18 hellcat had 8 sec reload and Sherman with the same cannon had 5 seconds reload, for example.2) Ammoracks are just broken, and broken intentionally. On many tanks ammorack is blowing up realistically in most of cases when its hit by a shell, like it should. But A LOT of tanks with very high caliber guns (like Maus, IS-2/3/4, KV-2, etc) for some stupid reasons have nearly unexplodable ammoracks. You penetrate them and hit ammorack directly, several times in different places, result? it just becomes black.3) Finally, absolutely utterly destroyed and annihilated balance on 5.7-8.0 Battle Rating.Before, like 1-2 years ago, War thunder had a lot lower historical limit on vehicles, the most late vehicles that were in the game (and had the highest BR - 7.7 or 8.0) were IS-4m, King tiger 105mm, panther 2, Early T-54 (it didnt have all the best late shells) and so on. Basically the latest vehicles in the game were designed in late 1940s or early 50s, and battle rating did make sense. However time was going and developer decided to add later vehicles with more advanced technologies, they started adding later T-54, T-10m, M60, Leopard 1, these tanks had HEAT shells with up to 400mm pen and sabot shells with a bit lower. And it would be COMPLETELY NORMAL, if ONLY they would give them PROPER BR, BR that would be way beyond 8.0. But guess what? there is still not even a single ground vehicle with BR higher than 8.0,  even though they have jets with BR 9.0. Probably the guy who defines ground veh balance cant count more than 8 just like gaben cant count more than 2. This becomes even worse now since they are adding more late vehicles like T-62 and ATGM vehicle for every side (controllable anti tank missiles). This entire mess is happening while there are such tanks as IS-2 and King Tiger on BR 6.7. Just think about it, regular late ww2 tanks are fighting with 60s vehicles with ATGMs, sabots and HEAT shells. 20 focking years difference. They even put one premium tank with ATGMs on br 6.7. As result of this completely idiotic balancing, many vehicles became completely unplayable, or barely playable in only some of situations. Adding tanks from 60s on BRs 7.7 and 8.0 caused lowering down BRs of some earlier vehicles like IS-3 and IS-4. Now we have vehicles that absolutely suck  against vehicles with just a bit higher BR they can meet in battle, but at the same time they are annihilating vehicles that are having a bit lower BR than they.

Final review, after I rewrite this countless times and keep the ""quit-join again"" cycle going, now I finally broke the cycle. So, one last time, last review on War Thunder based on my experience in the latest patch 1.65 ""Way of the Samurai"".Still not recommended.Still I'm the OG Udonge who joined back in 2013.Still, multiple sections.Air battle:Now to be fair, gameplay is kinda sorta solid, hell, low rank battles are fun, so fun I actually enjoy it. It's probably the best part of this game, in the Realistic Battle mode, your plane performs in a more realistic way, while the simple control is still there. While in Arcade Battle you get to enjoy fast-paced dogfight action. After all this game is all about air combat when it was first released.However, old problem is still there, sparking, some planes over/underperforming, but to be honest, this isn't the worst part.Ground battle:In short, the fun ends here. Long story below.Despite its ""more realistic"" damage mechanics, ground battle overall is, well, I'll be straight, bad.It could've been fun, it has lots of potential. Oh no, Russian bias. And sometimes, Wehraboo's wet dream, though in my opinion these are minor issues. Spawnkilling would be a larger problem in my eyes.In a real war, it makes sense that the troops have to suppress the enemies, prevent them from getting into combat, but this is a video game, a losing team has to be given a chance to fight back, the most basic mechanic would be anti-spawnkilling mechanics, which War Thunder does not have. If you played old Battlefield like BF2 you'll know the pain of being killed just after spawning.Finally, the cutoff time(27 July, 1953, the day when Korean Armistice Agreement was signed) is now actually nonexistent, instead, it's now something called ""technological cutoff"". Now we got things from 60s, if not 70s, there'll be a vehicle from 80s too. Some armored vehicles on rank 5 are vehicles that're still in active service, such as the Japanese Type 74 Main Battle Tank, or the M163 VADS which seen combat in the Gulf War. Also the Type 87 ""Guntank"". Which I actually have no opinions on. Thing is, weapons like these lead to a problem, which I will explain later.Gameplay in general, balancing, etc.:First off, balancing. This isn't a problem for low rank battles, planes or tanks, as the performance of these low rank weapons are rather similar, and they're from the same era, more or less. However, the problem starts to be more severe as the rank goes up. And later you can see battles between weapons during WW2 and post-WW2. Assuming players of both side have the same skills, the person using post-war weapon will have a higher advantage, as their weapons are more advanced, especially the ATGM which is capable of destroying any and all WW2 tanks. For aircraft, it's pretty much the same.Second, research of the next vehicle/aircraft, and the rewards. It'll become more and more frustrating as the requirements become much higher, while the reward doesn't increase. Without premium membership, it may take you months, even a whole year to get a rank 5. Not to mention you'll need a certain number of vehicles to unlock the next rank, as well as the parts research, which is also demanding as the rank becoming higher. The old researching mechanic is obviously better, as you don't unlock a single plane, but a whole rank of different weapons, fighters, bombers, everything ready be put into your lineup. And you don't have to unlock lots of upgrade parts for your weapon in order to see 100% of the weapon's performance. In other words, there was no such thing called stock syndrome back then.Community:It's basically circle jerk right now, as the moderators hate anything negative, you see only positive things on the forum now. One word, ""censorship"".Also, it seems the playerbase is getting smaller, some experienced players I know already left the game as developers turning this game into pile of junk. Devs are putting more and more stuff into this game, maybe they can bring in new players, but vets won't come back if the devs don't listen to the players.Conclusion:There was always a choice. You just ♥♥♥♥ed it up.Also, this game basically a tobacco product, if you have never played this game, don't. Otherwise it'll be nearly impossible to get rid of the habit. You know it's bad, but you just can't stop.			"

												Grind more than a Columbian coffee farmer grinds his beans. Afraid every second that a gang of drug smugglers will come to his home and take his wife and children. He grinds all day long for a few dollars a day...I would rather be him right now. Ironically for the few dollars I could make grinding coffee beans I pay to win in this game. Grind Grind Grind. The amount I grind you would think I was a sleezy Vegas Show girl. If anyone speaks out to the devs about the grinding or some of the flaws they are wiped out, banned...maybe shot. If the Columbian coffee farmer complains he is also shot by the militia.I dont feel like a pilot in this game...I feel like a Columbian Coffee farmer...I am just off to grind some more.1939/1952			"

Spent months grinding my Tier V T-54 tank (270,000 xp), in February they added the T-44-100 (another 270,000 xp); now I need to spend another month grinding a tank I did not want, and did not plan on getting before being allowed to even purchase my Tier V tank.Thanks Gaijin, you're a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

												Used to be a really good game with good progression system before 1.37 update. Now it's not even worth it, you have to work at least 2000% (estimated) more if you want to unlock a plane you want, including all previous planes along with new restriction to unlock 3 planes from previous tier.  Want to advance research on speicific plane? You can with free research points, there's a cost for it... required to use your own eagles to ""convert"" specific plane's research progress.Thanks a lot Gaijin for this bad progression system... * uninstalled *P.S. I would say it's fine for weapons' progression system, just don't do the plane's progression system.EDIT: This is OLD review, I have heard the update in January (2014) fixed the new progression system problems.EDIT2: By OLD review, I meant histroical review. I will NOT update this review. Please do not post, both positive and negative, here as it will be delete every time except for 3 posted in Feburary 2014. Thank you!			"

												I would of recommended this BEFORE 1.37, but since 1.37 changed everything, It is now ruined for what it was. I would wait for Gaijin to realize the mistake of the Tier I-V system that they have implemented to replace the Tier 1-20 system. They broke the HB which is now known as RB by introducing mixed nations to historical battles just like arcade which is a HUGE disappointment but this is way too far. If this is an attempt to compete or be 'better' than World of War Planes then this is a HUGE mistake. You were already blowing them out of the water! You may or may not have just sank to their level. Congrats. There is a possibility that you have have ruined a game that I loved, I just hope that you realise what you have done and fix this mess. I'll have to say that I don't recommend this game post 1.37 patch.			"

												Well the game is turning quickly into a money sink scam. They are even banning anyone who points this out on their forums and here in steam forums. Ive been a steam member since the early days and never seen this behavior before. Don't kid yourselves, this game is turning into a massive P2W game. The game is fun in AB, but the biases are so obvious its almost shameful. The new patch was nothing more than a massive attempt to get people to spend more cash or you will have to grind forever and ever. If you don't have hundreds of dollars to throw away to be competitive, then get used to the idea that you will be fodder for the rest. Overall the game is good, but the company running it are on par with hedge fund managers. Buyer beware.			"

I would not reccomend spending money on this game or treating it  as anything more than a space ship arcade simulator with so much bias towards your home country, that if playing correctly, you can never lose. Also, not to mention that the game pushes all kinds of scumbag actions like kill stealing, and rewards those who are greedy and don't even try to put effort into the game or teamwork. Also, if you're mad at someone just push the report button and write a BS story. Guaranteed chatban.			"

The Game should more secure i Aggree but using a Second security post shouldnt be the way.Its a Shame that When Firstly Seeing War thunder on steam Was a Jolly Because This game Was Different at the Time.It Only Went downhill.I Honestly dont think there are enough Staff in the Bug Fixing & Game play/Trial department as i seem to still Pass certain areas on a map that Still have the Same Bugs.

												You know, I put quite a few hours into this game and REALLY had a hard time doing this, but this game is too frustrating to recommend. It's F2P, so you probably know what you are getting into (grinding, paying for bonus xp, etc.). This is mainly concerning the tank portion of the game, but I feel the planes are similar.The topic du jour with WT is russian bias. Now, when I first heard this, I was skeptical as there are whiners in every game. There is definitely some questionably statted russian tanks, but the problem to me is the matchmaking. The matchmaking is terrible, you are often matched against overtiered tanks that you have no hope of penning. I get that there are game balancing issues vs. historical accuracy, but when you are in your Tiger I or Panther staring down a Tiger 2 or some cold war russian behemoth with futuristic ammo, you literally can't destroy the other tank without some heroic flanking maneuvers. That guy gets 10 kills and you are stuck trying to find the poor schmuck who got over-tiered in his tank before you get one-shotted. Repeat that 100 times and you'll realize you have better things to do wqith your life.			"

You know you've been playing too much War Thunder when...You have a panic attack while driving over bridges. You assume other drivers are going to push you off at any moment.While looking at cars you picture them in x-ray mode, noting where the critical modules are.While looking at planes in real life, you picture a target in front of them, guessing how much you would have to lead the target.You get frustrated with your car mechanic when he can't fix your car in under one minute.You can only hold your breath underwater for five seconds before you drown.You suddenly can pronounce German and Russian.While watching the news you see an airliner attempt a landing with one wing. ""No big deal"" you think.You get nervous when you hear a plane above you.You know more about flying planes than some pilots and you have never flown a plane.When you see two kids' kites get tied up together, you mutter to yourself, ""damn team killers...""You freak out every time someone tailgates you.You constantly beg your optometrist for ""keen vision,"" even though your vision is 20/20.You don't have to use an alarm clock anymore. You sit bolt upright after nightmares of ""YOUR LEFT WING!""You drive a car that has two fire extinguishers inside, a set of tracks instead of a spare tire, and a hatchet and a shovel on the side.When the car dealership asks what color you want, you insist on bicolor summer camouflage.When a cop pulls you over and asks why your steering wheel has been replaced with a joystick, you tell him ""simulator mode.""You get fired from your towing job because you towed a car upside down while the driver was still inside.You drive right through Road Closed and Flood warning signs into 4 feet of water. Only after you car is completely submerged do you get nervous.			"

												The worst part about this game is that it has the potential to be something great. It is a game based around what is essentially a fight with physics, but has some of the worst coding when it comes to physics in any game out there. You'll see fighters prop hang while shooting their 20mm cannons sub 50kph, T-34s bounce a 17pdr shell at a 20 degree angle, and so much more.A positive for the game is that it is updated regularly, however those updates rarely address any of the crippling flaws the game has. RB air hasn't seen a new map in years, and tanks suffer from a horrible matchmaking/balancing system. The patches are mere bandaids that never address the real issues. Prepare to roll out with your team comprised of 76 Shermans against a team full of Tigers and Panthers. While not impossible to win, it is horribly skewed in their favor. And that is just one of many possible scenarios.The game can be exceptionally fun. However, if you're looking for a balanced gaming experience that rewards a well placed shot or well executed maneuver, you're better off looking elsewhere. This game requires an even temperment and the ability to shrug off the mass of inconsistencies that the game will throw at you on a game by game basis. You've been warned.			"

Choose wisely, comrade.As is formula for all pay-to-win games, units you give us American dollars for will not only be more powerful but also undervalued in BR, so that you can sneak them into games where everyone will be even more below you in power and you can feel like a Real Man.  The kind of Real Man who beats his wife for laughs after too much vodka, Glory to the Motherland!Like every other online war game out there, there are people who use hacks to cheat & win.  Unlike every other game, however, our method of dealing with them is not to defeat hackers but rather simply try to ban their videos on YouTube and censor anyone from talking about them.  This is because we have managed to create the only collection of Russian programmers in the world where no one knows anything about hacking.We will claim that you do not really have to pay us American dollars to win, because everything can be unlocked with enough grinding, except, of course, all the things that cannot be unlocked except through giving us American dollars.  Things like super units, top crew skill levels, and more hanger space to screw the BR system with.  You know, those things used by our whales, er, we mean ""top players"" to ""gain a competetive edge"" (read: win with no effort).  This is good example to remember whenever we make claims about anything, comrade.Maybe if game was made by someone else we could fix these problems, but that would mean handing creative control over to people who didn't live in fear of being sent to Siberia if any actual realism slipped in or if they couldn't make their protection money payments to Glorious Leader Putin.  Why would we allow that to happen, comrade?  We have good system here.  We get you stupid Americans to give us money just to show you why Russan everything is always better.  Why would we change anything?			"

												You know what? I really like this game. It's not bad. I would like to recommend this game but they're so many things that are awful. First off all: the balance. Sometimes you get uptiered as hell. So you have to fight a T-10M in your Tiger II P. (Sekrit documints.) Also, the devs are keep making the game worse and worse with each and every update. I've been in-game for almost 3 years now. I know what I'm talking about. I've also spent a decent amount of dosh in the game. Pls Gaijin fix the game. I might check the game out from time to time but for now it's just bad. Also they don't even know how to host a tournament. For example: the E-100 tournamet. It was bugged for so many ppl. Pls fix			"

												Prior to patch 1.37 I had fun with the game. It was fun, easy to learn, and though it took a while to find a match in anything other than arcade mode, the matchmaking was actually balanced.They recently dropped the ball, however, and released a patch that the vast majority of the community agree was a mistake.The ""Research"" system is pointless, and only serves to lock you out of planes. If you do manage to get a plane, good luck affording it if you've been buying modifications for your existing planes, since you have to buy it after 'unlocking' it.The game balance has been screwed over too. Bombers are pointless now, despite the objectives in most game mades being to destroy ground targets.  If you're not in a plane with a 30mm cannon, well, sucks to be you. New to the game? Lucky you. You get to fly against spitfires and Laggs, they'll one hit you. Good luck.For now, I strongly caution anyone against spending money on this game. Hopefully the devs will sort this out, because I can't reccomend it in its current state. It's sad, because I really loved this game just a few days ago.			"

												Not that I anticipate this review to be seen very much, but having been with the game since 2012 I feel compelled to make one. I have played the predecessor games (Wings/Birds of Prey and Birds of Steel) as well as put about 3000+ hours of time into WT, not all on the Steam version, but before steam link and including a previous account, and I just want to offer my perspective on the game.War Thunder has undergone a large amount of changes in 4 years, which is to be expected. There was never a physical, celebratory  release of the game from Open Beta into an actual game. That being said, it's not for the worse for it. The game used to have some very unbalanced features (Some may remember the horrors of 2 minute games with Yer Thunder, or the B-17 bomber aces with laser gunners, or farther back the scourge of the D-13 dominating the game). Recently, the ATGM tanks (which just require some changing of tactics) have been put down as 'bias' and 'unfair'. The game is much more balanced than many other vehicle-based combat games.Also, trying to compare War Thunder to other games (World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, etc.) is not an apt comparison, the games are set up very differently, and WT is really a game all it's own.As time has passed, most of the larger, more game-breaking imbalances have been corrected and despite what people may tell you, the cries of Russian/US/British/German/Japanese Bias are all unfounded. In the vast majority of places it's simply someone not knowing how to counter any specific group of planes (for example shooting a Lagg-3's wooden wings). There are some widely considered to be undertiered/overtiered tanks and aircraft. This is always in flux as the BRs for some vehicles change nearly patch to patch. Additionally things like damage and flight models for vehicles are being tweaked and adjusted on a constant basis.Things that may be present in more intense simulators (things like unreliable engines, imperfect manufacturing, crew shellshock, etc.) aren't modeled into War Thunder. The vehicles in the game perform as close to they can while also maintaining easier control schemes for different game modes. For example, if you play simulator, you may be able to get better performance out of your plane than realistic mode due to being able to have a more complex control setup.In terms of business-wise and staff-wise, Gaijin leaves some things to be desired. Some of the staff can be abrasive at times, but for the most part they are all pretty well-informed community aides. I, personally, have never had a bad experience with game moderators, forum moderators, or support members. Some say they have, but I can't offer insight into those cases. Every issue that I have gone to support with I have received help with and been able to resolve the issue. As a business, Gaijin has really been using the F2P model with microtransactions for in-game currency (called Golden Eagles). GE can be used for premium time, premium vehicles (they earn more research and silver lion currency then non-premium vehicles), and decals and camos to adorn your vehicles with (most of these can be unlocked for free with playtime). Again, you will see a lot of cries of Pay-to-Win here, but that isn't the case. The model that it is is really Pay-to-Advance, as the increased rewards just help with research times and working your way up the grinding ladder.If you're looking for realism, War Thunder may not be the best game, simply because play is simplified for a wider playerbase, which is something people mark as a bad thing, but it's just a business move. The game has always been that way, and will continue to be more simple-focused, which isn't to bash on people playing in these modes, there are just more people in those modes.Gameplay is fairly easy to catch on to, but does take some time, patience, and practice to master. Knowing what your plane or tank can do, what strengths/weaknesses it has, and other attributes of your vehicle as well as the same of the enemy vehicles that you face is needed. The game is a time investment, you won't be able to hop right into it and get to top-tier in a week or two, it'll take longer than that.Edit: On hacking/cheating. Gaijin regularly (every month or so) announces how many accounts were determined to be using 'external modifications. and bans those accounts permanently. Most of the time, you will encounter no cheats, people can make vehicles do some pretty smooth tricks with gameplay mechanics, or are just better-than-average and players will look for an excuse as to why they lost. Not saying it to be elitist, but that's just honesty.Edit: Playerbase. To be honest the playerbase much anymore is filled with a lot of people who are all too happy to rage and vent anger in any way they can (cries of bias, teamkilling, spamming caps). These players are in the minority, most players are quiet and occasionally will say something or two. I cannot fault the game for actions of the people playing it. And there are a lot of good people out there in the game (the majority of players). I recommend playing alone or with people that you know you communicate well with. A squad of 4 people can clean house in any given game if they know each other and what they're doing.There are frustrating moments. Mainly for me, game updates are blocked on most of the networks I play on, as they do outside network security and Peer-to-Peer downloading is blocked. (Colleges, a lot of libraries, the like). I have not had much at all in the way of game bugs or glitches, crashes, or anything of that sort. You will come across some limitations, especially on older machines, but don't be deterred. I played on a potatotop for a year on minimum settings at 30fps, the game was still enjoyable.TL;DR- War Thunder has some realistic attributes, but also some simplified attributes. Don't listen to people crying wolf with bias, use your own patience and know-how to play and it is fun and rewarding. Be prepared to invest your time into the game, not for a quick rush to the 'end'. Play the game, if you find it fun or entertaining, stick around, just go along with the ride.PS- If anyone is looking to play, or discuss the game, feel free to find me in-game and I would be happy to join!

												The game is very fun if you ignore all historical value this game once promised. While in Closed beta the devs were very clear that the historical timelines would be the building blocks for this game. For example a very common aircraft like the 109 G6 or P51 would be more common because the repair cost and xp reward would be greater then aircraft that would be considered over powered for the year it flew. So in 1945 when 262 would be seen. The 262's cost of repair, ammo, and xp would give you no reward that would make it worth running it too much. Now the devs only see the money, not the historical value. If anyone opened a history book on the P63 and the P36 you'd see they had a habit to flat spin. I understand there is a Simulation mode, but that still doesn't adjust the year differences. An F6F has no buisness seeing HE112s! A late 1930s plane versus a mid 1940s plane.... I either will say the devs really just don't care about their older fans, or that most pilots of the US planes are so bad and complain so much that they need to be matched with planes from pre and early stages of the war. The Devs don't like the Japanese, they get a plane every 4 or 5 patches. The Russians are armed to the teeth with 1950s clubbing seals on 1945 German planes (execpt the Mig and F86)... Again my biggest gripe with this game is the Devs changing the one promise that made them stand out. For those who don't care about historical value you'll love this game. For those who are fanatacis about WWII aviation and armor you will be disappointed by the following(assuming you don't buy your way up the tree); Airforces (teir/nation) Russian:5 Japan:3 US:5 German:4 Britiain:4 ground forces German:4 Russian:5. I've played all the nations and grinded every tank and plane with out buying my way up the tree and with out using only premium planes. In WoT yeah I milked the Type 59 for every xp and credit it would let me take. Crap off topic, again not historical and will please the biggest spenders... the Americans and Russians.Oh and the reason they keep the 262 at tier 5 with a battle rating to meet the F86s and Mig 15s.... it's 30s! The HE162 was hit with the nerf club, so grinding the German Mig 15 is impossible and will take a life time to grind with out the 130% gain from the HE162. It's been said before and I will say it here. The other major killer of this game is the teams... I have been on some teams that just know what they are doing! They can aim, they know how to use altitude, BnZ, and stall fighting.... but that is rare 70% your team will be stuck on the deck killing AI and shooting AAA with a high altitude fighter. Also high altitude fighters like the TA 152, FW 190Ds, P51s, ect never really see the best of thier abilities because the fights again never make it above 5km. The Yak fighters historally were great on the deck and at low altitudes. With out a doubt there! WoT vs WT ground forces.... at least WoT is less grindy. The one BIG plus to WT groundforces, none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lower plate weak ♥♥♥♥ for the German armor! More importantly when the US tanks are launched none of that weak hull crap either. The M103 was a beast in real life and I expect to see it tear IS4s and T54s apart. The KT 105 is less leathel then the KT in tier 4. Don't grind for German tier 5 it's not worth it. Get Tier 4..... if the grind doesn't kill you. When GF first came out the Simulator game mode was amazing! The experience was AMAZING! and the credits poured in! Then the Devs demanded more money and longer grinds and beat the crap out of GF. I literally made it to Tier 4 in about two days from the initial release of GF. Both Russian and German trees.... now... pffft I still am not close to getting my Tier 5 tank because it's too painful to play this arcade crap!			"

												This game once was a very nice and good developed game, But slowly patch after patch it gets worse and worse, almost reaching WoWP level.Worse is even that you get banned for speaking out on the forum, guess russians didnt forget the CCCP that quickly, free opinion not allowed.Its a nice enough game if you start and know a bit about flying. if you dont, leave it be. Low tiers (which dont count as battle rating dictates match making) are hopelessly outclassed by professianal sealclubbers. up to high tiers which are a grindfest which make World of Tanks look like a breeze in the park...see for yourself and you probably quit after a couple of weeks...

												619 hours as of this review.... I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to play as the Americans. If you want to munch on American tanks and planes, then by all means give it a try. Pros- graphics- realistic tank/plane models- solid maps- good gameplay mechanics- free (kinda)Cons- absolutely no balance between nations (Germans and Russians are clearly superior in almost every way)- the grind for new vehicles is insane once you reach mid tiers- People who pay for premium vehicles have a massive advantage over the people who actually do the grinding- Can make you want to break your keyboard in halfAt first, War Thunder is an extremely fun game, looks great, plays great. I play primarily as the Americans (both Air and Ground), although i have spent a good bit of time playing as British planes, and German tanks. After spending a lot of time on this game, and getting past the first couple tiers of vehicles, you start realizing that Russian aircraft are performing physic defying manuevers, and German and Russian tanks are massively superior to their American and British counterparts. I had a load of fun with this game at first, but after putting a lot of time and effort (and a little of my money, because the grind was way too difficult without it) I have to say that I am deeply dissapointed with where this game led me. Basically, if you want to play as German or Soviet's, you will have a blast munching on the squishy American and British tanks, and sluggish American planes. I would love to give this a Thumbs up, because I have put so many hours into it and had a some fun for awhile, but due to the imbalance of the rosters, I cannot say that I am currently happy with this game.

												As of update 1.53, Gaijin is not even trying to hide the russian bias in ground forces(tank battles). Combined with a completely broken matchmaking system, penetration mechanics that rely on RNG, and a total disregard to the communities opinion makes this game not worth hard drive space. Which is sad considering the game itself has so much potential but is operated buy a bunch of money hungry russians that will do anything to make a quick buck.Overall communism/10 now have irrational hate for russia.

												+ Looks awesome across the board.+ Great performence and lots of options to configure this game to your liking.+ Almost no blue print/prototype planes.+ Sound effects are very nice.+ polished (pretty much no bugs, match UI is good though there is slight mouse lag inside the menus which is rather annoying).+ Easy controls for people without a fly stick.+ 3 game modes, something for everyone.+ It's free to play.+ It is currently not pay to win (except the 'reserve plane' and premium hangar slots which only affects Arcade mode).- In Mid to High tiers this turns into a huge grindfest.- Broken flight and damage models on certain planes that have been added several major patches ago and they keep putting more unfinished planes with placeholder physics in - instead of finishing what is already there.- There have been extremely OP premium ('flavour of the patch') planes with each patch who got nerfed some patches later. I suspect powercreep.- Stock planes to ""upgraded"" planes have a huge performence delta making the level grind painful and hard.- There has been a lot of ""remove content to make it pay2get/unlock with grind"", skins, decals, unlocks etc.- Bombers are having a hard time getting properly balanced, in low tier they are Bullet Sponges while they die like ♥♥♥♥ in Mid/High tier games.- If you put 5 Nations into the game support them all equally or don't bother adding them in the first place .- Power of Stalinwood and Leninium - If you know what I mean. (This is pretty open to debate though and it's not the case with every plane)- The whole Jet/High tier stuff seems fairly unfinished right now in terms of content and balance.If you want a real ""simulator"" that is equal to RL don't bother, sim battles is a nice mode but it still lacks realism and complexity. I recommend IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad for WW2 sim nuts and DCS (modular free2play too) world if you want to play with modern Jets.If you want some ""quick"" action without a huge learning curve, realism and arcade mode should be good modes for you.TL;DRI don't recommend buying anything for this game atm due to the amount of big changes especially to premium content but it is worth getting to have some fun :) "

												The game is slowly dying and mostly used by the dev as a cash cow. This review was updated to summerize the growing list of problems.- constant pop ups on log in urging you to buy premium- After battle reports displaying what you 'could have earned' if you had premium- Premium items being incredibly overpriced, up to $60 for one tank in some cases- incredibly slow lifetime long grind to get anywhere in the game, no doubt a method to push premium- free experience (you must use credit to unlock this) generated at a rate far too high in relation to unit experience- challenges that reward free tanks but basically require the purchase of premium xp bonuses- did i mention they push premium? - constant recycling of units by the devs, they stick a swastika on a churchill and expect you to pay for it- very thin unit trees, they have a large number of T-34 variants but zero japanese tanks- that roll mechanic...- poor map designs that are quite boring- spawn camping (although we have all done it in our time)- hackers- Gaijins method (or lack there of) for combating hackers, which origionally was to remove realistic mode, but now they really stepped it up a notch by having the grand strategy of doing nothing- Number 1 rule of War Thunder club: dont talk about hacking*feel free to add to this listBut the most telling issue with the games future is the upcoming War Thunder Coast Guard, and no im not here to complain about ship size (as we all know its not the size of the boat, its the motion of the ocean). The thing i wish to point out is that Gaijin is not even capable of hosting a non-pixelated stream showing off its latest offering.When the list of issues is nearly unending before boats are even released and gaijin couldnt even manage a stream let alone this steaming turd, it dosnt surprise me they are losing the player base. When a dev takes such little pride in its product i take such little pride in playing it.			"

												The game was fun in the beginning. You stop playing because your computer cant hack ( not able to play - not literally meaning hacking of the game,) it with updates done by game maker. So you stop playing for a yr or so. Sign in after making a api validator only to find out you have been banned for crap you did while you had the game uninstalled. Then you contact customer support (is a joke) only not to receive even an acknowledgement that you submitted anything, from GMs that clearly left the dev team. Then when you find one that is active they dont even respond. So 3 weels later you come on their store page and rip them on a review! Priceless.			"

												I would of recommended this BEFORE 1.37, but since 1.37 changed everything, It is now ruined for what it was. I would wait for Gaijin to realize the mistake of the Tier I-V system that they have implemented to replace the Tier 1-20 system.  Also they broke the HB which is now known as RB by introducing mixed nations just like arcade which is a HUGE disappointment.  I loved this game so much because of the Historical Battles, but this is way too far.  If this is an attempt to compete with WoWP, you didn't need to change anything, because you were already blowing them out of the water.  Now you sank to their level, goodjob.			"

												Are you looking for a game that accurately portrays WWII warfare? Then look somewhere else because that is not this game. The balancing is terrible and not up to historical records. There are multiple instances of russian biases (they get double payload for standard shells, tu-4, flame retardence across ALL planes, etc.). It is a timesink. I cannot reccomend putting the time into getting RP for tiering up when the developers literally just copy paste vehicles across tiers.

And they say it as the Russian planes do that Red Tails manuever.The shell mechanics are equally frustrating and awe inspiring as your SU-100Y rips a Leopard I to pieces, or your Panzer IV F2 blows through a M4 Sherman at over a km away.I really really want to love this game, and I most certainly used to, but ATGMs broke high tier matches, German SPAA dominates low tier matches (usually) and a host of other features including your shells stopping to exist if you die, so you can't ""kill from beyond the grave"" anymore. The graphics are beautiful, and the playerbase, matchmaker, forums(so I hear, I don't go there myself), and obvious bias are massive steaming piles of bull. There's also features if you're a good player, like always getting completely out tiered, bomb and rocket near misses killing you every time, artillery killing you with the opening shell, your shells being extra bouncy and your guns inaccurate, and so on and so forth. What people say about the game that is good is usually true, but what they say is bad is almost never false. If you can find some people to play custom battles with I'm sure it could be loads of fun. My clan (5D) played our own simulator battles actually based off historical events (Stalingrad, Normandy, etc) and unlike the Gaijin sponsored ones, actually were historically accurate.Maybe the upcoming ""World War"" mode will save the game, but sadly, this doesn't seem likely. I really wish this game could be fun, but after you play long enough, all you see are the problems in it, and the fact that your team is literally less than useless.			"

												As it stands right now, I would say no to recommending this game to anyone who doesn't already play it. The game is slowly going down hill. Everything from broken patches to 3/4 of the current player base for the aviation section complaining about problems that should have been addressed to the customer standards a while ago and nothing was ever done. Until Gaijin dev's take their heads out of their asses and actually put forth the effort to cator to the majority of their clients, I feel this game is doomed. Which saddens me, because the game has so much potential to be an awesome game.			"

												While playing this game it occured to me that the more time i spent partaking in the tedium, and the grind, the less fun i had. Initially, tank fights were very fun to play - an experience (one of few) i was able to take away from this game that was positive. It was simple - you shoot them and they shoot you. As i ascended in the ranks of both russia and US tanks (3.0-5.0), that same ideal stayed relativley intact; some tanks became more armoured than others but it wasn't impossible to kill them and a miracle shot wasn't something unheard of. There were clear trade offs with the tanks - Some offered more speed with a better gun, but less armour as a whole. Some were more armoured with decent speed but a crappier gun, and it goes on. No tank was without weakness in major areas, and the areas were very clear. This added a bit of interesting gameplay and it helped me learn how to turn my tanks in certain ways to block shots, or where to shoot tanks to get the maximum amount of damage and i reveled in that. It was interesting gamplay, and it was very immersive. I had spent a large portion of my time playing War Thunder at this metaphorical 'sweet spot'. Then i got my first 5.7 tank and i started to get matched with 6.0 and 6.3. An occasional 6.7 would appear, as well.  I would position myself no different than before and die instantly. I would fire away at tanks shot after shot, trying so desperatley to find a place to hit but die quickly after i was spotted after causing minimal damage. Most times, i would find fair matches but it was also the unfair matches i remember most vividly. I kept telling myself that once I was on equal ground, it would be more fun again. It kept me going to repeat that. Then i got my first 6.0 tank. Long gone were the times where i could just shoot at other tanks and cause damage. I was finding myself dying over and over even though i had been doing nothing different than before. Constanty dying to a single shot even though my shots never got the chance to even penetrate. When i did get a kill, it wasn't satisfying. It felt owed to me - and after spending the better part of 10-15 minutes driving my slow tank, i felt that it should've too.After some research on why my performance has suffered so badly, i learned that the game completley changes at 6.0+ with no warning to it's players. Instead of having huge killzones, tanks now had tiny weak spots to shoot and you were damned if you couldn't hit them. Some tanks were still thinly armored with guns equal to those of the slow cumbersome variety. There was no way to win for me but to sit and ambush or invest in these tanks that demanded tedium to drive. If i managed to get to a shooting zone that was profitable for me, I ended up getting bombed.The game was stale. It wasn't fun to play anymore. The tanks - they were wildly cool. As an enthusiast, i was thrilled at the idea of getting to drive them. It's unfortunate that the game becomes so unbearable at the higher tiers becuase i was really looking forward to playing a simple tank game like it was when i started. I wanted more than World of Tanks... but i also wanted less than the complexity this offered. I only hope that in the future they make a balancing pass at the game. And i sure hope that the ships don't come out like this did. I havent even started on the grinding process of this game. You will not get far without premium or a tank that costs money.			"

												Bottom Line Up Front: The only reasons to play this game are A) Because it's the only one of its kind (slightly more realistic than World of Tanks) and B) You suffer from crippling deppresion.In either case the grind will make you wish for the sweet release of death. I can't properly explain how bad the grind is because no matter what I say you'll fly through the first few tiers thinking I'm a liar. By the time you've realized your mistake you'll have invested so much time into the game that you'll continue on regardless. Once you reach the King Tiger/M26/IS-2 it will take approximately 90 games to research a fire extinguisher. I don't know how many it would take to research spare parts (to repair a thrown track/damaged gun etc.) though it will be significantly less. The grind gets worse than that but I haven't made it any farther.Anyone who's already played this game will be thinking about the fact that I haven't mentioned aircraft in War Thunder, which is significantly kinder on the grind portion of things. The reason for this is because of rudder wobble, and issue that exsists only with joysticks (google warthunder rudder wobble and take note of the age/frequency of posts). For reference imagine pushing the nose to the right, releasing pressure and having the nose go to the left in an equal and opposite fashion. Note that from an input point of view I've effectively gone from +100 to 0. The supposed solution to this is to reduce your sensitvity to as near 0 as possible and to reiterate this isn't an issue mouse/keyboard users suffer from.In closing I'll desperately ask you, the reader to avoid this game for the safety of your mind. Regardless, as I mentioned this is the only game on the market to reward so heavily careful and well through out aim via it's damage model. Even so it's attempt at realism is hampered by terrible hit registration and lack of important concepts such as spalling/smoke/overmatching.P.S. It was found once that (at a coding level) Russian shells were better than any other nation at the same caliber. Shocker.			"

												What seems on the surface to be a multiplayer online flight-'sim' is in fact a cruel parody of the genre. By deliberately collecting all the worst design choices from similar games (most notably those of Wargaming), Gaijin are shining a light on these terrible practices and acting out an exemplary cautionary tale.The developers are actually performance artists, who cause us to question the trend of soft launches, and ask 'wouldn't it be terrible if a real game was run by a team as deluded, incompetent and deceitful as the one we are portraying?'.Their most recent installation piece, entitled ""1.37, or how I learned to stop worrying and ♥♥♥♥ off my entire playerbase"" attempts to find the quickest way to sabotage a successful game, and manages it with aplomb.A satirical tour-de-force.

												The game has been going down hill at a constant rate for about a year now. The Russian bias is growing more and more with each patch they send out. The game used to be ballanced and fun, now its ""oh look I'm in a tank from 1944 fighting tanks from the mids 60's"" Driving a German heavy is like riding around ina car with a gas tank thats painted with the words ""please shoot me"" They have no armor as far as I can tell. If you try to fight a Russian tank one on one you will lose 9 out of 10 times. Also as far as I can tell Russian players seem to have some sort of buff when they play, their armor gets thicker and their guns hit harder. One last thing, the Russian pay for tanks are massively overpowered, they out class every tank they fight by a huge gap. This was a good game but not any more, thumbs down.			"

The non-Steam version is free, and you get two of the best planes without having to pay a single cent. War Thunder started out as promising, but now it's just turned into a money mnaking machine, with no regard for historical accuracy or immersion.

												Edit: Yes I'm still playing this because my only other option is MWO and I've already touched that stove (I'll always miss my 9AL pre-Ghost Heat). Had a match in Berlin, spawned north side. Thought I'd flank around wide in my M18 Hellcat, sticking to the back roads for the time being. Ideal conditions for the thing. Oh, they've hit my speed again, welp. Pan camera around checking for any enemies, it's realistic and I'm pretty far forward, don't want any surprises in my glorified armored car. Why... is an Allied T-34-85 able to keep up with me while I'm going full tilt on a long stretch of road. In an M18. Seems legit and in no way pants on head. The average thought processes behind someone who actually loves tanks and did their homework:War Thunder 'Realistic Mode'. Where we took out the Russian ammo's inaccuracy, nerfed American mobility and gun depression, didn't bother fixing their ammo to behave like it's real world counterpart, still haven't nerfed Russian HE ammo hitting up to 2 tiers higher than it's supposed to. Still haven't modeled German armor correctly to represent how weird the Tiger's front armor was, cool. Still haven't fixed American APHE actually not having HE filler, awesome. Oh and the German round velocity still blows, check check. Oh they hit the American mobility yet again, still haven't fixed their armor. And now their biggest strength, air power has to deal with Assault Fuses. On a plane you wouldn't bother dive bombing in. Secret documents showing this is how the real war went? Huh, that's interesting. Why doesn't the T34's engine explode as often and why does it take multiple HE direct hits to track tanks? Well.. alright we'll roll with that. Huh, that crew hatch deflected an AP shell at 70 meters, that's new...tl;dr - World of Tanks more accurately modeled the guns in their arcade game than Gaijin did in Realistic. Go play Aces High II if you want a realistic game and go play World of Tanks if you want a better tank arcade game.			"

												Even though I am strongly addicted to the game, it's ridiculous the amount of time and efort, maybe even money you have to put in before you actually start having fun. The devs don't care about you, or the game. They want money. Don't buy premium. OVERPRICED BS. Reasearching one tank that might require 6,000 RP (research points) will take you about 7-8 games. Even if you do really well in a game, say like 8 kills, you'll barely get 1,000 RP. The game is way too damn grindy. It's annoying. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced. Russians dominate tanks. 3 things that would change this review: 1. A balanced update. Not making eveything equal, but not making everything so damn Op and everything else with paper armour. 2. The RP system and researching tanks needs to buffed like hell. It is way too slow and frustrating especially for German tanks. 3. Primium is way too over priced. Want a year subscription? $120. F THAT. $5 a month. $50-$60 a year. I WILL BUY IT and so will many others. Also don't make it where you need to buy premium currency to buy a premium account. That's ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. This game has so much potential and is probably one of the best WWII game sout right now, but the people behind it are money cows and wasting that potential. The game is slowly dying. All that's gonna be left are the rich people that have everything unlocked and will just demolish you, therefore leaving the game unplayable. Fix it, or in 2 years there will be no War Thunder.			"

												after writing a couple of reviews about this game i wanna write a last one, without hatred this time.the game CAN be amazing, if you dont experience armor bugs (or bugs in general) and if you play in fair teams (which means that the playerskills are balanced between teams AND your tank/plane is not extremely underpowered compared to the enemies ones [tiger 1 vs tiger 2 for example, which just simply sucks big time]). some 1944 jagdtiger fighting tanks with up to 400mm pen and rockettanks from the cold war is also SO MUCH FUN. BUT, it does barely happen.. which leads to frustrating matches. the game was almost always awesome back in the days when there were only german and russian tanks available and no planes available in the groundforces. tiger 1 vs kv85, is1, t34/85 was just AMAZING. sadly its gone forever. now you are often plagued with stupid tank designs, prototypes and the worst thing: horrible matchmaking OR: if you are doing well, even if you get outnumbered a lot and you still manage to surive, you may get hit by some stupid bomber - GG. graphics got actually worse (surprisingly) which is another big let-down. (look at my response in the comments)i almost forgot it: this game has the worst forum mods ever. post some jokes about italians and feel the ban)))overall i cant, and dont even want to, give this game a positive rating. fix your crap, gayjin.i actually returned to bug thunder since this mod is simply amazing and it makes the game much better: http://www.moddb.com/mods/b0riss-sound-modin this video you can see the bugs and stupid things usually appearing in every single game:

												Almost 400 hours on record and I've been in this thing since the beta for ground forces. Warthunder used to be my favorite game. It was a refreshing battle system that favored the skilled tanker over the one in the better tank. I've killed T-34s and T-28s with a PzII. If you know where to shoot you'd usually be fine. If you get killed it's genuinely because the other guy was better. Or you weren't careful enough.That's what I said three years ago. Today? It...looks nice. Some of the most meticulously detailed vehicles I've ever seen in a WWII game. They sound fantastic. The way the treads move. The recoil of the guns kicking up dirt and dust. That's all I have to say that's positive though. It's become clear that the devs want Russian tanks and planes to be the best. To the point they're giving the IS2 rounds it never had to fight a tank it's already a match for. Russian shells having increased chances to set fires, detonate ammo racks and increased fragments compared to their British, American and German counterparts. Shermans having a higher probability of catching fire and having ammo rack detonations despite wet stowage and historically low burn rates. T-34s shrugging off 50mm cannons and 75mm's at ranges where it historically would have killed them frontally. This isn't a WWII tank game. This is a bunch of idiot children screaming in the sandbox that  NUH UH. WE'RE TOTALLY BETTER THAN YOU...J-JUST COZ! WE SAY SO. Used to be balanced. Used to be fair. Used to be an accurate representation. But not anymore. Don't play it. You'll get a better historical representation out of World of Tanks than this game.			"

												Every single update, Gaijin breaks the game more and more. Ask anyone with many hours in the game, and that's what they'll tell you. Every once in a great while, I come back to the game to see its current state, and oh boy, to no surprise, they ruin it up every single time. It's always something. It's always a broken flight model or damage model that stays broken for years, but conveniently, the developer's country of origin will always have the most cutting edge, despite having garbage heaps in WWII. Their newest system, their blackout system from excessive geforce, likes to black your pilot out by just flying in a straight line. Hit detection is garbage, you cannot select the game mode, PS4 players are in the mix with their horrid network cards, so you'll have B-25s teleporting behind fighters and killing them, and it's very pay-to-win. You can buy foliage to camouflage yourself with, you can outright buy planes and tanks, and often times, those pay-to-win tanks and planes will have a lower battle rating than their legitimate counterparts.If you want a game like this, sadly, everything else fails to come close. Even more unfortunate is that this very game fails to compare to what it used to be in 2013. Every single update ends up doing something wrong.UPDATE: Now nominated for The ""Most Disappointing Developers"" Award.			"

												It is pretty hard to give this game a solid yes or no considering there is a lot to love AND to hate about this game.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Realistic, World of Tanks doesn't even come close to this level of realism- Lots of different vehicles- Well-optimised- Not as pay to win as one might thinkCons:- Technically speaking however: it is pay to win- Average toxic free to play community- Unlocking tanks can be a real grind- Game developers don't know what creating and maintaining a community is			"

												                    I hate you Gaijin.. you greedy b******.  Imgaine this game for $40-80 dollars and the grind is much.. much less. I like this game a lot not because its good but because there is NO other game like this, its a monopoly honestly, I want a WW2 tank game that looks and runs well, there is no other games like it, so you have to deal with Gaijin.                    Its sad that the gaming library is turning into a bunch of greedy ""money only"" companies.. I would pay 100 dollars for this game to just make the game a game and not f2p garrbage. Now if you want to pay your way through and pass the grind, by the way the grind will take monthS to go through, you will be paying hundred and hundred of dollars were talking 1000 dollars worth of F2P microtransactions...                    But some people like the grind and others don't, I bet if you made two war thunders: One just like this one, a free to play HEAVY grinding game and then you made another that was like battlefield 3 grinding but cost 60 dollars, I bet you people would like the battfield 3 grinding and 60 dollar version better.             Listen if your a game dev and you wanna make some money make a WW2 Tank game, if you make it good people will come, right now Gaijin rules this game market for this type of genre, I promise you if you just clone this game and make the grind less and fix a few things and put a 40-60 price tag on it, no one would play war thunder for the tanks at least.

												WHEN WAS WAR THUNDER FUN AND PLAYABLEI have played this game for nearly 3 years and i am done with it. I started playing when tanks didnt exist and planes were only feature of this game. It was fun, we had 20 tier system, no stupid BR system, yes German planes were OP in that time, but havent met them every battle. Game was balanced except German planes were overperforming as i wrote. Then came BR system which worked in first few monts even in CBT of Tanks, but then when tanks came out strange things started to happen, but it wasnt that bad as its now. In first year the russian tanks was heavily underpower. Then came patch that make game playable on both sides for nearly half of the year. US tanks beta was full of new things, mainly US tanks offcourse, Shermans were amazing, they wasnt OP as many players cried because they aimed for turret and not for hull. FALL OF THE GAMEAnd now begins my critic: Gaijin nerfed US 76 mm and 90 cannons to ground, WTF is that you cant kill Panther to hull with 90 mm APBC? Russian tanks began to be massively overperfoming only in cannons, and not in armor, you could kill them easily. And now am I in year 2015 and MASSIVELY STUPID APCR NERF AND SCLOPED ARMOR BUFF. After this STUPID PATCH soviet tanks began to be massively OP in arnament and bull..... armor. T34 once bounced my KWK 36 APCR, really? I dont need to write about useless British tanks, their repair cost and their useless ammo. And i cant forget about MASSIVELY TOXIC COMMUNITY ON FORUMS, which are brainwashed and they dont take any arguments, even if there are true. I got ban by nearly nazi moderator because i very bravely saying true about the game.I understand that Gaijin cant make everybody happy, but clearly Russian Bias is stupid, it seems like Gaijin has Putin´s pistol near head and they cant nerf russian tanks. Gaijin is trying to make players happy by making premium tanks, thats STUPID and it will make many players to leave, not to come. CONCLUSIONDont start to play this game, its NOT WORTH IT in its currect state, maybe it will be fun in first tier, but you will very fast see how is game broken.			"

												Took a long break from warthunder after playing non-stop for a fair amount of time since the game went from fun to ""i hate myself"" after a while. So i decided to give some of the games compeitiors a go (wows, wot ect). I played alot of that before returning to warthunder to try again and was greeted with a new line of tanks. I gave these a go but i couldnt shake that nagging feeling of discontent with the game. It was mostly small things such as the really buggy tank physics which havent changed at all in the 5-6 months i was away, the fact that players with lower settings were at an advantage ect. I would recomed staying away, especially the tank side of things.TL/DR; took a break from game to come back and remember why i took a break.			"

												This game back in the day was an amazing simulator and arcade combat experience. However after a year and a half of gameplay from their original launcher (2009-1010) i began to notice a trend of ""small"" patches, which seemed unusual, but i pushed them aside.... I switched over to Steam to track how long i played the game (downloaded it from here about 2 years ago), and i've noticed my times on the game per day have been steadily decreasing from the lack of ability to deal with the crap they continue to shovel down our throat as players.Pro-... no, i'm not going to bother with this. There are no pros anymore. The first thing i can't stand is their way of ""sales""... i'm sorry, i bought the Ace pack when it was 39.99  (flat, no sale) and then they INCREASED the base price 3 weeks later to do a 40% sale, so now instead of it being 40 bucks it's 50 without a sale. That's NOT a sale, that's inflation. I'm sorry but you don't Con your players like that. That's flat out rude no matter what your explination is to doing it.Second, the nation bias is absolutely appalling! I've NEVER heard of biplanes carrying late-war era Shvak cannons all because ""They'd be underpowered against the other nations"" yet you have the audacity to nerf bomber strength (armor and gun accuracy/gunner count and this is being linked to all of them not just one before you proclaim i'm saying something out of context) for the Wellington, Mitchell, Flying Fortress and the Super Fortress, give the Ishaks and Yaks insane handling ability and ramming survival and make the early-game completely lopsided to the russian airforce! Which, mind you, was KNOWN for having several crippling errors such as weak frames, crap peashooters that broke down at the slightest jerking of the aerilons and were known to stall at low altitudes due to how the fuel intake was situated within the frame.Thirdly: The german and american tanks were instantly smashed for their armor ratings both realistic and arcade (arcade is understandable), while the Russians get armored MBT'S from the late stages of the 60's into the early stages of the 90's!? (T-54 models) You're literally making this game so difficult to grind other vehicles that you're pushing people TOWARDS other games.Fourth: speaking of 1960-1990, now you're bringing in new planes which is awesome, however, the planes your bringing in have nothing to do with the era of planes from the other nations. If you're so intent on bringing in RUSSIAN early 20th century jets, where the hell is the 1990's prototype Warthog attacker for the American side? Instead what do we see? Some snazzy one-shot P-51 remakes and a twin fuselage german prop plane that is a flying matchbox. GG gaijin.Fifth, and most important: Your communication with the public is TERRIBLE. You speak like you own the world, then toss us, your customers and players, aside to support the kiddies who have their parents' credit cards while many of us put forward suggestions that can support the growth of this game as a whole. (such as support for using ALL your tanks in arcade, the removal of planes in arcade tank battles which would make spawn killing less detrimental and the increase of tank map size so that people aren't able to shoot from one spawn to the other for an instant kill. This is just Arcade issues. I can go into much worse conversation about the hell of the ""magic armor"" of the T-34 in realistic battles surviving multiple BLACK impact shots from Tigers and Tiger II's of various models (8,8, 10,5, 7,5, 105mm derp on the M4, short 8,8 on the PZ IV and so forth) yet they're able to pen the top front plate of practically all tanks it faces and igniting a fire or ammo rack when it turns YELLOW, leaving you completely wrecked compared to a tank that in historical records *struggled for months* against those tanks when facing headon due to their out dated ammo types and low velocity guns.Your chat mods are also extremely one-sided. They let slip the slander upon America involving russian chatter but the MOMENT someone speaks ill of Russia they get chat banned! The moment they complain about the russian tech being biased, or the moment they are approached with fixes to failed coding that didn't get updated in nearly 7 years, REAL CODERS TRYING TO HELP YOU! They ban them! like they're the plague!You don't read tickets with thoughtful support, and if you do you only nit-pick problems that are given to you so you can blame the customer's computer (no matter how fancy it may or may not be) And if the computer checks out you blame the internet provider! YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT ANY BROKEN FORM OF YOUR GAME EXISTISTING.But i digress, You intentions are clear, you're not here for your customers, you're not here for your players. you're here for Russia. And for the ability to slander ALL countries out-right to give you that ""we reign supreme"" nationalistic pride that you would no doubt rip into ANY company not associated with russian communication/historical ""records"" (and have on Armored Warfare already from the look of their forums when i see russian chatter on there and in-game)In otherwords? I HIGHLY SUGGEST to all new players thinking of this game, AVOID IT AT ALL COST. The only reason i even look at this game once every 4-5 weeks is because i spent money on this game i refuse to let go without being used  to the best of my ability. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SANITY.			"

												I had to write a review about this game because I have noticed the amount of ♥♥♥♥ this game has been getting lately, and with over 1,000 hours, I feel as if I am more than qualified to do so.Yes, War Thunder is not a perfect game *gasp*, and I too have had my fair share of frustration at times. But when I sit back after a match and think about what I did wrong after being completely ♥♥♥♥ on, nine times out of ten it was my fault. Not angling my armor properly, being impatient and pushing so far up I get surrounded, etc. Thats what I love about this game. When you screw up, it's on you.People are quick to cry wolf on the russian bias. Those people are also the ones who don't angle, flank, and mindlessly take on a heavy tank from the front. This game requires a plethora of skill which you will eventually require through practice and perserverance. Learn your tank/plane! Know your weaknesses and your strengths! This will help you tramendously in any situation. If instant gratification is something you are looking for, there's always COD.Gaijin does a wonderful job updating the game fairly fast, and you can see they really do care about their community. They keep us updated and add new content almost every other month. They also do an excellent job hyping the following updates, giving players something to look forward to in the near future *COUGH COUGH BOATS*Basically if you want me to cut the ♥♥♥♥ and get straight to the point of this review...*Do not play this game if you are easily angered or impatient. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.*If you are new to WT, give it a try for yourself instead of looking at the comments. This community really likes to whine. Don't let the comments plague your experience.Most importantly, have fun, try not to think too much, and I'll see you in the skies!! o7			"

												War Thunder. War Thunder never changes.On august 15th, 2013, someones great great grandfather, who served in the army, wondered when he'd get to go home to his wife and brand new PC which he had never seen to play a WW2 sim. He got his wish when Gaijin released War Thunder, by dropping a download into a non translated Russian page.The gaming community awaited Armageddon, instead, something terrible happened. Gaijin began to make the game not as an accurate sim, but as a source of nearly limitless propaganda. Russians enjoyed luxuries once thought the realm of Soviet WW2 fan fiction. T-34's, LaGG-3s, Mig-17s outclassing whatever they faced. But then, in 2015, people awoke from the euphoria induced dream.Years of imbalance lead to shortages of nearly every major resource. The entire community unraveled. Fun became a distant memory.It is now the year 2016. The community stands on the brink of total annihilation, and i am afraid for myself, my bank account, for my time wasted grinding.Because if my time in the game taught me one thing: it's that War Thunder, War Thunder never changes.

												First question you have to ask yourself: Is this game fun? Can I recommend it for new players? And both questions painfully have to be answered with a big NO!Cancerous piece of ♥♥♥♥♥! Treating paying customers with disrespect. Optimizing the game to fit their supererior russian nationalism worldview while having the most obnoxious and gangster capitalism price policy on steam. You pay gold and you get a stinking pile of crap in return.Playerbase is shrinking.[steamcharts.com] Dont make the mistake to put it on your Hard Drive or even spend one Dime on this blackhole. 7 years of development and the most obnoxious bugs are not fixed. Stop braking german planes damage models so that steel giants now can burn out like paper planes. LMG does nothing to enemy fighters even with the ""best"" icendiary ammo belts. Leveling your gunners does nothing. Matchmaking is so hamfisted its not funny. Nothing is historical nothing is balanced properly. No matter if you play Historical or ""Realistic"" Battles or Arcade Battles. The game modes are sickening bad. The Map design is sickening worse. And the game mechanics are utterly broken. Its a simulator , right a simulator of how much a game company can abuse its playerbase and customers and laugh at history and realism and moste of all the core of a game fun and great teamwork. Everything is designed to ♥♥♥♥ you over. I wish there was a refund option for Golden Eagles and Bundles bought on gaijin page. The player base is cancerous and the program itself is just a frustrating pile of bits occupying your precious hard drive space.Its a grind fest and they publish a new tank or plane model almost everyday to sell to your for your virtual glas cabinet. If I had know that before. Id rather invested my time into buying and making/building real models in real life. As I did with my small Star Wars Lego Collection.			"

												One of the best games out there - 2 years ago.Unfortunately, the development company (Gaijin Entertainment) have made some poor decisions over the past couple of years, and the game is now an awkward mish-mash of parts that don't quite work properly, leaving the overall game to be frustrating and unenjoyable to play.Instead of taking simple, effective action against these problems, Gaijin come up with these needlessly overcomplicated ideas, which when implemented into the game fix one problem but cause two more.If you start playing it now, you may have some fun, but you'll quickly become bored and frustrated. Maybe in the future the game will be fun again, but with each passing month that hope grows smaller.			"

												Ah.. War Thunder Review time I guess.Let me go ahead and state, if your a fanboy, I dont care. Your opinion means nothing to me, simply because your opinion is tainted because it could be your ""favorite"" or you really ""enjoy"" this game, therefore keep it too yourself or do a review yourself.This game is not fun in the long run, compared to World of Tanks, the only thing this one has that World of Tanks doesnt, is it isnt a silly tank shooter. I dont care for the planes, simply because, I found it boring to fly around, press M1 over and over or hold it down, until finally your shots actually do something of use other then sparking on the person, or shooting the center gear leg or fuel tanks causing a fuel leak. I had tons of funs in Ground Forces though, Until you start playing every single faction there is, and start to see the reason why you see more of some factions and some of others. This game has no actual form of Balance, and in its attempt to try and keep things balance, and adding realistic stuff too it, they made some things completely unfun to play, while others are so brain dead you can just just toward people, bouncing shells off left and right as people try to pen you.Now, I enjoyed this game. I managed to get a good friend to play, he however left because the game was unfair for him, I ignored it and thought it was just him actting up. I regret not listening too him, after the whole ""cool factor"" of the game wears off, you start to see the problems. Lets start off with Gameplay first.Gameplay: Though it is fun, has a ton of problems, the game doesnt prepare you for anything, because of how the game Progresses, at first you start off as Reserves vs Reserves, which is the starting tanks. This is completely pointless to talk about, because its the most basic of the game, point and shoot, you will most likely kill anything you just shot at, or badly damage them, BUT even at this Tier, yous tart to see the real problems, Because of how the game BR system works, even though you only have 2 tanks, their both 1.0 and require a bit of knowledge to beat higher BR tanks, the game is completely fine with putting you up against these tanks, Often. This is called Uptiered, and its the most annoying thing to happen too you, at any point in the game, because you are fighting against tanks who are actaully better then yours, in any way possible, this of course only if the tank driver can use the tank, but they still get a advantage wtih either, better gun, or better armor, or faster etc etc. Im not even going to talk about Downtiered, because its just basically swinging a club at baby seals at this point. The game shooting Machinics are simple, aim at a spot on a tank, and shoot, if it pens, it hits something, if it doesnt, well it doesnt, too kill a tank in this game, you either kill all their crew, or blow up thier ammo, which requires aimming (For some tanks, ill get too that later), and this is where you start killing the Major problems of this game. Four out of the now Five factions to play Ground Forces, are easy to play. each one giving you HE filler AP rounds, made to pen the tank then blow up and kill damn near anything in the tank, these tanks are what will kill you the most often, because their the easiest to play. Russians have slopped armor with fast moving tanks, allowing even their thin armored tanks to just put themselves into a Angle and bounce shells. Germans have ""Nuke-Rounds"" even at lower tierss, alot of the German tanks, just instantly kill anything you can pentrate, Same with Americans. now Japanese and British is where alot of suffering of the game happens. British tanks Feature fast reloading gun, fast tanks, good moblity (not when backing up) and their guns are extramely good at pentrating, however since British tanks didnt field HE filler rounds in the world, they lack them in the game, actually they dont have anything (expect for the recently added Sherman 2, thats basically M4A1 Sherman put into British line), This makes British one of the most annoying factions to actually kill tanks in, Because Armor Piecing rounds, with no HE fillers is what the British used in real life, in the game.. none of the reason why the British used said rounds, are at all shown, Since you can repair your tank, This also makes it so you have to snipe every single crew or 2 crew in the tank, or try to cause a their ammo to blow up, meanwhile most of the british tanks, cant take a single shot, and will mostly die in a single hit. Japanese have very little armor on their tanks, very small pentration with their guns, and very little HE filler starting out, later on they get up too the same ground as, Americans, Germans, Russians.Now Progression in this game, is low, its a grind while playing matches to unlock a new tank... however once you unlock the tank, you have too use the tank, in order to unlock mods, IE different ammo, REPAIR KIT, or ability to put out fires, all of which shouldnt be a thing, without the repair kit, if your cannon barrel or cannon breach is broke, you cant repair it unless you go too a cap point, Fires will kill you without the ability to put them out, and its a slow and annoying death and will happen alot since you only get 2 charges of it anyway. Luckly the game is nice enough to let you repair your tracks without the repair kit.Im not even going to touch the ""Pay to get"" tanks, because the fact you can buy them and get all the mod for them, already says why their there, its just a massive money grab too get a tank, you cant unlock.All and All, No I wouldnt recommend anyone to get this game, and if you do, too never spent money on it, I have, and I regretted it.

A mixed bag if I ever saw oneOn the one hand it's kinda fun, on the other hand it kinda sucks.On the one hand I enjoyed myself, on the other hand I felt like I utterly wasted my time and the fact that I have played almost 30 hours of War Thunder (so far) tells me I should really get my life back on track.The game is immensely unbalanced and the much maligned russian bias is definitely real, hence your experience will oscillate cheerfully between fun and total frustration. Also there's the grinding aspect. There's more grind here than at a Napalm Death concert. Everytime you upgraded your spaceship of choice (don't tell me they handle like airplanes) to gain a slight advance you continue to squash your frontal lobe into some kind of gooey mush while trying to repeatedly break the grind wall. So, what do you have gain from this practice? Well, you get slightly better equipment which you use to grind to get better planes which you use to grind to get better equipment for that plane and so forth. It's tedious but absorbing, I completely understand how people can rack up hundreds and thousands of hours in this game. The monotony is strangely addicting, it's like getting a drug habit and like with any serious addiction you're gonna take it as far as you can go. I cannot even judge the fans and addicts, I completely understand it, but for me in the end the tedium won. The progression is so slow and meaningless I cannot take it anymore. I also take issue with the flight model in war thunder. In the arcade modes it doesn't feel like you're remotely on planet earth, in realistic and simulation modes it feels like you're balancing a broomstick on the palm of your hand.			"

												Time to post my review I guess.I used to play WT non stop, I loved it. But something happened in 2016. It just became unplayable for me. I was up tiered constantly fighting tanks and planes I had no hope of dealing with. The grind became so bad I just gave up on tier 4. And the ♥♥♥♥ing russian bias was so apparent it was almost funny.WT is nothing short of the prime example of a love/hate relationship. I love the gameplay and what is strived to be. But all its underlying issues and Gaijin not giving a damn to fix them makes me hate it.The community is the worst I have seen, balance doesnt exist, grind is unbearable and dont get me started on Gaijin.net.In its current state I give it a 3/10. It used to be a 5, but then malware happened and that WT isnt off Steam for Gaijin.net is incredible.DO NOT get WT, Its not worth your time in its current state and probably will never be worth your time ever again.

												Do not get this game. I´ve played this game for more than 600 hours in ground forces now and I really can´t recommend it at it´s current state.The game itself would be good if there would be more players and a better matchmaking system, the graphics and models are good, also there are no flamers in the community, but letting Tiger 2´s fight against T 54´s and IS3´s + IS4´s when you can´t even TOUCH them in the Tiger frontally is just a joke. Also there is no ""Russian bias"" itself, its just the thing that the Russian tanks are way to undertiered  to fight the Germans Brits or Americans. You have to spend alot of time and money into this game to get some  tanks which are actually fun to drive like Tiger I´s or T34´s. To be honest i hate World of Tanks but since Warthunder doesn´t give a single crap about its community and players you should rather play that instead of Wartunder.			"

												Oh War Thunder, oh War Thunder.  How you have gone astray.  Initially it seemed like quite a nice combat flight simulator, with the revolution that mouse could be used.  As time went on the game devolved into a series of longstanding issues that have not been resolved:1.  The Developers come from a Russian world view.  The map structure, is centered around a Close Air Support (CAS) concept; strategic bombers have markably pitiable splash radii.  Consequently, the majority of USAAF combat takes place at a low altitude where B-17 and B-24 strafe AAA and pillboxes with their .50 cals.2.  Variety for the sake of variation is pointless.  The developers are very keen on adding new planes to the game, some with no differences (Spitfire Mk 22, 24 have the same FM).  The Flight Models are invariably a placeholder (OP/UP) upon a new plane's introduction which borks balance.  Gaijin has a goal of adding more planes, but fails to balance them due to misuse of statistics in determining Battle Rating.3.  Realistic Battles and Simulator are the red-haired stepchild.  If you want a realistic flight simulator, look to IL-2 BoS.  Of late Gaijin has ignored the misuse of Bombers' mouse aim gunners in the mode of Simulator where joystick is all fighters can use.  Attempts by the community to redress this have been suppressed by Gaijin.4.  Gaijin is a very Russian company.  Their relation with the English speaking community is lacking.  Most famously a developer remarked the Me 262 was doing fine fighting F-86 Sabres because it was ""feeling itself at its Battle Rating"".  Attempts by the community to curb the bomber spam in Simulator Battle have been met with denial and suppression.  Gaijin is markedly loathe to admit a mistake on its part (reliance upon an unofficial TAIC is used to balance the N1K Shiden Kai) and forum threads are frequently locked upon criticism.			"

												War Thunder is an Combat Arcade/Simulation Game (Depending on the Mode you choose to Play) Which Features Aircraft and Tanks. (And maybe later Ships) Positive Things. The Game is Fairly Immersive. Its getting you into a Mood and Manages fairly well to maintain it. The Graphics and Details of the Game are currently the Best of the Genre. The Gameplay is Based on Realistic Damage Models rather than using an HP System. The Game allows Mixed Mode between Tanks and Aircraft which makes for an Remarkable Experience. Neutral Things. The Devs Listen to the Community. But unfortunately it usually takes a riot for them to actually change something. And very Often the changes come out way off from what the community hoped for. Content added is for most Part Free and usually you will be able to Play the Game very well without Investing Money. However in exchange the Game is an Horrible Grind that Takes more Time than most People have if they are Working a Fulltime Job. Negative Things. The Event Management is Outright Incompetent and Stubborn to Hell. Despite People being up in Arms about the way Events are Done. They have been Refusing to Change anything. And Repeat the Same Mistakes over and over. By now Many Events are Frequented by less than 10% of the Playerbase and alot of People dont even bother looking into the Event Screen anymore. The Moderation of the Forum is very restrictive. Negative Critics is not Welcome. And if you want to Post some I suggest you pack it in Flowers as much as possible as you will not avoid Infractions otherwise. So if your the Type who doesnt want to talk around stuff you might be better off not Posting Critics in the Forum. One Big Problem with the Game is that the Matchmaking is very Compressed. You will meet Tanks more than 10 Years more Modern than your own in some Cases. And in many Cases you will be met With Enemies you simply cannot Defeat. Worse as some Parts of the Matchmaking are thus not Played. You will either have to Grind around them. Or will constantly Play as an sole Lower Tiered Tank in an very High Tiered Match. The Last and most Persistent Problem in the Game is the Incompetence of the Mission/Map Creators. Which are placing Objectives right next to the Respawn. And Practically Force People into Spawncamping. Which Results in Enemies Spawning onto you while Capturing the Enemy Base. Or People Sitting nicely Hidden 300m behind your Spawn and Killing you without you having any Chance to Fight Back. The by Far Worst Problem however. Is and Stays the Abuse of Low Quality Graphics. Especially in the Realistic Game Modes. There is no Extra Markers on Enemy Ground Forces. This causes an very heavy Interference for Players with High Graphic Quality because they see alot more Bushes, Trees, Grass and Objects than Players with a Low Graphic Setting which thanks to this will see Tanks much easier especially in Cities Forested Areas. Right now my Judgement on this Game (Pls note the Date of this Review as things might change for better or for worse in the Future) is thatAir Forces AB is Fairly Playable and Enjoyable given you want Fast Action. Air Forces RB is Very Good with Minor Problems. Air Forces SB is Nice in General but its nothing for True Simulation Players. Ground Forces AB I got no Idea as I never really Played it Ground Forces RB Is currently outright Unplayable thanks to the Incompetence and Stubborness of the Devs. Ground Forces SB is Fairly Playable but very Limited as you cannot choose which Tanks you want to Play. So I as an Ground Forces Player will not Recommend the Game.If your more into Air Forces I suggest you take a look at it tough :) Well in the End you need to Check for yourself anyways. And its Free so Give it a Try.Just Expect to be Frustrated alot on stuff if your getting into it some Further.			"

This game is beautiful and has fantastic physics, But this is a combat game and requires alot more effort than that.The devs are Completely clueless on retaining players and have no idea on how to effectively balance the hundreds of planes in this game despite the dozens of attemps to help from the community. gaijin absolutely refuses to listen with a vengance, and wont tolerate any negative publicity.the story of war thunder is a sad tale, doomed to be repeated by the countless F2P games that will never go away, we all hoped this one would be different, but corruption is a resilent foe, and war thunder fell victim.this game is only alive thanks to its exeptional premise and constant influx of new players, but make no mistake, this game has been forsaken and no savior is in sight.

												Started playing back in 2013 waiting for the tanks part of the game and found the plane part actually pretty fun at first.When tanks came it was quite a ""diamond in the rough"" some bugs but good potential.Now more than a year later things on both planes and tanks have gone for the worse, high tier balance is not existant anymore since the recent patch. Another things is the slightly lingering russian preference in early/mid tier planes and mid/late tier tanks.Example: T34 wreaking havock for half a year now and totaly stomping since 3 months, the few changes they made, changed nothing, still rolling around with 95% winrate in RB, because obvously all german and US players are bad players.

												Nothing worse than wasted potential...EDIT: While at the time of the original review the Pay to Win model wasnt so much an issue, it's grown to be a real problem. Those that are willing to spend the extra cash can quickly pad their line up of tanks and planes to include prototypes that never really saw action but are immensely powerful, duplicates of already top of the line tanks/aircraft, and 'premium' content like rocket launchers that are at lower levels exclusive to those who pay. some of these premium tanks/planes fill holes inbetween various teirs and making jumping to the next level without them incredibly difficult. This is far more noticable playing tanks, as all aircraft are generally flimsy enough to be destroyed by aircarft of any level. On the face of it War Thunder has a lot going for it. three modes of play for those looking for the hardcore cockpit only view flight sim with excellent physics, to the more casual pick up and play arcade sim, and even a middle ground. the graphics are top notch not just for a free game but any flight sim out there. the playerbase is fairly large. the ever expanding list of planes, and now tanks! to fly and drive. most impressively it strays from the pay to win (P2W) model and is an exceptional free game where 90% of content can theoretically be unlocked by playing for free, those few premium aircraft or tanks are not super powered and give no additional benefit to those that buy them and some can even be won through in game events.however...this game more than any other seems to have incredibly horrific balancing issues. planes and tanks from vastly different era's will come into contact with each other through a convoluted and completely broken matchmaker that uses a form of ratings to determine a planes effectivness (most noteably the fact that if you fly a ME 262 you can expect to see more Mig's and Sabers than B-17's and P51's). some planes are unflyable due to the fact they will be put in situations where they are laughably outmatched in nearly every aspect (looking at you japan), and worse some duplicate planes like the typhoon and early ME-109's will have different ratings despite being the same aircraft...The grind...oh the grind...the game roughly splits up aircraft and tanks into one of 5 catagories roughly equating to era, you start with late 1930's tanks and aircraft and through play (or payment) earn new aircraft/tanks by playing and earning points. now this works great with levels 1-3, but after that, without sinking money or an insane amount time dont expect to be playing with jets or late war panther tanks. (ive played 500+ hours with some premium time, which effectively doubles your research point rate, and while i have all catagory 4 aircraft for most nations and a good amount of tanks ranks 1-4, i am nowhere near a consistent line of jets or post-war tanks) TL;DR Version - The game has noteable flaws but a lot of potential and a large playerbase. its free and wont be a waste of your time to give it a shot, but dont expect a perfectly polished game			"

												Gaijin is determined to destroy this game completely. They have for a long, long time had very strange ideas especially when it comes to balancing the game. Their system for the relative matchmaking between vehicles (their ""Battle Rating"") is only initially based on expected performance, and is then ONLY based on player statistics. If players do bad in a plane it means the plane is bad and should get lower BR to get easier opponents, with absolutely zero investigation into WHY the plane does bad.Couple that with strange ideas like low graphics quality completely removing some graphical entities from tank battles (like some types of bushes) and the CEO effectively insulting anyone that thinks it is a bad system to not make the world representation at least have the same objects rendered in different quality of graphics and you are in for a fun time.Their interaction with the community is basically to tell us to give feedback, and then completely ignoring absolutely everything that's said. At the odd occasion that they don't completely ignore it they just completely misinterpret it and destroy the game that way instead.It is tragic that the above happens, because the game's ENGINE is excellent, and the game has an enormous potential, but the management at Gaijin is so incompetent that calling them ""monkeys"" is an insult to actual monkeys worldwide.Gaijin doesn't treat this as a game. They are simply milking it on money for all they're worth, and seem to treat it more as a test-bed for developing a game engine. How fun the game is is completely irrelevant as the code works on a technical level.There is no question about if they'll ever get the game on its feet. The only question is ""How long can you put up with the growing mountain of ♥♥♥♥ before you leave?""			"

												This game needs serious match making rework. After the first day matches are extremely unbalanced. You'll take your tier 1 tanks or maybe your first tier 2 tank into battle excited for combat, only to realize you're facing late tier 2 or maybe even tier 3 tanks that you can't damage at all!Why is this happening? Because the devs have decided to impliment this incredible ""battle rating"" system without telling anyone it was coming or even explaining why it was needed.You know that old saying if it's not broken don't fix it? Derp!So how this works is it takes your top three tanks in your load out, does some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ math with them, then poops out your battle rating. This is supposed to help in matching you to people with a similar ranked load out, but it doesn't work at all!That's right, Gaijin has put this system into works and it does the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it was intended.So I did a little research to find out what this battle rating garbage is all about.Overall BR = A/2+B/4+C/4 Overall BR = (6.0 / 2) + (5.7 / 4) + (5.4 / 4) = 5.775 Then it rounds your value UP to the next bracket.That's from the wiki page.http://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=Battle_ratingsHowever when you actually get into a game and look at the player's ratings, you'll notice that you're is maybe a 2.7 with a few 2.3.. But then look over at the other team and it's 4.7, 3.7, 3.7 for their entire team, save maybe one or two.What does that mean?Tier 1 units are typically between 1.0-2.0 BRTier 2 are 2.3-3.7Tier 3 3.7-4+There are a few exceptions but generally that's how it works. So when you look at your BR with everything 2.3 or less, then the enemy BR is all 4.0+ you are not going to win, period!Many variations of turn speeds, fire rates, ammo types available, penetration on ammo, armor,  ect goes into the different tiers. So when you have a tier 1 tank fighting a late-tier 2 tank or even a tier 3, your armor penetration on ammo simply isn't high enough to deal any real damage. Your only hope is to use extremely high penetration ammo (which still most likely will bounce off) and pray you hit something vital.However, here is the fun part, the high tier enemies don't need to worry about aiming or using good ammo to wipe you out quickly. It's point-click-dead for you. In air battles, they will turn faster, fly faster, have more ammunition, shoot faster, do everything possible better than you.You may be able to get lucky and find someone as out-matched as you are and kill them before a high tier wipes your face in the dirt giggling, but typically you will be obliterated within seconds of spawning.This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have such a wide range of tiers it places into every battle. For example, some of the final tier 1 tanks can compete with tier 2 tanks.. Not all of them can but some can. However, they can't do much of anything against a tier 3 tank. Even if you are the most elite pro sniper you are still at a massive disadvantage because you must use pin point accuracy to inflict any damage at all, then the damage is very minor. All your enemy has to do it hit you anywhere at all with basic ammunition and you're done in one hit.This is by far the worst aspect of this game and completely ruins the multiplayer PVP aspect. Other than this the game is fantastic and I would recommend it. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to never see one of this awful matches. But there is no way I can give this game a thumbs up when it allows vets to prey on complete noobs. (Yes you can be in the starter tank and fight T2-T3 tanks every single match, that happens a lot)But then there's also the spawn camping. Oh yes! This game is also 50% spawn camping. Most maps are designed so that the teams can instantly begin shooting at each other from spawn, or only have to move a little bit to fire directly into enemy spawn points. A lot of the maps have hills off to the sides that tanks can perch on then snipe everything in the map with ease, once these hills are taken it's impossible to compete. The horrible part about this is usually one team spawns on or right beside one of these incredible tactical positions and begins dominating your team in spawn or just out of spawn soon after the match begins. There is nothing more disappointing then spawning 3 times only to be killed instantly without even being able to fire a single shot. This game has zero spawn protection and in most cases players rush to get into the easier spawn camping spots, then it's game over. Until this is fixed I'd say don't waste time on this game. Many of it's players are quitting and going to other games because of Gaijin's horrible decision making and failure to listen to it's players.On top of all that the community doesn't do much to help out new people and is infact encouraged to prey on them. You'll notice during your first few matches how some of the enemy team are level 20 generals running around in noob tanks with maxed out crews (Its easy for them to rack up kills and get huge points for doing it!). If you're lucky to avoid that, then once you get your first few tanks you will most definitely realize the unbalance of this game's match making. Try your best to get those high tier tanks/planes but you will -always- be pitched against higher level tanks/planes and players without any mercy.			"

												They have a good game here. I say that as someone who's played for what is honestly years now, starting all the way back in 1.27. Has the game worn on me a little? Most likely, but what I think has happened is Gaijin saw money and got greedy. Progression is my main complaint. The progression way back when I started playing was nice. You'd play for a week and unlock a plane or two and you'd have something new to play with. With patch 1.37 they changed the entire progression model, claiming you'd be able to get down the line faster than ever. That was a lie. Now you could play an entire month and would maybe unlock a single aircraft. Then it got worse. Gaijin slowly reduced the experience you recieved from your aircraft, upped the experience cost of everything, and charged more for premium vehicles. With every major update, they would put more obstacles in the form of more vehicles, some barely historic. Normally, a game that adds content like that would be great, but when it's used to extend the grind to later tiers it becomes a chore. The progression is a joke now. If you were to start today, you might see a jet in about 18 months. That's a long time to dedicate to what feels like a rapidly declining game.Overall though, the gameplay is still reasonable. For the most part, aircraft fly and fall apart convincingly, and tanks feel properly heavy like they should. It's got a solid core game. The biggest issue is the actual grind, and when a game starts to feel like work is really when you should drop it. Would I pay any more of my hard-earned money to these developers? Probably not, and if I do that time is a long ways away when the game undergoes radical changes. Would I recommend this game? In it's current state, absolutely not.			"

												Well, after sinking quite a few hours into this... I finally came into conclusion:WarThunder is free to play. As in, it is free to roam around the map, and be cannon fodder for overpowered russian biased players (even more if they're paying for premium or premium vehicles). You can drive around in a nice model of Tiger 1 which was no match for any other tank for a good few years, and used to anninhilate every russian t32, in this game this won't be it. You will get upranked and will have to fight ridiculously overpowered (cannon wise, shell wise, movement wise) soviet vehicles. Tbh, even high explosive charges feel to do a lot more damage once you fight for the russians... I'm no expert, but afaik Gaijin is a russian company, hence the bias...Don't get me wrong, I'm far from being bad at this game, I camp around, play the Tiger tactically, get my several kills most of the time, but it is a struggle. Gaining wins in Ralistic Battle? Yeah, right. 1/20 is a win. In Sim battles, it's better, but there aren't that many battles for Tiger1 in sim.And don't even get me started on planes... Did I mention scores of russian speaking players? Not having anything against, but most of the communication is done in russian without asking...What elsee... ooh, lots of spawn camping. You spawn in, bam, right into the back. It seems fair to Gaijin. Cause, you know, russian tanks are fast and nimble, by the time Tigers get to objective, theyre already at our spawn, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone as soon as you spawn in. So if you think you enjoy being shot in ridiculous OP affected ways most of the time - this game is for you. Then again this isn't far away from sadomasohism. "

												Hello All! I am AzureWolf, and this is my review of War Thunder.I began playing War Thunder in early 2014, so you could say I have at least a year of experience. As you probably have noticed, I didn't use this account, or even the account before this one much when I played the game; don't be fooled though. I've spent well over a thousand hours grinding for the much loved planes and tanks (and god knows what else now!) that we have come to love the game for.But I was a pay to win!No, just kidding; although I paid my fair share for premium, and even other bonus vehicles - I played my fair share of game; at least enough to clear a country or two. (In war thunder vehicles are seperated by country! If you didn't know.)And so it was! I was a War Thunderer! Hundreds of kills and thousands of destructions! Oh yes ladies and gents I was the cream of the crop; gunning down even the most skilled pilots with my point-and-click methods. But one day..It happened! My old account was hacked into and used to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of games, including war thunder items, add-ons, and much more! So, in order to keep my credit from plummeting, I had my bank charge steam back for the false purchases. And what happened?I got banned from steam ._. - and so I made this account; luckily I still had War Thunder right? Wrong :cThey took my hours, my hard work, my real earned money, my love for War Thunder; and flushed it away. I am at this moment, permanently banned from War Thunder by the creators Gaijin.Now ladies and gents, I will not lie! This game is one of the best and most fun simulators and arcade battling games there is.. but if you are looking for customer service and loyaltly to you for your hard work (and money!) - you best try elsewhere.

												This game starts out fun but as you get into the high ranks, it starts taking 50 to 75 games to unlock a single tank or plane. Very often two or even three of these tanks or planes are indentical in every way, save the name, meaning you spent 200+/- games trying to advance past them to something new. At the same time you start seeing players who paid real money for tanks that are practically invincible. Suprise, they kill you at will. On top of all this, there is a terrbile bias towards the Russian faction and games are generally one by whichever team has more russian players.			"

												The company who made this game is Russian, and there is huge Russian bias in game. Russian tanks and planes are way stronger than other nations' tanks and planes. What is worse is developers dont care about this. Russian tanks have op ammunition, their armor is very sloped, they have cold war tanks, their fuel tanks and ammo racks rarely explode, their ammo has double chance to cause fire etc.Bomber planes are extremely weak only one bullet is enough to cut the wings. Bombers are almost unplayable on upper tiers.Game has pay to win elements. Premium vehicles, premium account, accelerated crew training all give many advantages in game. There are also annoying bugs in game ( like disconnecting from chat and squad after every battle, no research points after battle bugs) .Game is only recommended if :1- You only play with Russian tanks and planes2- You dont use bombers 3- You dont mind pay to win game system.

												If you want a balanced multiplayer game, look elsewhere.  If you're wondering why my play time is so high with a negative review (well, aside from the fact that a huge chunk of those hours were from me being afk while in the hangar), it's because the game keep going steadily downhill.  In game graphics are the only things improving, everything else (balance, gameplay, balance, pay walls, did I mention balance?) are just getting worse and worse over time.  I'm no longer a regular player like I used to be, I only come back whenever there are major content patches to see if Gaijin finally pulled their heads out of their you-know-where and started listening to their playerbase.  Unfortunately, this is never the case.  Out of 10 matches played, only 1 or 2 would be actually enjoyable.  The rest will have you rage quitting and facepalming over how stupid the game has become.  Such a shame too, it has such great potential.			"

												Ever since the update, the game has gone to crap. Airplanes become paper airplanes with having one to three shots to kill you in the stupidest of moments. The game has an unfair disadvantage. Level 1 tier plane can take down a tier 3 plane within 5 to 10 shots. Amazing. 2 - 3 shots to cut your wing with any type of caliber. The U.S. Airforce might be taking this game as a joke since the B-25's wing can be cut-loose by a tier 1 beginning plane. For god sakes, pictures of bombers coming back home with bullet holes everywhere and my bomber is taken down with 2-3 bullets. A joke of a ""simulated"" game. And a joke to people in the Air Force.I will change my reviews once you guys look up facts, not from Wikipedia, but from actual US/USSR/IJAA/RAF facts.			"

												Before you read this, let me make it clear that I am only talking about ground battles in this review.I consider this game one of the best in its field, mechanics-wise. Graphics are well rounded and can play on even a mediocre PC. It looks absolutely stunning at max details, but it will give you a severe handicap when trying to spot enemy tanks.Now for the bad; The playerbase is absolutely terrible. Roughly half of players in this game do not understand the mechanics and seem too preoccupied with (trying) getting kills and thus tend to ignore the mission at hand, which will ultimately garner you a loss in the end. While the game doesn't reward winners and punish losers like in similar games, it is still quite demoralizing to lose ten or more matches in a row, because your teammates are running around like headless chickens.Another concern is the abundance of russian players on the european servers. They refuse to use english and tend to teamkill you when you don't understand a word of what they're saying. From what I've heard, it is because the russian server is even more toxic to play on, so they go to the european server instead.Russian bias; it exists in the form of favorable battle rating for russian tanks. There is no denying this.Community: The community is congruent to poison and Gaijin is more focused on punishing than listening. It looks like Gaijin is actively trying to sabotage the community and what good is left of it, is slowly fading with each ban.Bugs: A lot of bugs have been introduced over the course of the last two major updates - don't expect to have a good time, as wonky physics, horrible ballistic collision and missing tank interior will ruin your day.Half a year ago I would definitely have recommended this game - not so much any more.Warthunder is slowly turning into a rotting cesspool of biased game design, bugs, horrible player management and blatant disregard of community feedback.TL;DR: Don't get this game, just don't - you will regret it. It will seem fun at first, but then it will suck out your soul and leave your dried salty husk to write bad reviews.			"

												Edit: A new spark of life has been shot into this game. ""Enduring Conflict"". This is a fantastic gamemode that needs to be about on a permanent basis. The match is pretty much 6 hours on a drop in drop out basis. They need to fix the rewarding however as if you do not stay until the end of the match you will not get your rewards, they also need to add a few more objectives but overall it's perfect. You get to respawn as many times as you like in RB or SB and keep flying out your favourite planes from battle rating 2.3 to 4.3 (there are other barackets too). I feel for once gaijiggles have pulled out a golden egg and I cant wait to see it hatch, fingers crossed it's not rotten and it tuns into something grand. WarThunder is a little hit and miss for me, there is no doubt that this is the best game out there for it's genre, but whilst there is nothing to match it the game is plagued with problems within staffing and general game development. Recently the game has been on a decline, from what has been fun is now just beyond a joke. The development team continue to nerf aircraft such as the Mosquito, an aircraft iconic during 1941-1942 for it's excessive speed and maneuverability, it was given the nickname ""the wooden wonder"". However this game doesn't reflect this at all, the aircraft used to fly great however it has been nerfed to the ground so much that it's slow and does not maneuver very well compared to it's historical counterpart, in fact it has been nerfed to the point where the early planes it was built to outrun and outpace can catch it fairly easily, it faces late war prop planes which far exceed the Mosquitos capabilities. This is but one of many planes that have seen nerfs, the fabled Griffon Spitfire? Nerfed, engine HP is greatly reduced, 150 octane fuel removed. F8F Bearcats? Nerfed, Ta-152 and various other german planes? Nerfed, Japanese planes? Nerfed. Russian planes? Buffed.     Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is great but the balancing is terrible. Now the official forums are just a complete and utter **** show. Overly power hungry/mad community moderators and admins handing out bans and warnings to players talking about issues in game, broken planes or any other issues regarding the games development, they will make snide remarks and as soon as you make a retort they will come down on you and claim that you're causing a flame war when anything you say is far from it. I would like to reccomend this game, but the games is beingg ran into the ground by a poor development team and a corrupt band of misfits patrolling the official forums taking away peoples freedom of speech. Slowly but surely Gaijiggles is becoming an Authoritarian company, or maybe it already is.			"

												400 hours in... Honestly, I really liked the game. I loved fighting in WW2 tanks and planes. It was fun at low tiers, and still is pretty fun at said tiers. That's where it is balanced. Higher tiers... don't bother. I'm only higher-tier 3 tanks (GER/SOV) and it's hardly fun anymore. If I can get the drop on someone, then I'm ok, but nothing I do can stand up to Soviet tanks. Being undertiered for every game doesn't help, so me in my Tiger H will end up fighting tanks a whole BR point or more above me. It was like that for planes too (I achieved Tier 4 GER) and Soviets destroyed everything no matter where I went. I nearly stopped playing this a few months ago... may just completely stop now until I see someone on Youtube show that it doesn't suck anymore.			"

												As usual Gaijin keeps driving this deeper and deeper into ♥♥♥♥ territory, with each patch worse than the last.A redditor sums it up nicely.""It's less a testament of that and more a testament to how much people desperately wanted War Thunder to be a good game. Hell, I saw this train wreck 2-3 years ago and stuck for it for a year past the point of ""I don't like where this is going,"" before I stopped playing more and more, finally stopping outright at the ~2.5 year mark.All the while I tried to get the word out as best I could on what was wrong with WT, how it was wrong, why this actually constituted being called ""wrong,"" and possible solutions to fix it.This largely fell on deaf ears because the devs/community representatives/etc (whomsoever it concerns) are too busy being sycophantic, self-serving, ignorant, intent on dazzling the playerbase with smoke and mirrors, and a general disregard for major problems in the operation of the game and its general gameplay.That I stuck around for so long shows just how good War Thunder is at its core. That is, its most basic gameplay is absolutely phenomenal even if it has problems due to imperfect flight models, bad balance choices for tiering in both directions, blatantly improper use of metrics for determining balance, damage models that feel like the devs threw darts at a dart board to determine how strong things were (my favorite being P-47 wings disintegrating to 0.30 caliber shells that the overwhelming majority of planes during WWII were largely immune to except in insanely large quantities measured in hundreds upon hundreds of individual strikes)...the list goes on.But the devs don't care about fixing the actual problems with the game, flat out aren't being told it due to incompetent community representatives for one reason or another, and instead focus on pushing out more buggy, imbalanced, badly designed but gloriously modeled filler instead of spending a couple patches just making the game more fun at the gameplay level. This coupled with the blatant cash grabs that they've done making the game significantly more expensive to accomplish significantly less, and people are finally starting to wise up to those who left before and why, and choosing to leave as well.Or, to put it another way, for them, they just had the final straw put on the camel, and its back is broken.This problem has been a long time coming, and people were desperate for the game to improve, but they're just now giving up. The game could have been that good.But it also shows that the problem takes a very long time for most people to detect, and Gaijin right now is banking on that high turnover rate to stay profitable.The best anyone can do is try to make people just joining the game stay away from it by warning them that it has serious problems, but this feeds back into the first point: The core gameplay is just that good that it masks the absolute failure that is its metagame and mismanagement for significant amounts of time. And until the reviews tank WT, this will continue to be the case."" -Taranok "

												After last changes, I am totally hate this game and did not recommend to play now. Broken damage system, a cheaters and an old bugs. With an each new patch, even worse.When I come here from the other popular tank game, I hope this is the hardcore, more realistic game, about oneshots, marksman skill, tactics. But now It has nothing with realism and historical accuracy, just another arcade game with pretend to be a sim.The balance was never great, but now, when a WWII tanks fight against a Cold War beasts – its absolutely broken.The damage model in current state – is ridiculously unrealistic.That feeling, when you make direct hit with the soviet 122mm AP shell, and an enemy doesnt blow up sometimes… Often, only possible way to make a frag with the HEAT or the APDS – looong killing crew, man by man.And of course, an old bugs doesnt fixes, many cheaters in the game, but when you tell about it, you just get a ban, hard to play without donate at a top tier... Each new patch just add a new models, and a stupid changes, developers doesnt listen community and do not make the game better, do not improve the gameplay, just make a money.P.S. ""We are all just waiting for a similar game so we can drop this one like a dead baby. I can't wait for Gaijin to die honestly. Or at least for them to restructure their dev team. They don't care, they don't listen."" – from the official WT forum.			"

												I enjoyed this game whenI first started it. The problem is when you start getting into the tier 3 ranks of tanks. The armor on the tanks barely make any difference whatsoever. They say the armor is thicker on tanks at the front hull. Well I actually decided to spend a few dollars to complete my first tier 3 Tiger tank and let me just say I regret spending the money. One shot to the front of the hull or anywhere else on the tank will penetrate every time and destroy all of your crew and munitions. This is especially true as I am around level 8 and every tank I come across is 2-3 tiers higher than mine in every battle and severely dimishes the fun of this game for me. Needs better matchups for the games, and so far It's not getting any funner for me.			"

												I supported this game way before Steam, as pre-beta tester. Everything seemed like the future was unlimited. THey have removed all ""simulation"" aspects of the game, they nerfed the historical capabilities to ""balance"" the planes (what's the purpose of tiers if you have to nerf the planes too). They have Tiers where the Me262 is up again Mig 15s, (seriously?)Overall, the game lost all what made it fun, and is full of arcade players that don't care enough because simulation and historical accuracy doesn't matter anymore.Will anyone ever create a good Air, Land, Sea game again?

												To sum up what is being said within the 20,000 reviews is pretty long but in short it goes like this. For people new to this game it is a brillaint second world war arcady flight sim with different styles of play and many different aircraft, later on the game requires a lot of money to actually progress anywhere if you even manage to reach tier 4 out of 5 you will understand what I mean by this, If your not prepered to put money on this game i wouldn't suggest getting your hopes up for it.For people with 400+ hours or those who have played it prior to patch 1.37 we all feel your frustration, the company switched from the all knowing all loved, to the more ""give us your money"". What 1.37 added was different way of proggression from the much more simple 1-20 tier system with 20 being top and 1 being the start it was compressed into only 5 tiers, what was expected was rough boundries eg Tier 4 vs Tier 4 well nope... If you play tier four your more than likely to experiance the wrath of a MiG-15 pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game, still not the worst part thought, both Arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the AI gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life, this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to ""Give me all your money if you want to be good"" the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy (Not to mention unbalanced) aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premiuim account or buy paying to progress. All this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just infront of it (Which comes stock so it's probably worse) The game went downhill from 1.37 flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or you'll slam into an invisible 50ft tree. The games Devs weren't bad people and still aren't they're running a compnay and it seems they need a way to make more money from it, unforunaely this is one of the ways they chose. They used to listen and fix almost all bugs and issues now I think money has taken over a once great game that used to be a brilliant, now instead it is the biggest example of pay to progress.			"

Its so ♥♥♥♥ing bad.Edit as of 12/21/2015: Gijin has though it would be SMART (dumb mother ♥♥♥♥ers) to give the British tanks superior RoF and AP capabilities to the point they can fight all other 3 factions easily and are now the new dominant and OP faction in the game, even more so than the russians in most instances.

												The game seems so good at first glance, almost revolutionary. But it is everything but good.It is really a pain... You play great flight sims like Cliffs Of Dover, Battle Of Stalingrad or Rise of Flight just to find out that the multiplayer servers are ghost towns. Then you try out War Thunder. You are amazed by the graphics, the amount of content and the huge playerbase and it is even free to play!But your amazement doesn't last for long. (1) The ""matchmaking""First you start to realize the matchmaking is more than a little ""off"". Espacially playing the german tech tree is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. If you pay attention and have a little knowledge about these ww2 vehicles you will notice that there is a huge time rift between the planes you are flying as germany and the planes the allied forces fly in the same match. But it doesn't stop there. It isn't just the germans who suffer. -The entire game consists of sealclubbing and getting sealclubbed.-The gamemechanics themselves support this by controlling everything for you by mouseaiming and target markers so that seemingly the only thing that matters is the vehicles performance.At this point you might think: Yes sure, matchmaking is bad, but the game is still in beta, so it will eventually get better after the next patch.No it won't. I'm playing this game for three years now and have invested houndreds of hours into it (didn't play it from steam) and I can tell you it gets worse and worse after each patch. (2) Flight models, ""Realistic Battles"" and ""Simulator Battles""If you are like me and you aren't interested in arcade games you will probably go straight into ""realistic"" or ""simulator"" battles. The problem is, that most of War Thunders player base is concentrated around arcade battles so the other two game modes get less and less attention by the devellopers each patch. They are basically removing content from these gamemodes instead of improoving them. For exemple since one patch that has been released this year ""Realistic Battles"" now have mixed factions. You will fly in an american plane side by side with a japanese one to shoot down germans and brits. That is what they call ""realistic"" now.Same ♥♥♥♥ goes on with the flight models. Almost all flight models in the game are placeholders. Some of them seriously broken. (Just to name two simple examples: With the japanese biplanes you where able to fly up straight into the air without stalling and reaching heights in which the pilot would probably freeze and suffocate. The bf 109 on the other hand gets its combat flaps ripped off when reaching speeds over 300kph)But what does Gaijin do about it? Nothing! Since three years we get in every new patch new vehicles to attract new players and the old flight models remain untouched.(3) The root of all evil. Gaijin itself.The problem with this game is not its engine or its game concept, its the company behind it.Gaijins aim is to make quick money with this game. Moneymaking is nothing bad and every company needs to make money to survive but Gaijin has taken a rout which pisses on its playerbase in the worst possible fashion.How does Gaijin make money? Do you need to pay money to play the game? No. Is it pay to win? Kind of, but thats not the main problem. What is the main problem then?The main problem is, that Gaijin doesn't aim to earn money with long time players, but with players that jump in, get a first glance of the game, are amazed and pay money to get quickly to their favourite vehicles. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will soon realize that they have sunk money into a game that is horrible. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will leave with anger as long as there are new players comming in and paying money to get quicker to their desired vehicles. This is why the game is so bad because the game doesn't need to BE good to earn money, it just needs to LOOK good.(4) Gaijin and the playerbaseAfter all the problems I have listed here I think this is the worst of all. I've allready said, that gaijin just uses new players to milk money out of them, but I think the worst thing is how they are treated afterwards.When people realize the problems with the game they go on the forum and complain about them. The most natural thing to do you would suggest, espacially when you have paid money for game content. Wrong!Even when people reaveal problems in the game in the most modest and friendly way they are are verbally attacked by Gaijins moderators in the worst and most childish manner. Posts and entire threads get deleted, players blocked or banned for simply pointing out problems and Youtubers get threatened for uploading videos criticising the game.Thats Gaijins propaganda machine at work. They don't want the game to look bad for potential players because the potential players are their money base and not the players allready playing the game for a few months.(5) SummaryThere is no game in the world that provokes as much fellings to me as this one. The reason being is that this game had so much potential to be an entry for a complete new generation of players into flight sims. It had so much potential to become something really big and revolutionary. But in the end this dream has been destroyed by the greed of its company: Gaijin.Do not play this game. I've sunk 20€ and probably well over 300 hours into it for nothing but pain, anger and frustration.			"

												War Thunder is a ""free to play"" game where you can either take it to the skies in a variety of different airplanes from different nations (USA, UK, GER, USSR and JAPAN), or you can jump in a rather well modeled and simulated tanks from light tanks to anti-air (USA, UK, GER, USSR). I have quite a lot of hours in to the game and there is a reason for that. I have enjoyed this ""free to play"" game in the past, and I would love to keep playing it but it seems that one of the patches that came out in the last few months, or something else has changed the restock and repair fee amounts in the game. Back when I still played actively you were able to outfit your plane/tank and play the game without worrying whether you had enough credits to pay for the restocking of ammo and repairing it after the match, regardless of the outcome of the match itself. Today I noticed while playing with my Rank III german armor, that even if I managed to kill 1 or 2 enemy tanks in arcade game AND if our team won the match, I lost credits when I came back to my hangar. I had 96k silver lions (credits used to pay for stuff ingame), I lost 3 tanks and managed to destroy 2 and our team won the match. In the after report I saw that I got slightly over 10K silver lion credits from the match but when I returned to the hangar, it showed I had 94.5k left, which means that unless you are super awesome at this game and manage to take all the points and destroy half of the enemy team without dying yourself even once, you won't be getting much anything out of the arcade matches in terms of credits to buy new tanks. This is essentially the same method World of Tanks makes you buy premium and use real money at the end-tier tanks. Without one, you won't be able to afford the repair costs after the match etc. etc. etc.This pretty much saddens me, especially when we aren't even talking about end-tier tanks here in War Thunder, we're talking about Rank III tanks. Because I have no intention of spending any more real money on this game I suppose I will just have to drop it and stop playing. It's already almost impossible to get to IS-2, Tiger 2 and beyond without using real money, and the grind fest from Tiger H1 to Tiger 2 will literally take you months without premium unless you are willing to spend every waking hour playing the tank portion of the game.It was fun War Thunder, maybe I'll come back when you cut the repair/rearm costs between matches and actually give players a change to get to the higher rank tanks without pulling out the old credit card.

												I started a rant but I can't continue it, the game is just not worth the extra words. So you get a no for ruining one of my favorite games. Thanks, Gaijin for some good times and some even worse than bad.   I plan on writing a proper review, I just don't have time. You -could- skip over it and not even read it, like this game does with it's tanks. ""Oh unlock this tank, but if you use it you'll face Korean era end-game content that can pen you from ANY angle -what so ever- and since you can't pen THEM and you're too slow to maneuver around, you just have to bend over and take it!"" So you're better off skipping this tank altogether, Tiger II H for example. Let's not even get into the ammo racks situation. Russian racks don't explode, period, once in a blue moon. German racks explode regardless of ammo-types or where you were penetraded, one stray fragment from AP will set them off. Russian tanks have some miraculous shell-bouncing magic abilities, too, and I can say that as a Russian tank user. that ISU-122 has bounced 88mm to the side of the hull where the ammo is at point blank, many MANY times.Edit: So they announced naval forces. But they've come out saying they likely won't do large ships like battleships because in testing they're too slow and boring and battles would go on far too long or what ever. Well it happens that they've added several new maps lately that are just massive for ground forces. Neat, right? Well when it takes you 7 minutes just to see the first shot get fired, I call absolute 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about battleships being too slow and boring. This whole game is ending up to be just that way, they're just looking for excuses. Furthermore, there's this thing called the KV-220 that was added as a rare 'earnable through agonizing grinding' premium Russian tank. Tigers have trouble penetrating it, and it's faster than the weaksauce KV-85 that everyone else gets. You can't even buy this tank if you wanted an OP monster. Only way you could get it was to nolife ""tasks"" all day every day for a week or what ever. Adding it was a great mistake.			"

												-PREPARE FOR A MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT!-I've had this game for a looooong time, since about patch 1.27 or 1.29 - never really played it then. Which was a massive mistake. I should have played this game every day when I had the time. I didn't, and I'm kicking myself for it. I think that this game should have stayed with the 20-rank system. Let me tell you why.-From what I've seen, overtiering wasn't a problem, as aircraft used to get into matches with others which were at worst 2-3 tiers higher than it.-Gaijin had 20 tiers of unlocks to play with, so putting an aircraft in slightly the wrong tier wasn't a big issue. Nowadays, if Gaijin screw up the battle rating on a plane, that plane becomes infuriating to fly - not that there's anything wrong with the plane, but because the matchmaking it gets is downright unfair. A perfect example of this in action is the low-tier German tech tree.-Expanding on 'overtiering', every plane and tank has its own battle rating. This is how matchmaking works for each of the 5 nations:UK: Fair matchmaking for appropriate aircraft.US: Good matchmaking.Japan: Seems alright, I wouldn't really know.USSR: TROLOLOLOLOL OP MATCHMAKING FOR OP PLANES TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLGermany: Don't even get me started... flying low-tier Germans is PAINFUL. Worst matchmaking, easily.-I have 95 hours on record or thereabouts for this game. It's by far the game I've played most on Steam - 90% of those hours have been spent after patch 1.37 was introduced. My highest tier aircraft is the F4U-1a Corsair, a rank 2 aircraft, and I'm at tier 2 with most other nations, after 85.5hrs played AFTER patch 1.37. If I keep playing this game, I reckon it's going to take me another 200 hours to get my first jets. Grindy, grindy, grindy, grind.-However, Gaijin are taking steps in the right direction to make the grind shorter and more bearable. They've reduced the amount of RP and Lions it takes to research and unlock aircraft and tanks by a large amount. Then they reduced the amount of RP you earn from tank battles. Errrr... not so keen on that, Gaijin.-Gameplay is solid for the vast majority of the time. Despite my lacking skill both in the air and on the ground, I can enjoy myself most of the time whilst playing this game. Maybe it's because I'm interested in WWII combat, maybe it's because I like unlocks.-Most of the planes and tanks you'd expect to be in the game are here.You've got plenty of Bf-109 models, plenty of Fw-190s, He-111s, Do 217s, Spitfires, a few P-47s, a few Mustangs, A6M Zeroes, a G4M1, LaGG-3s, MiG-15s, you get the drill.-The game *should* look gorgeous on max settings. You do need a good computer to run it on max, though, but it should be worth it. I have a cr**py laptop though, so I can't confirm or deny anything.-Money is a problem from what I've heard. I try to always keep as large a sum of money on my account as I can.Overall, the game has its ups and downs, pros and cons, but I think the cons outweigh the pros, especially for your average Joe gamer - someone stuck down at low tiers, enduring idiot players, awful vehicles, what have you. I did say this would be a long read!			"

But all of it is being thrown away.No one knows why the devs are seemingly intentionally destroying their product, no one can stop them (since they don't care about player input), and no one can speak out against them (since the forums are heavily censored).Do not spend your time or money on this game, at least not as it is now.

												2 years ago, this game looked promising, but this is no longer true. Gaijin are the worst devs ever, they ignore the requests of the community and implement things that break the game. Most recently they changed the BR system and MM system, which already compressed the vehicles too much. Now there's vehicles from different genrerations fighting against eachother e.g. Me 262 and Sabre. They have ♥♥♥♥ed up the game so badly and they don't care about the communities reactions. ♥♥♥♥ you Gaijin!Graphics    6/10Realism     2/10Balancing  -10/10			"

												This game was great fun. Realistic-ish tank combat, air combat, ect, it was fun really..Too bad its been spiraling down the drain for a while now.-Total garbage performance/optimization in the updated game engine. This is really sad, was a very pretty good     performance game at one time. Problems persist unadressed for long peroids. When fixxes do come, they often dont actually fix squat. SlI? good luck. AMD crossfire-dont even bother, unplayably broken.-Hystericlly bad customer service. ( half the time mods just troll people asking for help on forums, if the post makes past the mods in the first place,,its pretty funny)-Famous Russian bias. This didnt actually bother me to much, but ya, its like Vladimir Putin coded the game,,,,,while riding a bear with no shirt on. Its a joke.-The grind is REAL. Reapair cost at high teirs cause turtle matches and emty wallets.-Divebombers. A classic example of unballancing mechanics that go unadressed.Pros- the game USED to be the best tank game around.

												Can't say I could recommend it to anyone.I liked it for a while, not gonna lie, but matchmaking makes it difficult to.I never played it for the flight sim aspect, quite simply because it is NOT one. And never will be.War Thunder, however, gave me a base off of which I could rate other games, with regards to things such as quality, graphics, realisticity, and historical accuracy (though textbooks would be a more preferable point of reference for the last one).I put about 700-800 hours on the game so I have a pretty good feel for how it works, and it is likely I will not play it again.But to recapitulate, it was a good and fun game to play in order to get exposed to flight sims, at least in my opinion. Again, I REALLY would not call this game a flight sim, but it gives one a good feel for how they work. For example: I used WT to learn how to use a joystick, and learn a few BFMs on simulator mode.Thank you for reading.TL;DROverall not so good, but if you've got nothing else you can play it for exposure to flight sims.

												If you are reading this, please do not stop. I am a veteran gamer who's been playing WT for over two years, and have invested thousands of hours and a couple hundred dollars into the game. Every single patch for the last year has been a mounting disappointment for me and the community. Just look at the feedback on the official forum or subReddit. Do not be fooled by their shiny graphics & vehicles. By the time you get to the mid-high tier matches you will understand why nearly all of Gaijin's most dedicated consumers have left the game. The developers, TIME and TIME AGAIN have demonstrated that they are INEPT at improving the gameplay. Any attempt to ""fix"" these balancing issues you will encounter as an intermediate player will make the grind EXTREMELY slow and YOU WILL NOT HAVE FUN. Gameplay in every mode (arcade, realistic, simulator) is slowly shrinking into enclaves of people abusing broken game mechanics, such as completely UFO flight models of aircraft that haven't been amended for months, tank shells that won't kill an enemy tank's crew member despite skewering him in the face, anything you can imagine in terms of WTF. Not to mention the recent battle-rating amendments that completely DESTROYED high-tier gameplay. You, new players, once you start getting a couple hundred matches into the game and unlock new tanks, you will come to realize that the developers will NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LISTEN TO YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS, EVEN IF THE GAME IS ENTIRELY BROKEN. Tell me new players, does a first model A6M Zero from 1939, deserve to fight a P47 introduced four years later? The devs certainly think so, and they will tier these two aircraft at almost the SAME battle rating! How about the ME-262, a jet introduced in 1944, routinely fight MiG-15's and F86 sabres from the Korean war? The developers have actually tried to JUSTIFY this, despite these aircraft being WORLDS apart in terms of performance. And now because there are no more players who want to offer themselves as cannon fodder to superior planes, the queing times for these higher-level matches are getting longer, and longer, and longer. Gaijin's solution: lower the Battle-Rating ceiling so that Korean war jets fight WW2 German PROPELLOR-DRIVEN planes, and 1944 tanks fight End-Game Cold War tanks that are virtually impervious to their guns. Forum moderators will shoot down negative posts without reading your feedback. Instead of fixing these ages-old broken game mechanics the developers insist on adding shiny new tanks at prohibitive prices to lure naive, trusting new players like you, and you will regret it. Take my word, I have been on the forums and other social media for years now, and I can tell you with the utmost certainty that the WarThunder playerbase is dying. Slowly, sure, but progressively and steadily. And The only ones to blame are Gaijin and their inept staff. I am almost certain that Warthunder will become a ghost-town before ships are released. I tried to cram as many reasons for YOU to not pick up this pile of garbage that WarThunder has devolved into within the last two years. Take it as you will, but know that you are funding a HYPOCRITICAL, CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT, and GREED-DRIVEN company that does not care an OUNCE about what you think. Don't wait until you wasted a couple dozen hours into the grind, only to discover what the rest of the veterans already know. Trust me. My screen-name is cdahdude5, and if you really are curious to see how much time I've invested in this game go here and search my name: http://thunderskill.com/Gaijin's playerbase was already shrinking, but this last patch of theirs is the nail in the coffin. Their losses are too great now, and I am highly pessimistic that the Gaijin staff will somehow save the game, and actually LISTEN to what their players have to say. Jesus coming back to Earth is more likely at this point.			"

Never have to play the same.Easy ways to gain the big boi currency; Golden Eagles.Well-made weaponry with varying velocity and penetration values.No hit points for tanks/planes.Is not World of Tanks.Cons:ATGM's.Tier 5 is unplayable.

Up.Gaijin needs to grow up too... 12+? Are you serious?No infantry.No blood.No gore.No crews screaming for their lives.No realism in Realistic Battles. Just modified specs.Pay2play tanks/planes are overpowered not because they are 'overpowered', but because they are easy power grinds over normal vehicles hence the name 'Pay2play'.Ignorant dev team.Bias.America doesn't get a break from all the bs. Worst lineup in the whole game (before Japan) and still no RP/SL buffs. They are JUST NOW adding in more stuff for the US but counterbalancing it with more overpowered tanks/planes for other nations.Trolls. Lots of trolls.Almost everyone in-game is a fan of Germany. Just love supporting their mans hitlah.Russia gets beef for their garbage tanks. Germany is easy-af mode.There is a visibility stat...Players aren't pushed to jump to Realistic Battles. Instead, everyone plays Arcade.Daily rewards is a bunch of test drives. I like them but, it's just a bunch of test drives. You never get a vehicle or something cool.Wagers can only be used in high tiers. Makes grinding harder. Just a trashy ♥♥♥ game overall. They had it at one point. They screwed up. "

												I played this game for a long time, yet i won't recommend this game.For almost two years, each time i get the same useless bonus (backup vehicle or 5000 coins, a normal low ranked tank's price is 300.000 coins) only once or twice i could get a normal bonus, which was again a cheap, useless bonus but since it was few times it felt good (15.000 coins), so if i get 21 time bonus (21 days of login) i can buy a cheap tank for myself with again im greatful for some cheap, useless, low priced bonus.War Thunder is not a player-friendly game for free gaming, you need to pay for it or else game developers woudn't give ♥♥♥♥ about you because there are so many other players, you will see that i am right after this game will keep on giving you the same useless bonuses over and over..I keep playing War Thunder but i decided not purchase anything because i know the next day i pay, I will keep receiving a repair fee for a light tank as a bonus. This game will give you nothing instead of ''CONGRATS YOU WONT 5000 COINS'' so why should i trust this game at all? They won't get nothing from me for being so greedy, the only way this game will start giving you something is when no one will play that game, and the bonuses will be out of desperation. I've seen many greedyass developers that were begging for coins in the end and that is what they deserve.I spent almost 2 years for this game, don't make the same mistake (PS ; i won't delete the game since i spent so much time to open up high tiers, but give a chance for other tank simulation games, unless you have 2 years to develop yourself to have atleast decent gaming experience.In short, you may enjoy the game, but don't expect much help from the game itself, i will write further reviews if there will be any change in rewarding system or some player-friendly act by the game developers.I know no matter how much i write, game developers will laugh their ♥♥♥ of me since they dont give a ♥♥♥♥.. why am i saying this, NO change at all. 5000 COINS gifted well done (after 2 years) can i not accept the gift since i do not want some chewed chewing gum as a gift? I'd prefer a gift that is written ""dear player, f-ck you"" instead of 5000 coins ( to unlock a ♥♥♥♥ tank its atleast 300.000 coins. Every chance-roll is set and known to the developers, after i spin it slowly stops at backup tanks or 5000 coins (every time). Seriosly sorry for my language but ♥♥♥♥off, i have more chance in an illegal casino. Someday ppl will realize this bs and will go away and then everything will be free, when no one is playing this game anymore. I hope g.developers will start to give a ♥♥♥♥ about people.

												Edit: I didn't leave because I couldn't deal with the bias (IJA main in the top 30% of the playerbase), I left because of Gaijin's shenanigans with the exploit coverup and the consequent banning of my clan's leader after he posted about it on Live.USSR: The Game.Seriously. For example, the ""our stuff is the best around despite sucking compared to everyone elses"" mentality, common in Communist countries such as the USSR, is very much in play here as Russian equipment is by far the most (unrealistically) powerful in the game. USSR-style censorship is also in play, with one particular example coming to mind where the CEO of the freaking company asked players to remove all trace online of a game-breaking exploit, which is still in the game. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to get this review removed. USSR-style respect for the players is also in play, with the entire game running on the simple basis of ""You don't like thing? Good, let's make it even worse."" Despite all of this, they actually had the audacity to ask the playerbase to vote for them in the Steam Awards. I did, nominating them for the ""Russian Bias"" award. I recommend doing the same.I played this game for far too long before realizing all of this. If there's one good thing about, it's the fact that it's better than World of Warplanes, but let's get real here - what isn't.			"

												Heavily flawed F2P game that takes itself somewhat seriously as both an arcade flyer and an air simulator but doesn't force you to buy in through ridiculous grinds like the typical F2P. I'll be discussing the flying portion as I have the most experience with it.The primary issue here is that the devs are Russian, and like all Russian devs who make WWII games the commie propaganda shines through heavily and the Russian bias is extremely tangible, either due to national pride clouding the devs' honesty or them being force fed Red Army propaganda as children. The key to having fun in this game is extremely simple: ignore Russians entirely. Don't play maps that pit you against Russians, and you'll have few complaints. The other factions balance well against each other, but compared to the flying saucer-tier unrealistic flight models of the Soviet Air Force(whose real life achievements include the worst kill-death ratio in World War II, the most plane crashes in the war, and probably the most pilots flying under the influence of alcohol), you'll find yourself raging out due to blatant imbalancing to favor Russian players and Russian planes(like pitting post-war Russian aircraft models against early/pre war German/Japanese/British/American ones, which is extremely prevalent in the first three tiers but consistent throughout the Russian aircraft tree). A good way to test the insane imbalance is by starting the game as a non-Russian faction, and then picking up the Russian tree after you've learned the ropes to experience maximum seal clubbing as you can climb sharper, dive faster and turn quicker than anything else in the game.The secondary issue is that these devs have added many types and classes of aircraft to the game, and any that aren't fighters or interceptors(70% of the aircraft models in this game) don't serve a purpose or benefit their team in any way. Bombers/ground attackers/fighters that focus on ground targets are nothing but a liability to/drag on their team and dog chow for opposing fighter aircraft. They do not serve a purpose in game modes that end 95% of the time in team wipes, even though there are ostensibly mission objectives for bombers to complete that almost never get done.Flying anything that isn't an air superiority fighter is choosing to play 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'. Fighting Russians in anything that isn't Russian(with few exceptions) is also playing 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'.The Russian bias, wonky flight models/characteristics and horribly imbalanced game modes bring my score for this game from a solid 7/10 to a 5/10. As it basically still in 'active beta' release, I cannot recommend it until it is more polished and the devs learn English well enough to read their forums. If you DO play it, please don't give these devs any money.			"

												Welcome to War Thunder, the game where B-17s can get shoot down by a Russian Biplane, let's get started.Things I like:- Realistic flying mechanic- Damage modules-Both planes and tanksAnd that's it.Now, let's get to the things I hate.- Balance -> This game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Russia, now, the real problem (seen from a USA main) is that every nation exept for USA and maybe UK is overpower, expecially Russia.It might be me, but I think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 US bomber.- Teammates -> Altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will """"steal"""" your """"kills"""" and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. Not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds ))))- Bombers -> As a US Bombers main, I realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially B-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the B-17 is probably one of the weakers. And it's kinda strange, since in real life, the B-17 was one of the best bombers.- Russia -> Every russian plane\tank is overpower, I litterally got bored of playing as US and constatly get shot down by Russia that I tried to play Russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.People ofter ask ""Is this game Pay to Win?"" of course it isn't, it's play Russia to winSo, if you don't like to loose, Grab your Sekrit Dokumints, put on your tracksuit, choose your Russian plane made of Stalinium and spam ""♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" everywhere you can and put on ""Kalinka"" or The russian march of Red Alert 2, oh, don't forget to write  ""xaxaxaxaxaxa ))))))"" after every kill. Now that you know how to play Russia in WT, you're ready to go Tovarish			"

												Simply put: I don't have such love/hate relationship with any other game than I have with War Thunder. Also no other game has made me more salty than War Thunder.That said I'll list some pros and cons.Pros:-Different levels of realism from shooty-tooty arcade to much slower paced simulator battles-Lots of tanks and airplanes to unlock and new ones are constantly added-Very nice graphics-Free to play but not win to pay-Does actually require some skill, especially later in gameCons:-Realism is sometimes more like ""realism"", tanks ricocheting rounds in very weird way OR taking damage when they really shouldn't etc-There are lots of stuff to unlock but sometimes you'll notice that vehicles are very similiar. For example when unlocking american tanks you'll spend ages grinding through three different Shermans that aren't actually that different from each other after all. (Slight changes to armour thickness etc, don't really mean anything) And that's just one example.-Technically it's still pay to win, War Thunder has this premium system that gives you different kind of boosters to use and also provides you with a selection of premium vehicles. Not all of them are that special but some of them are seriously unbalanced and overpowered.-Does require skill but still most of the time it seems that it's not enough. Game suffers from serious balancing problems and therefore some matches end in minutes no matter how good of an player you are.Some other things that need to be noted:Game has this Battle rating system or BR in short. This means that every vehicle has a rating, for example 3.7. Game then searches for players with same BR. Thing is that usually you have more than just one vehicle. Lets say you have three tanks with BR of 3.7. Things are good and you're having pretty evenly balanced games. Then you get a tank with BR of 4.3 Suddenly you're facing tanks that have BR of 5 or even higher. This leads to greatly unbalanced game.Also because of this game doesn't always feel rewarding. For example I grinded for some time to get legendary Tiger and Panther tanks but after I got them I really didn't feel like playing with them because I was fighting more advanced (prototype or post-WW2 era tanks) most of the time. That also takes away some realism.Spawncamping. Yes, I do it sometimes myself too but still. Too often I see games where one team steamrolls to other teams spawn and kills everyone. Some maps even make it very easy by having the spawn points on open ground and easily seen from across the map. Already unbalnaced games become even more unbalnced because of this.Lack of teamwork. It's extremely rare to see some real teamwork in WT unless you're playing with friends or are part of some clan. There are lots of russian players even on EU servers and they don't usually speak english and even less usually they give a ♥♥♥♥ about other players. Not saying that they all are like that, just like 80% of them...Game modes don't really force you to be a team player. Okay maybe it's bit wrong to rant about this but I still want to point it out. With tanks game modes usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map. Even though you do get a reward for capturing a point and you do get more points and currency if you win a match it doesn't force you to play the objective or be a team player. WT would be a lot more fun with new game modes etc, maybe there will be some in the future.All in all, War Thunder is somewhat hooking even though sometimes it makes you really salty. You might like it or not or perhaps you'll be like me and feel both ways. I chose not to recommend this game because right now it feels unbalanced and broken, maybe I'll change my mind after a while. Or maybe not.  "

												This game could have been so much more.  It has everything at its most fundamental level for air combat to be an absolutely phenomenal game, with basic gameplay that is top tier.But this game is plagued by one irreconcilable problem:  It is being managed and developed by Gaijin.Since I started playing, Gaijin has lowered the value of of your money spent on this game (that is to say, they've repeatedly raised the price), frequently have increased the grind in the game beyond frustrating levels, habitually ignore major gameplay and metagame problems in all aspects of the game, and spend patch after patch trying to blind the community with new content while they fail to address legacy issues with the game.New content is frequently bugged, either hilariously underpowered or overpowered, and more or less keeps a status quo with a game stagnant in terms of gameplay when the gameplay is full of more holes than swiss cheese.  In addition to this, the devs frequently make asinine balance changes that ultimately lower the quality of the game more often than not.I could honestly go on, but it would make this review too long going into the nitty gritty.  The point is, as long as Gaijin is running this game, it will always be destined to get worse over time, not better.Despite this, the raw gameplay will suck you in and the overpricing will wring you for all you're worth before it tosses you aside with its easily missed legacy problems.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												My Grandson turned me onto this Gem. Yes the game is free, but if you want to get more enjoyment then a kid at Christmas Time I would you spend a few dollars on a premium membership for at least 30 days and some golden eagles. plan on about $30.00 to get yourself started. I know you may read of the griping of handing over few dollars for a game that is supposed to be free. Do you not think the developers wrote this game not to have financel gain? Just give the game a test drive. If it can keep a 60 year coming back for more (even I crash a lot) You younger folks should be taking this for a spin.

												I've spent a lot of hours and a lot of money on this game. Trust me when I say this. It's a good game concept and to be honest I would like to continue playing this game, it was a good game. Now, well, you have to understand that these game developers like most other game developers in our current age are greedy little ***** who don't pay attention to the game but to the money. What can we do? Stop other people from wasting their time and money. Don't play this game. I would rather play 'Armored Warfare' or 'World of Tanks'. At least you can continue getting tanks without much need of the use of money. 'War Thunder' on the other hand, if you want to get above tier 3, you can either pay up or grind for the next 3 to 5 months for 1 tank or plane. The game itself is good, but the developers decisions are not.<EDIT>I think it would be more for ground forces vehicles than planes. Some high tier planes can be accquired much easier than high tier tanks. But all in all, after a certain stage higher in the tech tree, it becomes almost impossible to unlock anything without the use of money, unless you are willing to spend almost 3 to 4 months depending on how much time you have. This means the game is catered more towards the players with more money to spend. Don't get me wrong, you can still obtain vehicles at high tier without the use of money. It is just not practical with the amount of time you need and have to grind through. For someone who does not have 24 hours a day to play every day. A great game suddenly becomes a chore. As I have said, I would still continue playing this game, but I cannot recommand it as of yet because of how the developers react and respond towards bad reviews and handle these situations.

												-Games not balanced nor ""historically balanced"", so why go a unhistoric unbalanced path?-Community is awful-Community Manager falsely advertises packs with bad wording and contacting support does nothing but ""will forward message to devs"" (Its been almost a year now and nothing heard back, feel scammed)-Either bad net code or majority of the servers being in EU or RU allows for ""hit"" shots to not really hit-Game is very grindy unless you buy a T4 premium vehicle + premium (I said forget it for tanks)The game has a lot of potential but theirs too many glaring issues such as balance to make it worth the time to play.

												I have been playing this game for quite some time.  I had purchased the Sherman tank package in order to get access to early beta (which was only 2 nights a week and a time that I could not play).  I logged in recently to find I had a negative 2000 golden eagle balance and was notified that it was due to a bug on Gaijin's end.  I had not received the extra golden eagles but the system thought I did and removed it.  Gaijin's solution was to zero my balance and thus remove the 2000+ golden eagles that I had bought via steam.  I am not happy with the customer service on this and thus I cannot recommend this game for fear this could be a common situation in the future.Also in ground forces. There is a serious bias towards Russian equipment. It was good but not that good. BR system needs a complete overhaul.  The economy for ground forces is atrocious and an embarassment for the design team.  Very difficult to make a decent profit in a win let alone a loss.  The lockout for leaving a battle is a joke.  It makes sense in Arcade mode but in realistic or simulator you get one vehicle maybe two before the match is done.  Once gone (god forbid you down't spawn in a rock and have to bail) you have to wait a stupid amount of time for something you have no control over, or very little.  I had hopes but frankly the game has a long ways to go.			"

												War Thunder would be a great game, easily the best WW2 vehicle simulator on the market, in the hands of a more competent developer.Let me qualify that. The engine is amazing. Great graphics and solid performance, even on weaker systems. The variety of tanks and aircraft is unmatched, and the 3 distinct gamemodes are all varied enough to be entertaining. What Gaijin consistently fails to understand, however, is their playerbase. I'm not even going to go into the whole ""Russian bias"" argument, just know that there are compelling arguments proving  it. Even if all the overperforming vehicles were British or American or Polish or whatever, the sheer amount of denial and refusal to address overperfoming vehicles, or mis-tiered ones is laughable. We have World War II era jets like the Ho 229 and the P80 facing off against cold war era ones like the Mig 17 and F 86 Sabre. Late war tanks like the Panther II VS some of the best post war tanks like the T-54 or T-10. The Yak 3P is currently much better than what's tiered against it, as is the I-185, a plane prototype that killed both it's test pilots and was cancelled. The grind is also unreal. Someone calculated that, without premium, and with a pretty good 2.5 k/d, it would take a person roughly 2000 hours to grind out a top tier vehicle's modules. Not a vehicle, just to unlock every unlockable module on a vehicle. That's roughly a year of grinding if you played 166 hours a month. That's insane. This kills the playerbase at the top tiers, which is causing all sorts of problems with the matchmaker as tanks are drawn up from the lower tiers to fill these games. So, overall, I still hold out hope that Gaijin will fix this game. They have the power to make this the best game of it's type on the market, bar none. But for now, stay well away before you get invested in a sinking ship.EDIT: So, this just happened:

For those of you who don't want to watch the video, here's the rundown. Illegal modifications for War Thunder have begun to circulate, and multiple Youtube channels who make War Thunder videos covered these mods. Chief among which was a mod that put vehicle markers above enemy tanks in the RB battle mode, effectively giving the player accurate information about enemy location that would not be available to him otherwise.Gaijin then put a poll on their official forums, asking for player feedback on one of 2 options.Option 1 gave Gaijin a blank check to copyright strike videos covering these illegal mods, effectively censoring their own community with unlawful copyright strikes (Yes, these would be unlawful, as critique of copyrighted material is covered under fair use)Option 2 just put those overhead markers on enemy tanks in RB for all players, ""Making the illegal modification useless"", and also ruining the gamemode of choice for a significant portion of the playerbase.This is ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful, and even I doubted Gaijin would stoop so low. What they are doing is giving their own community, the dedicated players who keep interest in the game alive, an ultimatum. Stop covering these illegal modifications, or we will ruin the gamemode that you like. Keep in mind, they aren't even attempting to fix the exploit that allows this mod to work, no, they just want to bury it so that no-one can complain about it. This is truely disgusting behavior. They are admitting to the entire playerbase that they are more willing to issue unlawful copyright strikes, potentially destroying entire Youtube channels dedicated to making content about War Thunder and putting Youtubers out of business entirely, than address an actual problem with their game. This is not how you make a good game, and this is not how to reward those who create free publicity about your game. They have since backed down, and deleted the poll, but the issue remains. They were completely happy to do this in the first place. They saw no issue with threatening their own community with mass censorship, rather than deal with an actual problem in their own game. I'm calling it now. Gaijin will never save this game.			"

												As quite the veteran player, over 1500 hours at the time of writing.Don't get me wrong, i loved War Thunder, yes, loved, Gaijin (the company behind the game) made a couple of terrible mistakes lately.I play mostly air realistic, and sometimes ground realistic. And yes, it is still a fun game, but Gaijins BS is too much for a lot of people.1. They had a bad matchmaker, the community wanted it to get fixed, even proposed fixes, but Gaijin made it worse for a part of the available vehicles (the top of the tree) it was a huge failure, Gaijin calls it a succes and will implement it for all vehicles. (or they have already done,i haven't played it for a few days because of this)2. They refuse to listen to the community, see point 1 for an example. The forum topics that would get a lot of negative comments are moderated, your post first has to be aproved before it is posted on the forum.3. I don't know about this one, but they are going to implement gameworks into the new dagor 4.0 engine, i am sceptical, but the new engine looks promising nevertheless.4. Some flight models are incorrect, some ammo loadout are incorrect (ww2 tanks that get post war shells)Don't get me wrong, i still enjoy the game, but i would not invest any money in it, just because of this, if they fix it and show that Gaijin is a compentent game developer i would happily invest money in it, i think they deserve my money, look at how much of my time is in that game, without costing me a dime.I would love to see a competitor for War Thunder so they have a reason to listen to their community.It is a fun game, but don't invest any money in it now, only when they listen to the community!

												This is my 1.37 review.http://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.pngThis is the 1.39 review.http://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.pngThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.The biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out. The gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).For the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).These aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.It's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41.			"

												I used to enjoy this game until the developers went insane. They began banning people who ponted out that hackers were ruining the game, refused to listen to the community and players about things they want changed or issues they have. Focus on stupid things and not adding useful content. The developers have ruined a game that I once enjoyed about a time period I absolutely adore.			"

												War Thunder has been in a steady decline since ground forces went open beta.  Every successive patch has introduced changes and modifications to the game that make it worse, and Gaijin ignores and actively suppresses the suggestions of its playerbase.  Their moderators on the English-language forum are rude and corrupt at the best of times, their business practices are shady and they treat their players, the ones who support this formerly great game, like dirt.A heart 'not recommended.'

												Would be much better if the maps were actually fair to all countries.Basically, in real life US fighters weren't meant to be interceptors. They were made with large fuel tanks, sturdy airframes, engines optimized for high altitude, and machine guns. The reason: to escort bombers from long distances. In War Thunder, we instead see US planes thrown into an interceptor situation against planes which perform the role of intercepting extremely well (ones with light airframes, cannons, high climb rates, etc). The maps show an obvious advantage to planes designed for this role due to their size.  This results in people having to ""side climb"" to recreate the long journey the American fighters would take when escorting bombers. Problem is, you're usually the only person that does this, with the rest of your team either being bombers or fighters at low altitude that get picked off in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, making even the simplest mistake while BnZing an enemy leaves you vulnerable to their whole team and in a matter of seconds you'll have 20 cannon rounds in your fuselage. Why should I have to wait 10+ minutes just to get a shot at winning when other countries can get to altitude in a fraction of that time? And for some reason, naval and army planes are thrown together. I'm not whining about ""Russian Bias"" or how American planes suck. American planes don't suck. Actually, they're amazing for what they were made to do: ESCORTING BOMBERS over long distances. Not intercepting fighters. And if they were given that role in the game, they would be extremely formidable. As of now, unless you're with a squad of people climbing together, extremely good/lucky or going against a team of idiots, you're playing with a lost chance.Just to clarify I'm mainly talking about RB.

												Started playing Warthunder 1/1/14. At first it was entertaining but after 2 weeks of playing it lost it's appeal. I really shouldn't have to submit myself for hours upon hours of tutotials on youtube and reading message boards to understand the game let alone have success at it. I purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a ""hedge fund"" and ""ponzi scheme"" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.The concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing. Flying for 2 minutes then getting shot down by a higher level plan of which I stand no chance against......is not.I purchased the premium membership 3 days ago, I'm walking away from the game and Gaijin can keep the 2700 golden eagles I have on the account.

												At first I loved this game, it was fun, challenging and progression was slow but achievable... Far easier if you purchased in game currency of course.However, when they released patch 1.37 they ruined the game. Made it 4-5x harder to progress, devalued the in game currency so any prior purchases were essentially worthless... But the worst thing they did was alter the flight characteristics of some of the most popular aircraft to make then virtually unflyable... This was a game that was supposed to be balanced in terms of the aircraft/skill level of the players online. Instead you got dumped into games with players in far superior aircraft. It was like putting a Jet fighter up against a bi-plane.If you had a preference for Bombers as many people did... forget playing it anymore. Aircraft were basically crippled and rendered useless in battles.The they released patch 1.39 and I tried to update... forget it. They use bit torrent to spread the downloads amongst their players rather than provide a server for people to get it directly. The problem with this is that the download speeds are virtually non existant. People can turn of the sharing aspect and I suspect the majority do just that. I left the game attempting to update for 35hrs and had downloaed just 2% of the 5+GB update. At that rate it was going to take me weeks just to update the game.Gaijin's customer service is pathetic, offering no help what so ever... Their advice on the slow downloads was "" wait and it will finish"" I saw complaints deleted, people banned for asking simple questions.I removed the game and will not play it again.			"

												Little background, I have been playing this game pretty much from the beginning. I loved the time I put into the game but unfortunately am unable to get back into it due to the direction the game was heading and the loss of faith I had in the company. Positives:+ Amazing Graphics+ Runs Smooth+ Both tanks and planes feel amazing to drive and shoot really giving you immersive gameplay+ Free! (Technically)Negatives:- Funded by microtransactions (They need to make money some how but grinding take a very long time without spending money)- Ran by Gaijin..Personal Negative:- Frustrating gameplay (It's supposed to be realistic yes! Doesn't mean it doesn't get frustrating)- ATGM's don't fit into the game at all...- Bias towards a certain line of tanks...Anyways, I completely stopped playing after I was banned for a long period of time for an issue that was out of my hands. (I've spent $2k they banned me for like 20+ days over $40 or something like that) You can see that here:

												Apparently i came after the golden age of this game because it's nothing but a grindfest now. Be prepared to unlock a few planes quickly using your special tokens and then get settled for long nights of mindless slogging and hard work to painstakingly unlock one plane at a time. How the developers could ♥♥♥♥ this up so bad is beyond me. I bet it was corporate. ♥♥♥♥ corporate. In COD it might take you 20 mins to unlock that shiny new gun. In Forza you might have a few races to get through before you unlock your next car. ♥♥♥♥ even in EVE Online it takes you less time to unlock a cruiser than it does for you to get one ♥♥♥♥ing plane on this game... In fact it would probably take you less time to go out into the real world and get your real Jet Aircraft Rating than it would take you to unlock Jets in this game. How ♥♥♥♥ed is that?So if i could fix it here's what i'd do.1/ All Tier one aircraft unlocked immediately and ready to fly2/ Research is like EVE Online, it's in real time say at the rate of 5000RP/Hr. You can queue up to 5 aircraft and once one is unlocked, the next in the queue automatically starts getting researched.3/No ♥♥♥♥ing elite tokens, you money grubbing ♥♥♥♥ers. If you want money just make us pay a fee for the game! A one off good 'ol fashioned payment of between $20-45 that i'm pretty sure everyone would be happy to pay, and then let us play your ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's a good game, we want to play it, but you're making it harder than it needs to be for us.			"

												Warthunder is a beast all it's own.  At its heart, it is a very great game.  It's developed well, it looks pretty good and it offers a diverse take on the whole PvP plane or tank game.  It doesn't have stupid health bars or weird aiming mechanics, where you hit the enemy plane or tank takes a major role.  There are bugs, yes, some incredibly ridiculous, but they are usually fixed quickly.  Usually. Where Warthunder falls short isn't in the game itself.  It's not overly Pay 2 Win, you can unluck every vehicle by purely playing the game without paying a cent.  There are premium vehicles that you can pay for, but they are usually are reskins or one-off paper tanks that usually won't give much more of an advantage.  I say usually because the rocket tanks are incredibly over-powered, but they are also hella expensive.  I've only ever seen one in game.  Warthunder fails at community development.  It's community is fractured and diverse and its community managers are hostile and condescending.  Gaijin will not do a single solitary thing based on the voice of the community, no matter how hard the community will push to get something changed or added.  Gaijin bases all of its decisions on numbers, their own numbers, and are rarely wont to put any faith in their playerbase.  In fact, there are many times when they are openly hostile on their forums, placing the blame on players or entirely dismissing the voice of the community.  Their forum moderators are akin to the Gestapo or more appropriately the NKVD.  Any sort of negative opinion is immediately met with a ban and the comment deleted.  Petitions by the community are put up and vastly ignored.  Gaijin even pulled out its community managers from r/warthunder, probably their best oppurtunity to get feedback toward their game because of the upvote system,  and instead of listening they simply left. I want Warthunder to succeed, but until Gaijin want it to it never will. Also, I just use the direct launcher instead of Steam, which is why my number of hours played is so low.  I've been playing off and on for close to three years.			"

												Patch 1.37 ruined the game for me.  I thought that matchmaking was sketchy enough with the old system of 20 tiers of planes you unlock through nation EXP.  Now you have five tiers that you unlock various planes by using other planes or some such thing.  But what that means for me is that I have planes that were tier 6 previously being pitted against tier 10 and higher planes in the previous patches.  I am getting killed in basically one hit all the time, and it makes me never want to play the game again.update as of 12/20/2015:Game still broken, matchmaking is absurd, since the Ground Forces came out I was really excited for a ""realistic"" tank combat game, however, there needs to be a balance between ""realism"" and fun.  Right now you can expect to get shot right out the spawn and then (if you aren't killed immediately) you spend the better part of a minute waiting to repair whatever got damaged.  I'm sorry if I don't find waiting very fun.  Not to mention the blatant pay-to-win style of ""premium"" vehicles...a sherman with a multi-shot rocket launcher on it?  a T34 with a 100mm cannon on it?			"

												(As a side note, I ""play"" from the War Thunder launcher, not steam) I've been playing this game since before it came to steam, and back then, the game was fun and balanced, however, this is no longer the case. This game might as well be called Germans versus Russians since those two nations are the only ones worth your time. I find myself wondering why I'm playing half the time since most of the battles are getting into range of one of either the german's or russian's weapons and dying. On the other hand, playing as the germans or russians isn't very satsifying either since pretty much all you have to do is look at something to kill it. But if that's your thing like it is for all the other players in those nations, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time.			"

												As I am writing this, War Thunder's ""most helpful"" reviews are almost all negative, as I am sure you have noticed. While I'm certain many of these reviewers' points have merit, I believe it is important to consider their viewpoint and that theirs might not be yours.By all appearances, the game is not fun anymore for people who have played it for thousands of hours and/or prefer Tier V (Highest tier / Most modern vehicles) realistic/simulator mode tank battles as non-Russian nations.As someone who has spent a couple hundred hours playing as Germany, U.S.A. and GB in up to T IV air arcade battles, and as Germany in up to T III tank arcade battles, I am here to tell you: This game is a lot of fun, I have encountered few balancing issues and fewer bugs, and I'm relatively sure I'll be playing another few hundred hours before I get bored of it and move on.If you are interested/curious, just install the game and try it for a few hours, it's f2p, after all. Due to the slow progression, I definitely recommend getting a premium account to speed things up a bit, if you end up liking the game. If you aren't stupid/rich enough to buy the ridiculously overpriced premium vehicles (that offer no real advantage apart from another progression speed boost), you will find War Thunder to be well worth the subscription cost.

												(TL;DR at the bottom) As you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this game.The fact that I've been playing it for so long only makes me sadder writing this review, because I simply can't recommend it (as much as I want to). Heres why:The devs just don't care.The gameplay itself is great and I've had such a blast playing this game over the past few years, but the devs just don't care about the game or the players, even though they pretend to. They never listen to the community; ignoring balancing issues and not even slightly punishing players who should be (constant team killing etc.). They also have done a few shady things in the past:- Sued an individual for using the domain name ""Gaijin.net"" even though the original gaijin.net predated the company by seven years.- Threatened to ruin part of the game if players didn't help them abuse youtube's DMCA strikes against youtubers that showed bad things about the game.Their complete lack of concern for the playerbase and the game itself also means that there are much less people playing, so if you want to do realistic battles good luck because there are few people playing, and gueueing for simulator battles can take up to 20 mins.Oh, and don't even get me started on their ""customer support"". TL;DR: This game had great potential, but due to gaijin being such a terrible developer team they ran it into the ground, which really is a shame.			"

												The Devs continue to ruin this game with their consistent, poorly-executed 'Patches'.They've turned what used to be a fast-paced, action-packed flight game into a tortuous grind to get new planes, and then more grind to max-out the features each plane has (engine power, guns, ammo/ordinance, etc.)The Mods are far too heavy-handed with their chat bans.  If you say a word they don't agree with, or talk about anything 'Other than' planes/the game itself, you stand a good chance of being muzzled for variable durations (at their whim and mood).Too many of the other players are either forced to be self-centered, greedy little psychopaths, or for whatever reason are just maladjusted human flotsam that choose to play against the 'Team', the objectives, or just cause grief and mayhem at every opportunity.The 'Game' itself, is really amazing. If you have all the time in the world and the patience of a Saint, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it.For awhile.Good luck!			"

Not only it held a lot of promise gameplay-wise, but it also looked gorgeous, with great visual details to vehicles. While not a very big fun of ww2 airplanes, I awaited Ground Forces with anticipation, to become a more history focused and sim oriented version of world of tanks. I have been playing GF since closed beta and originally it was a real blast, especially simulation mode. And while game had a lot of problems back then, including balance, damage model, corridor maps and the like, the potential for a greatest tank game for ppl, that want something more deep and historically accurate,  was there. Unfortunately it was not meant to last. As a lot ppl noticed back then, and still do up to this day, game is heavily biased towards soviet vehicles, while german vehicles recieve disproportionate amount of hate from developers, and it only gets worse over the years. What was attempted to be excused as bugs, or overpenetration mechanics couple of years ago, nowadays became a norm, and it seems it was intended even back then, in gaijeen attempt to appease their main player base, which are russians, to slow a player decline from game. Just a few examples of disbalance and nonsense that happens virtually every battle:Balance issues:German tanks battlerating, which puts ww2 german tanks against post war tanks, and generally pits german tanks against opponents that were introduces much later in the war, thus virtually making all german tanks inferior to their opponents. What the point in tiger 1 100mm armor, when it has to fight late war tanks from 1944+ which can pen it from any range at any angle, while tiger keep getting ""no damage"" even from t34-85s relatively thin hull...Gaijin supposedly strives for realism, by adding armor coefficents for later german tanks, to simulate lover quality late war german armor, yet they ignore things like tank optics quality difference for example, which all ultimately plays in favour of soviet tanks. Another example of this is British solid AP shells whith which you virtually has to individually kill every crew member of enemy tank to destroy it, which translates into 5-6 shots to be able to destroy enemy tank, and i f its a soviet tank, then you can count on the fact that after your first shot, you will be one shotted by glorious soviet gun, unless ivan is too drunk and miss you.In realistic battles, where teams are being balanced by nations, germans loose 9 out of 10 battles, which speaks for itself.Most maps are made that way, that there are almost no long range engagements, like it used to be on old Prokhorovka and Mozdok maps, which again greatly plays in favour of soviet vehicles, which are more close combat orientated.Soviet glorious AP shells that 8 out of 10 times oneshot your tank by killing all the crew and detonating ammo racks, while it takes several similar shells to take out soviet tank, which is illogical considering how cramped soviet tanks were on inside.If soviet glorious AP shell did not one-shot you, then it will somehow crit gunner, driver, and your gun at the same time, this happens 99 hits out of 100, where german tank manages to survive the first shot.Nonsense that you will encounter almost every battles.Outsmarting and flanking enemy t34 on your Pz4 F2, making a sideshot in a hull, only to see ""no damage"", while guy notice you only after that, casually turns his gun and oneshots you without much offeort for aiming...Outsmarting and outflanking enemy t34 with your tiger 1, shooting twice from short range at engine compartment TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO OVERPENETRATION (as fanboys and gaijin like to claim) - after second shot with no damage, enemy finally spots that simething wrong, and drives away.... catching him 20 seconds later, direct hull shot along the tank hull axis, no damage, while he shoots back on the move and oneshots your tiger.... just great, so much about skill, but seems not a requirment for soviet tankers.This list can go on and on to eternity, because as I said, nonsense like this happens almost every battle.It is really sad to see a game with such great potential turning into ♥♥♥♥ by its own devs, trying to appease a part of community, so school boys and always drunk Ivans and Nikolays can have their fun at expense of other players, especially german tankers if we take realistic battles national balance into account. While I understand their desire to keep players in game, I think favouring one part of the playerbase over the rest is a bad call in a long run, and only need leads to game stagnation at best. So all in all, I cant reccomend this game in its current state, which seems to be only deteriorating over time, and unlikely to get any better. I will be cheking this game every half year or so, to see if there are any positive changes in game mechanics and balance, and might change this review in the future, but for now - NOT RECOMMENDED.

												I am fed up with the complaints commonly levied against this game. Firstly there is no Russian or Geman bias, there are only bad players. Am i saying all of the vehicles are ballenced, no way; never the less the reason people are strugiling is because people refuse to follow the meta game and try and use vehicles that have little to no use in most situations. I have to atribute this to people going for iconic vehicles and expecting them to win automaticly, thats not how balance works. The classic example is the Tiger people want it to be op because thats what it was like in real life, well its not real life crewmembers can fix cannon breaches in the field, so why should Tigers fight against early t34's. Onto the other main complaint, with the amount of hours i have in the game which is greater than my steam hours (used to play on the launcher) i have seen only 1 definate hacker ever, people with 50 hours can shut up about it being full of Russian hackers.Finaly the game is not pay to win baring a couple of examples of premiums (the XP-55 Ascender and the T-29  are the ones which come to mind) which even being very good vehicles and the best at their BR they are not good enough to carry every game, and with regards to the T-29 its only a issue as German teams are nutoriously bad because people pick them as their first tree to get the lepard ""the best tank in the game"" and there for have no experience playing high teir. However bushes remain to be BS but they dont affect the gameplay 99% of the timeEnough whining at why all the other reviews are bad.Positives:great looking game.amazing models.fun gameplay (when not enraged).lots of content .high skill cap.etc.Negatives:toxic comunity.bad ground forces map design.repair costs -.-not getting parts tracks and fpe as standard.... not cool.beyond that its disapointing the metta does not allow all vehicles to be competative but that is understandable.Very finally tips for new players.dont get a T4 premium untill you can resurch T4's.go through forums to see if the vehicle is good and your play style.Run down of the nations for new players:America Aviation- the planes are good, but for more advanced players as the time to kill is greater with 50cals.America Army- to be avoided at  all costs as your first nation. no armour medeocre guns, its hard.German Aviation- very strong easy to fly at low teirs but gets more chalenging at higher teirs but a higly recomended starting nation.German Army- I found low teirs very boring but there is nothing wrong with them beyond being repatative. at high teirs they are obviously one of the best nations, but the teams are auful. If you want to go for the Germans please mother of god learn weak spots your guns are not infalable.Russian Aviation- very fun at low teirs but soon gets repetative but has a high skill cap, i never enjoyed the Russians but their is nothing persay wrong with them.Russian Army- the best staring tank nation hands down the tanks are fun and easy to use, at high teirs they reamin compatative and fun.British Aviation- personaly my favorate planes in the game but they can be dificult at low teirs with the low ammo count so you need triger dicipline. At high teirs they are a joy and teams work well together. Highly recomended (apart from bombers)British Army- dont touch it its auful until T4 its a massive grind.Japanese Aviation- This is the one nations planes i have not touched extensivly, but i know they are very good but with no survivability dont touch as your first nation.Japanese Tanks- see british tanks but worse.If you have goten this far thank you. I appoligise for any spelling or grammar mistakes I am writing this late at night.In game name Squishy_Manatee.			"

												I have played this game to its fullest extent. I have top tier vehicles in every nation in every game mode, i.e. Tanks and Aircraft. I will say that this game is a great game, everything is quite balanced up to tier III. There the BR system has its flaws and is supposed to be reworked soon. Getting to tier III without paying isn't too big of a deal, playing it every so oftern you can get to tier III, however if you wish to have the F-86F or MiG-15bis, you will have to put in quite a bit of time, or money (Tis the nature of F2P games). If you wish to have really fun games without the super grind, play a lot of tier III and just enjoy your time. This game has its flaws, and I hope Gaijin will address these soon(:			"

Planes are overpowered (Tier 3 against Tier 1 and 2)7. Fun for the first ten hours, then it gets pretty bland. 8. Wanna play simulation battles? Good luck finding one. There is hope...1. Simulation is engaging, feels realistic. 2. The overall mechanics of the game are pretty solid. 3. It can be fun. Emphasis on *can*. However, as it stands now, I'm putting the game aside.

												This is by far the best World War 2 simulator game i have  played, tho it does not cover infantry battle, it does cover aviation, it will soon cover tanks, and in the future, naval battles.They try to make a historically correct game and base their planes on reports and blueprints to make them opperate as much alike the real planes (soon to be tanks and ships in the future) as possible. Hosting events, such as real battles, like the battle of Berlin, the assault on Iwo Jima and many other battles, they deliver what an enthusiast is looking for.They also make sure there is something for everyone, with the ""arcade battles"" mode, where they put planes of any nation (USA, Nazi Germany, USSR, GB and Japan) with the ""some-what"" same preformance in a 15v15 battle anywhere on the globe, from Guam to Stalingrad.Gameplay handle like a dream, the game is action packed beyond what you can ask from a F2P (Free to play) and there is as i mentioned before, something for everyone, if you want to dogfight, or level a military encampment to the ground with a well placed 1000kg (2000lb) bomb, or carpetbomb a convoy, even sink a battleship with a torpedo, it is right here for you.The game preformes suprisingly well on even a low-grade PC, with a well optimised engine and good distance rendering, you can expect high fps (frames per second) almost no matter if you are playing on low or high graphics settings (depending on your PC hardware ofcourse), eigther you are flying at high or low altitude. I am running at 120 fps+ when i play the game at the highest graphicalsettings and i love the action the game delivers. 10/10			"

												Gaijin are a bunch of idoits. Every single patch brings with it a sh*t storm of problems and introduces new content that noone wants or ever asked for. Prime examples are the Yak 30 and the Tu-4 and ATGMs and float planes that have no place in the meta of the game. I've been playing from the launch of this game, and it has been a rollercoaster ride of fun, it runs fast on my pc, and there are no other flight games quite like it. Sadly, Gaijin are a bunch of idiots. They ruin the game by being abusive to their community, and displaying downright abhorent behavior toward their content creators. Russian bias is existant, but not as bad as it used to be, The Russians have the best jet and best tank, but all the midteir stuff is fine. The game has become more and more grindy has the years have gone by, and grinding out a tank is a month long process for me. The meta of the game makes no sence. You are rewarded more for killing other players, but for some reason that has almost no corrilation to winning the game. Also, a tutorial would not go amiss, as new players typically have no idea how basic game mechanics work, even at high teirs there are people that don't understand how to win a game or shoot down planes, or fight in general. Perhaps most annoying however is the fact that the CEO of Gaijin seems to think that abusing YouTube copyright rules are a solution to a very small group of hackers. There are bigger fish for Gaijin to fry, and hackers should be the least of the companies concerns at the moment. To sum up, the game is spectacular, it looks great, and its fun to fly and drive World War Two machines and fly with friends. However, I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that Gaijin are a bunch of idiots and they seem to be uninterested in their community and the state of their game. Don't start playing, you'll be lured in by the first few battles, then you find yourself at odds with Gaijin, and you'll care to much to stop playing, but hate every time you get on to get your spin to fly a few. I still have a glimmer of hope that Gaijin will pull their heads out of their asses and make this game live up to it's potential, and thats the only reason I play still..... What a shame			"

												Let's get this over with.I've been playing this cobbled together monstrosity since 1.25, since Gajin has continued to add content including new models of planes and tanks, maps, game-modes, and an entire new portion of the game; Ground Forces. Great right? The problem here is, the base of this game is an complete and utter wreck, while most online games suffer from poorly implented band-aids, this game could use a few. The same problems that were apparent in 1.25 are still there, with each patch and addition of new content only adding more and more. At this point the game is standing on a poorly contructed foundation with a number of medicore ""balances"" only further eating away at it. The BR system that was supposed to be the messiah for all imbalances in the game when introduced has at best stayed in the same cluster♥♥♥♥ as it was in when introduced, and at worst has only further became ♥♥♥♥ed with more and more vehicles being thrown into it. The few times devoplers actually acknowledge a problem, we are given the same answers we were given two ♥♥♥♥ing years ago, ""We're working on it"". To the people who still think betas for games are actually for fixing and helping devolpment, let alone those who try to use this games excuse for one as a way to defend it from criticism, wake up. This game is going into it's third year of open beta, they've had ample time to fix plenty of these problems and yet still here they remain. I want this game to be good, there is a real lack of it's type out there, but it's never going to find that success like WoT did until they go back and wade through their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fix the mistakes they made years ago.TL;DRThis game has been a mess for a long time and has only gotten worse. Devs refuse to fix core elements and would rather implement new unbalanced premium vehicles than actually go and fix them.			"

												War Thunder is an interesting beast.  Its closest competitors are both flight sims and the super-arcadey World of Tanks/Warplanes, with WT filling a niche in the center.  It is for that reason that I enjoy it so much.  However, the ""base"" game mode is the Arcade difficulty, which is where Gaijin is clearly targetting.  A good majority of the game's balance is based around Arcade, and the most interesting mechanics abound there.  Realistic is where the most involved players tend to congregate, however, and the split between developer and fan focus creates some ""interesting"" dynamics in balance and gameplay.  And by interesting I mean horrible.  Though there are certain aspects of the game that *are* balanced, there are others that have gone from horrendously overpowered to nearly useless in successive patches.  Most notably, bombers such as the B-17 were previously unstoppable death machines in all game modes, however as of patch 1.43 they have become almost paper in Realistic.  Though marginally more effective in Arcade (as with many changes this points toward developer focus) they are no longer the research/currency printing machines they once were.  Of course, even with these issues, I have almost 600 hours in the game.  How, if it's so poorly balanced?  Well, simply, it's fun.  WoT is much more arcadey and has very different mechanics than WT's ground forces, and I like the higher-risk feel of WT's more ""realistic"" damage modeling.  The replacement of WoT/WoWP's hp system with internally modeled components and armor penetration (which is obfuscated in the other games) makes it feel like you get more information and feedback.  The planes feel easier to control.  You can one-shot people if you're skilled enough.  There are dozens of vehicles to unlock and very few of them are pre-war no-name biplanes or tanks.  The graphics engine is very very pretty.I honestly don't know.  I love the game, but also hate it.  And here I am logging in again.			"

												I Love this game but they have screwed it up so much it aint funny. DO NOT spend a dime on it untill it comes out of beata. Changed the whole tiering system so now Me262 fight MIG 15 all the time, no German 109 does not over heat, Russian plaes that were made in 1948 are in the same tier as USA, BRIT, JAPAN, 1943 year of ranking and I could go on. Game had all the hope you could possibly want. Finally a game that can burry that horrible thing called World Of Tanks. But, nahh, they went from a good company to ripping off the customer. Planes you buy get nerfed ( w/real money ) they nerfed the whole pay out system and made it almost impossible to play. ANd yes I have premium. A year of it to be honest. I never end up with more deaths then kills every match. Yet I make Jack crap in RP. You make less in which was once called historical battle because you use to fight nation VS natnion but now they call it real battles or some BS. Play it but don't spend a dime on it, Their Russians, and act like it. Bias to the hilt. Stalin was GOD, USA and all EU players are treated like garbage. So bad, that if you buy gold, its the same. No conversion between Dollars, pounds, and the Euro. But if your in mother Russia they do the conversion on that pathetic money of theires. The Rubble.			"

												I play American and British planes and tanks, and find that the planes are competitive. The tanks are a different story altogether. The tanks seem to alternate between ""clubbing"" and being ""nerfed"". One day I'll get kills with, for example, an M10, the next game I'm bouncing shots all over the place, getting hits but no kills. As it stands, American tanks seem to exist to pad the scores of Russian and German tank players, especially Russian. Each updates seems to introduce a new nerf on the tanks I play. You never know what you'll get. American tanks are by far the easiest tanks to kill, especially between rank 5.0 to 7.3.  They have no chance against an IS-3 or T54 1949. It also seems like anyone recommending this game hasn't played it very much compared to those of us who have 700 plus hours, who seem to generally not recommend it. Or maybe they are just playing Russian tanks. I would have recommended it in the beginning, too. The game is as addictive as crack, and like crack, it will cause you to waste a lot of your life for no reward, other than frustration.			"

All fun remofved and replaced with frustration.Would I recommend?  Right now, hell no, even WoT on it's worst days is better.  If 1.39 actually fixes anything (chiefly MM) then yes, otherwise it's uninstall time...			"

												Personally i would not recommend starting to play this game in the current state it is in and you must be willing to buy premium if you want to stay sane when you get to late tiers oh and dont bother getting to late tiers in tanks or planes because its just not fun.- Tank matchmaking sucks, lets match a low tier 4 against top tier 5's because thats a good idea, i feel sorry for anyone who is currently trying to research tier 4 tanks, as soon as you get their you will just be matched against tier 5 where you can literally do nothing but run and pray you dont get rekt by one of the many T54's. I was researching the Maus but gave up in the end and just boosted my way there because of the endless slaughter of being matched against stuff i can even pen. You want to have fun in tanks, play in tier 3 and lower. - Planes are similar, i mean we've all had that moment when we just want to kill ourselfs when we get rekt by that 3.7 FW which is placed in tier 2 (Because Logic) which will ruin anything in its path. I mainly play Britian planes and i never seem to actually be killed by anything but a Yak, Lag, FW or BF. I think you stand more of a chance in planes being match against high tier planes because theyre all made out of paper, yes they can out run you but atleast you still stand a chance unlike tanks. I just wish planes actually had some more good maps, they're all so repetitive, boring and all so open.- Taking away the 2x for your first battle at first seemed like a good idea with it being replaced with the daily rewards. You would be wrong in thinking the more days you play the better stuff you would get, in fact you're actually better off just playing it every other day. For example im on the 148th day now and ive just got a 10% silver lions boost, im so glad i've been loyal to the game for this long so i can get rewarded like this! They should start adding big golden eagle drops when you get past 100 days, i mean there is literally nothing that makes me want to continue this streak apart from my head telling me that there might yet be something good.- This game is also now turning p2w with all these rocket tanks they are bringing out as premium tanks and then placing them in tier 2. So no overall i don't think people should start playing this game unless you want to make yourself go insane or until the devs actually listen and fix this ♥♥♥♥ed up game.Edit - Just hit my 149th day and got 4 silver lion boosts of and a silver lion wager, 10/10 would waste life away again.

												Update - 12/9/16Still just as awful, player count dwindling so it isnt just me. Just a game you want to love but Russian developers make that hard with their inexperince and their Russian-Theiving hands. Would be better if the devs sell to another team. But Russians are stupid,just a fact of life.Update - 5/19/16Why play Medium-High or Ultra when you can play Ultra-Low to get a compeditive edge?Cheats Confirmed (Video Proof on youtube) Go play IL2:BoS or BoM or DCS instead. 60$ is worth it.Tired of losing with Realistic Soviet-Era Machinery in other games? Look no further! WarThunder has Buffed,Unrealistic Soviet-era Tanks and Planes that put to shame other,Suprior nations easily.Don't think its true? Find a player who says ""There is no Soviet Bias"" and look at his profile and Take a Gander at his most played/MostKills/MostPoints of tank, and look at the drop off. Still dont belive me? Find as many players as you can to do the little test to! So what're you waiting for?! Unless you wanted a game that had its logic based off facts not Propoganda or Her'sey, WEll then Ide suggest picking up IL2:BoS or DCS: BF109k4 , FW190 Dora or the P51D Mustang. It might not be for free, but it is Authentic.			"

												I could not recommend this game but why? Dispite the game having fun gameplay and some annoying features that could be improved I dont think the developers understand why its fun and continue to leave the game in limbo. Nothing of flaws have been address in several years from gameplay, UI, poor maps, bad matchmaking with only NA and EU severs, Slow tank and  model loading, unbound key features, annoying menu delay and in my opinion deteriorating gameplay in mid to high teirs (subjective). Combine with incredible grind to get pass teir 5 tanks you need to only play this game or spend more then on a triple A new release game for one fractions tech tree. From all this above I have got impression that the developers are more in line with EA and UBsoft, more interested in profits first then making a complete game.Ultimately do try warthunder it was fun but I wouldnt put money into the game because they arent interested in improving the game, only adding more mediocre content to continue keeping paying custumes attention. There is alot more amazing games out there that you can find that deserve your time or money.  "

Here's why:I swear, everytime I join a game, it's like going to a Beiber concert without the music and the positive ""comments"", in better wording, I think I joined a Battlefield game made for Call of Duty fanboys, constant cussing, constant childish insults like, ""your mom"", just horrible teamwork, if you don't pay for anything on the store, be prepared for the constant superior might of the other team, I think the ""admin"" like people that control the chat are in complete denial when you say that the game is just a giant, rigged bore, even when it is true, and last of all, it is horribley balanced with bias to the Soviets, if you aren't Russia, ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥, FACE SUPERIOR MITE OF STRONK SOVIET POWER. Hey, this reminds me of this one used-to-be great game that is also free on the steam store.

												I dont want to be so Offensive, but please understand me coorectly. Game itself its fine, I was, and I am quite happy with the game, but Reasons why I dont recomend it are too much.A) Gaijin is Lying us and they made great summer sale FRAUD to all of us, when they raised nominal prices. Ofcourse, that Sale off was Fraud, and its also confirmed by sale shops which are marking prices for long time...B) Gaijin told, that cheating is not possible in their game... Actually few replays was made, ""usage of wallhacks and aimbots"" and gain was Forcing all those peapole to stop streaming those replays... By their behaviour, is comunity paralysed, and I am really worried about playing this game furher.C) It is heavy grind game... Forget to play for highets tier tanks or planes... You will have not enough time for plaing with all those corupted mechanics by cheaters which officialy dont exist as Gaijin telling. If you want tanks for money, personaly I dont see any problem with that (many working players have no time for playing day by day over and over to grind favourite tank), be prepared for spending houndreds of Euros!! Yes, thats right... This is GREEDiest game ever made on the world.. Even planetside2 is less controversial.D) Bias.... And yes, after 2yers of playing this game I agree, There is russian bias.... T34 Tanks are really ""hidden coded"" bugged, same as more obvious vehicle, which is Airplayne calles JAK3 etc etc etc..... There were only few JAK fighetrs which was able to fly higher than 3km , but in this game they are best boom and zoomers  with incredible High speed (better than spitfires :-D LOL....I am done with this game.

												This game went from one of the best games I've ever played to being the absolute worst I've ever played since I started playing it in 2011.I've racked up more hours in it than Steam says I have, because you're stupid if you think this game didn't exist before it was on Steam.The devs are greedy, do not care about the playerbase (only their wallets), continually introduce terrible features into the game despite overwhelmingly negative reactions to them, don't know how to balance anything if their lives depended upon it, silence people who have bad things to say about the game, pay people to give good reviews, and as is probably obvious now... steal from the players by making them overpay in order to get things.The players are often toxic, brainless, arrogant, and all around jerks. I'm all for banter, but when people start attacking each other personally... that's an issue.If you want to have any hope of progressing past tier 3, you almost HAVE to buy a premium account unless you are a God (news flash; you're not). Even then, this game is a tedious, un-fun grindfest. Rewards are extremely low, no matter how well you perform in a match, compared to the research price and credit cost of vehicles.The battle rating system is just... broken. Almost nothing is rated properly. The game has a tendency of stacking teams as well. In other words one team is almost all higher battle ratings than the other. Couple this with the fact that many players lack a certain thing called ""Common Sense."" Then add the fact that the one team almost always has one (usually two) full squads of 4 players in a clan on Teamspeak/Vent/Skype/etc. and the other does not.When you add those together, you're basically playing Defeat Simulator 2014 (2014 because that's when battle ratings were introduced).It's just... not fun.I don't recommend playing this game unless you want to give yourself a reason to just end it all... well. When it comes to tanks anyway.The planes (minus jets. Jets are miserable) are ♥♥♥♥ing great. When it comes to the planes, it's ridiculously difficult to not have fun.			"

 War Thunder  is a game that allows you to command planes, tanks (or other ground vehicles like trucks), and eventually naval vessels in PvP and PvE matches.The selection of vehicles you have range from pre WW2 (usually around the time of the Spanish Civil War) all the way up to the Korean War, and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the USA, Germany, USSR, Britain, and Japan (at the moment Japan only has aircraft, but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too). There could possibly be more nations added in the future, but not much info has been provided on that. Additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations.The game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches, these are  Arcade,   Realistic,  and  Simulator.  Arcade Battles  are the most popular, enemy nametags appear when in your line of sight, mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better, for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a colored marker appears when you're aiming at an enemy, with the three different colors (green/yellow/red) indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate.  Realistic Battles  has realistic mobility characteristics (though not at the same level of simulator mode), limited markers (nametags still appear, but the lead circle and the colored marker are gone), and realistic team matchups (you won't see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode).  Simulator mode  does what realism mode does, but takes it up to eleven. You can only view your plane from inside the cockpit (some of the cockpit interiors aren't out yet, but you still get some kind of first-person view nonetheless) and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret (like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield).The PvP portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match.Aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets (generally the role of attackers/bombers) and destroy enemy planes (generally the role of fighters/interceptors/etc) in the common  Ground Strike  mode. There are also the game modes  Domination  (which involves landing on air fields to capture them) and  Air Domination  (where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone) The more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives, like the attacking side is helping an AI ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them.Tank variety in objective types isn't much better, which are usually just capture and hold points on the map. This is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavy/medium/light tanks, SPAA, armored trucks... regular trucks with mounted machine guns  USSR plz . The realistic modes objectives don't change much for ground forces, but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time.The PvE portion of the game can be done solo or with friends, at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content. The PvE content includes  Single Missions  where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective,  Dynamic Campaign  where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map, and  Historical Battles  which you have to buy with the Steam Pack or in-game, which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cutscenes added. Though there doesn't seem to be much of a point to doing these PvE activities because they don't provide much of a reward, which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game, the grind.This game is very grind heavy, especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription. If you really want to try out the jets you're going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game.But I can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play. All of the vehicles are very well designed, while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practicing and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle you're facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight.The game isn't P2W either (well, I guess that depends on what your definition of P2W is), most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics, or speeding up game progression. The only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew, which improves the performance of your vehicle, but if you're willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew.While this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games (in my opinion) it isn't the absolute best. If you want that go for DCS World.If you decide to play this I would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there. Don't try to rush to the end game because it isn't that great. If you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with, and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments. Just try to have fun in the end.This review ended up being much longer than I expected.			"

												The game is great. It kept my interest for many years. Had some great ideas to start. So much so  that I've put quite a bit of money into this game aswell. Having enjoyed it a lot.But in recent years, Gaijin has gone down the pan. They're not a good company. They censor negative views on the forums, regardless if they're non-trolls or non-offensive. They don't want your views if they're negative.They do not listen to community feedback. Overpowered planes in your battle-rating? Until their statistics (Which they never release) say it's OP, nothing will be done about it.Russian tanks get ammunition that they never used in WW2. But they have it, because reasons. Gaijin claims to be more historically accurate than WoT. Ok.There's a whole load of issues when it comes to their BR system. It's been discussed to death, you can find it if you search for it.Gaijin has also in a recent poll, where someone exposed hackers. Pointing them out or something. Their poll was either you let them do copyright strikes against youtubers, or they'll ruin realistic battles. Abusing copyright law to censor. Nice one Gaijin.They're not a nice company. They'll get no more recommendations from me.If you still enjoy the game, good for you. But I no longer want to support a company like this.I touch on Gaijin as a company a lot in this review, but it has a lot of negative effects on the game aswell. Like no community feedback being taken seriously, if at all. Not even when polls have overwhelming majority voting for a good idea that people want.			"

												This game started out as a very fun, exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing. But now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. I started playing while they  still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy ONE plane... ONE! You'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. So if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there.			"

												Firstly, Russian equipment is OP, and to quote another review ""Recently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…""Second, if you don't throw money at it to quickly upgrade your crews for any vehicle, you will be one shot every time you get in one. Flying a heavy bomber? Doesn't matter, one bust of machine gun from a I-16 and you have no wings. Driving a tank? Doesn't matter, someone will 1-shot you across the map with a Russian tank. The game is zero fun at this point. It's pay to win or don't play at all.			"

												This game was really nice before patch 1.37, but it still had some bad aspects before that patch, first of all, the devs are russians...nothing wrong with their nationality but  i mean you really notice they are russians, they are totally pro-russian, everything russian is just OP in this game while in real life russian airforce was trash having tons of casualties hell there were even battles where 30 german planes destroyed 400 russian planes (air skirmish before battle of kursk), but lets forget about the Russian OP part, it was never p2w until patch 1.37, now it takes ages just to unlock ONE single plane, before that you could unlock an entire line of planes and buy them if you had the money, well doesnt sound that p2w yet, but here it comes: every game you get some exp and additional exp that can be bought with goldeneagles, so if you pay you can just unlock most planes very early while others will probably never be able to unlock most planes except if they play 8hours a daily per week for 2 years ... another thing that makes me mad are the german planes, most of them are just garbage, i wonder how the real german planes could destroy 10x more planes than the russians if they had such bad planes... the worst thing is ww2 german jets vs korea war jets, i thought this was a ww2 game ! so you reach the legendary german jets just to fight the 10-20 years newer korea war jets ?? the devs tried to fix that problem giving the germans the EXACTLY same planes as russians and americans of the korea war... so i think everyone will be excited to reach the end game just to see that every nation will have the exact same plane without any differences and the so called ww2 game will be a mix of korea war and ww2 or a pure clone wars.

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Although, it is free! ... -ish.Being an old Starfox veteran, I got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. Each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. Needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.Then, gradually, I progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. This was fun, too, for a while. But then I started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. Instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. Get used to these head-on collisions. They happen a lot. And not just with enemies. Sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. Because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'F**KING RAMMER N00B' for your trouble. Lovely.My main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. So the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.Alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.I get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in World of Tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. However, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. So, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. However, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.They will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, I'm not convinced.Sorry, Warthunder. You only get 4/10 golden badger eggs. :(			"

												Played since closed Beta and have held on to hope for improvements all that time, not to mention over 3 years waiting for naval aspect/world war.While a few things have been changed for the better in that time, most has been taken in the opposite direction.Like so many dev groups, these guys scoff at players ideas and suggestions.  People have begged for some of the same things for years now. They made several changes to the MM system and got slammed in feedback by players.  They created so much imbalance in their battle rating system (br)  they lost 80% of the players that were in the game for 2 years after launch...which is why they came to Steam for all the exposure.  Good, ever-devolping games draw more players than they lose over time.  This game loses players 2:1 over how fast new players join.  No matter how many people left and/or complained, they reinforced the system instead of reversing it.  The more players they lose, the more they adjust the system creating more imbalance.  The more they adjust the system, the more players they lose...they put themselves in a catch 22 they could easily get themselves out of, but that would mean admitting their vision of what the gameplay should be isn't up to snuff and the players have a better idea of how the game should work than the devs who openly admit they don't play their own game...Allow me to re-iterate...they openly admit they don't play their own game and make all changes based on metrics - and then get upset and make threats to some players  that publicly respond with negativity to the changes...ALL the people I've met and enjoyed flying with in the game over these years have left.  Only a handful ever came back to check up...none stayed.Gaijin has taken to censoring bad press and reviews around the web where search providers will comply including the banning of players accounts that have been linked to the reviews.  They push threats of copyright infiringement on players for creating youtube vids of the game if they make negative comments towards any aspect of it, but never hassle those uploaders that say only positive things.  This was the proverbial straw for me.  They won't fix it, and they bully people worldwide for complaining about it.  I lost 2 friends I had since the beta stage to censorship.  They posted a video showing new changes some time back...they commented negativley but in a professional and tactful way.  Both had their accounts banned after years of playing and for them, thousands of dollars spent each over that time.  Lost it all for voicing their opinion on a consumer-driven product...that's about as low as a company can go imo.I've never been threatened myself or had my account banned for commenting, but I've never posted with my game name to reddit or ever posted any videos of my play.  I have however seen for myself the emails Gaijin sent to people and the emails from search engines and youtube advising a players content was removed due to copyright violations by request from GJ due to negative commentary in said video.I'm not going to dicuss it on the forums, respomd with feedback, or complain anymore myself.  I'm done...no matter what they change and what they add, if they realize their end goal for the game before it dies completely, if hell freezes over, if they bury me to my neck in sand in the desert sun, pour honey on me and leave me for the ants, I'll not be back.I'll admit that fun can still be found once every few matches, but most are nothing more than free for alls and even the sim battles now have yolo players.  The degredation of gameplay is immesuarable.  Want a crash and burn game that offers a good chance of winning to a yolo team?  All they have to do is run russian planes and tanks and they'll win more often than not.  I've never harped on the bias, but always felt it.  The time came when I decided to ""when in rome"" and in fact exploited it.  I switched to russian planes and tanks so I could still enjoy the game more and honestly, the bias is real...they get hit for damage less(can be hit lots, but very few good hits will ever count as dmg), have magical armor, and can kill most things just by shooting in the general direction without aiming, etc.A few particular vehicles of other nations stand out as exceptional but most of other nations are terrible in comparison...from their overall flight perfomance to their win rates by default, and very importantly, the quality and overall hit chance of their weapons.  The russian vehciles upped my win rate significantly...it came to be that I expected wins when I ran russian lineups - even if I played ""dgaf"".  Just no fun.The game is still early access technically, even after 4 years.  Only 1/2 the game they claimed to be making has ever surfaced.  Visually, the vehicles look great!  The terrain and such is lackluster at best.  I think, in the end, this is one of those games that should serve as a template for a new production done by a better quality company with more respect for the players they rely on for both funds and success.  Their censorship is over the top though.  Even if they fix it all and finish the development, I'll still not return due to Gaijins aggressive tactics on censorship of comments they don't want others to hear..I think some of the devs must be throwbacks from the old days...the only media they want for their game is ""state-run"" and ""approved"".Luckily they cannot forcibly remove Steam reviews.The storm has rolled in...see you in more friendly skies...tldr; read it or don't...the thumb is visible regardless.

As a German tanker I'm alright fighting Is-2's, Pershings and all the tanks made from 1945 and below but fighting tanks from the future is kinda crazy, how can my super thick Maus compete with tanks that can penetrate its amour anyway.(and yes i know that Germans tanks are for long ranged combat but if everyone in our team keeps going long range who's going to rush?)I would play this game again if they would at least fix the BR			"

												Ignore the hours played, it's closer to 1000 but Steam decided not to count them when I started launching the game without itWhat's to say really? The game was rife with potential but is constantly re-broken with every patch. The developers are really trying, but unfortunately have no way to properly communicate with the community, so they end up ""fixing"" what isn't broken and breaking further what's already irrepairably damaged.The management, the forum moderators, and everyone else involved with community-to-developer relations has not a bloody clue as to what they're doing. Community asks for bug fixes and flight model updates for a certain aircraft? Gaijin ignores that aircraft. Community asks for repair costs for a certain nation to fall in line with the rest? Gaijin doubles the repair costs for that nation.And just don't even try to criticize them in any way. The entire management team can't take a shred of criticism, and pretends the community is out to get them, all the while actively antagonizing the community and ignoring their requests. Forum posts regarding poor balancing or unhistorical performance are met with smug, arrogant condescension.... IF they aren't flat out removed.You want to play an arcade flight game? World of Warplanes (never thought I'd say that)You want a simulator? IL2, DCS, the list goes on to a billion.And did I mention this game is free? It's free..... and I still wouldn't recommend a download. The company involved has spurned all support of the game. They deserve to watch their game crumble, but either way will end up blaming the ""toxic"" community they bred.3/10 - Disappointing beyond all measure, imbalanced and poorly managed beyond all comprehension. Run by completely oblivious, close minded fools. Would have recommended 3 months ago, can't even suggest a trail run now.			"

												Over all nation's planes performance in real life and other WW2 plane games.  German planes > British planes > American planes > Japanese planes > Soviet planesBut In Warthunder Soviet planes > AllSoviet planes = Motherland Rockets with cannons that can instant kill everything on the planet in a single burst.I used to love this game and it had so much potential when it was new released back in the days. but the game becomes very unbalance in every new updates. Gaijin secretly nerf other nation and buff soviet vehicles in every updates over years. Same for both planes and tanks. The developers don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about customers's suggestion and also strictly bans alot of customers that speak againsts them and their unbalnce soviet buff. They are still continue to buff soviet and break the game. Everyday and every month people are leaving this game because of this crap. That why i thumbs down.

												While War Thunder is a very good looking game and arguably one one of the best WWII aviation games available, the state that the game is in now is unplayable (100% due to Gaijin's stubborness and inability to acknowledge or fix glaring issues). It is completely unacceptable and no one should attempt to play this game until its developers start to listen to the games community and the valid complaints they have, fixing the issues instead of disregarding them. I really want War Thunder to grow as a community, and i really enjoyed playing it, but at the moment, Gaijin and War Thunder have reached a new low.			"

They are trying hard to sweep this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t under the carpet. Trying and failing. This game is flooded with hackers to the point its ridiculous bs.

												Ive got over 300 hours on this game, and though its fun, i wouldnt recommend it to anyone. This game proclaims to be ""Historically Accurate"" but i assure you its far from. Like most of the other negative reviews state, this game is extremely bias towards russian tier vehicles. The only time it actually seems remotely fair is when your playing as planes. German tanks are practically made of paper while the T34 and its predecessors seem to be made of Unobtainium. In my opinion, wait it out. Sooner or later the devs will finally realize this game will continue to lose its popularity until said issue is fixed. As of now this review is staying negative.			"

Better than Rosetta Stone!Play unhistorical vehicles!Hate everyone!Get rammed to death!Blessed by Stalin APHE!Soviet nation best nation!-10/10.In all seriousness due to Steam not saving my review I had a nice long review explaining why I don't recomend this. If you have friends,and the patience of a saint,then by all means try it. But don't fall into the pit of buying a premium vehicle or item. Gaijin is a terrible dev and hasn't listened to the community in years now. The 5 ranking BR system doesn't work. It's designed to make them money and frustrate the hell out of you. Normally,that isn't a bad thing. However,in this BR(that's been ♥♥♥♥♥ed about since it came out) is very bad. Most Soviet vehicles end up undertiered(a few US ones do too) and Germany and IJN get over tiered. UK kind of falls in the middle.If you want to rage the least,you should play USSR. Generally the best unhistorical vehicles. If you want to rage the most,play Germany and Japan. USA and UK fall in between that. It looks pretty at least. It's a damn fine pretty game.			"

												Amazing Graphics, Great game, 5/5 hands down.Edit 1/23/16:While the game still has amazing graphics, the Devs need to listen to the community instead of being greedy. This game has the potential to be one of the best games to have ever been released.I do not change my opinion on recommendation because It is a great time waster and it still can be fun.Edit: 11/27/16The game's gameplay and community are certainly degrading, being level 100 with the majoirty of the game's vehicles unlocked. The CBT for Naval is certainly a refreshing thing to say the least.But I still retain the fact that the Devs and Game Masters need to listen to the community and hear their cries for change.  My Biggest problem is that I can get 10,000 research points in Air Realistic easy, but when it comes to Ground Forces I struggle to get more than 4k a match sometimes only getting 2k. This is absurd as late game tanks are 380,000 points to unlock. This means I have to play over 200 games to get a couple of vehicles. "

												It must have been 4+ years ago that I played the beta of this game. At that time, this game was more like  simulator style ''Wings of Prey'' but with some mmo progression elements and better multiplayer. For me, those were the good days. I love realism and simulator games, and the red and blue letter markers you see hovering over friends and enemies, and other UI elements of arcade battles and realistic battles break that immersion for me. In any case, since those old times I've seen this game go downhill step by step. Gaijin Entertainment has decided there is more money to be grabbed with simple game mechanics which makes the game accessible to a wider audience, even console gamers who have joined in on their PS4 as of the past year. However for people like me, this has slowly taken away everything that I initially likes. Progression has become more pay to advance faster. As a result of this new business model, Arcade and realistic battles have been gaining a lot of players, while simulator battles has been draining players steadily. It has come to a point where simulator battles only play a minor role in event missions, in which a person is not even able to pick their tier or vehicle of choice in many cases. This week I finally decided to uninstall the game when I discovered that while I was not playing the game for a few months, they changed the tank sniper mode aiming mechanics entirely to a very weird and completely unplayable state for me, with no alternative option to switch back to old style controls (at least not in simulator battles as I understand it). Which means that I can only play the by now extremely scarce simulator flight battles. There is nothing for me anymore in this game now, and I will say goodbye to it after many years of fun. If things ever change I may come back, however with Gainjin's new mindset I don't see that ever happening. To make a simple conclusion:-Do you like World of Tanks merged with World of Planes, with better mechanics, graphics and a better experience in general? Totally play this game! -Do you like a highly immersive experience with many elements similar to the challange of simulator games? This used to be pretty good, but not anymore. Go play Il-2.			"

												DISCLAIMER: Although it shows i played less then 60 hours on steam, i have well over 900 hours outside of steam.http://i.imgur.com/9R7mDRS.jpg--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great graphics.Great performance.Gameplay is awesome.Terrible balance.Bad match making.Incomplete game, full of vehicles that behave like UFO's.I have played this game for more than 2 years waiting for their promised changes to take place, only for developers to retract or outright lie. In the begining they said the focus would be realism and historical accuracy, but over the months more and more arcade elements were introduced and the realistic and simulator community completly ♥♥♥♥ on, simulator community in particular is good as dead, thanks to the complete negligence of developers.They exploit broken content to get moneys and realese an endless stream of clone premium vehicles that add nothing to the game.The worst moderating team and PR that i ever seen on any game, CEO comes to forum and said some of the most stupid things ever to the playerbase.It looks good, it plays worse then WoT when it comes to balance, match making and net coding, it is just a damned frustrating mess that shows no signs of clear direction or intent, every patch they tinker with stuff and that was uncalled for, it is clear they don't know what they are doing and they bit off more then they could chew.Patch after patch that is nothing more then content dumps, most of which always badly balanced or unfinished and then takes 3 to 4 mini-patches to get things to a minum acceptable level. Also they base their balacing around  player statistics and that is why this game is hopeless in that respect.Gaijin's motto: -We try fix what is not broken and instead break that also.Not worth the time.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:As of 9/2016 this game is still a pile of garbage. If you are planning to give a try stay on arcade mode and nothing else. SB as been forsaken by Devs and RB is a waste of time, especially RB with planes. You will waste 20 mintues hunting a enemy fighter so that then he drags the fight to his base and have the Ai AAA kill you with super accurate fire. This is not a game for those looking fair chalange.P.S.Tank battles are more cancerous now then in the closed Beta, enjoy getting spawn killed repeatedly, as Gaijin has no spawn protection mechanism and all maps are tiny ( and therefore easy for fast vehicles to exploit).

												Well i decided to change my rating, but i still wouldn't recommend playing it seriosly. The BR system is still bulllsh*t, ATMGs were a terrible idea, and i just couldn' resist some russian bias. The game is full of bugs and server issues. Example of some russian bias: Leo 1 HEATFS peneterates T-54 frontal, hits the ammo, nothing happens. T-54 shoots back, Leo 1 goes boom. Example number 2: A bug affected the performance of the IT-1, they fixed it hours later. They broke the RakJPz 2, still not fixed. Panther G is a submarine (somewhat accurate, but the engine wouldn't run 2m under water).			"

												Great potential, but that alas is where the greatness ends.Terrble faction balance, see Russian Bias, God awful matchmaking for RB/SB and eon long waiting times are just a select few of the miriad of problems that you face with this game, add to this the grindfest of later tier unlockin and P2W nature of the game you have an unenjoyable experiance.And lets not forget the censorship of Gijan against its community and anyone who would dare use their freedom of speech to point out flaws with the game.

												The linux port for this crashes after the login, and has done for about 8 months at this point. The devs clearly don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Shame, because the game mechanics are actually pretty satisfying.Edit 31/03/2017: This game is now working on linux again. Whether it's because the devs changed something or because I swapped my AMD graphics card for a Nvidia one a few months ago is a mystery I cannot help you with.			"

												I have been on Warthunder on and off. And it's constantly the same thing, 1 Nation is OP as ♥♥♥♥ and all the others keep getting nerfed. Please, either fix the balancing matches for skill level (Tired of sh*t teammates screwing up the game), balance nations or just put the ACTUAL HISTORICAL values. Until then, beatings will continue until morale improves on my end, and I will play once again, once the game is ""stable"".			"

												Can be fun at low tiers, like tier 5 and below. Above that the game balance in arcade battles is pretty poor. Tier 10 and above is horrible in arcade. Ground strike maps usually end pretty quickly with very few planes actually shot down due to bombers destroying the enemy airfield, which is a autowin. Historic Battles is the only place where there's decent fun to be had in higher tiers, but wait times are horrid and sometimes you end up in games where half the teams are AI.There's also some pretty blatant pay to win schemes going on in the game. Instead of earning xp for your air crews and unlocking upgrades through gameplay, your air crews and planes can be maxed out with real money.			"

												War Thunder has been a very good game from the beginning, but over the months it has been degrading.Lots of vehicles and lots of different game modes to play (campaign, co-op, random player run battles (custom battles,) arcade, realistic, and simulator battles.) The game looks great too. But over the last year the developers have taken a very hard turn towards trying to milk the game than to actually listen to the community and fix many issues that have plauged the game. Though the turn to milking has been going on for a year and a half, since the start of this year (2015) it has increase sharply.The official forum team (International one) are run by a ignorant unproffessional who thinks the community are over-reacting, haters, or even paid by the competiton to ruin the game's reputation when they are pointing out a problem. There is many more problems. The main one is mainly balance issues in game (Battle ratings.) But, I do recommend, you try the game yourself even if I a old grumpy veteran from early 2013 am going on negatively. Many new players love the game even with the apparent problems.			"

												The Russian bias is real in this game, so unless you intend to play anyone but Russian, planes or tanks, expect allot of frustration when they seem to be the only ones that they want to be allowed to 1-hit people, when they spend so much time talking about increasing the battle duration and nerfing down anyone elses ammo that comes close to the lethal destructive potential of non-historical Russian APHE.If only it weren't so much better than world of tanks, so much more realistic other than when gaijin arbitrarily swings the nerf bat at something like british APDS turning it into a needle gun where you virtually have to kill every individual crew member. Whats that, high tier british tanks ONLY get APDS other than their HESH rounds? its OK, top tier Russians still using non-historically performing APHE rounds and killing people just fine? lolololol.Planes can be just as bad, just wait until your running into the hordes of Yak-9's often put up against planes that where historically flying 3 years before them, with a flight model thats an absolute joke and seemingly made from bullet proof stalinium.

If you plan to play, do not play the USA or German Ground tier. Only Russian. If you plan to play the air forces do not play the USA, British, German, or Japanese. Only Russian. The russian bias in this game is as real as it'll ever get. People can say whatever they want to say but the fact is, russian bias through and through. Only play if you're interested in playing russia.			"

												Generally a very nice game with excellent graphics. However, due to the new matchmaking system which matches bi-planes with cannon-planes, I would not recommend it to new players until Gaijin changes the matchmaking again, because as new player you will have to start with bi-planes and are therefore only free point to others.

												Throughout the course of this game, my opinion has largely changed. I used to recall on the game as a pioneer of the aircraft simulator franchise as it embarked into the realms of World War II and its epic course, now I can only review this game as a mediocre displacement from that former realization of it being a ""wonder"". To begin, the company, Gaijin Entertainment, is ridiculous at best. I used to be a strong advocate of another title of the company - Star Conflict - until they nearly dedicated all resources to War Thunder alone. The company is infamous for dropping titles and other assets in pursuit of other monetary ventures. I still rather miss playing Star Conflict as it felt like a new take on space combat (Mind you, this was before Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and several other acclaimed space simulators to be). Though my regards on Star Conflict do not reflect War Thunder, it reflects my opinion of the company that seems like it desires to be the next EA of Russia. Oh that reminds me, in its conveying of the depressing updates of Star Conflict, and other titles, they apparently have no English representive (Or that person needs to be fired) as it seems like the company uses Google Translate to loosely translate press releases to the customer. Personally, I like to hold onto Star Conflict and War Thunder simply so that I can read statements with grammatical errors so blatantly obivious, it is a pain to the eye while a laughter to the brain. To the matters of War Thunder, I used to play this game on a daily basis - to this day I maintain 175.5 hours - I would most likely have 1,000+ if I did not stop playing this game however. With the release of patch 1.37, to ""decrease"" waiting times for flight battles, Gaijin decided to remove several tiers and merge them into a few. Now, what does that mean? It means instead of matching against a player with a similar aircraft tier, it means going against individuals that can either be incredibly above you in level or incredibly low. To me, this seems like an attack against those who are just picking up War Thunder. How is it that a company can maintain a player basis when it invites new ones into battles that are significantly outmatched? I suppose the developers are able to achieve this, but I suppose the fame will outrun its course.As a reflection though of the current update, Ground Combat, I was elated beyond scale. I stayed up overnight to download the update and to finally get into my tank to discover how fun it was. While the ground forces update is exceptional, it is amazingly generic. I would dare to say it seems like Gaijin dissected World of Tanks to mirror the tanks and battles to the very   controls and combat. Personally, I almost laugh simply because I have wondered if Gaijin Entertainment and WarGaming (Developers of World of Tanks, Wartanks, and Warships) are brothers - family in ownership.Though my opinion and reflection of War Thunder is based primarily upon patch 1.37 and the company's background, I cannot sadly recommend this game. I still take fun in participating in air battles and tank battles on the occasion. Knowing the company's background, I cannot but wonder when they devise a new title that maintains such high success if not higher than War Thunder, when they will suddenly drop frequent updates to pursue the next monetary venture. If you're interested, look up Star Conflict on Steam and review updates and other news for the game. Everytime that I do that now, I simply get depressed. I wonder if people even know that this company has maintained other somewhat successful titles before this one, considering it seems like Gaijin throws old titles and other former successes off a cliff into a void of neglect. In my opinion, if a company releases a title, that company must maintain fixes for bugs and glitches while releasing new content to increase the player basis - in a professional manner. Considering Gaijin most likely uses Google Translate rather than an English interpreter, translations of the updates and other press notices are astounding. My yet born nephew would probably understand and convey English better than Gaijin. NOTE: This review reflects mainly upon the ethics of the company. If you are looking for a game to play occasionally that reflects your desires to defeat the Axis or Allied Powers of World War II in a simulated fashion, I would recommend this game. Though, I would stay WarGaming's titles would be a better choice. As a very frequent gamer, please take into account the ethics of  Gaijin - the next EA of Russia.  "

												While this is a good game, it is rediculously biased. When I first got this game it was a blast and I had a good time. So based on gameplay I would have given it a positive recommendation. I am an older gamer, from the mid 80's and as a rule I dont like making ingame purchases. But I am also an American and lack common sense. Ask any Canadian about us. Anyways, I made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all ""lost"" when I bought some upgrades. By no means did these upgrades use all of it. I submitted a ticket and to make a long story short I was told I would not be refunded the ingame currency and that I must have spent it all. What makes this all ludicrous is I never recieved the upgrades I supposedly spent everything on. I never played it again. In hindsight I dont feel I really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. So I hope my review will temper the ""very positive"" rating they have right now since I dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. I will just go back to Wot where I haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your IQ is 3 points above ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That would be 73 points for all you guys who dont quite hit the mark....

												Overall it's a good game, not pay to win. But after 1.37 patch, matchmaking isn't history authentic anymore, and new unlocking system making this game hard to open new aircrafts\tanks (way below limit where you still can get fun). Grind, grind grind. They need to double the exp points(including crew exp) to make this game any interesting to play without premium. On other side premium is too expensive for an average player. I still playing it only because i've got a friends to play with and i've opened almost all USSR and USA crafts before 1.37 was released.So, at current state of matchmaking, prices for premium, and amount of experience point you need to unlock.I don't recommend this game. Maybe check it later, if only they will change their minds about all greedy decisions they made last half year.			"

												I have almost 300 hrs into this game. It's not something you want to take seriously. If you do then you will become very frustrated and spend multiple hundreds of dollars on. I know because I've spent over $500 on upgrades across multiple countries. With Russia not being our closest allie. I stayed away from them. I was born and raised in the USA. So I went for my country and their allies. I didn't realize or know that this game is for the Russians. If you choose a faction make it the Russian's. They are by far and wide more powerful than anything. The kill the most powerful tanks of any other country with one shot, even if it's multiple levels lower. Don't waste your money or time. I'm finding all the free to play games are jacked up. I will stay away from them. There will be a shift away from them and they will learn and go bankrupt. hahahaha			"

												This game has turned ♥♥♥♥. I actually ♥♥♥♥ something out this morning that was less ♥♥♥♥ than this game. True story. The game is essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money. ""Free"" research points cannot be used unless you have eagles to convert them into usable research points... and of course eagles cost money. You can happily play through the first tier of planes for each region relatively easily, however as the tiers progress, the goals and upgrades become harder and harder to obtain, especially on free-to-play and thus push you towards getting a premium account or paying for game currency. When I first started playing the game, it certainly didn't have such an obvious push for cash but as the updates have rolled on, it's shown it's money grabbing side.Money aside, the game is relatively good. The arcade mode is most people's favourite, with realism lowered and more emphasis on action. There are however two other online modes: Real Battles and Simulation. The game also offers a single player mode and campaign. The gameplay itself has been simplified and allows for control almost entirely through a mouse. There is a vast array of aircraft for several different regions, all of which can be upgraded and to a limited extent, customised overtime. There are also a multitude of maps, most containing land/sea units which have to be eliminated along with airfields and bases. For more information read a better review than this one...			"

												Love the hell out of this game since it is one of very, very few places where you can play something like what they have made here.  BUT that being said I can't recomend it because there are many game modes, many tiers of vehicles, Tanks and Planes, for many nations.  Why is that bad you ask.  Because there may be 5,000 people as of the writing of this review but they are all spread out over all those modes, tiers, vehicles, nations, and servers.  And odds are since the devs are giving the most attention to ground forces that is where most people will be.In summory there are too few people playing now whith too many ways to play and the Match Maker is apualing and is all but unfixable que times can be anywhere from 0 seconds up to and above 20 minutes.

												I started playing War Thunder at update 1.39. The game has changed drastically. At update 1.39 I saw great potential in the game. Recently the developers have annoyed me to the point where I dont even want to pick this game up and play it. They advertised this game as being a simulator. All though there are some aspects of ""realism"", I've noticed that they have added a few things that really strike my nerve. Additions such as paper tanks that never saw combat  ie Maus, T-25, T-44, etc. Its gotten to the point where you would drive a tank from 1945, such as the m26 pershing, and be up against Leopard 1's, T-55's, and m60 pattons. On top of that the developers do not listen to the community which could possibly help them change broken aspects of the game! In short, If you love games that are historically accurate, I do not recommend playing this game.*Recently this game has gotten even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ since the addition of cold war era equipment. Word of advice never touch this game.*			"

												Where to begin. This game, at first glance, seems like a fun game, and truthfully most of the time it is. However, the cons outweigh the pros in this game. For starters, once you enter tier 3 ground forces, the grind becomes unbelievably long and tedious. Even the modifications you have to research take quite a while, and it sucks that the game hinders you until you unlock these modifications. For example, not having parts or FPE can really screw you over, but if you play careful you should be fine. The problem lies with having to research adjustment of fire and the elevation mechanism. Your gun will be inaccurate as all hell until you research these two, which again is very frustrating. The whole battle rating system is confusing and unfair (Tiger E going against Tiger II's and T-44's when your line up is a Tiger E, H1, and a pz4 g). Some maps seems to favor certain spawnpoints, and the game can be a load of horsecrap sometimes with the gameplay. My main problem is the developers tactic of ignoring their community and making it nothing more than a money grabber pay to win game. And when I say pay to win, I dont mean buying premium tanks, I mean having to pay money to speed up a tedious research system. All in all, if your looking for a fun game to play, then by all means download this game. But dont expect to play it for too long before the games bullcrap starts to shine.			"

												So far I've clocked more than 800 hours in this game, and that's only after moving it to Steam.This game started out so well, and went so damn down hill. Me and some mates played all nations, both air and land, and what used to be a very good game with alot of options, has narrowed down to be a soviet game, basically. If you're flying planes you'll be generally way more successful with the soviet planes than any other nation, if you're playing land games you'll generally be way more successful in soviet tanks. And I do mean way more, like 5-6 times more.Graphics are really nice though, it's a beautiful game, but the development is going straight down the drain.You'll hear and read alot about bias, and see developers answer it is not so. But if you play this game, play all nations and make your own judgement.Developers for that matter, never had any grudge with them, but seen them more or less bully critics.And how many games do you know of that implements censorship on their forums? Try and make a post on any of the update threads.This game had such immense potential, and was going in such a good direction, when they for some reason just decided to nuke it all.			"

												Game is ♥♥♥♥. Total ♥♥♥♥. Insane ammount of russian bias. A T-34, a low tier tank, can take 5 hits to the front and 2 hits to the side. My mid tier tank gets one shotted by a T-34. Every time. They can shoot across the damn map! Russian tanks are much much faster. Do not spend any money on this game, especially since its so overpriced. I dont have anything else to suggest you, because WoT is a PTW piece of garbage too. Just dont play. Grinding is insane, as you have to play for 2-4 weeks just to get a new tank. Never play. No customer support as well. Maybe if we get enough people to leave the gam, Gajiin will fix it. "

War Thunder: Money Well Spent; A total of Zero USD.Revised Edition!Pros:• Fun plane combat... Sometimes• Fun ground combat... Sometimes• Wide selection of vehicles... To grind forCons: • A lack of admittance to problems• Unbalanced gameplay• Game relies more on type of vehicle than skillOverview: War Thunder is an arcade like flight simulator with added tank combat for near full scale battles of both land and air. Published by the company Gaijin Entertainment and labeled as an MMO it is quite unlike any game I've ever played. There is an assortment of game modes ranging from Arcade, to Realistic, to Simulator, to Historical Events and Campaigns. There is also an assortment of Planes, Tanks, and Armored Vehicles that you can get your hands on, most of which all have their own style of play that differs from game mode to game mode. The community is rather live and active although not always in your language. None-the-less you're sure to find what you're looking for even if it isn't what you want to hear. It's an extremely fun and rather addicting game that costs you as little as a mouse click; that is assuming you can handle the grind and don't want every vehicle and advantage.The Facts: 1: Hit detection is a joke. There is a phrase we use called 'sparkling' and it's when you see your rounds sparkle on an aircraft. When this happens they do no damage because your client is not in sync with the server meaning the rounds you see hit only happened on your screen and never actually registered with the server.  This is exactly as bad as it sounds.2: Crew Points. In this game Crew Points is something that matters way too much. You gain Crew Points from simply playing the game, but in rather minute amounts. The survivability, mobility, accuracy, and pretty much everything is effected by Crew Points. I have over 1000 hours in this game and I've yet to max out a crew on any nation for either planes or tanks. This is in large part because I refused to pay money.3: Pay 2 Win. Many people say this game isn't pay to win and I understand their stance on the matter. My opinion differs however. You can pay money for more Crew Points at an astonishing rate. You can buy Crew Slots so you can bring more planes into Arcade Battle. You can buy Bushes and other Cover to add to your tank. You can buy Premium Time which helps you unlock Parts and Vehicles faster along with giving you more in game currency to unlock those Parts and vehicles. You can even unlock Parts flat out with money. Most of these you can get by simply playing the game others require money and each varies in the advantage it gives. In my opinion if you pay money and instantly become better than you were before you are by definition Paying to Win.4: The Grind for Vehicles and Parts and Crew Experience. Once you finish a grind and get a new vehicle it will have zero Parts. This fact alone puts you at a rather large disadvantage even more so for tanks with the inability to put out fires or repair and even to a larger extent to people who have no Crew Points. This essentially in my opinion throws an element of skill out the window. For higher tier vehicles you will be held at a rather severe disadvantage for many hours of gameplay until you unlock the essential items to be compete effectively. This forces users to either grind it out in what I personally think is a rather miserable experience or 'lets' the users who don't want to wait simply purchase the parts with money. All this means is the person who plays longer or spends more will be statistically better simply because of their Unlocks and Crew Points.5: Match Making is horrible. This is one of the things you will learn rather quick in this game. You will, at least half of the time, face someone of a higher Battle Rating than you and the better you do the more it will happen. In planes this means they can out gun you, out turn you, out run you, and out climb you. In tanks this can be expressed with one one word: OVERKILL. The shier disadvantage you are in when you're facing someone of a higher Battle Rating is enough to make you write a bad review like this.6: Russian Bias. There is a reason people joke about Soviet planes being made of 'Stalin Wood' or complain about the Soviet planes having laser spray cannons. What makes matters worse is they are Historically Accurate in regards to the 'Secret Documents recently discovered in Secret Bunkers'. That is an actual quote and I can't even argue it. The game in essentially built around everything that the Soviet vehicles do well at. There are exceptions to this like everything, but for the most part it is blatant.7: Cover and Concealment. Since you're able to change your graphics settings you're able to provide yourself with a clear advantage over others by removing Concealment from the game. Doing so removes most shrubs, all grass, and most all foliage on the battlefield. This allows you to see much farther and through a lot more than Tankers who are player on higher settings. This leads you to being shot from places that you can not see yourself.8: Randomness. Pure and simple randomness. From having your wing ripped off from a single small caliber bullet. To having your tank explode from hitting a tin can in the road. To having your pilot knocked out in the first shot from 1.5km out. To having your tank bounce a round off of it's barrel, have it land on your gunner port, have a sliver of it's metal touch your ammo, and have you now at the vehicle select screen wondering how. This game is completely and utterly random in most every regard that matters.Recommendation:It's sad when you see a game with potential drift so far away from what it could become. Its even more sad when you see a game hide its problems behind the dedicated player base and by those who willingly choose not to see them. This was a fun game for me for many hours, but those hours took a toll. I started to see the problems for what they where and began to realize they most likely will never be fixed. Because the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one.I would not recommend this game to people simply because it is not anywhere close to being friendly to new players. Those that have invested time and money into this game will always have a strong advantage over new players to an extent that it would ruin their experience.			"

												The game itself is still cool with tons and tons of potential. You will enjoy it if you are looking for some casual, braindead, short term fun. However, if you're not braindead and you end up a little bit smitten with the game's potential, you quickly find out that the game's biggest problem are its developers and most notably the absolutely atrocious decisions of project management, the completely skewed priorities they set, the nearly indisputable fact that these people obviously do NOT play their own game and the utter incompetence of the 'community managers' who act more akin to secret police than to actual community managers.Gaijin Entertainment is killing their own game, one patch a time. They do not listen to their community, they do not play their own game, they have been making awful decisions for years now with zero results to back them up. It would take much more time and effort than I am willing to put in to describe all the problems with WT and Gaijin, not to mention that people have mentioned them literally thousands of times by now. This game and its developers are pancaking this sinking airship into the ground at a record rate. Stay away from it.			"

												Just, please, spare yourself from this hellhole. I made the horrible mistake of playing this game and leaving it back in 1.37. I wish I kept kept playing, because the game was playable back then. I imagine that you come to this game because you like WW2 vehicles like me. Gaijin (The developers)  give you the finger constantly during your experience with the game. Insane bias. My friend pumped 300 .50 cals rounds in a yak-9 and didn't evn get a hit registered, but he could see the impacts on the yak-9. BEFORE YOU EVEN POSSIBLY THINK HE'S A BAD SHOT, THE YAK WAS LINED UP. Oh, and you know how japaneese aircraft blow up when they are set on fire? Well yeah, the fires on russian planes will take a flap off if you're lucky, and will always go out.What about the Germans? Well, as a German main, I am disgusted at how horrificly underpowered they are, it takes a fully upgraded BF-109 to be any use. FW-190's get sniped by russian gunners on auto, but that's actually a normal occurance to ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT.How about tanks? I hear you ask. To put it simply, and kindly: a chaotic piece of s****. Armor has no meaning. And yes, I actually care, because so many tanks on lower tiers dont fight other tanks anywhere near their time period, so some are so unfaire, while later on at teir 5, armor is pointless, but the russians bounce Maus shells as if it were nothing.KEEP AWAY. I don't know why I hope to think it gets better and try playing more, I'll change the review when it gets it's old charm back, in the meantime, I reccomend you play World of Tanks or World of Warships, or even better, IL-2 over this, thing.

												Mechanically a good game with a lot going for it.But patch by patch the balancing and match making gets worse and worse and the developers ignore all complaints. Some tiers are neigh on unplayable right now, with planes and tanks with vastly different performance being pitted against each other. Your enjoyment of this game is now mostly reliant on the MM putting you in a match where you get fair opponents. And those matches are getting rarer and rarer, near to non-existent. It is now not a game I would recommend anyone spend the slightest bit of money on. Play for free and play it casually, if at all.			"

												Seriously, its not worth the time. I've spent too much, and wasted my life on this game. Hell, I was even permanently banned of the forums for complaining. Gaijin doesn't listen to your complaints. Gaijin only cares about making money. Easy example, CBT tanks. CBT tanks are tanks that you must buy a pack to unlock or use. (This happened with American tanks and currently happening with British ones.) In order to unlock these, you need to purchase a pack. These tanks are really OP so for people to enjoy tank games they need to buy these packs. As soon as their out of CBT? Nerfed into oblivion.			"

												I don't usually write reviews for games, but in this case I will make an exception so as to lend my considerable time spent playing War Thunder to the decision-making process.First on the agenda is the ever-present complaint of ""Russian Bias"" or, as it's more popularly known, ""I suck at this game so I'm going to complain that the nation the company is based in is OP.""  Seriously, if there is any Bias in this game whatsoever, it has been mitigated over time by the inclusion of more vehicles for other nations and the refinement of the game mechanics.  Furthermore, this game is HIGHLY skill-based, which means you need to get good to do good if you play any mode other than Arcade.  While this may require a time investment, it does pay off by providing the player with a FAR more rewarding gameplay experience than anything Wargaming could shovel out of their pit of despair.  I must, however, concede that the game DID have bias when it first came onto Steam, of that there is no doubt.  However, since then other nations have been added to the game and the game mechanics (such as spalling, armor deflection, and ammunition properties) have been refined further and further.  At this point, the only Russian Bias that might exist has to do with their aircraft, but I'm not familiar with that situation personally because I predominantly play tanks.  In the case of tanks, I can confidently say that Bias is virtually nonexistent as Russian tanks are easy enough to knock out if you know what you're doing.  Also, the Panther's gun eats T-34's alive because its shell normalization is so good.Speaking of shells, you recall when I said that to do good, you had to get good?  This includes learning what ammunition types do what and, especially in the case of Sim battles, learning what tanks belong to which nation.  When it comes to ammunition and its capabilities, it pays dividends to know that APCBC rounds are more capable of defeating sloped armor than APCR.  The first thing to remember is that this isn't World of Tanks, and APCR in War Thunder isn't the magical ""I win"" button it is in World of Tanks.  Furthermore, it pays off to know that loading a full load of ammunition is not actually a bad thing.  Yes there are MANY people who will tell you otherwise, and in some tanks I admit that it may be true that loading a diminished load of ammo is actually a good idea, but if you are even halfway decent at War Thunder, you'll notice that you're surviving longer and running out of ammo when you really don't need to if you do load a minimal supply.  It's details like this that make War Thunder so good; it makes the player think, and therefore makes them better teammates.Moving on, let's talk about the devs shall we?  Gaijin has been notorious in the past for ignoring their community and doing what they damn well please with War Thunder, and to an extent that is still true, but at the same time Gaijin HAS been making an active effort to pay more attention to what they're community says.  On the one hand, I'm happy they're paying attention, there are problems that do need to be resolved.  On the other hand, I'm EXTREMELY happy they continue to ignore the community for the most part.  Why would I be happy about this you ask?  Well, for one, the majority of the War Thunder community plays Arcade, which is just...not War Thunder's main mode, no matter what anyone may tell you.  Unfortunately, the fact that the majority of the playerbase plays Arcade means that they tend to complain about game mechanics and balance that are really quite alright, and some of the REALLY hardcore elements tend to zealously campaign against the existence of Realistic Battles and Simulator Battles.  I personally believe that Arcade is not War Thunder's main mode, it still feels tacked-on even after all the TLC that Gaijin has given it, but despite that I do feel it is a necessary evil as the mode keeps the most toxic and bigoted elements of the community contained.Speaking of the community, it's not as bad as some people say it is.  Yes, it does have it's fair share of idiots and toxic trolls, but they are not as prevalent as many would lead you to believe.For those who may be interested, the graphics in this game are fantastic, easily besting World of Tanks or *shudders* World of Warplanes in graphical fidelity.  The sound design is also quite good, with the tanks actually sounding like tanks and the planes, for the most part, sounding like planes.  You still have the odd flying lawnmower and tank with the wrong engine audio, but those are easily ignored in the face of everything else.Let's see, what have we missed?  Ah, yes, the ""issue"" of ""bad balance"" that you see so many people complain about.  I'm going to be brutally honest and say that I could not give Two ♥♥♥♥♥ if the game was actually unbalanced or not.  I personally believe that if a game is unbalanced, it provides the player in a supposedly disadvantageous position a real challenge, and a chance to really shine as a player who knows what they're doing.  I commonly say that there are no bad tanks, only bad tankers, and this game really demonstrates that by requiring a player to practice good situational awareness and intelligent decision-making.  The game is one of those few MMO's that actually rewards good players for being good, though good fortune still factors in like it would in reality.There are other reasons to enjoy War Thunder as well.  Gaijin has created a detailed and comprehensive custom battles system that allows players to create entirely custom matches with settings of their own preference.  This has allowed entire player-run tournaments to be created with special rule sets and custom vehicle lineups.  That's not all however, as Gaijin has added the ability for players to create entirely custom scenarios in which the creator of a scenario can edit virtually anything about it.  If you want to recreate the battle of Kursk down to every detail, you can.  Unfortunately, the custom scenario's system is still single-player only, but Gaijin recently announced that they are actively working on making the system multiplayer-capable, meaning players would be able to create, upload, and host entirely custom battles with things like forced ammunition loads, vehicle choices, and preset trigger events.  You could recreate the Normandy invasion if you wanted, complete with offshore bombardment, AT guns, Infantry, and specific tank spawn locations.Some people will commonly complain about the number of premium tanks in the game, but those people also forget that Gaijin has to fund development of the game in some way, and the prices for premium tanks and Golden Eagles is actually quite reasonable compared to the way Wargaming extorts you.I could go much deeper into reviewing the game, but I think I've made the majority of the better points towards downloading War Thunder and giving it a go.  I highly recommend this game, and I suggest that you give all game modes a try before you pronounce it terrible and give it up.  Every game has its flaws, and War Thunder is no different, but the game is being actively developed by a developer that is learning to communicate with its community more than it used to.  Not only that, but the game offers a truly unique experience that doesn't subject itself to the whims of RNGesus as often as health bar based games.  It is possible to get one-shot in this, but that feeling of blowing a tank sky-high with one shot of your own is something I have only ever felt in this game.  War Thunder is unique, and I hope it doesn't conform to what other MMO's are doing just because they're so Arcadey and successful because of it.			"

Not nearly as good as the game was, but you know all for the sake of ""beta"" status most players went along and continued playing. 1.35 came along and is still to this day considered the best update. But that was autumn 2013. 3 years ago.Since 1.37 the betastatus has ended and the game is officially released. With that came a totally toxic gaming developer, mod/admin community and more and more restrictions on the forums. Which would have been manageable if the game wasn't brough to its knees...which it did, obviously.Bottom line, WT was promising to be a historical and graphical astounding game but it has been completely destroyed by its developer and toxic mods/admins. The player numbers have dropped from 120k online to 40k-ish which tells you something as well.If you want to get started, I can't recommend this game anymore, it has become too much of a moneygrab (the recent navy beta that has been introduced is the new utter low Gaijin has fallen too) where if you have to start right now, you'll be frustrated after less than an hour. And there's no reason why you would get frustrated over a game.TL;DR:Used to be good, got destroyed by its developer and mod/admin. Chances are very slim that Gaijin will ever unlock its full potential.			"

												Save yourself the trouble and go play another game that does any sort of simulating or realistic combat scenarios on the ground or in the air. This game, for the first year or so, of its development, release and subsequent updates was a GOOD game. A fun game. A game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of Wargaming's World of Tanks fan/customer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes. All that changed with the introduction of their BS riddled battle rating system that they would, with each patch, adjust each plane's, and ground vehicles when they were introduced, ""battle rating"" to fight enemies the PLAYERS WHOM MAKE UP A TOP PERCENTAGE AND EXCELL within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else. Every. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Patch. Time and time again you see a major increase in the number of SOVIET aircraft with their UFO like flight models outperforming, even though the Soviet UFO should never have gotten off the airstrip, other aircraft that make the ""UFO"" seem like a volkswagen. The same exact @!$^ is occuring on the ground as you see some BULL!@#$ T-34 get ammunition at a 3.3 battle rating, think Shermans and barely upgunned Panzer 4's with higher velocity 75's, that can penetrate and one shot a Tiger. A TIGER at medium to long range.All in all, I would hope that those whom would be interested in this game..go play another game. Armored Warfare, World of Tanks or SOMETHING besides wasting your time on some Piece of !@$# that Gaijin refuses to get anywhere near balanced called World of Soviets. Oh wait sorry, ""War Thunder"" as they claim its called.			"

												First off, I used to love this game until the reccent patches made it borderline unplayable unless you play japs or russians. The american planes are always killed because .50 cal is like throwing pebbles at steel and they fly like bricks. The american tanks are armored like they're made of butter. The german tanks cant pin anything (Especially the Tiger H1). The russian tanks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the grind takes years when the RP gain from matches is 1-3K a match with premium. The Brit planes use cannons to rip the wings off of anything they face. And lastly, all the devs want is your money at this point. The game has become Pay to Win in so many ways, the premium planes out pace all other planes, the premium tanks are bulletproof and the RP gain is impossible to grind without premium accounts T4 and up. In short, dont play this game for the sake of your sanity and bank account.			"

												If you are looking for a WW2 flight simulator, this definitely it's not your game. Of course, have good graphics and some physics, but it's all. Seems more a Call of Duty, with plane skin. And you'll see, planes with doubtful flight model, weapons not working realistically because of hit detection problems and other issues, multiplayer missions and map designs forcing players and planes to act weird, different than an aerial combat of WW2: High altitude bombers flying low, strafing ground targets; Interceptors attacking ground targets; Ground attackers joining in dogfights; Bombers joining in dogfights; Bomber hunters afraid to attack bombers; planes of the same team attacking each other; in rarest times you can see any cooperation as aerial squadrons, and so on. And don't get surprised if your prop plane of the WW2 got in a match against a jet of Korean War era... it's pretty normal there.Well... they said, game still in Beta phase... So, they need fix and implement a lot of things yet... If you want give a try, be my guest...			"

												The best WW2 vehicle combat game you can get. Easy to play and understand and open to anyone. Wide variety of Historical aircraft to choose from and fly offering unparalleled flight combat and soon ground forces combat. The developers are a hard working and committed team who are always evolving and shaping things based on feedback. Excellent events and rewards on a regular basis and great community.			"

												Arcade flight simulator with varying degrees of difficulty, ranging from being able to maneuver heavy bombers in moutain passes to wild  unrecoverable death spins every time you try to bank too hard. Planes look historically accurate, some of the maps are based in historical places, no other merits for historical accuracy.			"

												Look, it's a great game for the first bit - and I love it to bits but the game seems to be going downhill following obscene BR compressions and whatnot - I've play days of this game and in its current state if you're looking for something to play competitively, look elsewhere.If you're only here for a bit of fun - by all means.

												Refering to the time I spent on this game, I think I'm eligible to show my rage about what War Thunder has became.I use to have a 10/10 review on this game. But...yeah, in past tense.Gaijin use to respect history. They add vehicles and make changes according to real data.Now Gaijin make changes according to the amount of Vodka.Several most direct reasons that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off:1. US tank shells' penetration got nerfed and changed shot types (APBC to AP, like M103's M358 shots).2. XP55 incidents. (You should know what happened if you have the premium plane.)3. Bullsh*t changes to battle rating system. (Battle rating decides what vehicles you will see in a match.)4. Ridiculously unbalanced game while the CEO still insists the game is perfectly balanced.5. New vehicles always get sooooo OP for a couple of patches and then got nerfed to sh*t.6. Soviet noob rush kills everything.OMG can't list anymore. This list will become a 5000 words essay if you want me to list every bullsh*t currently in this game. Gaijin has been adding a bunch of unnecessary changes like UI changes into the game while the content of the game is as messy as my underwear closet. Stupid errors and mistakes are everywhere in the game. I afked for like 2 months and found out the game is even worse when I came back. I got so mad tonight and I deleted my previous 10/10 review and changed to this comment. Now I would literally give the game a -10/10 if possible.I loved this game Gaijin, we all loved this game. Plz plz plz plz don't kill your community. Overall, go to IL-2 or DCS World if you want to fly a plane. Go to WOT or Armoured Warfare if you want to play tanks.Update: just watched Phly's latest video

												If you dont want to suffer, play russian tree. This game is highly biased, for example my tiger 1 88mm gun shell bounces off t34 almost every time when its at slight angle and when it penetrates the 45mm armor there is not enough damage done to stop a t34, but when t34 hits tiger 1 with over 100mm of armor, even at slight angle, with its 85mm gun it breaks turret drive and knocks a crew out so you cant fight him back till he kills you, or it kills you instantly. I have shot t34s in back portion of turret where is ammo, and they often manage to run away, but when they touches my ammo rack its instant kill. American tree of tanks suffer even more.. Talking about planes, fighting mig 15s and mig17s with f80 or f2h is not fun at all. And every pach its getting worse. Now i regret playing this game and wouldnt recommend it to anyone.			"

												The game has a very good engine and a great variety of vehicles. And because it's a free to play game you can expect an ungodly grind unless you spend a LOT of money but that's just how these games work. The thing which really leeches the fun out of the game is the fact that as soon as you stick your head out of the first tier you will be matched against high tier 3 opponents. So how do you fight planes which are faster, turn better and have better guns and armor? Well, you don't. They will kill you head on, they will simply fly away, outturn or outclimb you if you manage to tail them. And how do you fight tanks which can penetrate your front armor with ease at long distance while you can maybe hope to damage them at close range from behind? Well, you don't. That's the basic failure of this game: Most of the time you will fight an uneven and unfair battle. Bottom line: The matchmaking in this game is plain broken.			"

												War Thunder is a free to play MMO Plane/Tank simulator with vehicles from the Spanish civil war, through World War 2 up to the Korean war.My hours in this game would make you think I'd recommend this game, but I can't in good conscience do that. This game has both absolutely terrible qualities and redeeming qualities but ultimately it's not enough to recommend this game and below I'll tell you why. This review will be based mostly on my thoughts as a realistic game mode player.If you want to skip the indepth review and just want my quick thoughts : It's a game that has great potential, but greed and lack of listening to the community are runing it. Give it a try if you're into your history or flight sim games as it's free, but you'll likely run into some things that will ruin it for you, I did and so have my friends who I play it with. Be it the grind, inbalance of matchmaking or the dreadful community.Good pointsLooks great - The game itself looks amazing, vehicles and locations have been carefully recreated to try their best to give an immersive experience and at a decent frame rate. I have a GTX 760 ti and run the air force part of the game at 100+ frames and the ground forces at 50+ frames on average. It dips from time to time depending on the map and the lighting.Optimised - Almost every update brings some new optimisation in the form of how the networking is handled or how everything is rendered and will run moderatley well on some modern potato machines.Choice - At this point in the game's development, there's a wide variety of what you can fly and drive with 5 nations : USA, Japan, Germany, Great Britain and the USSR. Every Nation has tanks except for Japan at the time of this review, and every Nation has a full air force, with Fighters, Bombers and Attackers to chose from and more are being added with each major update.Progression - To progress in this game, you research different vehicles at each tier, to progress to the next. You'll start off with Biplanes and eventually work your way up to Jets. Each vehicle has upgrades it can receive, from engine upgrades to armament upgrades like bombs or rockets, or bigger cannons. This sadly can end up being grindy if you don't have premium.Groups/Squads - If you have friends that play the game or will play it with you then you can form a group to go into matchmaking with, however you should ideally fly/drive vehicles of the same tier/battle rating (Battle rating is what defines what matches your vehicles go into, and what they go up against) Otherwise you can wind up with a slow, cumbersome biplane fighting against a post-war Jet.Game modes - There are 3 game modes in this game, Arcade which has little to no realism, other than bullets and shells have drop, certain armor cannot be penetrated by shells and you can't fly into space. 'Realistic' and that term is starting to become looser with every update but in this, your pilot can be knocked out if you pull high G turns, the flight models of planes are more realistic, you can rip of parts of your plane from going too fast. Lastly is simulator, it's called this as it is as a simulation of what it would of been like, or so they try to make it like that. In this game mode you have very little HUD, it is better off played with a joystick and your enemies have no markers over them, nor do friendlies at longer ranges.Bad pointsRealism - I don't mean this as in I don't like how realistic it is, on the contrary it's not realistic enough. From them adding planes/tanks that never flew or saw action such as the Maus or the Horten 229. Another problem is in the realistic game mode which will see only biplanes fighting in the Korean war, or some Alternate history rubbish, which is Gaijin's answer to what would of happened if the cold war escalated right after WW2. Late war vehicles are going up against Korean war vehicles thanks to a new, messed up matchmaking system and is apparently no longer worth playing in late war Jets, as they get decimated by Korean era Jets.Matchmaking - This used to be a good point, or so I would believe but nowadays like I mentioned, the higher tiers are messed up and no longer worth playing. at the lowest tier, you have 'reserve' vehicles which used to only fight other reserve vehichles, but due to lack of players searching for games the entire system has been compressed, which is unfair on new players, who get absolutely clubbed if they're in a biplane, and go up against early monoplanes with cannons. Some nations are favoured more than others, but I'll touch on that later.Lack of Map variety - This one was hard to word, as there's a lot of maps in the game, from almost every theater of war but some how the matchmaking doesn't like variety. Naval fighters for example in the American tree don't often get get into Naval maps, instead they get thrown in with the British on 'Alternate History:Berlin'. I've no clue why they've done this, there have been loads of terrific maps that are actually historical, such Malta and Guadal canal. This lack of variet often puts Bombers and attackers at a disadvantage as it's often more difficult, if not near impossible for them to contribute to their team, if all they have to attack is a carrier fleet, which will rip a single plane to shreds with laser guided flak( not actually laser guided).Community - This is pretty consistent with any game, particularly free games but the community is mostly God awful. There's obviously the few good people, who appreciate history, or how beautiful the game can look, but the majority is weeaboos, racists, unfunny meme-loving, man-childs or actual children. So just stay clear of that if you're still interested in the game.Exploits - Though I said previously that they've optimised the game for bad PCs, this meant they added ultra low quality settings so even your grandma's oven could run the game, this brought the option (which has thankfully been removed since then) to completely remove foliage such as bushes and small trees in ground forces. This would give players the advantage of being able to see other players, who try to hide behind this foliage, which is more often than not big enough to conceal a Tank. Now the only option they have left in, is the ability to turn of grass + foliage in your optics, which puts players, who don't want to cheat and play the game at higher settings at a disadvantage. Another option is the game, while not really cheating is an option called 'verticle targetting' which essentially allows planes that have fixed guns to shoot bullets out the sides of their guns, rather than where they're actually aiming, which results in a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t kills and deaths as I have experienced on both ends.Russian Bias - Now alot of people are skeptical, as am I about the so called 'Russian bias' in the game as it is made by Russian developers, who were born or lived in a time where the soviet union still existed and so did the Communist ferevour. A lot of players who say it exists are just outright bad players, who think their American bomber can out turn a Russian fighter and proceed to get shot down, then claim it's 'Russian bias' that they lost. I believe it's a combination of patriotism, and unfair matchmaking. For example, Russia goes up against Every nation, including it's allies but only in Korean war games and Alt History. This is often bad for the allies as they're split between British and American planes, which fly quite differently and fight differently, resulting in a split and on top of that, more allied players fly bombers and attackers which results in less fighters, which results in them being outnumbered in dogfights (usually). Secondly you get a lot of Russian fighters, usually their post war super-prop planes that first flew in say 1946, fighting German planes from 1942.Hopefully you found this review useful, if you did I'm glad I was of help.

												During my play time of warthunder i tested tanks all the way from closed beta to what it is today.and its a pile of ever loving purly rotted ♥♥♥♥.so mutch potential down the drain cause really its the only game out in development right now with modern graphics that could have made a epic tank combat but the fallowing killed it.they claim tanks operate like they did historicly which is a load of pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. denfesive smoke launchers dont work. cannons phase space like wot through buildings and other tanks. and if your down to two crew members who is aiming the gun and loading the gun while your driving to?low quality graphics still remove bushes trees and rocks.br rating system while is a good idea is really to compressed for a fair fight that sometimes comes up. (as in there are certain tanks that if they get a +1 match theres no snowball chance in hell they can dissable the tank they face frontally) and ATGM""S main missle can take fire like a champ. 105mm sabot no prob 120mm HE shell to the tip of the missle just makes it look a bit worn. not to mention is also can phase threw tree's and fins dont get damaged from multitude of bushes it flys threw.shells dont peform anything like real life.rng bounce mechanic and module destruction just like wot you flank the tank that outclasses you in everything but speed put a single shot into a criticle part and what should dissable/destroy the tank doesnt.i really wanted to love this game i really did however given the fallowing all this really leads to is just another wot that makes you dumb down the graphics so you can see the ♥♥♥ hat shooting from 4 forests and a village away.they also cherry pick historic advanteges dissadvaneges certian tanks had.example: the tiger 2 has a bad steel modiphyer making its armor worse than what is stated in armor view.early t34's dont get bad weld/cast modiphyer.along with reaload times being altered for ballance reasons.back to steel beast./edited for first spelling pass. im not the best.

												The plane are overall good game , give you satysfaction playing it.The Tanks have interesting gameplay, but have many game breaking bugs like :-Terain deformation destroying your traks or killing your driver.-Poor armor penetration calculation (eg. you can penetrate on the conection of frontal armor and side armor)-Some time croshair shows that you can hit enemy tank shooting near the ground, but the ground eat your shels. (whit no explosion efect ...)-Some buldings have buged in game models and you can shoot thru them walls.For now i'm giving negative evaluation for this game until they repair ""ground forces"" bugs.If you want only to fly plane's you are good2go.

												Hello there. I got this game for a while now, And i can say i got dissapointed with each and every update.I play only tanks, ground forces. I started up with the rissian line, obviously thats the default line you start with,so i stuck with it, pretty quick advance, no real money spent, never my intention. So at one point i got bored of those, not to long ago i started the german line(the only one i did besides the russians), well, here the problems starts, reserach takes ages, the armor of tanks are weak, guns are accurate, but lack the real power. All the conclusion, as ive seen others say aswell, if you mind the time, you wont mind the money. As i am, i have not much time to play, just a simple H1 tiger tank takes ages to research with no real money to help. You hardly get stuff. And plus you are forced to research all the useless stuff that you dont actually want just to advance a tier,plus this cold war stuff they recently put in it,rubbish. Bad things go on.Ive left world of tanks for the same reason, now i see how greed got hold of people. What do we expect, the whole world runs on that stuff,and its to powerfull.....Wonder if my car can run with that xxxx.			"

												The realistic ground battles in this game were great, but after they introduced the P2W bushes camouflage, I just can't recommend this game anymore. Which is a shame really, because the game artists did a fantastic job, too bad the product manager (or whoever is deciding what is free and what is premium) is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥.Edit: The forum moderators of this game are just... wow.Never seen a forum with more power abusive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than on WT forum... They ban me from posting, give me a warning point AND delete my post! Eather warn me or delete my post, this is too much...Deleted post because reasons: http://prntscr.com/aqaum5But they did something I have never seen before, they deleted the whole page of content that was against the recent game changes, so now you have the page 82 and page 84 (yeah there are 80+ pages of players telling Gaijin not to do something and they still do it) but the page 83 is ""not found"".- For those of you who think I only played ~20 hours, see the screenshot I posted from the WT forum. There you can see how I got 3000+ battles, and was Ground Forces, Steel Generals and Royal Armor tester, which means played more than 20 hours...			"

												The game has been going downhill since 1.41 as they haven't fixed numerous issues found within in GF and AF part and also final nail of the coffin is that they went with bad MM system plus bad BR compression that ruined the balance completely in 6.7-7.7 matchups. I wouldn't recommend you guys to play WT unless you are masochist. (I played this game since early 1.29 and this steam only records my time spent on WT since 1.41 to 1.47, so about 500 hours in Steam while 750 more from 1.29-1.39 then 1.49-1.51 so I know what I am talking about.)

												I used to have fun with this game, but the devs seem determined to run it into the ground. After the latest update, any resembalance of balance that was left in the game was destroyed. The devs value queue times above anything else in the game and have made high tier tanks and planes extremely compressed with vehicles being sealclubbed as a norm. They refuse to use anything but player statistics when deciding where to place a vehicle's BR which leads to severe over or undertiering and further exacerbates the game's matchmaking problems. The official forums are ruled with a Stalin-like fist with any disent towards the devs' decisions being met with a ban and or post being deleted. The forum moderators do everything in their power to make sure that players have no contact with the devs and generally act like manchild wannabe dictators towards users and are constantly powertripping. the game does have a subreddit, which is better (usually) than the forums, but gaijin *officially* has no presence there. The sad thing is that the vehicles themselves have vastly improved compared to how they were two years ago, but the devs have consistently made researching vehicles a huge pain and matchmaking consistently more and more broken with every tweak they make to it. If you do get this game, just play it intermittently as trying to take it seriously will leave you burnt out and sick of it.			"

												This review is only about War Thunder tanks.Had fun in War Thunder at the BR 6,7 ? No more because Gajin had the great idea of lowering the maximum BR from 8.0 to 7,7. The way i see it Gajin did it because to reach BR 6,7 is plausible with just grinding but beyond that getting vehicles is extremely time consuming with out MONEY.  So now you are faced against the top tear tanks like                   T-10M,Maus,IS-4M and others of same class whic is not very fair on my opinion. If Gajin did this to balance the german Tiger II (witch are pretty powerfu) why didin´t they lower also the IS-2 Mod44 BR.  The point of this review is i dont just understand the reason behind this change and it seems quite like the game is just asking for more money. Now of course i can be wrong but the ""update"" seems like its only goal is to make Gajin richer.War Thunder is still extremely fun game at the tiers that this is not happening and don´t shy away from it for that reson but the players that have spent a good amount of time in War Thunder are geting trampled on by the pay to progress mechanic of this game.

												The opposite team snuck all around the side of the map and flanked us hard. I defended our spawn from the 2 KV2s, a T34, two flakpanzers and a wirbelwind, a pzG and F2 and about four Il2s in my tier 2 Crusader with only the gunner left alive. I totalled 5 kills and 6 assists, plus two aircraft kills, and I did all this with only 1 other tank who died about three minutes in. I got 1000rp. After putting 700+ hrs into it I have literally no motivation to play this game anymore. Thanks Gaijin for wasting my time.			"

												This game has just gone to s­hit over the last few months with gaijin making f­ucktarded decisions and absolutely refusing to listen to the community. Back when ground forces came out and I started playing, this game really had potential, and gaijin has completely wasted all of that potential by making this game a pay to win hell with a r­etarded battle rating system. This game has absolutely no future because of gaijins idiocy. Don't download the game, and definitely don't give gaijin any of your money.			"

												This is what happens when your matchmaking system is designed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.You play for a few hours, thinking it's fun. You'll get shot and blown up in one hit because the enemy knows the exact pixel to aim at that is weakest, no matter what tank, but that's part of the fun. Then, you unlock newer tanks, that despite being heavier and looking tougher, are just as vulnerable to machine guns and random fire as the cardboard armored tanks of tier 1. You'll get components taken out by trees, because this game is awful.God, this game really makes you feel for all the morons who serve in tanks. Since just one hit makes 'em a firework. Don't play this game. Don't waste your money supporting them.			"

												I have played this game a lot, and I've had a lot of fun most of the time. However, since they introduced the 'research' system many moons ago, War Thunder has never been the same. It now takes a disproportionate amount of time to unlock anything new. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is excellent,  both in the air and on the ground (especially in Realistic Battles), but it tires me how long it takes to get to the next plane, which is invariably just a slightly improved retexture of the last vehicle you spent 5 hours grinding with.If they fix the unlock system, tell me.

												I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE aviation!SPECIALLY WW2 aviation!Maybe thats what kept me trrying to play this game for so long!My rant with it is that it is SO unbalenced!Really ... EVERY ♥♥♥♥ing plane you get is ♥♥♥♥ before you spend dozens, of hours on EACH plane to get ALL modifications available.Plus the ""cover"" modification is in the LAST tier of modifications!This means that you will get one shoted in less than a blink of an eye by someone with a better plane after sometime 10 MINUTES just getting to where you wanted!Why does it take forever to mod up planes?When you enter a new tier you have 2 options since your plane suck and you know it suck!1- Play defensively, try to use energy fighting to the most and fail frustrated because:a) your guns tickle enemy planesb) you will not kill any one unless you keep fireing ate them for at least 5 consecutive secondsc) you will get one shottedSo after 10 minutes of climbing youdive on an unsuspecting enemy plane ,tickle it and your dead because your plane is SO underanked that some one who was cruising has more energy than you and you WILL get one shoted because you have NO ""COVER"" because you just ♥♥♥♥ing got the plane.2)Jump in the action taking now 5 min to get there fire against some plane, tickle them and die one shoted.Repeat that with all your planes an go back to the hangar and repeat like a robot for 7 hours, because thats what you´ll need to get all of you planes allmodifications ... Opt 2 is perfect because everyone loves losing right?Not only the planes are underpowered when you enter a new tier but they will also put you against people with dozens of levels of more experience than you with 1 or 2 tiers of plane difference.To make it more clear:You just got you new karate belt!You are so happy that you got it and now you can test your skills! =)So they will put you to fight someone with 2 belts more experience than you and give him a pistol!I am SO frustrated with this game right now I punched the wall SO ♥♥♥♥ing hard and woke everybody up.The only reason I don't have broken fingers right now is because I actually practice karate! ¬¬			"

												With the recent patches made to this game Tier 4 is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against. That is no the worst part, anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked. Do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this, or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than 5.0, it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to. As I said the devs are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic. They also DO NOT listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and Gaijin have firmly stated they are staying.The censoring has gotten worse, they have been threatening youtubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted. this is a complete violation of youtubes copyright system. After the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtuber who brought to light cheats people were using, not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down. This is yet again more abuse of youtubes system and is also Gaijin using their own community for personal gain. DO NOT PLAY! Take a stand against the devs and show them that this will not be tolerated and cannot be forgiven.			"

The extent of Gaijins Narcissism extends beyond the game and even Gaijin's forums where any criticism of the game is swiftly removed. They are now flagging you tube videos that say anything negative about the game and I mean anything Negative.

												This review isn't for the game, as the game itself is fantastic.This review is for the customer service.I contacted customer service about a problem with a contest they were having.  The problem was that the objectives to ""win"" a chest with a  slim chance at getting a premium plain/tank were completely luck based and had nothing to do with anything and I was venting my frustration with them that I had spent 40-50 hours in two weeks trying to get the premium tank/plain.  I told them that I could have just spent that time working overtime at my job and probably had enough money to buy every single premium item they had for sale.They pretty much told me I could F off, that the contest was working as intended.I told them that the high level of customer service I had recieved was leading me to uninstall the game and never play again.  All they had to say to that was ""We are sad to lose any customers"" to which I replied, ""No, no you aren't"" they closed my ticket in full before I could choose if I was satisfied with the result or wanted to keep the ticket open for further help.

												The game was great! I've been playing since  the early early open beta around a year or 2 ago and loved it! I would have given it a 10/10, but now ever since a patch that came out around last December i would give it a 2or3/10. The gameplay is the same and is very fun to play whether alone or with friends but now you have to grind grind grind grind grind just to get 1 plane. Before i could just buy plane after plane in tiers but now i have to grind for research points (which are very hard to earn) to research a plane. Plus Gajiin went and had to make the game go from Free2Play (completely) (only buy if you feel like it) to having to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 matches or more. You basically have to buy Golden Eagles so you can convert them all to research points to speed up the research of a new plane. I would still reccomend this game if you are into fun aviation type games and playing with friends but the free2play aspect is just no longer here.			"

Imagine you being able to go between a plane and a tank. Sounds great right?Now imagine that the devs behind this game completely not care about the community. Flight Models broken in every patch, Planes being crippled. WW2 Planes matched against Korea Era jets. And now, sprinkle a bit of ""Devs decide what you play, and how you have fun"", then stick a big, stinking, huge ♥♥♥ grind to get anywhere on top.A game where the devs force you to play specific races, penalize you for doing good in planes, and utilizing them as they should, and then force you to pay money to lessen the grind, a grind which increases with every patch they release. Don't forget the fact that they keep lessening the value of everything in game, and raising the prices for less reward. What's that? want a pack with a premium plane? ""SURE!"" say the devs ""But we'll charge you twice as much, turn 2 months of premium into 2 weeks, and completely ♥♥♥♥ over the premium plane as well""That is warthunder.

												This game is very unbalanced, and yes i am one of them who doesnt realy like this game. This is my personal oppinion so dont rage as we all have different oppinons. F2p words just translate (try this out for fre unlimited time) As premium players can easaly dominate free users. As the game itself it takes hundreds of hours to finnaly achieve normal plane which will get destroyed by again premium players.  But the game itself is nice and polished. And im actuolly keen to try this with user release of ""Oculus Rift"". But still, to fuly enjoy this game you have to spend extra money for joystick (joy-stick) and for ""Oculus rift"". But you must agree, that you need fast PC in order to enojy this game even further. At the end, i wouldnt reocommend this game for f2p user.

												 After putting a year into this game. I enjoy it alot! However the developers and chat moderators are at times completely off their rocker.   It's a natural case of pay to progress/win. Premium Vechiles recieve advantages over their progression tree vechiles of the same Tier and even model of vechile!   I'm use to being out spoken on video games I enjoy. Gaijin has a reputation of silencing negative criticism.   Promoters of the game like PhlyDaily are pentalized for giving constructive criticism. They retaliate against his criticism with removing all of his videos off warthunderlive.  Questionable bussiness practices is the bottom line!   IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 will give you all the planes and more. Same realism and it's only 9.99.   I've spent 500+ and only have 1 full tree of German planes grinded.... A year and 500+..  Warthunder could be the best in series. But, They won't stop trying to make money over a good game.   Raising prices on their ""DLC"" then putting it on sale!  Also know as a crime.    :)  They also sued a man who owns Gaijin.com  .  I'd look else where for the money you have to spend. Lastly! Anti-facism laws mean you can't use ww2 german ace names.

												Where do I start? Well, before when I could join a battle, die early, get annoyed, and go: ""Nah, I really don't care, I'm leaving"" with no serious consequences. But now if I leave my crew gets lock and I think: ""Wow this reminds me of that arcade tank game by WarGaming (WoT)"", hmm.To be honest this game usually gets worse each patch (with exception to a few) and I really don't have the pacience to wait for 5mins for my crew to get out of battle. I loved this game because I could join then leave the instantly get into annother game with the same vehicles, not any more. Also the BR is getting compressed even more (Phly Daily have a video on this:

 and Gaijin doesn't listen to the community and in my opinion only really cares about makeing money.So f**k you Gaijin, this game will go under if you don't listen and/or atleast try to fix things. This game gets a 2/10, can be fun but mostly just annoying. So that's my opinion, play it for yourself and see what you think.			"

												War Thunder is the very dffinition of a Pay-to-Play game. I wouldn't mind paying $15 as I did with Counter Strike. At least I knew it would be slightly ballenced. War Thunder forces you to purchase premium Tanks or Planes to do better. Playing with friends is a disatser as it places your squad into the highest members server rank. There was no effort to blence the game. Do not waste your time with this game.			"

In 2013-2014. Somehow, WT is more likely devolving than evolving, if we talk about the long term playability.Free to Play - on very low player level, you will enjoy it I am sure. Then, you will see Gaijin's true face...Cannot recommend anymore.			"

												Great fun at first, but after a few months gets really monotonous.  You go up a tiered weapon progression system for each nation starting with simpler, less powerful weapons at first then advancing to more advanced weapons.  Tier one is great fun, but once I hit tier 3 it stopped being fun.  At tier one I at least felt like I was contributing to my team.  I could run around, shooting, destroying, and getting points for my team along the way.  At tier three that stops happening.  I'm not sure what changed in the game, but I couldn't just fly a plane and blow stuff up on the ground.  Ground warfare stopped being fun as I would spend more time traveling between respawns than actually fighting other tanks.  You can still choose other nations to play in tier one battles, but the game now takes far longer to set up matches at those tiers.  Essentially killing that option of play.			"

												i have loved this game for a long time after the new update i cant stand it. i mainly play arcade i find it alot of fun until recently where im making a turn i could make no problem before and my pilot loses control or my plane simply will not turn its bad enough getting ganged up on by russian planes and japanese but at least before i could manuever to avoid them and turn until allies came or i could make a break for it but now i cant even do simple manuevers without my screen going black, my plane derping out and not turning or my pilot losing control. there have always been balance issues with russian bias and things like that and the mechanics made it where a good player could survive against 2-3 planes chasing them, and if you're lucky take one or two down in the process but now the skill of the player doesnt matter if you didnt put points into your G force skill or if your plane refuses to make the turn.

												i used US tanks only until now , i have to pay to play this game , this 100% not a fffree to play game , at least not ffree to pay in Tank Battle . OKOK , maybe this is my problem because i cannot play the plane battle very good , so always lost all planes at less then 5 minutes , so , i cannot earn much white lion from air battle .........the problem is , i use US heavy tank , the repairing cost is over 5000 white lion each , and need to pay for the ammo reload for the next match , BUT even i won a battle , if 1 of my tank was destroyed , then the reward was unable to cover the repair cost , most of time i cannot kill more than 1 enemies tank , why ???????? Because US heavy tank is hardly to killed a Russia heavy tank or Germany tank in 2-3 shots , but always shot by enemies by 1 round ( germany or russia heavy tanks ) , and all my crew dead and my tank was total lost , so if i lost 2 tanks in 1 match , then i at least need to kills 3-4 enemies to earn enough white lion to cover the repairing and ammo charge for the next battle ......... if you wait for the FREE AUTO repair instead of paying the repair charge , you need to wait for 6-7 days , then you can use that tank again !!!!! FxxK !!!!! that mean if i have less than 1000 white lion ,  guess what happen ???? i join a battle , 1 -2 tanks was destroyed , no enough white lion to repair , wait for 6-7 days until the tanks was finished FREE AUTO repairing , than play 1 battle , and wait 6-7 days again ................ or you can BUY white lion by REAL money from cedit card , than you can have many white lion to pay for repairing .................THIS GAME IS NOT FOR POOR GAMER , unless you are a professional and always can killed 5-6 enemies in 1 battle !!!!!

												Alright, I won't lie. This is a good game, but the devs are rather horrible. Staff in general is pretty damn horrible actually. They're the kind of people that if you I guess so much as say one plane is broken and needs fixing, they'll ban you from the forums. End of story. The kind of company that has biased moderating. If someone says they have a friend thats a moderator, don't always believe them, but those mods will ban you from the chat and voice commands and even THE GAME if they feel like it. Anybody can really be a mod and be an ♥♥♥ about it, but quite frankly, Gaijin doesn't really have half a polished sh*t. Play this game if you'd like, it's alot of fun. Just be aware of the community and company. The community can be good, but you got a couple of kids and clans (=oBRSo=) that act like a bunch of CoD 12 year old ♥♥♥♥.

												Warthunder has the potential of a good game. The graphic, sound and images are quite good because they give you a feeling of actually being in the cockpit yourself. I have played about 726 hours on Warthunder, despite that this is a good game if you like warplanes and tanks of Worldwar 2 that is, this game has many issues which actually makes it less fun to play and enjoy the action. Regarding the tanks, I can say the game is very crappy. To put it simple down: it is nothing more than a kill-fest for the other party because of the many spawn campings. Nonetheless if you have the patience, you can sometimes destroy many tanks if you can keep your coolness. Regarding the warplanes, I can say the game is okay. You can choose to just attack ground troops or you could just go dogfighting in the air with the enemy planes. For me this was quite fun though.In general the game has many faults. The most annoying fault is the matchmaking for both planes and tanks. This is very terrible because you are always put up against planes or tanks of a higher tier than your own. Now for planes it doesn't really have to be that bad if you can fly your plane efficiently. On many occasions I  have flown in bi-planes [of different nations] taking down planes like the Lagg, Yak or similar other planes. When it comes to tanks however the situation is slightly different because with tanks you can't maneuver  like the planes your way out of the enemy's path.Another annoying aspect is the team killings and ramming [mainly in air arcade]. The hit registration is not correct or doesn't always register properly. Then you have the Russian bias [Russian planes/tanks].Last but not least the community itself. The community was nice but it tends to move towards being toxic. All in all I prefer to be neutral but to speak out my mind: I can't recommend this game. Reasons for not recommending this game:-Terrible matchmaking-Incorrect historic information regarding planes/tanks-Faulty hit registration-Toxic community-Russian bias -Teamkillings-You have to pay for certain stuff [such as changing nickname, flag of country etc.]Like I mentioned the game is okay but due to the above mentioned reasons, you will lose fun and joy in the long run. Personally I am not really bothered by the Russian bias though but more due to the other reasons mentioned. However this is just my opinion on the game. Try it out and experience it for yourself.

												So this is going to be my first review of any game on Steam. However I think that people need to know what they are getting into before sinking any time into this as I did.  As a warning this is a long review but there is a lot to go over.First the pros:1.) The different physics models per mode (arcade, realistic, and sim)2.) The wide variety of vehicles3.) beautiful graphics4.) damage models that are not hitpoint bases, i.e. not World of Tanks style5.) intuitive controls.6.) can take multiple vehicles into one battleNow for the cons:1.) The developer does not accept any criticism from the players. Forum posts that are negitive get deleted by mods and you can get your account suspended.2.) the economy is screwed up. The only way to make any decent silver lions (free currency) is to finish in the top three on your team and be running a prem account and several prem vehicles.3.) The matchmaker. War Thunder works on a system they call battle ratings, BR for short. In essence it is a system to reduce the waiting time for a match. Each vehicle has its own battle rating and the different BRs in a given lineup create the combined BR used for matchmaking. Now this all sounds well and good but having even one vehicle of a higher BR in a lineup can put you in very high tier games. Here is an example. I am taking a german air lineup into a match. I have two Bf-109s, two Fw-190s, and a Me-410. Using this lineup will likely get me into a battle with F-82s, Bearcats, and late model Mig fighters. All of these fighters can easily beat my lineup if the enemy pilot is halfway competent, which is likely a given for such high a tier. The same problem comes up with ground forces. M4 Shermans are regularly put up against Tigers and IS series tanks.4.) the damage model. I did put this in the pro section but it also belongs in the cons. This is because it is extreemly easy to one shot vehicles, especially tanks. This is actually the aspect that drove me to stop playing the game. It is a regular occurence to get ammo racked from even the smallest hit to the ammo rack. In order to do well you really need to study all the vehicle models to know where to hit to do the most damage. 5.) the graphics. This is another thing I put in the pro section but also is a con. This is specifically the lowest graphics setting. Despite what the developers have said about fixing the exploit many players still play on the lowest setting to remove a lot of the foliage from the game. This is key in the realistic and simulatior modes because there are no enemy markers to aim at, only direct observation. many times I will be behind a fallen tree or tall hedge and get shot at from the other side of the map. Thanks to the kill cam feature I can see that the shot was not random but aimed correctly and hit the ammo directly. The person who killed me is clearly using the exploit because I was completly behind the concealment and without target markers it should have been impossible for him to see me.6.) the grind. Over the course of my time with WT, not just on steam but also on the direct client from the devs, I have still not unlocked any tier five machines. this is because it literally takes hundrest of thousands of xp to unlock a vehicle and higher than tier three. As I mentioned before the economy is also terrible and makes it hard to buy any vehicles you unlock. A silver lining is that once you buy a vehicle you keep it and do not have to have a individual garage slot to keep it in like in WOT. You also have to unlock other ammunition and the stock is often terrible. There are also no current vehicles that have multiple choices of main weapons, only extra mounts for aircraft. 7.) the playerbase. The community in WT is one of the most toxic ones I have ever encountered. Due to the damage model system almost every kill ends up with the receevign player calling hacks and reporting the other player. I made it a polocy to never enter team chat or general chat.8.) game engine. The game originated with the aircraft component. Therefore the game was developed on a flight sim engine. This made for a wonderful air combat game untill the massive changes to the aforementioned BR and economy. If you are a new player I would suggest you really only play air battles because the physics for ground forces are terrible. Collisions are extreemly common and can lead to huge glitches. For example tanks can get stuck inside each other or get pushed into the gound. Fast tanks can also easliy flip and many heavy tanks use it as a tactic against lighter tanks. Final thoughts. War Thunder started out as a great game but has now devolved into a money maker by the developers. It is possible to advance research on vehicles and even outright buy the upgrade with Golder Eagles, the prem currency. i personally have not spent a dime on this game and I am glad I didn't.My final rating is 2 out of five stars. If you can put up with the grind and want a good MMO flight sim then go right ahead but ignore ground forces and try not to spend money. The developers sometimes have specials for free prem vehicles but they are often extreemly hard to get. As the developer is based in Russia the event times can be sometimes weird and you have to keep watch for them. You will also need a decent comp and large monitor. I do not know if this issue still exists but the Mac client is filled with bugs. I have not used that client in a couple of years so that might be fixed but if trees are not rendering correct with it then it is not your computor but the game itself.			"

												I've been playing War Thunder since some of the earliest closed testing phases, though I only recently moved my install over to Steam. In the begining War Thunder showed so much promise and seemed like it could be genuinely fun without absurd grind or pay to win nonsense, and for a while it really was. But as the years have gone by systems changed to make the grind worse, more and more pay to win BS was added and the devs have made it more and more readily apparent that they don't care about their consumers, only making as much money as possible off of us. Pile on the recent friction between the developers and the community and it is apparent to me that War Thunder is no longer worth supporting in any way, not with my money and not with my time as a player, so it is with a heavy heart that I have to say good bye to War Thunder for good.

Thta's not only on concrete surface (where it could be understandable) but even on soft ground AND under water.Sudden death syndrome. A 12mm machine gun can kill tiger by random hit that kills entire crew. Not really fun for anyone who isn't into camping tacticsLarge bias in performance of armor toward russian tanks. Strange, that soft german targets (flak,  new TDs)  as well as russian AA guns that meant to have paper armor, can surwive literally dozen penetrating hits and bounce some.Preium content: doesn't worth it. Premium account does nothing but adds silver income, which can be obtained in large amounts without that. Premium tanks  aren't worth 45$ cost aexcept couple of russians.

It's a game where the russians need to be the best nation. If you want to play this game afterall play russians. Only that way you stand a chance.			"

												Pros: + it's fairly pretty + Lots of historical aircraft to flyCons: - Extreme Russian Bias - Rife with historical inaccuracies, despite labelling itself as a simulator, and these historical inaccuracies that completely UNbalance the game - Forum Mods will ban anyone who speaks ill of the game, other players, the Motherland or any mention of ways to improve the game - Frequent updates that fix jack sh*t - It used to be great, but it was barrelling downhill pretty fast in the lead up to the Steam release. I gave it a while, figuring the devs were somehow busy trying to get it through Steam's aggressive quality control, but after having come back to it nearly three years down the line, it has devolved extremely far. I write this review, both as a warning to new incoming players, and as an attempt to get through to those who for some reason still love this game. This game has extreme potential, but until the devs stop kidding themselves that the USSR was a technological power house that can make any machine perform better just by adoring itself with a Russian paint scheme, we will never se this game in any sort of actually historically accurate or balanced light.

												At first, the game plays great. After a while though, the wonder dwindles away along with the small ""Golden Eagles"" incentive pack they give you and all you are left with is grinding nonstop. Also the matchmaking is wretched and Russian planes have an extreme bias. After a while of playing this, you just end up asking yourself, ""why bother?""			"

												If you love outstanding physics, intense tank battles, realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay....Then you came to the wrong game. Welcome to War Thunder, please insert money to continue. For some reason the developers seem to think Russia and Germany won WWII as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen. I've done my best to enjoy this game, but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing, it's somewhat impossible to do so. I've seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble 12 year old Xbox Live children angry they can't get a kill, however don't take this review as such. The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.But if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!But the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map. HOWEVER! ""If you do pay for premium,"" your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.So grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game). I recommend a spare keyboard as you'll most likely bash your face against the keys a few times.			"

												Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on ""their data"" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins ""data"" says they do ""perfectly fine"" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible ""data"" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of ""Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!"" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result. It has a lot of potential and could really go somewhere, but only if the devs stop and listen to the people that've spent thousands of hours of gameplay on this game.			"

												If you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with War Thunder! Every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for Golden Eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.The Russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! This most experianced in the mode Realistic Battle where it's nation Vs. nation and the Russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! The RNG for Russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off OP ammo (some WW2 tanks have post war ammo)!You really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the MM is one of the worst i've ever seen! It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.    Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse! A lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates 1.37 and 1.43 where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!

												Great game, but...The game has gorgeous graphics, butThe problem is... I have spent over 350 hours and over $100 dollars on the game and i still havent hot a single JET!!! I understand that they want you to spend money on the game and do a bit of grinding but not quite this much. I SPENT $100... How much more do they want me to spend to unlock at least 1 tier V plane (or tank). This is my favorate game and most played on steam, I've spent $100 and have been loyal for several years, but still not even close to a jet. I CANT EVEN TEST FLY ONE! Its a great game that I would reccomend but after a month you have no goal because none of them are in your grasp. ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRIND YOUR WAY TO A JET AND ITS NOT PAY TO WIN SO, WHAT IS IT!!!!!!!!!!If anyone is reading this that has any sort of power towardds the game at least concider thease problems than me and my friends are having and for other people thinking of getting the game also concider thease points.

												Yeah i'am still playing this game and hoping that it will change.... First:It is ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced as hell.... If you had played this game for a while, you will start to notice that not only by ranks match making is working, but with ""Battle rating"" too. For example:III tier tank BR: 3.7, 4.0, 4.3, 4.7, 5.0, 5.3 (if you got 3.7 you are ♥♥♥♥ed, the match making will put you with BR 5.0 all the time and sometimes 5.3 will apair, after a week of grind and wasted all your nerves, you will get 5.0 tier and will think : ""finaly, i have walked out of this ♥♥♥♥"") however, you will go of course for tier IV , now whats happens:IV tier tank BR: 6.3,6.7,7.0 (It seems ok, the max  BR that you will get in the team is 7.0 its about 1:10 of battles) But if you got 7.0 BR IV tier tank, you will be placed with max 8.0 tier witch is much more powerful when shity 7.0 (like T32) the chance with 7.0 BR that you will be placed with 6.3, 6.7, 7.0 is 10% ~. Now second:American tanks (Dont choose it if you want to get more fun in the game)Until III tier tanks its ok, seems the balance is bearable, but when you want to get IV tier tank, you will be facing alot of fu cking useless shermans against Tiger II, IS 2 (the most playable tanks at the moment) These tanks got better armor, armor piercing shells comparing with: M26, A41A1, T32, M36 GCM, (M19 is the best).And yes when you get the fu cking T32 you will be placed with 8.0 BR tanks and do nothing at all to them, you will be a fu cking meat until you get 8.0 BR tank too. And it takes again alot of nerves and time (ages) to grind it. NO FUN TO PLAY AT ALL, THEN THE TANKS IS LIKE A PAPER and cant even penetrate normaly Tiger II or IS2.. T32 should be 6.7 BR not 7.0... or the balance should change..The american tanks is so fu cking god da mn owfuly nerfed as hell. DEV, i know it should be a realistic game, but come on, its just a GAME.... MAKE SOME BALANCE.And the last of it:Never choose american tanks, dont make a mistake like i did and dont waste your time... Play with Russian or German you wont regret it. I guess i'am quiting this game until DEV team make a better balance for the sake of the world "

												I give up. In the beginning this was fun,very enjoyable game. There was fair amount of one shooting and being one shoot and bouncing shells. If someone would kill me there would be no hard feeling,good job man you outplayed me. But...but...once you reach IV lvl tanks your world turn upside down. You will always and I mean always being one shoot from any possible angle and from your thickest armor.Someone hits your track kills you,someone hits your barrel it kills you,someones shell ricochet of you still kills you, even when someone hits your antenna it kills you.I tried to play more carefull,pay more attention how am i positioning,tried using terrain and building to protect me and still no use.The enemy simply shiiits on my future.When game is about to begin of course is not going to put all players in the same time and you are going to love the invisible ghosts that are hitting and blocking you from blitzing to the capture point.Lets not forget the glorius badass players who took bombers and drop bombs on your respawn point right after you return in game.You could do nothing,you returned simply to be killed and add that repair price who is devouring your silver lions.I dont think I'm going to play this game that much as i used before,simply it reached point where I'm frustrated too much.Not to talk abuot players who never communicate and i mean never. I used to have golden moment where i felt unkillable,godlike,was in top of the list,have 10-12 kills,but now this is just always bad expirience no matter what you do.(ok trolls come on let us hear how I suck how i dont know to play,come on boost your ego,confidence hope it helps you feel superior then rest))			"

												UNINSTALLED ON MY 2nd DAY OF PLAYING. I've already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pro's.This MMO combat flight sim started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade-ish, so I'm pretty experienced with them. This one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with.When I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era plane, and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. At first, it was fun and challenging, and I found myself consistently ranking in the top #2 or #3 spot on my team (this, mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sim's). But after I reached level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At 3rd and 4th level,I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20-40 players. Not only were these players way more experienced with the game than I was, their planes were way better too! I would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky little 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons.

												Strong pay to win, broken game design.I've written another review over a year ago, this is more of an update. I haven't played tanks much, but a lot of things from the review are the same there as well. The pay to win: Crew skills. Its bad enough that without paying money it will take you years to grind those up, and you really need to since they give massive advantages. Pilot vitality ""skill"" makes the pilot grow adamantium scales that when max out can even shrug off 20mm hits (so much for the advertised historical accuracy and realism), golden eyes for the pilot give a huge advantage in historical battles, and gunner accuracy for bombers adds chuck norrises to your crew that insta gib everything. ETC.  On top of that, there is a qualification (ace) that increases these skill over the regular limit and it can only be bought with gold, you can't even grind it up after no matter how long.Premium matchmaking: An example from the air tree - premium buffalo has 1.3 battle rating (battle rating is whats used to match planes vs each other) while the regular one thats exactly the same is 1.7 battle rating. This occasionally varies, sometimes after a while a new premium plane gets a normal battle rating, but hey, while they are the way they are for some planes, its baby seal clubbing. Upgrade system. Every plane stars out as ""stock"" and is gimped in performance (climb rate) by around 50% (!!!!!!!). For anyone with any clue of air combat its quite apparent that even discrepancy of 5% makes a massive difference, but the developers of war thunder had clearly too much vodka (they are Russian btw). For example - historically yak 3 is 25kph faster than bf109 g-2 and only 2kph faster than fw190 a-5. However, if you don't have the upgrades for the yak, you will never catch any of them, and if you don't have the upgrades for the a-5, you will be caught by yak3's very quickly making any historical accuracy or real tactics for those machines completely absent. Either you pay gold to upgrade your planes, or you will suffer in a horribly underperforming plane for a long, long time while grinding out millions of xp needed to even unlock the upgrades for purchase with regular currency. (on lower tiers the grind is much less significant however)Regarding tanks - being unable to extinguish the fire in a tank before the proper upgrade is purchased with either gold or grinded up, as well as only having 1 type of shell... well its alomost as bad as with the planes. Though with planes the differences in performance are a lot more significant. Flight models. They are completely out of whack. Most of Japanese planes have climb rates higher by over 50% than historical, making them total ufo's that out climb everything in the game and out turn everything as well. A lot of planes were and are beng added without any flight models, just a placeholder copy paste (why add them in the first place if the FM's aren't done yet?). High altitute performance is only modelled on some planes, some don't have it... KI-43 is still a ufo with a placeholder flight model for what... 3 years now? Matchmaking. The better you do at the game - the worse the matchmaking you will get. Apparently developers decided that you need to be punished for skill and your effort to learn air combat and do well, and therefore have implemented a system where trash players get put into lower BR matches to compensate for their lack of skill, and good players get thrown in to play against planes years ahead in development. Imagine dota or league of legends ( or even counter-strike) were to do something similar and give more hp to losers. Those games would be done the next day. So unless you are planning to be bad at war thunder - you are gonna have a bad time. The false advertisment of historical accuracy:There is 0 of the advertised historical accuracy in the game. The developers have stated on the official website that the current tiering is historical. Tier 1 - pre war, tier 2 - early war, tier 3 - mid war, tier - 4 late war and the final tier is corean war. So what do we have? *I've deleted the old part of the review but everything remained generally the same, some planes moved up and down but 1944 planes are matched with 1939 ones still. I'll just give one example, since I don't want to waste too much time writing about more planes like I did before. You can look things up yourself. 1944 F4U-1a corsair has the exact same battle rating as 1939 BF-109 E3, as well as some other 1939-1941 planes. The result? An unstoppable powerhouse of doom, such is the corsair flown properly. Nothing can compete with a late war Boom and Zoom energy fighter. It was so easy to club baby seals in it I genuenly felt bad. To summarize: This game used to be quite a good game during early release and beta, but some of the broken ufo planes never got fixed, the developers keep adding planes with placeholder flight models to this day, the pay to win gets stronger and stronger. First it was the crew skills, then upgrades, then premium planes with lower battle ratings and ufo flight models...etc No real reason to play this game unless you want to throw in some cash to get a big advantage over other playes, and/or only fly broken ufo or rediculously undertiered planes. If the amount of hours or dollars (120$) I have spent in this game doesn't not convince you I know pretty much everything about it inside out, here are some of my stat screenshots:Arcade -

 Overview  War Thunder is a free-to-play [F2P] tank/plane arcade and simulation MMO hybrid. War Thunder is an online only game that requires a constant internet connection to play; there is no offline mode. You’re also required to create a Gaijin account to play, though the launcher is incorporated into Steam so no additional DRM is technically required.In War Thunder, you’ll be given the opportunity to control and play with several hundred tanks and aircraft spanning prewar to roughly the 1970s. You’re given the option to pick any starting nation you prefer: German, American, British, Japanese or Russian and chose to play either aerial battles [planes] or ground forces [tanks]. When you play, you’re given up to three vehicles to pick per battle and then placed into a game that is 16v16. There are different game modes, but your typical mode for tanks is capture-the-point, which can be won either by eliminating all player vehicles, or capturing 2/3 control points on the map to drain the enemies “ticket” counter. For planes, you’ll encounter forms of domination and “ground strike”. When the battle is over you’ll be awarded experience and silver lions, War Thunders in-game currency regardless if you win or lose. You can use the currency and experience to unlock new modules and better equipment for your vehicle, as well as newer vehicles as you advance up the tech trees of each nation.The battles are broken down into three types: arcade, realistic and simulation. Arcade mode is the most simplified of the three, hit markers, simplified physics and enemy outlines when aiming at an enemy vehicle are present in this mode. Realistic battles will have you encounter more precise physical issues [speed, g-force, turning speeds…etc], removal of tank outlines and slower battles overall. Simulator brings realism even further by attempting to simulate tank and plane controls, which removes play tags and forces the players to visibly identify friend and foe among many other differences. In simulator battles you can only play from the viewpoint of your crew. For a full list of the variations, I’d recommend checking the forums or their website for additional information.For those wondering, when it comes to F2P games, often the stigma is that they become very pay-to-win [P2W], forcing players to invest an unreasonable amount of money to stay competitive. Luckily, War Thunder stays clear of this pitfall. While there is premium currency called “golden eagles”, buying them only gives a few benefits. Firstly, you can use gold to buy premium account time or premium vehicles which give an increased amount of research and money revenue per battle. Secondly, you can use said gold to advance up the tech tree quicker or by cosmetic decals for your vehicles that may otherwise be unavailable. Often times you’ll find events held by Gaijin that will give you the chance to earn some of these items for free if you meet certain requirements in the allotted time. As someone who has played on both a basic account and my current premium one, there are no real advantages to premium time/gold aside from reducing the amount of time you need to grind out your next vehicle or module(s). A tank from a basic account is no better nor holds any advantage towards the same tank on a premium account. All that being said, let’s look at some of the core gameplay aspects.When it comes to gameplay, War Thunder is a great team game to play with friends. There’s a lot that could be said about it that I cannot possibly cover in this review, but after several hundred hours I still find it extremely entertaining. The battles are exciting, the maps are visually appealing, different and for the most part are well done and fairly balanced outside a few key issues that will hopefully be addressed in the future. Overall, the game runs quite smooth given the superb visuals and vehicle models. If you have the PC for it, the game can be visually stunning.The game really shines when you play with friends, or join a clan and compete with additional teammates. Playing solo isn’t bad, but being able to coordinate with your team, provide cover fire and create strategies mid-combat really brings out the fun in War Thunder and breathes a whole new level of skill and challenges into the game. That doesn’t mean the game is perfect. There are your occasional clipping issues, mismatched hitbox variations that don’t line up with what you see visually and the shell mechanics can be frustrating at times, but overall I’d say I’m quite pleased with how everything works in the long run; there’s always going to be hotfixes and changes that can be made to improve gameplay.In regards to UI, in game the controls and UI are well done. However, in the hanger [main menu] the UI could use some serious work. The messaging system, while improved, could use some extensive altercations to make it more user-friendly and less cumbersome to use. Message notifications, chat boxes and the invitation system all need work as well. It’s not a game breaking issue, but it can be annoying when you have to wade through menus trying to find something quickly.In the end, War Thunder isn’t for everyone, but I feel anyone with a competitive edge or a knack for playing MMOs will find it enjoyable. It takes some dedication and time to learn the maps, the controls and understand how the game mechanics work, which makes a bit of a learning curve for some. However, it is well worth the time to learn, especially at the low, low cost of being free.  Pros   Solid visuals, vehicle models and sound effects. Great by yourself, even better with a team or clan. It’s free so there’s no risk in trying it. Gaijin is constantly updating the game and fixing key issues that are brought up. Cons  
 The game has some clipping and hit-box issues in certain areas in various maps that need attention.  Aircraft in ground battles still need to be addressed. Grinding can be very time consuming. Teamplay is heavily geared towards those who join your squad; relying on random teammates is not advised. Overall, War Thunder has been a real pleasure to play. It currently stands as one of my favorite multiplayer games and even after so many hours invested, I haven’t grown bored of it at all. If you’re a tank or plane enthusiast or just love quality MMOs, then I’d highly recommend checking out War Thunder.			"

												Well I was really excited to play this, had a midweek sale and looked amazing was planning on buying at least one of the packs depending on how well I liked. BUT WAIT! Someone decided that they wanted to do a server update which basically made Thursday useless (at least in my time zone). Honestly my main problem is that one the main launcher it said nothing about this so I wasted an hour trying to log in and diagnose what could have been causing this. Luckily the 3rd/4th time I had to restart I noticed the Steam news saying that the servers would be offline for maintenance, which is fine updates are fine, but again would have been nice if the actual game said as much.

												To begin...Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.Every country is good in their own way.For example:Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defenceJapanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defenceRussians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defenceGermans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defenceThe game mechanics in this game are very good. The diversity of planes is very good.You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)Diverse selection of maps Many gamemodesThere are 3 levels of difficulty:Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand outRealistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of planeSimulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.The matchmaking system depends on two things.1 - Tier of the plane2 - Battle Ranking of the planeIf you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.TL;DRThe Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking. "

												Latest patch ruined the game, and the developer is refusing to revert back to the more fun and fair way it was set up before. Matchmaking is FUBARed. Going from all the tiers they had to only 5 tiers isn't working, and is making for completely messed up matches where sealclubbing is the order of the day (e.g. advanced WW2 fighters vs biplanes).Planes will often catch fire now much more easily and burn up or explode from a single hit. I've exploded from having a tailgunner on a bomber wing me with a couple rounds.They also increased the grind by 600% or more according to someone in the community who did the math. Their in-game currency was vastly debased when it came to converting XP. It's a huge money-grab on the part of the developer.Worst of all is the fact that Gaijin is actively censoring their forums, removing non-abusive posts criticizing the changes made in patch 1.37 and banning people, like me, from being able to post if they don't like the patch. They're also making troll accounts praising the patch and insulting people who aren't happy.A good game ruined by greed and a bad company. Stay away.			"

												Positives-Wide variety of tanks, and planes-Wide variety of maps for both tanks and planes-Sensible controls-Semi-realistic damage system-Semi customizable skins-Research system that insures game has long life.Negatives- Russian Bias, russian tanks/planes have a permanant buff that gives them a great advantage.- Tank crew members do not ""die"" they only get nocked out. (FIXED)- Slight pay to win/advance system- Menu and custom load outs, tend to reset randomly. (Though very rare)-Abusive report system- Abusive graphic system that allows low-tier pcs users to see through walls and trees (FIXED)-Spawn camping becomes a very big problemOverall the game is worth a try, its free. Despite the negatives the positives are overpowering.*And with each patch/update the negatives over power the positives. Then flip back for a short time before becoming bad again.			"

												Latest patch ruined the game, and the developer is refusing to revert back to the more fun and fair way it was set up before. Matchmaking is FUBARed. Going from all the tiers they had to only 5 tiers isn't working, and is making for completely messed up matches where sealclubbing is the order of the day (e.g. advanced WW2 fighters vs biplanes).Planes will often catch fire now much more easily and burn up or explode from a single hit. I've exploded from having a tailgunner on a bomber wing me with a couple rounds.They also increased the grind by 600% or more according to someone in the community who did the math. Their in-game currency was vastly debased when it came to converting XP. It's a huge money-grab on the part of the developer.Worst of all is the fact that Gaijin is actively censoring their forums, removing non-abusive posts criticizing the changes made in patch 1.37 and banning people, like me, from being able to post if they don't like the patch. They're also making troll accounts praising the patch and insulting people who aren't happy.A good game ruined by greed and a bad company. Stay away.			"

												Welll the game is really fun and good practice for upcoming battlefield 1.  But the respawn system is pay to win type. They want only money.. there is a number of diminishing tanks or planes and you have different 3 tanks or 3 chances before it says to leave lobby and get back to hangger. I said diminishing tanks because you could buy extra ""back up vehicles"" with the ingame token bought by real money. Well that wes fine untill i noticed that the extra respawn is reduced by 1 after each match... meaning the money you invest goes in the drain. Plus they offer Premium Account. Atleast if they had unlimited spawn in premium account I would have given a thumbs up.. So dont waste your money in this game.  Thanks that they gave me inGame currency for completing tutorials.. I do not recomend this Gane unless they improve the respawn thing.			"

												I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone in it's current form.   The developers doesn't seem at all interested in listening to the community and instead intent on releasing unwanted patch after unwanted patch.   Mean while Nerfing any non-Russian plane or just out right refusing to fix them.   It is now turned into a horrible grind against more experienced players equipped with far better Aircraft;  due to their matchmaking pitting you against higher tiered opponents to ""encourage"" you to spend more $$ as well as their pitiful higher tiered game that no one wants to play and therefore everyone playing in lower tiers.If you didn't level up before 1.37..  Good luck! "

												I cannot reccomend this game.I originally wrote this review in a bit more of a positive light, and I honestly wish feedback was excepted on the official forums. But, unfortanutely, this game lacks any form of dev support or care whatsoever.For starters, just reading the update posts by Gaijin made me want to delete this game and send it back to the bomb-crater it came from. Literally every other sentence was praising Russian historical documentation and how Russian books were the source of most of the information. And, honestly, I didn't care about that.What kills this game for me isn't that it's a Pay-To-Win game, it's a Free game that's Pay-To-Play. I was just fine in Tier 1 on my very first day, and I really looked forward to a grind and working up to my next tier of tank. I now regret sticking around that long.Ontop of that, matchmaking is the definition of team-stacking, with high-tier vehicles being placed specifically in one team, especially with things like Churchills. While my team cowers in fear, the enemy rolls over us in tanks a tier or even two higher than ALL of us.I wish this game was more open, and better. But, the devs of this game have destroyed it entirely. The match-making is despicable, the Pay-To-Win mechanic is absolutely disgusting, and the overall game would have been better off without both.			"

												High tier plane is all over the place. There used to be reasonable tier spread but its 100% garbage. There is no reason for me to fly my B-29 at all now as I face MiG-15bis that can climb from the deck and blow me apart with a single pass way before I can even reach a target to bomb. The other late war props and early jets now face end game jets. I would have reccomended this game a year ago over its competitors World of X, but its not in a good place now.

												War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.			"

												while there are some good aspects of the game, such as being able to control tanks and planes of different nations, there are many downfalls to this game as well. Pros:- Addictive. It is very addictive and can be very entertaining if you don't mind some of the faults in the game. - The game looks somewhat nice, and for a free to play game it's decentCons:- Spawn Killing. There is a lot of it. And in RB tanks this is a real problem So much in fact that sometimes people don't bother with the objective and just doge the enemy in order to camp at their spawn almost five minutes into the match. You may be out there, capturing the point while killing enemies and then you get killed. It's okay though, because you have enough respawn points to get one of your best tanks. You drive forward, and bam, some guy sitting behind spawn is waiting there to kill you. They one shot you and you die. Of course though, you no longer are in the battle as there are no more respawn points. Great, some guy behind spawn killed you with little effort while you try to help your team.- Grinding. While it is a free to play game, the grinding is incredible if you don't plan on paying for golden eagles or lions. While you do get convertable research points when you are in battle, they are usless without you having to pay as the conversion cost not only costs those research points, but also golden eagles. So those are usless, even if you do have golden eagles because the conversion cost is insane.			"

												It's difficult for me to recommend or discourage getting this game since depending on what you do it's mostly on the fence.(This is by the way from someone who almost exclusively plays planes)The game is fun, as someone who has a great interest in WWII/Cold War aviation I find it to be a very nice change of pace from the usual. However, issues do show and as you've probably seen from dozens of reviews, Gaijin very heavily favors their country of origin.Compared to other playable countries, Russian aircraft are usually shown to be cheaper and much stronger while sitting in the same tiers and battle rankings. It can be frustrating and almost seemingly draws you into that mindset that you have to play Russian to actually enjoy the game. I was determined to use American planes as I know them best, but I found it mountingly difficult to do well with any of them and I ended up just moving onto Russian. Another issue is there isn't really any sense of teamwork, not unless you join a group or something dedicated to it. It becomes a free-for-all and a lack of cooperation, and especially ramming and friendly fire, become very common. You ask for cover while a pack of Spitfires are on your tail and a bunch of people use the chat commands to say ""Never"" or ""No"" as you become sharkbait in the air. There also isn't really any way to balance out which matches you play, and as a result the game will stick you into an air domination match with a team consisting of almost entirely ground attack aircraft and bombers.Also, while a lot of planes rarely get many updates or new tiers, there are three Russian fighter lists from different manufacturers and a good half-dozen variants of the Yak-9, a plane often regarded as a UFO. Also, Russia has more jets and stronger aircraft than other countries. However, the music and graphics are great (the latter especially, even at the lowest possible settings). It has a good deal of replay value.I can't say I recommend it. I mean I do in a sense, if you're willing to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but otherwise you'd be better off with one of the Il-2 Sturmovik games or Birds of Steel.			"

												I might possibly take the inordinate amount of time it would require to figure out how ""researching"" planes and tanks works, and how you set up crews, and what it takes to actually succeed in battle, but really ... who has the time?  In general (and like Gaijin's other FTP offering Star Conflict) there is very little explanation, no real way to practice, and a lot of push to buy premium.  Naw, Gaijin.  Find another sucker.Update: since the latest revision, I can't give any Gaijin game another shot: War Thunder hangs and then crashes at login, and Star Conflict just hangs.			"

												They changed the air targeting/hit system since beta. The hit detection is somewhat fubar at this point. Can aim at the lead indicator at point blank range, but none of the shots hit. The tank battles are one sided, some of the tank variants have some extremely worthless loadouts that cannot be changed. They do no damage unless you hit from behind, but the enemy will instantly destroy you otherwise... Worst part is, you either have to grind with other tanks to continue up the tree to tanks that are not worthless, or sit there and hope others are not in heavier tanks.I will admit the tank combat system is interesting, with the ability to take out the tanks in multiple ways, but the execution is just soooooo abysmal. I stopped playing this after they changed the air targeting system... a few months before ground combat came out. I wanted a world war 2 vehicle game and decided to try it again. What I played was sooooooo much worse than when I left. I am sorry but THIS SUCKS!!!!!			"

Now its bloody IS2s, Pershings and King Tigers going against some late war and many, many post war tanks. I've honestly lost count on how many matches i had with my 6.7 BR tanks where i have had the unfortunate ""match-making"" out me in with Leopards, M47s, Maus' and the odd T54 and M60 here and there. And there's that issue of Russian bias. If you want good evidence of it just take out any of their planes. They turn on a frikin dime, pump cannon rounds in to you and take god knows how many .50cal rounds. And their tanks...holy crap. T34s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tigers left right and center. I've gotten more kills in my T34-85 alone than in both my Tiger H1 and Tiger combined...and i started both the German and Russian ground forces tech tree at the same time (somewhat equal amount of grinding on both) And so many matches are filled with kids who have never heard of teamwork Jsut don't guys.

												***Review based on aircraft game modes***I've been playing this game for years, even before it came out on steam, and all I can say is do not download this game.The unbalance of each team for ever match is unbearable.  The OP russain aircraft are so painful to play against, it almost literally gives me cancer, if it hasn't already.The constant patches and updates with un-notified changes to aircraft models within the patch notes is incredibly misleading - one day you could be flying along fine, then after the patch your aircraft could just fall out of the sky, it's wings could shear off just because you made a 2G roll, your aircraft could blow up just for looking at a russian aircraft.I would say play the game, just to understand what I mean by all of this nonsense, but I would also say do not even bother with it.  It'll be a waste of time.The jets too - well, don't fly any jets that are British or American, because they apparently suck - by the time you get off the ground, the entire russian team of MiG-17s will be on top of you, blowing your team to pieces.  Believe it or not, a Gloster Meteor from 1942 would fly against a MiG-17 from 1952 (for those of you who are not aware, huge technological advances were made in jet engines and aircraft aerodynamics within those 10 years).In fact, if you're reading this and you still want to play the game, fly as russians.  Deal out the copious amounts of BS, and make the game unplayable by making everyone fly around in russian op bias AF aircraft.			"

												Do not waste your time on the tank mode of this game.You will be one-shotted in any tank you choose, (except the later tiered Russians of course)So many bugs and glitches, (Like invisible bombs falling from the sky, with no indication and no planes on the minimap)I was playing in a Tiger E and I drove about 10 meters away from an enemy Tiger II H. I shot him directly in the cheeks of his turret, on GREEN. (Green, indicating you can penetrate.) And it bounced.Russian tanks are overpowered and can practically one-shot any tank. Which makes playing any other line pointless and not fun at all.BR (Battlerating) Is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed. (Tier 3 tanks with 4.0 battlerating get's placed in tier 5 tank matches with 7-8 battlerating.)Paid $50 for golden eagles. Which got me to tier three. (gg)Glitchy repairs (The timer resets randomly sometimes, even if you don't get shot or anything. So you'll be on a minute repair, it get's down to like 20, and then it resets and goes to a minute again.)You can get oneshot/shot from across the map. (Literally, be careful going 25 feet away from spawn, you can and will get one-shot/shot.)Spawnkilling, yup, no spawn protection, no cover. You can literally spawn and be one-shotted.The list goes on and ON with bugs and glitches that they don't fix.-Honestly It's a waste of time, They refuse to fix these glitches and bugs, and I heard somewhere that they were going to BUFF the RUSSIANS. (?????????????????) THE ♥♥♥♥? Now, I don't know if that's true, but.. damn.-Planes is a lot nicer, but It's boring.			"

												(I have played 200 hours on PS4) I mainly play germans i dont care if u disagree, its just my opinion, I was not in ww2 so I dont know everything about it.  Russians are way over powered, battle rating system messed up e.g tiger 1s going against IS 2s and ISU 152s when historicaly they versed T34s and K-V1s and smashed them. but what really puzzles me is that the game  is not realated to time for e.g when the jagtiger (came out in late 1944-45) it is versing late 40s to late 50s tanks which kind of defeats the porpouse when they say it one of the most realistic ww2+pre and post  games out there. but what upsets me the most is that the german armour is so weak when in real life it was very good the best example would be the panther it couldnt be pened by a 76 at 2000m. in summary it is an unrealistic game, which is unfair for the japs brits US and Most of all Germans. when i saw ""get know us"" (credits) i saw the whole team was of some slavic background apart from a couple (no exaggeration). I have not been in a single game were a german played says ""**** this game"" or ""Soviets are op"" (because of how easily germans get blown up) but what sums it up best..

												=Old Review, 2014=  Great primarily WWII era military game. with Aviation, ground units, and eventually naval units as well. Overall fun to play.=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.   Nothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)I still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.  But flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.Here's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game			"

												I guess I am going to be joining the ranks of folks with 1000+ hours down voting this game. Gaijin has refused to listen to it's own player base regardless of their time or investment in the title. Continually and casually making horrible buisness decisions that purely insult the player base. When the community speaks out over the issues with the title, Administrators hold a gun to their head and tell them to admit there is no problems, or be banned. It sounds broad because it is broad.

												The russian bias in this game for ground forces is so over the top its almost comedy. I dare you to play for a while, and watch what happens.1. The team with russian tanks drives to your spawn. your team kills a couple, but they invariably manage to get there as 1 shotting a russian tank isnt as common, but them one shotting everything else is.2. they camp your spawn and proceed to ♥♥♥♥ the map.3. the russian side wins.This game is about as far from a simulation as you can get if you go by WW2 statistics for russian losses.

												I really loved this game untill it went down the sh***er. Lemme explain, so throughout the entire time I had played this game, which is longer than I have on my steam acount, Russian planes were and still are known as the most op s**t ever. ""Well c'mon the dev's can change it if you present historical evidence"", well it has been done, and you know what? The devs said it was just anti-russian propoganda. It seems like Gaijin is stuck with this whole nationalism thing even into a game. Now lets talk about the Community, it seems like Gaijin doesnt even F*****ING KNOW IT EXISTS. I mean c'mon, if you promise something, at least make something. For example, Gaijin promised bomber interiors for a long time, pass a couple years later, we have new airplanes, new tanks, new maps, and everything but F*****CKING what they promised. I have long stopped playing this game for myself, I only sometimes boot it up to play with my friend, but other than that, I am really done with this game. I would not recommend this game to anybody that wants historical accurracy, or fair matchmaking, or anybody who like to communicate with the devs.			"

												I'm afraid I'm going to have to say this game used to be good, but blatant disregard for game balance by the developer has taken away from it in such a way that I cannont with a good conscience say it's going to be fun for a new player.Sure, there are some vehicles that are still tiered competitively, markedly some premium ones, but by and large, most nations' tech trees will make a new player want to drill holes in their head until they're mentally six years old. Incidentally, that is the age I suspect Gaijin's lead developer to be. But I digress.A new server update was pushed upon the playerbase recently, causing considerable backlash due to now nonexistent game balance exacerbated by bugs both large and small the developer has neglected to fix for one reason or another. The playerbase by and large advised against pushing the update immediately after the preliminary changelog was posted about 2-3 weeks ago, citing game breaking issues with balance that would be the result of it. As has been evident for everyone with half a brain cell, that is exactly what happened.To shed some more light on vehicles' battle ratings in this game, they are tiered in regards to each other by comparison of player effectiveness. This has led to some vehicles getting hilariously undertiered because they are abused in roles they're ill-suited for whereas others have been tiered so high you're depending on your opponent being cripplingly stupid to have any chance of killing him. I assume I don't have to point out the problems inherent in such a tiering model.To add insult to injury, some vehicles were given new ammunition types, ones they never had IRL. This has caused ground forces battles around certain battle ratings to have become increasingly lopsided for any nation that is not Russia as the new ammunition type is much more capable at penetrating angled armor on tanks.Add to that arbitrary nerfs to certain vehicles despite the explicit statement about historical accuracy and I can only recommend you do not spend any money on it, at least right now. Maybe things are going to get better once Gaijin has felt the pressure from decreasing income, who knows.			"

												Ignore the 0.5 hours, thats just the steam version. I'm in tier 5 America and have a positive kill death ratio in the P-51 Mustang. To anyone who has ever played this game long enough, you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of Christ. For anyone else, let me tell you why. This game has so much potential to be good, but it squanders it in the silliest of ways. So let me just get this out of the way, it is Russian biased. Not even gonna lie, don't have to because I'm in the safe Steam forums where KGB...I mean Gaijin developers can't execute my posts. Imagine this.It's a terrible day to be a tanker, the Germans have a tiger and you have 1 T-34, in real life you win by number advantage. In WarThunder, you win because the Tiger decided to replace it's armor with paper and lined it's hull with High Explosive ammunition. I can not believe how many times I have been ""Ammo Racked"" in a Tiger. You can be shot in the tracks, and your tank could randomly explode. How does Gaijin explain? The game is still in developement. That's why when tanks first came out, lets just reduce the listed capabilities of ALL German cannons by about 20% or if you wanna be technical, model it at 15 degree before even regarding what you're hitting, so technically you could hit something dead on, and still be penalized 15 degrees and just be glancing off.Is this just one case example? Definietly not. Everytime they put new stuff in the game (while completely ignoring existing issues), if it's Russian they just say screw it, raise all of its values from the previous plane, times that by 2, and make it a UFO. If it's anything else, case example the twin mustang, which is litterally a p51 times 2, is actually now 1/2 in value. Instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically, they add in more planes and with the twin mustang, were too lazy to even code the second engine. WTF logic is that?Look I'm not going to recommend this game. This game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me, were given false feelings of love. Frankly the kick that I can get out of this game is winning in a Tiger or P-51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that I like. If you play for that I applaud you. But for everyone else flying UFO planes and ww2 T-90's, you are so blind to how bad this game really is.Btw I can agree with many of the other negative reviews, but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people. The funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues, but still think this game is worth it. I don't, as a WW2 history enthisiast, I have been pushed to World of Tanks. That's how bad this game has become. At least War gaming has a method to their madness. Here, make sure you pray to RNGesus.			"

												2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier "" Russian Bias Party"" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game.

												Dont look at my steam hours on this game. i played not from steam. It took me a long time to get to this point . I am not that guy who goes just about to rage after he was killed.. This review is a sum up of my expierence with gaijin from the long past time. I joined them in 2013 december. Back then it was only planes and was fairly good. Had its bugs pros and cons but was good. All went to hell with the patch 1.24... and from that on it went only down.. Then came the ground forces. Man it was good. Again alot of bugs but it was good.. you would kill and get killed but it did not bother me. And after every patch it got worse in groundforces. And you could feel the bias towards russian forces. And now it just RussianThunder. Why? becouse russians dominate tier 5, dominate tier 4 ,dominate tier 3. Before the Br spread and change 6,7 was really playble BR. Well you guesed it. Down came the br nerf"" it is for the people , to get the tier 5 battles going "" oh yeah right... only nation benefited from these BR was russia. There tier 5 beats the hell out of anybody. So ""free frags for the t54 t10m and is4!!!! Russian shells have also  better mechanics then other nations. 122mm shells just go trough anything. why other nations shells obey the laws gravitu ant etc... Russian armor: oh man those t34 bounce a tiger II shell even from a 50m distance, whell you now they had like 9999+ armor values... but somehow there 85mm go like a knife trough butter,,. My opinion: Stay away from this game!!!! save your selfs some time!! go out, dring beer,make a barbecue or a picnic dont now . Anything is better then this developers game.			"

												Two years ago I would have recommended this game. Now I can't.I don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call War Thunder a simulator), so I can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.But I can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.There are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.In order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. When you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).Doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. At the start of the game it isn't too bad. A low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. That's 9 games, fair enough.The problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. To get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the Fw 190-D9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. That's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.That means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. Want to get a jet? Play 500 matches.The game doesn't reward you for playing well either. Even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the MVP, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. It's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. On top of that, Gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. Those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and I can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. They could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. This means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. So to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time I mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.Gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. RP gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since I started playing. This is also why I have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning I would have quit very quickly.This makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why I quit playing it.Now the second issue - balance. This one is a lesser issue to me because I didn't play game for historical matchups.The game uses a system called ""Battle Rating"" to match different planes together in a battle. A plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). Planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. The problem is that the Battle Rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.You will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.Planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.Keep in mind that World War 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. Also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.The result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). Some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.If I feel like seal clubbing I can just take out my He 112-A0, F2A Buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course I'd get next to no reward for this, but I sure would make a lot of people frustrated).In the case of the He 112-A0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.On the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. Bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in Realistic Battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). Some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.Similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.So why do these matchups exist? That you can ask only Gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in War Thunder.This brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.Any of the above will likely never be fixed. The developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. They don't read the English forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.The way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. Anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way Gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. The post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that Gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. There are many more problems with the game that I haven't mentioned because I haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to Gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).I'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.Either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.Everything works perfectly well in Gaijin-land, comrade! (Except it doesn't).TL;DR:If you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. It is free after all. But it's a waste of your time.			"

I wasted around 85 hours here, at first it was good but the more the game evolves the worse it becomes.EDIT 11/19/2015:Recent patch fixed a graphic setting exploit, which is a huge step in the right direction.Cannot recommand the game (still too many problems) but if they keep on actualy improving the fun part of it, yeah it might be something to consider.

												                         Russian Bias simulator 20XX/CKYA ♥♥♥♥♥ PROPAGANDA MINISTRY IS PROUD!--If its russian, it is better in basically everyway compared to any other nations counterparts.  (fire rate, manuverability, fire power, armor strength, etc.) And im talking about all tiers and mode, To the point where its just ludicrously historically innaccurate.--If something new comes out, its great for a few weeks until it gets ""HISTORIKALLY READJUSTED"" to be worse than whatever they may come across in a fight*. (unless is russyan)--Best part of this soviet era police state of a game? Bringing up any negative feedback on their (moderated by russians, who dont speak english by the way) you usually just get your thread deleted and a free ban, no matter how polite you may of been.--But this is a review, so i have to say something for the gorgeous graphics, the attention to detail in the models, the well thought out and enjoyable damage system giving all vehicles unique playstyles based on their strengths and weakness'.-- Soo, yeah, ♥♥♥♥ Gaijin for ruining their own game, but if you enjoy getting stomped as an inferior filthy capitalist/fascist/jap by Stalin blessed valkyries of communism. Or enjoy stomping as bad player you are, by all means, play Russian Propaganda War tapes, a telltale game. "

												DISCLAIMER: I PLAY ONLY GROUND FORCESAfter 700+h on Steam and another 800 on the external client without Steam, it's time to say goodbye. So i write this review now:Simply put, WT is a game with good concepts of gameplay, but ruined by bugs and unbalance.WHY IT IS RUINED:1. Tier 5 of ground forces has been ruined by 2 things: HEATFS rounds, a type of shot which can penetrate any tank at any distance and moslty 1-shot it, and also ATGM carriers, a class of tank destroyer that can fire a guided missile that can 1-shot any tank at any distance, cannot be destroyed in mi-air, and this missile can be shot from full cover positions with just the launching rack exposed, with the actual tank becoming invulnerable to all frontal attacks.2. Other tiers ground forces is also ruined by huge quantity of bugs, like a shot that is suppsoed to pierce a maximum 120mm armor piercing 200mm, or a shot that is supposed to pierce 270mm bouncing a 20mm armor surface. Or again, tanks with a dead gunner being able to shoot at you anyway, shots disappearing in thin air... the list would be too long. Also physics are broken.3. Then there is also planes in ground forces. Oh yeah. If you do some kills in a match you get to drive a plane, each kill is worth 1 point you can spend for this plane, 2 points for rocket plane or 3 for bomber plane. You basically get to drive this plane for like 60 seconds, and you go and bomb or rocket tanks on the ground. Other people can come and shoot you down with 1 points fighter planes or also anti-air trucks can shoot you down. The point is planes are totally unnecessary, are spammed every 5 seconds, people uise them as kamikaze on tanks, and so on.4. In Realistic mode it's even worse, people can bring their own planes and use them indefinitely, so it's a big bomb / rocket spam all along on tanks, while players maybe want a TANK battle not being bombed every 30 seconds.5. A lot of tanks are premiums, you have to pay to get them or drop and complete Golden Wagers, which are nigh impossible to do. Those premium tanks are often overpowered, not all of them but most, and give you an edge on other players. I know this is F2P but some are ridiculous.6. Sometimes there are events, where you can get premium tanks for free, often ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones or ""special"" ones who are just reskins of existing ones, very rarely good ones. These events are always incredibly frustrating, not difficult but just frustrating. But, if you have Golden Eagles (premium credits), you can actually PAY and complete the tasks of an event instantly! Or even better, in some events you can buy a premium ticket, which allows you to get unlimited chances to perform specific tasks and so get an HUGE advantage above non-paying players, and in these events the number of special tanks is limited to say first 200 players on the leaderboards... so or you pay for the premium ticket or forget about getting even close to the special tank no matter how good you might be.7. Tanks are often incorrect about what ammo they carry respectively to their historical counterparts, and shot mechanics are completely broken, it can happen you shoot the enemy's ammo rack with a cannon, and the ammo becomes yellow, or orange, that means damaged, or even black, which means destroyed, but NOT explode, and then the enemy kill you. Same can happen for any other part or crew member, it is totally realistic a crew member can survive a cannon shot in the chest and be only wounded right?8. Maps are often bugged and tanks can actually often shoot THROUGH buildings, concrete walls, steel beams, trains and so on... so don't be surprised if you see killcams of people shotting you through a house or a steel beam.9. [1.61 Update] Last stand mechanic re-introduced. Basically, tanks used to die if they had 1 crew member alive left. Now they do not anymore, but instead thet last crew member can use Gunner or Driver positions as you choose, and you can now request ""reinforcements"" to replace dead crew members with new ones. They will respawn directly in your tank. Honestly, last nail in the coffin.===This might have been a bit ranty and i apologize, but this is completely true. Try for yourself if you want.This was a good game before OP tanks, before Maus (which i own), before HEATFS and ATGM, before plane spam, before events you can pay to win.It is not anymore.			"

												I started playing this back in 1.33 I think. Back then it was fairly well balanced though did have its issues. However, as of now, 1.55, the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The main focus of this review is aimed at the ground forces, but has some relevance with the planes as well.When tanks were first released, they were balanced quite well. You could go into a game knowing you could do well, regardless of which nation or tank you picked. Nowadays though, Russian tanks will one shot you, regardless of where they shoot at you, and they will bounce most shots you fire at them. Those shots that do penetrate rarely hit anything vital. For a long time I've defended against the whole Russian bias, but as of 1.55 I can no longer ignore it. A prime example is HE rounds. Russian HE rounds (designed for soft targets e.g. infantry) are about 4 times as powerful as any other country, this means even well armoured tanks will get killed by them.With the release of Brit tanks, we finally had something that could actually kill T-34s, but of course, they have since been nerfed, through either reducing armour, or by making rounds less effective. Fair enough on some of the ""updates"" they cited sources, however, they have not shown us where they get their data on Russian tanks.Until this balancing is address, I find it very hard to reccommend this game, which is a shame as the potential is there for perhaps the best game of its kind.

												2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier "" Russian Bias Party"" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game.

												After around 150 hours of flight, plus tests etc (started without steam client then moved here).[LONG post incoming...and a bit of rant after the break...beware!]Read comments for updates.Premise: part of the negative review is due to the Free 2 Play model and company/moderator policies towards customers/community (paying and non-paying). The other part was for having the prices of the packs go up during or just before Steam Summer Sale. Not a smart nor respectful move if you ask. Let's see if a negative review hits the soft spot more than a comment cancelled and a thread closed on the main forum to ""keep people at bay and show only one point of view"".F2P model:Not a huge fan of F2P but I gave it a try since I like flight sims. This F2P is not Pay 2 Win but it can get your money out of anger instead of encouraging you to pay for the fun you had (oh and to avoid the grindy grind, but this seems fair enough).Like being competitive from the get go based on your skills only? Not in this game, well, almost. I also don't like this F2P model in particular (Riot/LoL is a lot better IMHO but probably won't work in this game), too much advantage if you use some money in the early tiers. Gamplay levels out in mid tiers. After some hard times trying to face paying players at the beginning you can compensate with experience. Just touched a glimpse of pre-end-game and it seems to get there again. Face experienced players and pay to have some advantages (or not be at a disadvantage) with crews that can only be bought with real money. You can also get more strategic choices with planes lineup and some planes (unbalanced in many subtle ways) that will probably get fixed in the end.Hard to be sure because of the many variables but I had the impression that as long as a match is between non paying customers (some hints on how to recognize them, not 100% sure) it's balanced, otherwise you're facing a veteran player or a paying player. In short: money can substitute experience. As I said not a fan of this model but not game-breaking too, just pretend you were against a veteran or pay for the product you're using.About game modes:- Arcade is quite fun and can be enjoyed without any special equipment typical of the Flight Sim genre, so if this is your case sure give it a try. Less skill based than other modes, just less waiting in queue and more action in game. Badly unbalanced at times. Bomber gameplay broken and game breaking. Matchmaking is questionable at best. If you do good it will penalize you with worse teammates. Some bugs here and there and improvements to be done (collisions, hitboxes and kill assignment) but also positive development on interface features polishing.- Realistic battles are too much of a compromise to me but this is quite personal, they can be fun with a friend and spending some money not to be at a disadvantage with crews and upgrades. Just a warning for all the joystick users: you have to just go directly to Simulator mode here or might have more fun with other flight games because of the mouse issue (Arcade/Realistic battles with joystick vs. mouse users? If you like a tough challenge...mouse users have a sniper rifle, joystick users have a knife, sure you can win a round or two in Close Quarters Battles...but...err...yeah). - Simulator: they're apparently shifting from the simulator aspects towards an almost Arcade oriented game. I might be wrong but this is not bad per se. Simulator is tough to get right and is a money sink, also not fun for the big audience. Some really good premises but slow progress on this game mode, mainly due to lack of interest by the server population. Not Gaijjin's fault, they have a limited but good team on that. Just lack of interest in this mode, though I have to admit that most of the simulator crowd bled away in the past months due to this already starting shift in priorities and some game breaking issues not getting attention (bomber's gunner view and sniping precision for example).You can stop reading here..._________________________________________________________________Still with me? Then probably you're interested in why I gave a negative review...The game is good. It is fun (sometimes not, but others have to win, you know the 50% win rate rule in competitive games ;)).  Pretty solid server infrastructure. The community is a bit harsh on some points but you can ""almost"" ignore this aspect and just enjoy the game until...Until the company policies and forum policies gets in. Luckily we have a right to post our concerns on steam, otherwise the impression given by the forum would be quite far from reality for the average joe.Let me explain better: complaints and criticism are not met well, even if expressed in a respectful and (hopefully) mature form. Plenty of posts cancelled and/or edited. For example my second post on the forum got cancelled, seen happening the same for at least 2 other people in less than 2 weeks. I'm feeling bad about not having freedom of speech but you know, it's an overrated privilege :P.Example: prices for packs on steam went up just when the steam summer sale started, so they were 1 euro more expensive even at a 25% discount than before sale started.I just replied to someone pointing out that Gaijin had the power to fix a matter brought up by the Steam Summer Sale.Less than an hour later my post was removed and the HOT thread closed with people mocked and insulted by a Senior Moderator for ""gambling"" on the sale. I mean, who wants to pay more for less? If I know a steam summer sale is coming, I can wait a couple of days to see what I can get. Complaining for a ""wrong"" policy might have been too much, but suggesting to evaluate if it could be handled in a positive way is another thing. Or at least I thought so...anyway I perceived the price change as a bad move and I expressed it. Result: I was told I ""gambled"" and ""lost""...but my money are still in my wallet and they ""lost"" 2 sales...not sure who ""gambled"" here... Want to do F2P? Get it right or beat your community to get money from anger instead...I don't get it but I might be wrong, only time will tell, sure I learned a lesson and I am curious about the future of the company and of the game ;)To conclude the review on more game oriented negative aspects, almost exclusively about the Air Combat part of the game, Ground forces are not my bread and butter.Many things that can improve gameplay a lot are not top priority (MatchMaking balance, planes' Battle Rating balance, Flight Models and Damage Models) apparently for financial reasons to create artificial shifting gaps that attract money. This is not big news, I've seen masters of this strategy in the last 15 years and Gaijin is just making some experience in the field. If it floats their boat they're right to do so.Emphasis on new planes (sometimes with completely broken flight models) might be good or bad, depending if you like a good polished game or a dynamic one with frequent news.Grind is a bit tough but can be accepted if you have patience and dedication. Progress is like hitting a wall in the late tiers, approaching endgame, but I admit that I agree with them, if you get there you have to pay for what you got.Honestly I was in the process of doing so, just thought that with the sale I could buy 2 packs, one for me and one for a friend who played with me up to here. Just got a bad feeling about this. I'm going to buy one pack anyway probably because I feel guilty for the fun I had before. I just wanted to point things out so they can at least see it, I know they don't care but I never lose hope in mankind :P. Other people might be interested as well before committing to the game.Thanks for reading through, hope this puts things in perspective for a game that has so much potential for the Flight Sim genre and for gaming in general.Wolf			"

												War Thunder is a good game when you look at it as a whole, but when you play it you will start to notice that there's a lot of things that are wrong with it. The players have been screaming at Gaijin from day one that the so called battle rating system doesn't work, Gaijin have made several attempts to fix it, but they always do the wrong things to fix it. The game is losing all the old players because they have become sick and tired of Gaijin's way of fixing the game... ADD MORE STUFF! Ignoring the problems with the game completely. The latest major patch of the game, patch 1.53 had the shortest peak in player interest ever. I left the game not long after this patch after having played the game since 1,25.			"

												Warning:  this game may cause you to swearThe developers have done a good job in making War Thunder a reasonably realistic MMO wargame.Lately, I have been playing the tanks and can report to you that the key to knocking out an enemy tank is to kill all of its crew (as opposed to the tank having hitpoints - as it is in the other major MMO tank game).This game may take a little bit to get used to, but once you do, it can be addictive fun.I believe War Thunder deserves at least one award for its hard work (including research and development) in bringing the nearly-forgotten war machines to life.

Gaijin (based on my view) has no intention of making a game for the gamers, of making a game that someone wouldnt hate after 10 minutes. 1.53 officially killed it, once i saw how much was behind a paywall i knew that the game had reached the point of no return.

												My favorite free to play game! I currently have 220 hours in and I haven’t spent a cent on it! Yes it does take some time to get more advanced planes but if you can be patient about it you can still unlock them without purchasing anything. The graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is intense! You could get into firefights that could last up many minutes. There’s no reason for you not to try this game out! It is also extremely optimized so you can play this game on a less-powerful rig.

												Used to be a good, fun game to play either by yourself or with friends.But then greed. Greed ruins everything.So when I last played this game, it was a fun as heck F2P WWII dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system, was not p2w, and was well optimized with great graphics! But then I heard what they did to the game, and died a little. They ""REVAMPED"" the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. This lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. After hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, I am not happy. This game used to be great, but then they ruined it.TL;DR I would NOT give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system, IF they fix the system.			"

Otherwise  ( and of course unless you are a communist since all the russian vehicles are OP on poorpuse besides all the denials from devs/mods and other staff, which also includes their soviet cold war era rules ) then i reccomend for you to NOT to play this game, and either save your time and money for other actual games or upcoming games which in even earlier stages of development than this one, they are more solid and advanced in many several ways than this piece of commie crap.

												This game should be renamed to ""Russia Thunder"". Its a good game. But its not about skillz. Its about who plays Russia. Couldnt expect less since Gaijin is a russian company. They got the best shells, best armor and the best lucky. You have 25% chance of onehit a russian tank. But they have 100% of onehit you. lol. Since its a russian game, of couse, the US tanks and planes are the worse. haha. They really dont like amaricans. So have fun. If you wanna win, dont forget: play as russian. :DI play this game. But i do not recommend it.Go play World of Warships. Its a fair game.			"

												The game was fun to play, now its horrible.Constant one hits in both aircraft and tanks, tanks especially make this game so keyboard smashingly frustrating I have decided to quit playing.  The balance of nearly every game you play is WAY off.  In aircraft arcade mode nearly every fight is dominated by jets and other aircraft with seemingly impossible aircraft physics.   In tanks you are cruising out looking for prey then suddenly you explode from and exploding ammo load or your crew is rendered unconscious!  So you spend money to get extra crew training points and to upgrade to ace crew and it makes little difference.There is nothing in the game to encourage team play, I play this with a few friends and its impossible to actually play with them.  Another player here refered to it as a complete free for all, he/she is 100% right.Hit aim indicators are pretty much useless, especially in tanks.  You get a green armor penetration marker, you fire a shot knowing that the round should land on a vulnerable location then all you get is ""no damage"" or a complete miss.  Drving a big ♥♥♥ tank through the woods you clip a tree then your tank track breaks -.-  are they made from used condoms and tissue paper?  Vehicle models for ground forces are absolutly nuts.  Russian vehicles are OP, game developer is russian, nuff said.Historically the game is way off, if you spend the time and do your research on vehicles you will see what I am talking about.  Now look at both positive and negative reviews!  Positive reviews are for the vast majority from people with very little playtime and only a few sentences long.  Negative reviews from players with HUGE play time and the majority of them are quit long and descript.  I have spent a long time reading the negative reviews, I agree with them all.  1.37 destroyed the game in favor of capitalism.  1.39 did little to rectify anything.Moderators and support in general is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I actually got chastised by support staff in my last two tickets even though they where acurrate, polite and somewhat complimentary!  The support staff for this game need public execution and mature experienced support persons to take the reigns.Short of it is:  The game is terrible, when you have a problem expect little in the way of help, once you get into a teir 3 vehicle you will just get ♥♥♥♥♥ over and over making progression nearly impossible.  DONT play this is you love MMO's  This game is marketed as an MMO, its missleading.Pardon spelling, in a rush :)Game sucks donkey balls - Enc out "

												first off let me say warthunder is a great game with lots of potential, but it will never reach the full potential, heres why:1.the russian biasit is pretty self explanatory, the devs are russian and so they need to beef up their tanks and planes to make them look better than they were historically.2. the pushing of premiumthe devs constantly push you to buy premium by shoving it in your face as you log in or by telling you that you could be in in tier 5 right now if you had given them your life savings.3.Overpriced premium packsThe premium packs can cost upwards of 100 usd. its sad i know4. extremely slow progressionprogression takes too long, its just a way to get you to buy premium.5. the preium biasyes i know its pretty sad but if you buy premium your ingame performance magically just improves. your guns and armour do so much better.so dont buy into this game or pay the devs money. they dont deserve it they never will. also dont go onto their forums, everyone is toxc and so are the leading moderators who are rude arrogant and vulgar.

												I've been playing this game for quite a while, then I got it on steam, due to the fact that it was hard to deal with transactions. I used to love this game, but then one patch just ruined all the fun not only for me, but apparently for many people. All the frustration that it brought was overwhelming, the whole unlock system literally turned this game into a grind fest, a hard grind fest, forcing you to play what you would not enjoy playing at all. The feedback to changes was the following, all negative feedback was successfully ignored and/or deleted by devs. This game might be fun for a couple of hours but then you’ll just find it incredibly frustrating….

												In a very big nutshell:BEING GERMAN IS SUFFERING, AVOID. These russians have a huge bias against them not because of nerfed plane models, but instead they make GOOD GERMAN PLANES OVERPRICED to the point where you break your bank AND THEYRE TIERS are TOO HIGH so youre paired with allied flavour of the month planes.Russian biased developers who tweak and nerf planes that were presented to them accurately by their international flight team and make russian planes overpowered and dirt cheap to repair (which just quit a week ago because they discovered this and a whole scandal ensued).Grinding like you've never seen before (It makes World of tanks look easy unless youre like that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who bought a years worth of premium and spent $1400 on this game.)Pay to win features shoved up your face (you only made 10k lions this match but buy premium and get double your lions now!!!) (You can have 6 people in your squad with premium! Which still doesnt work).Overpowered planes that usually are flavour of the month (F4U Corsair, Bearcats, Pay to win Spit Mk IX, Vampire, La 7FN, etc) becoming either nerfed the next big patch or made overpowered even more.Did I mention it has terrible hit registration?Ура вы ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ России))))))Update to my Comment:Unfortunately, my comment still rings true and Gaijin dumps this game down the drain once more. Im not surprised because my first comment already explains whats wrong with this game, the new 1.37 patch just amplifies the difficulty and bias of the game even more to the point where now youre practically required to use p2w planes and have premium in order to grind at a decent speed.

												After putting in a metric ton of hours into this game and around £140 into it ive come to the conclusion that its just not worth it.This game is really great at times, there is however a weird parity, its regarding planes, they are great because you can use a tier 2 plane to completely destroy a tier 4, it gives options. Sadly this gets you limited research points not sure why and that becomes a problem, it forces you to use planes you probably dont want to use. for example spitfire vlc has quad 20mm but the game wants me to use a spitfire xvi which has dual 20mm and dual 7.62mm which is worse at everything apart from top speed. Make making is odd because its rarely on point, you either slaughter the enemy or get slaughtered, it could be due to the number of people that are playing it though. By the time you get to tier 4 you have to put in around 20-30 hours to research a plane which is halfed if you waste money on premium. At tier 5 you will need to push an insane 50-75hours for a plane and that extends by 10hours the deeper you go into tier 5 its a massive grind. Tanks however are worse, firstly you get less kills, this means less research which in turn means it takes a lot more time to get a new tank, you are at a disadvantage if you dont have premium there. Afterthat the balance for the tanks is shameful, it comes down to pretty much having your tanks go from epic to paperweights with a minor change to the battle rating system, you arent given that choice and that bugs me big time. I used to be fine with this because i didnt have anything else to play but once i realised war thunder was turning into a monthly subscription to me i had to draw the line somewhere.			"

												If there's anything good to be said about War Thunder, then that is the graphics, because it is truly impressive and beautiful. The planes are all nicely worked out, and there's nothing like an airplane falling from the sky unloading machine guns on an enemy fighter, as well as the explosions and fires equally impressive. The sounds that accompany all the bullets, guns, bombs, rockets and anti-aircraft artillery are pretty impressive (and very high!). The music is appropriate and of good quality, but forgettable, since we are busy enjoying the blue backdrop. We can also paint our planes with a variety of different emblems and symbols to our liking. There are also several maps, and some of them with a night mode.			"

												I first tried this game back in august 2013. I really really enjoyed it for a few weeks. Back then there were only planes in this game and since I was a beginner, I could unlock new tier aircraft rather fast without putting money into the game. I did however buy a few premium aircraft at a very 'reasonable price' ('good old times') simply beacuse I was enjoying WarThunder so much and also wanted to support the devs for this increadible WW2 fighter aircraft game.Being a hardcore aviation junkie I spent most of my time on the realistic battles. The arcade battles are just way too unrealistic for my taste, however I still do play them alot and enjoy them aswell. After a while I stopped playing WT but after a few months break I came back. This was before the ground forces and the game was pretty much the same as the first time I played. I still did enjoy it very much and there was nothing to complain about.Later the ground forces was added to the game. I installed WT again and started playing tanks. In the beginning I did not enjoy the ground forces at all, simply beacuse my lowest tier tanks were facing higher tier tanks with proper armament whilst I had a worthless low caliber gun on my tank. I simply could not get any kills. Therefore I lost interest in the ground forces very fast but went back to the air battles again. I enjoyed the air battles very much but this time around I noticed that, particularly the russian aircraft were OP. Maybe this has always been the case? but I did never notice it as much as I did this time around. Then I bought a steampack where I got some golden eagles and a premium account. I also bought even more golden eagles and bought a ridiculously, insanely expensive premium tank. It literally cost close to 33 euros! For ONE god damn TANK! However I did start playing and with a premium account I enjoyed the game more then ever. Nowadays I pretty much only play tanks because I want to unlock them all. But even with a premium account unlocking new tanks was ridiculously expensive. All the time I have to spend my money on golden eagles to buy lions. This is getting really expensive. If this was a game that cost 60 euros on the steam store, you would save soooooo much money on just buying it once. The prices are insane. They are disgusting. And this is what ruins the game for me. I enjoy the game but its getting way way too expensive!Another HUGE problem is how OP the russian tanks are! Just because the devs are russian it does not mean they should make the russian tanks 2x better than the germans. The IS-2 for example! It is ridiculous! It can take hits like nothing else, and it one hit kills the god damn Tiger pretty much wherever it shoots. Same goes with the aircraft as always. This is a major issue that has to be fixed. However I highly doubt that they will ever fix it.All in all, the biggest issue with the game is the fact that it is virtually impossible to play without a premium account! I would be fine with that as long as all I needed was a premium account! But this is NOT the case! Even with an expensive enogh PA, I still have to put TONS of money into the game! This is solely a PAY TO WIN game and NOTHING else. Even though I love the game itself I am quitting altogether! I am not going to play this anymore simply because its so god damn expensive!			"

												A lot of people hate the game because Gaijin changed things for the worse. Arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do Realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because Germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. However, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more ""unenjoyable"", I beg to differ all of these negative reviews.Firstly let's start off with my experience. I have at least 400 hours logged from the game before I joined Steam. I've played for about a year now, before steam, so I know what I'm talking about.Okay. So about the game itself - It's a WWII simulation. Arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. Mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (And as of June, tanks) to however you want to have them. There is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - You can add decals, paint the vehicle (After getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc etc.Playing with friends is very easy. Just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. Send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.Another thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. Most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. Ghost Shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. Overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (Look on my video section for a War Thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown). There is little music in the game, if any. It is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/MP3/iPod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. Keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. The other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying (""The enemy has taken the base! We must get it back at all costs!"" - No ♥♥♥♥ sherlock).Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not SUPERHARDCOREPVPMUSTWIN. Just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like I do. Give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it.			"

												If you want to play make sure you go Russian and have your backup nation be Germany.  Do not play US or UK lines.  I do not even know why they bothered to put those tanks in the game they are so broken and unplayable it will lead you to quit.  I quit 3 different times for months on end because I was stupid and went US as my main line and UK as my backup.  If you plan on going US or UK lines just do yourself a favor and don't play the game.   Don't be me. Gaijin seems to think putting a 75mm M3 cannon on your M4A3E2 Jumbo ""Heavy tank"" and giving it a 5.3 Battle Rating (the same gun your first crappy 3.3 BR sherman has) so you can go up against Tiger's which you can't even pierce, from behind, point blank is just hilarious.  Especially when they can pierce your front with ease and 1-shot you every single time. When you get up around the 5.3-5.7 BR games you can tell which team is going to lose before it even starts when you bring up the scoreboard and you see which team has the most US / UK tanks.  That team is going to lose every time.Until they balance the game don't bother playing.  Its pretty boring when every corner you turn has a T34 or a pzIV/tiger (or both!) "

												I started playing this game in February or March of 2013... not too sure now. At that time the game was pretty fun and they added some good features along the way. I enjoyed playing and how all the planes were more or less on an even playing field. The matches had some flaws but not too many. But in December they added a new update which made the game completely different. They had a 1-20 Tier selection...and changed it to 1-5. The planes you face are at many times not fair in any way. I now HATE this game... I still find myself playing it but only because of how much fun I had before...and the fact that i dumped money in to it. (Luckily only 15 dollars.)

												TL;DR: Don't play this game. In it's attempt to be realistic, it sacrifices fun. It's patonizing, and teaches you nothing about it's core systems, while constantly telling you how to not crash into the ground. Bad controls, bad gameplay, and just not fun. Avoid. Go play Ace Combat instead. 4/10 (Numeric breakdown at the bottom.)A truely awful experience. I tried this game while losing a bet, but tried to go into it with the best mindset possible. After all, I'd wanted to try for awhile, and Ace Combat 0 is one of my favorite games. Not the same thing, I know, but, hey, maybe I'll love it!I didn't. Going in, the tutorials are god awful, meandering around and teaching things in reverse order (Such as telling you to speed up to a certain speed, THEN teaching you where the speed indicater is), and telling you simple stuff. I'm aware this is nessecary, and I'll let it go. After all, what is a tutorial but a ""how to play games."" (Although, there were a TON of ""Yeah, I get it."" moments..)So, I was let into the game, and it was just boring at it's finest moments. And at all other times, insulting and confusing. The game boils down to ""Put the circle over the enemy's circle and win."", but it doesn't.  It kept popping up reminders to ""shoot the lead indicator"" and ""don't fly into the ground."" Reminding me of core, simple concepts while I puzzled why my screen was going black, or my gun was refusing to fire.  Even with these problems, I was only downed four times in five games. One was a strait forward victory, but the others were caused by being rammed, either by my team-mates or enemies, or a single occasion was my engine cut out, only to allow an enemy to take off my wing with a single shot, leaving me helpless. I was later informed that the game, in it's claim to realism, decided to make guns jam with rapid fire, pilots lose consciousness at turning to much, and bullets be useless unless you hit something vital, if they hit at all. While these are interesting concepts, and true to life, they do not make for a fun experience, especially when they are never explained in game.The control feels sluggish and sloppy, often wavering dangerously out of control, or jerking to a knife turn with a slight shift of the mouse, when it's not slowly plodding along to get where you want. Again, I feel this is probably due to the game's aim towards realism, but it feels boring, and irritating. The visuals are nice, but I don't have much to say on this, as I don't much care for graphics in this day and age.The menu's are likely more understandable with time, but I felt confused as I just pushed buttons to go along with what they told me. Researching and buying and equipping weapons, nor crewing is ever explained, and left me feeling confused and upset when I felt no effect. Once again, this is very likley due to my short playtime, but I feel it needs to be much more well explained. All and all, it's a pretty game, and for those model plane collecting realism fanatics out there, you may have some fun with this, but not being able to turn the camera to look at your plane will take away from your pleasure of this. Numerical breakdown: Visual: 6/10I know nothing about planes, but the ones I got seemed...accurate, I guess? The clouds and the explosions were lovely to look at, but it's hindered by the fact you never will get time to take it all in. I ran the game at high, and it looked very dull and lifeless.Gameplay: 3/10I hated my short time in War Thunder. I didn't feel like a bad ♥♥♥ pilot, dodging fire and chasing my enemies down to their inevitable defeat. I felt like I was piloting a cranky hippo, and slowly following other hippos as I plinked at them with spit balls until they fell down out of pity. Usability: 4/10The UI is competent enough, but due to the lack of explanation on anything important, you'll likely feel lost and confused, at least for awhile, if you don't have someone to jump you in. I gave it extra points because, on High at least, it ran like silk, never a hiccup or slowdown in sight. That in itself is to be commended. Sound: N/A*I don't recall hearing any music, and while this makes for a much more realistic experience, it's a boring one. Bring your own music. The sounds, however, are servicable. Bullets plinking off your plane sound like bullets, and explosions go boom, but nothing that makes you feel there. Nothing that feels like a bullet hitting your plane, or the huge blast you want in a bomb. *Not rated due to my lack of rememberance on the topic. Utterly unprofessional to not go back and make sure, but hey, this isn't a professional review.			"

												This game, in it's current form, has some serious problems in terms of in-game economy, balancing,  and grinding.Balancing: While not too bad for players that fly allied planes (Britain, USA, Soviet Union), those flying in planes of the Luftwaffe or Imperial Navy/Airforce feel the pain. So much so that for the Luftwaffe and Japanese planes, late Tier 3, Tier 4, and Germany's Me-262, Ar-234, And He-162 jets are quite literally almost unplayable. In tier 4 for these nations, you will commonly see on the opposing team P-80s, F-80Cs, Meteors, Yak-15s, B-57s, IL-28s, and the like. All of these are jets planes from late 1944 to 1951 and onwards. All going against prop planes from 1943-1944 with guns that lack enough velocity or power to even stay on target when attempting to engage these planes, and it's not like they can catch them. These planes cruise at about 750-900Km/ph. Now you may think, ""but the axis jets get the same treatment, right?"". No, they don't. Me-262s go up against F-86s, jets which were intodruced in around 1953, a full 9 years ahead of the rudimentary and clunky jets technolgy present in the 262, which has difficulty even getting up to 700km/ph in level flight. The He-162 has the same balancing problem, only it has only 2 low velocity MG151/20 20mm cannons, instead of the 262s 4 30mm guns. The Ar-234 is a jet bomber with no guns, and low speed (topping out at about 760ish Km/ph), and yet it is matched up with Meteors, F-80Cs, and IL-28s. Planes that are not only significantly faster, but also have several rather large and powerful guns. This renders all of these planes, the 262, 162, and 234, not only torterous to play, but also virtually useless, despite their historical significance. As for the Japanese planes, they have the same problems at teir 4 as the germans do, only worse due to the low armor present on most of the planes, along with low speed, making most teir 4 matches in a Japanese plane 7-10 minutes of pure seal club favoring the other team. The only saving grace for the balance system for axis players is the Japanese R2Y2 jet bomber. A manuverable hugh-speed jet bomber with 4 30mm high velocity Type-5 cannons. Other than that, most of the other late game axis planes are bunk do to quite possibly some of the worst balancing I've seen since the ACR 6.8 in MW3.Enconomy: Early on, things arent too bad, but after late tier 2, it becomes that if you get shot down before a match has ended, you end up losing money very quickly, to the point were after a few bad matches, your once baby smooth cool Million has been reduced to a pitiful 300k, hardly enough to afford or train crew for your next plane. To make matters worse, unless in an event, the most one could make during a game on average is usually only 15-30k(ish), making it take literal ages to save or pay for anything in game.Grinding: Similar to Enconomy, in the early game, researching is pretty quick, and relatively satisfying. You get to squee over getting your shiny new P-40 in only a few short matches, but later on, it begins to take days, weeks, and in the case of tier 5, possible months to unlock the new plane, and thats just to unlock it for purchase. If you don't have enough money, than feel free to cry yourself to sleep while you continue the grind so you can pay for the plane, only to have it immediately knocked out from stock-syndrome.All in all, the game has the potential to be something beautiful, but do to the almost blatant refusake to fix some problems shown by the devs, it remains in a rather unbalanced, and in some ways, painful, state.However, Ground forces is pretty great except for the high cost of tanks.

												For what it's worth, this is probably one of the better flying and shooting games i've played that involve WWI and WWII aircraft. It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.Given that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble. Trust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gang ♥♥♥♥ you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!It is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this.			"

												TL;DR great game destroyed by bad devs.Would I reccomend this game a year back? Yes. My best friend introduced me to it and I got hooked, we played for HOURS just pwning people in RAF planes.  It was brilliant, with wonderfully detailed models (still applies now tbh) and varied gameplay with a challenging yet entertaining game that was just fun to play.Then slowly but surely they made dumber and dumber decisions, like casualising tank gameplay (Even on sim mode!) Having imbalanced and unrealistic gameplay (Stalinwood and RAF Planes are best, everyone else suffers) making the game a grindfest and making planes too expensive (you have to grind 'silver lions' to repair planes after battle, if you run out you have to grind starter biplanes) My friend gave up about halfway through saying 'this game is just another P2W 'free' grindfest.' He's right, the game isn't as bad as others (No names), but he's still right.And then the team started making outright moronic changes to the game, the dealbreaker for me was when they started to make flags and certain decals in the game cost real life money, apparently because Ukrainians were using them to bully those poor poor Rooshan soldiers who play this game, after takings ze vacations in Ukrop...Comrade Pootings was made of the sad there, comrades. Politics aside, it's just a cash grab. A dirty filthy cash grab. If they really cared, they'd ban Ukrainian IP's or just removed the flags all together.It was kinda like my ex GF, she started off interesting, fun and she was pretty too, but then she started to get fat, started chatting behind my back and asking for more and more gifts, I hoped both would eventually go back to the good times, but I knew it wouldn't happen. I knew it had to be broken off. So I unsubscribed from the subreddit, deleted it from the library, broke up with Gaijiin by text and killed and hid my computer under the patio when they started to talk backBasically, the developers suffered Hanlon's Razor (never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance). In other words, they aren't EA, but they did make some dtupid decisions that pretty much ruined the game. so I'm writing this review, then I'm uninstalling. Sorry  Gaijiin, you dun goof'd. Also forums have finest KGB mods that will ban you for any reason, keep grinding comrade and keep your head down. 3/10			"

												Lot of good mechanical concepts, but they're burried under abject incompetence in almost every aspect of execution.Horrifyingly unbalanced, grindtastic, stuffed with requests for inordinate amounts of real money, blatant pro-Soviet bias, incredibly slow and laughably unfair matchmaking. Most of that playtime you see is from 5 minute plus queu time.Grind amplified by the number of pointles duplicate aircraft/tanks without meaningfull differences that wouldn't even warrent an upgrade module with a vehicle in any other game.Patches are predominantly composed of utterly pointles and overpriced premium aircraft rather than anything that would take work they can't get directly paid for like balance and optimisation or simply anything other than kicking the playerbase.In the concept, this could be a great game if the developers (or their management) weren't somewhere between malevolant and incompetant. And Gaijin's PR is abysmal.What comes next may be subjective, but I swear to you it is unoquivically the case: The game hates me specifically.I land multiple 37mm cannon hits on an enemy fighter and they don't go down, I fly out in a B-17 Flying Fortress and literally get dismembered by the first 20mm shell to greet me or my pilot takes one machine gun bullet and the whole plane counts as dead. This alone is reliable.			"

												I don't think one can speak of War Thunder without giving World of Tanks a mention at least.At the time of writing War Thunder is roughly around 1mil players and WOT has around 18mil players; does this mean anything? No.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------General Overview:A Free-To-Play game aimed at mutliple market generally suffer in terms of game-quality along with many other issues. War Thunder runs great on PC; has a sleugth of options to fit your liking from shadow-blurring, borderless-windowed, to a mountain of adv settings.Visuals:The visuals are absolutely stunning and gorgeous, everything to the models of the planes to the beautifully rendered fluffy clouds. Single-pilot planes allow for cockpit-view; where the dashboards and controls of the plane are all visually working, along with the pilot and his throttle plus rudder. Landscapes are also vast and give you a sense of flight-realism as you’re staring down from the skies. Along with that, weapon-effects from 1000kg bombs, torpedos, and MG-fire are represented fantastically.Gameplay/Game:War Thunder supports a multitude of different control inputs natively; mouse/keyboard, controllers, gamepads (With a ton of default profiles for most-market gamepads.) and even Oculus Rift support. As any F2P game though however, level-progression is slow and most newbies will likely turn away in frustration after their first hour of constant death. But I doubt anyone who wants to play a game with much depth as this will not-overlook that factor.War Thunder has different control schemes from advanced to intermediate but the most basic control method; the one you being with is the Mouse-Control. In most recent memory, or perhaps in my entire gaming history I have never encountered a game where mouse control worked so well; it is incredibly accurate and fluid in its function. Mouse-Control is great; works flawlessly and will do wonders for players who cannot wield keyboards and other paraphernalia as most hardcore gamers can.As mentioned before War Thunder is a great PC game, in terms of UI, engine and stability; along with options. The developers do care for their game and it really shows.---Gameplay is usually revolved around player-controlled airforces and AI-automated fleets and ground armies. Your team has an airfield; which can be defended and attacked; affecting scores. Generally mission objectives are either: “Destory all Enemy Players” or “Destory Enemies Ground Troops”The outcome of games relies on the mix of fighting between players and the elimnation of AI-troops. Focus on airfield, bases, and troops too much and you’ll notice your entire team had been wiped out. Or waste your time in a 1on1 dogfight; chasing your enemy during the entire match to find that YOUR ground forces are nearly gone.A game needs a good balance of strategy as methentined but airplane composition is also important.Fighters/Bombers is the general-split classification of the planes, if the enemy team has many high-altitude bombers and you have no-fighters in the high-skies = problem.The amount of depth and sophistication in gameplay is astounding for a F2P game, at the same time it is not without some “grinding” and novel-gameplay aspects most are bored with-do exist.---Whether you want to roll down bomb-carpets of destruction with the B17 Flying Fortress, shoot down Americans with the MIG-Jet fighter, or just have relaxing dogfight with biplanes… War Thunder is a great F2P game that should appease to new players and some adv-flight sim players.

												I've been playing this game for about a year and a half, mostly on the standalone client. Through this time period, the game has had it's ups and downs, and on top of that the game has had its fill of Gaijiin not caring about it's playerbase. I've been at the  second to last tier for most of the time I've been playing the game (using the new tier system) Why, you might ask? Well, I don't have the time to devote the almost two hundred and thirty hours JUST to research, and not purchase, the next plane in line. I don't have the effort to sit back while Gaijiin's official community response to the horrible matchmaking, and substantially increased grind is ""It's working as intended, none of the players understand and the blame is squarely on them."" Yesterday, I was going to buy premium, OUT OF FRUSTRATION. And then I wised up really quickly, and saw exactly how much it would take for me to get to my next plane. I can safely say that this game will never get another penny from me until they fix their dreadful system. The fighting and the actual core gameplay is fantastic, and in my opinion, unmatched. That being said, the game core that supports you, like earning currency and experience quickly leeches the fun out of the game, leaving it a cold and empty husk of what it used to be. If you're thinking about playing this game, as a longtime veteran that has been watching things slowly go downhill, and the player numbers dwindle, I can only recommend that you wait until the next major patch and see where it goes from there, unless you are into grinding that makes World of Tanks, which is the game that most of us early players were AVOIDING, look like it's a quick progression system. I hope Gaijiin steps up their game, and their attitude with the international community.If and when they do, I would be more than happy to make a new review parading the turnaround. Until that point, I absolutely cannot recommend the game to anybody unless they like korean made grindfests. In which case, we've got a Russian made grindfest right here that you can possibly enjoy.Good luck, Gaijiin. Listen to your player base when they're screaming at you and dropping like flies.Edit: I've just recieved Jets after all the time i've been playing the game. Again, if you don't already love the game, there's not much in the way of keeping you hooked as far as progression goes.			"

												As a pilot, a combat flight sim jock, and a military historian, I can only say this:War Thunder isn't worth it.The Simulation mode is broken beyond repair. Flight models vary between ""incomplete"" and ""complete,"" whereby the community will argue that ""complete"" means 'perfect,' even though they pale in comparison to other sims. The missions that you are put through completely dash any sense of immersion and waste the potential of aircraft that were role-specific. The AI is laughable and deadly at the same time, which I'm sure an experienced simmer would rapidly recognize.As such, I totally gave up on it, as well as Realism mode.That left Arcade, which for a time seemed a decent distraction of sorts. A game, certainly, and not a simulation. But time tends to bring out the worst.Tiering is broken beyond compare. Not only did they forsake historical accuracy, but ""balance"" involves throwing grossly inferior aircraft into the same match, and by that I mean there is literally not a single advantage some have over the others.Damage modeling and/or hit detection is so poor that you are forced to maintain long tracking bursts rather than make effective snapshots. Conversely, there is evidence of some skill or stat-based handicapping which makes even the slightest scratch lethal, whereas other players can take literally thousands of rounds and keep dogfighting. This dynamic is curiously absent from Russian aircraft which use cannons so large that near misses equate to instant death. Maneuverability in the form of elevator authority and horizontal turn rate is also messed up, because radial Gs and therefore turn rate are fixed. This means that there is literally no way to win a turning fight against even a 1 degree per second advantage without the enemy completely fouling up, and, once again, the Russians have the best turn rates at almost every tier. ""Energy retention"" is a farce, primarily because of a grossly simplified physics. Heavier objects accelerate slow and decelerate fast, regardless of their momentum. Acceleration is also very linear, as opposed to being an inversed exponential function where you have to fight for the last few mph. When all of that is combined, Russian aircraft which are predominantly made out of 'wood,' even at a stage where they were using 2,000 HP engines, accelerate ridiculously fast, dive ridiculously fast, and climb ridiculously fast. Even if a metal aircraft has a higher top speed, it will take so long to get there that even some biplanes can catch and destroy it simply by hitting their top speed first. At the same time, the ever vaunted I-153 Chaika, because it's ""light"" and has its horsepower, is capable of outclimbing and outcruising even a P-40 at altitude. Thus the statistics seen in-game about maximum speed and climb rate are effectively Lies, and, yet again, the Russians hold the advantage.And finally, the ""domination"" game mode which is so often repeated is nothing more than a ""please kill us, Russia"" festival in which altitude advantage and performance are practically irrelevant. Russians armed with cannons can simply nose up at leisure and plug you with cannons, and it is only through rapid and shameless ganking that you could possibly defeat them under such circumstances.All of this begs the question whether or not it was designed to favor Russian players, or if Russian aircraft design just happened to work best under broken conditions. The answer to that will never be known to satisfaction unless a Gaijin employee blows a whistle, which is highly unlikely.So in the end, there really isn't much else to say. War Thunder is worthless as a simulator, and is considerably broken as an arcade game. If you play it, my suggestion is to avoid the forum, avoid the fanboys, and avoid Paying Money. It is Not a game I would pay money for, under any circumstances.			"

												War Thunder has been one of my favourite games for the past year or so now, and it's changed in so many different ways. Even though some of the core game mechanics have been altered and vehicles have been added in which have changed combat completely, I still find it to be the same addictive vehicle sim that i've loved every minute of. One thing you'll want to know before you try this, which you should by the way.... it's free!.... is that Gaijin like to change around things. A lot. Oh and don't play this for one nation, as you'll get burnt out really quickly.Time for a little list....Pros:Its freeIsn't Pay to Win (though some will argue otherwise)Can't instantly buy the best vehicles, Tier V's need to be earnedLots of vehiclesDevelopers update regularlyEvents and competitions(Eventually.........SHIPS!)5 complete sets of Aviation trees for US, Germany, Russia, Britain and Japan (though there are still planes to add)4 complete sets of Tank trees for all of the above except Japan, who are in developmentControl customizations...too many.....Did I say it's free?Looks beautiful!Cons:A little bit of nation bias.... just a bitNo proper realism mode e.g a few Me 262's face off a couple dozen P-51'sThe grind to the next tier can be rough aloneVoIP is a little mehWhat are you waiting for? Try it out!With a bit more balancing, and less Russians (шутят), then this game could easily be bumped up a bit. Oh and wait for ships to come out, RIP WoWS....Score 86/100			"

												THIS GAME IS FUN TO PLAY!Everything else about it is ♥♥♥♥.First and foremost:How would you like to fly a piece of tissue paper against an army of ginsu knives?  Because that's what the matchmaking will do to you.  They have tiers: different levels of planes that follow a semi-chronological order of how the planes were developed and improved throughout history.  But, in matchmaking, the tiers mean nothing.  Have fun flying a bi-plane against a jet.  The matchmaking used to work, but then they upgraded it, and now everything is terrible.Secondly:The interface is awful.  I hope you like opening menu after menu after menu.  There's no real explanation for anything, and there's a lot that needs explaining (matchmaking, upgrading planes, what the currencies represent, what do my crews do, what does upgrading them get me, why aren't my friends getting my invites to my team, etc.).  The only thing that's obvious is the ""start battle"" button.Third:The game is fremium.  It isn't 'pay to win', since there's only so much you can upgrade the planes, and they're minor upgrades anyway, but there's a constant siege of ""pay money to not have to grind this.""  It's not really a big deal, but if that sort of thing bothers you, then watch out.  Honestly, before they bungled up the matchmaking thing, I would have gladly paid money for this game.  It is fun, when it isn't horrifically broken.Fourth:The chat interface needs work.  Nothing too major, just smooth it out a bit, make it carry conversations from out of game to in game, so I don't have to constantly swap between steam chat and ingame chat.Having said that, the game IS fun, when it works right.  When you're not being instantly shot down after five minutes of flying towards some dot in the distance.  When your weapons can actually do something against the enemy npc targets.  (Both are matchmaking problems).So.  Until they change the matchmaking system, I'm not recommending this game.  It's great fun.  Stay away from it for now.			"

 War ThunderIt is a multiplayer / mmo game released as a free title, where we are fighting with other players in the air and on the ground but also soon on the sea. This production gives the opportunity to play in different modes: arcade, realistic and simulation. Each differs in the level of difficulty as well as varied gameplay. The game has micropayments, premium accounts but they do not interfere in the game (perhaps only at the beginning). In the game we develop crew that they are in a better use of our war machines, you can use real money which is not really that expensive, or develop them by playing the game. To unlock another machine, you have to play a lot to gather a certain amount of points, or once again use real money to unlock immediately (which is not profitable). In addition, after each unlocking we have to buy them and train our crew to use it. The game offers several nations such as Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan. Each of them has a lot of number of machines to choose from (Japan does not have tanks). War Thunder has a very powerful, realistic physics and damage system. Controlling planes and tanks is very realistic. Destroying enemies is about eliminate the crew or give critical damage to machine. This game is a really great production except for a weak balance the machine, while playing I had a lot of fun destroying vehicles enemy players. Great sound system, nice gameplay, beautiful graphics convinced me to play for hours. I highly recommend this production, however, I warn that, for me, the game began after unlocking Tier 3.All in All  War Thunder is a really nice Simulation Game!9/10 From MeSweep "

												Only way you can have fun in this game is by playing the undertiered Russians with their glorious Chaikas, LaGGs and Yaks all built with glorious Stalinwood that can shrug off even a 75mm cannon. And while you're not dying, you can feel the the light of Stalin shining down on you as you kill all the poor Tier 1 planes with your heat-seeking 20mm cannon that nobody can escape from. All Soviet tanks fire shells that the ghosts of Stalin and Lenin will personally guide towards the enemy so you don't have to aim. NOT EVEN FIRE WILL STOP THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GLORIOUS SOVIET WAR MACHINE.			"

												A fun game on the whole but there are a number of issues with it--Server sinc issues-Payed tanks are over powered for their ranks-Map fatigue-Not all key functions are bound by default, meaning that some of the important keys that you will need are not bound from the start and you will have to explore to find them-Cramped UI-Random rewards are lack luster or outright uselessWith all of the negatives of the game it is actually really well supported by the developers with frequent updates, ever changing vehicles, and the ammount available only ever expands. The vehicles and mechanics are generally realistic, though some liberties have obviously been taken to make it more appealing but you will learn alot about mechanized warfare in the 21st century just by playing the game, and learning is always a good thing. For all of its faults, it really isnt a bad game.Final sumation: If you are looking for a game to mindlessly dump hours into, yell at and scream when you get knocked out in the first three minutes of a match, and grind XP late into the night because you want a new tank, then this is a game you would probaly enjoy.UPDATE: Since the recent update to Warthunder there is an issue with aircraft balance. Certain tank designs have either open tops, sides or are much less of a tank and more of an armored truck, are now overly suceptable to attacks by aircraft. There have been a great many times I have 'burned down' without taking any damage or having been in a fight. Yet, a player who was flying an aircraft was credited for the kill. In non simulator modes of the game this is an unfortunate development as it seems to effect the game in a negative way. It is not glorifying to have an aircraft slam into you for a kill, nor is it rewarding to kamakazi your aircraft as soon as you get it. The purpous of flying aircraft is now redundant since you inevitably resort to dive bombing the enemy in a half hearted attempt to get a kill, but on the whole are attempting to return to the fight.

It's changed in different ways though, a lot of crazy things have been added. Still though, Gaijin Entertainment has done a fantastic job with War Thunder, and I hope that will continue.I voted for War Thunder in the Steam Awards for the ""Just 5 more minutes!""

There were a few issues that still needed to be ironed out with matchmaking and flight models, but the game was great and had a lot of potential. However, after the release of Update 1.37 I would recommend that players avoid the game until Gaijin figures out how capitalism works.			"

												This is a game of peaks and valleys. The look and feel of alot of the vehicles is pretty great, so you wont notice the grind at first. Then once you get to the higher levels and can get a hold of some of the tanks that can typically oneshot any other tanks provided they aren't facing towards you and even then. It can get super frustrating but that isn't to say that it is all bad. As for the positives there are fewer things more satisfying or fun than rolling up in your kv-2 or is2 and just deleting people with your derp cannon. If you don't mind grinding and aren't easily frustrated this game might be worth a shot.			"

												This game is pure for the company to get money from the players.I am a tanker in realistic simulator and arcade, and i don't fly anymore because stalium on planes.And since you're not getting much research points i get about 800 rp in realistic and 1200 rp in arcade.Simulator is a timed event so you cannot go in your favourite tank at any time in simulator (also counts for planes)They also got a bad system for  ranking tanks and planes with a 0.7 br difference possibility.So when you have a tiger 1 you face of with t-44's.The team is not realible because they all want kills to get rp and get the new vehicle, the tow hook for example is in game already a long time yet nobody knows about it, and the spawnrape is real expecially in realistic and simulator.A bad system for teamkillers how do i know i was about to shoot a enemy and clicked to shoot, bam teammates shows up behind a rock and i get kicked for that aciidental teamkill and all i get is a loss in lions and go to the main page where i just can go directly to a new battle.The post war ♥♥♥♥ is real m8 you got vehicles that dident even existed in ww2 and mixing ww2 vehicles with post war ones doesent make it accurate at all.Not only that they also wanted to make a REALISTIC game with not REALISTIC armor on tanks and planes.and planes that never flew or left the designer table.Prices go always up and so do reserch points needed, and now im talking more about rp it takes me atleast a week or 2 to get  a new vehice with many hours spent.Alot of people will get frustated with all the above so they would pay to get to the high tiers for a free to play game.Dus people are leaving the game more and more making it emptyer and so they increase the br difference for fast games making unbalanced gamesThe only good thing is the lion gain and the graphics and the models and thats it.

												I know I have not played War Thunder for too long, but I am experienced in gaming. War Thunder is honestly great at the surface, there is so very many little details to the vehicles and environment, and the dogfights can be absolutely gorgeous. The tanks and aircraft are so incredibly well modeled, and personally I find the shell penetration camera to be quite amazing. Watching tiny fragments explode and bounce around inside the tank's interior. As a simulator, it fares quite well, as tanks do not just explode into full speed, and turning requires skill in order to not lose speed. However, there is a but to all of this.I understand that this is a ""free to play"" title, and as such they plant micro transactions to hell like usual. One thing I do like (i play world of tanks a lot as well) is that decals and customization, while limited, is permanent and you don't have to keep rebuying as you do in wot. The grind is not good in War Thunder. Actually, it is just terrible. Games such as War Thunder and World Of Tanks make getting to the next level of vehicles feel like a job, and the reward after hours and hours of gameplay is just not worth it.The matchmaking is poor, as you will often be fighting enemies you have no hope to defeat, and the ai comrades are not exactly the best.If I were Gaijin, I would scrap the whole free to play idea, because it makes this game and many others like it just a crappy and greedy cash grab. It is just my opinion, but I think that War Thunder would make for a great full price title, but more focused on a singleplayer than multiplayer, because as we all know online multiplayer is sometimes just the worst. A true PVE mode would be great, as well.I know these ideas are just that, and that Gaijin is just one of those companies that is more interested in the payment and income rather than making a genuinely deep and amazing video game.And because of that, I cannot reccomend War Thunder in the form that it exists right now.It is an amazing concept of land, sea, air direct control warfare buried beneath a freemium pay to win mess like so many other games.

												I have played the game mainly outside of steam, so my real time count would probably be about 600 hours and not 6,5. I can safely say that the games is only a long and boring grind. the soviet is MUCH more powerfull and get a lot more options when it comes to arsenal than all other nations. ill let you guess why... (gaijin is russian.) 90% of all your sessions will be ended purely because youre too frustrated to continue. For example: Youre grinding that annoying aircraft that you already have used in more than 400 games and it struggles to even scratch anything and out of nowhere you get instakilled by a fkcen yak or any other russian (soviet) aircraft in generall. And btw, I have friends that have just out of nowhere lost all of their GE (kinda like gold money that you buy from real life cash)EDIT: After a 2 years long break i thought that maybe they fixed the ammount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game, but nah. bombers are still made of paper, and russians are still super biased... the thing about the russians being biased is extra frustrating because they always say this game is realistic, but in reality, the soviet was really poor and couldnt afford any good aircraft. they were so poor that they even used the ""5 man line"" tactic, the first guy in the line had a rifle, and when he died, the second guy took his rifle, and when he died, the third guy took his rifle and so on...Moral of the story: 3/10. Pretty graphics, but terrible in any other way.Dont install it. Unless you have the patience of fkcen buddah or if you just want to be mad all the time and suffer.its sad because its such a missed potential.			"

												I picked up the game following it's recommendation from a YouTube personality known as the Mighty Jingles. Long story short, I enjoyed the game to some extent for a while, the flight controls were intuitive, the graphics and audio were near-perfection, and even the ground combat was entertaining, keeping in mind this entire game is built out of a flight simulator game engine. Sounds nice right? Well, the real problem comes from the publisher, community moderators, whoever, that have repetitavely smothered the game's community contributers for little to no reason. I'll only name a few examples, as if I wrote out all of the stories this review would be a novel. I believe in mid to late 2015, the War Thunder premium content prices were hiked up roughly two weeks before a steam sale, so that when put on sale, the content would be reduced back down to it's original price. Anyone dumb enough to buy the pre-steam sale hiked prices were not given refunds. Most recently, there had been a survey posted on the WT website, asking players to vote (due to a hack that makes all enemies fully visible) whether to basically give this hack to absolutely everyone, thereby implementing it into the game, or to pledge support to Gaijin, permissing them to abuse, the YouTube copyright system to take down any videos discussing the hack in any way. This is definitavely not how a developer or publisher should ever act; let your product speak for itself, don't make it lip-sync, then get angry when others point it out. Overall, good game, the issue is that it's under the control of someone at Gaijin who is obviously too inmature to handle the video game industry.			"

												I would have recommended this game maybe last year...but then the British patch came out and now tier 3 tank battles are hell. The reason, pay to win with the A.43 BlackPrince. Can't pent the front with any tank below 5.7 BR (unless you're playing Russian, which the game is very bias towards). Apparently it is fair for the A.43 to get sabot rounds while no other tank has them until late war-post war. People may say just flank it cuz it only goes 10 MPH, expect the A.43 can just stay 1 KM away from everyone and snipe.			"

												If your new to war thunder  here's a key tip, the aim reticle you see on an aircraft, if your behind them aim a bit above it to actually hit themAir battles are alot more relaxing depending on the situation your compared to ground battles where it can be stressful and frustrating while rewarding on how well your match can go, i would recommend starting off in air battles at first then transitioning towards ground later on to ease you in.On ground battles however its a different level of game entirely with the possibility of having your entire line up of tanks getting wiped out within minutes to not loosing a single tank, i would recommend starting off with either russia or the recently added japan ground forces, russia as their tanks have some good sloping and armor early on in their line upm while japan for some highly mobile (in my opinion) tanks with an equivalent tank to the KV-2 on tier 1 called the ho-ro with a hefty but lethal 20's reload, 150mm mortar canon, which will one shot kill most tanks should you use the high explosive rounds being viable until tiger tanks or is's start appearing.The game is fun and doesen't become a paywall until you start unlocking some of the more iconic tanks to each faction, the closest thing i can relate it to is the heavy tank no.6 and all the tanks to its left.

												TL:DR The balance issues in this game are nothing short of atrocious. The developers are iconoclasts with no respect for half-decent free-to-play models or competent community management. With that out of the way, let's get down to the more in-depth description of what's wrong with this game:- Every subsequent patch seems to be based on strong-arming people to buy overpriced premium content rather than allowing them to do it themselves. Progress through tech trees is incredibly slow to the point of frustrating and fun-crushing. It is difficult to grind out new machines (especially at higher tiers) even by the standards of tiered F2P games.- Balance issues are present from Tier II upwards, most notable at Tier IV and Tier V (especially with Ground Forces). The game is prohibitively difficult to enjoy when the vast majority of battles involve facing off against tanks that cannot be penetrated or aircraft which effortlessly gain energy advantages. Many planes and tanks that see each other in this game simply aren't comparable.- High tier bombers are Satan's children. Honestly, though, I can see why bomber spam exists. So much horrible behaviour comes about from the War Thunder community because the devs have made it painfully difficult to actually enjoy the game, and people playing it to grind out higher-tier vehicles are obviously going to do unpleasant things in order to make it happen.- Community management is nothing short of terrible. The CMs who are present on the game's forums are unpleasant and incredibly heavily biased, acting defensively and with standoffish behaviour regardless of topic or criticism. No issues from the playerbase are getting through to the devs because these community managers act as indiscriminate gatekeepers. One of the best things that Gaijin could do at this point would be to overhaul their entire community management team.- It's not fun. That last one hurts me a lot because I used to find it fun, before patch 1.29 where they took it upon themselves to wreck the economy and slow the grind down to a crawl. Progression became so horrible that it's hard to pin down quite when it stopped being fun, but before long I realised that I was playing for the grind rather than anything else.So I can't recommend this game. It's a technical masterpiece, really well optimised, beautifully rendered and gorgeous to look at. If you're after a nice visual experience, give this a go. If you like good devs and fun gameplay, give it a miss.			"

												Pointless game. Get into combat, get shot at through obstacles, get killed right away. One has to wonder, is it cheating? Manuever into their rear, take shots, either bounce or no damage, they turn around, you are dead. Updates process is so complex... obviously design to get suckers to spend. But, when it is all said at done, the cheating and you inability to inflict damage makes you wonder why spend any money. The cheating wont stop just because you spent money. And the ramdon effect of shots makes it pointless to even try. Give it a try but dont get sucked into spending money. It's not worth it.			"

												Used to be so much fan, a birlliant game I sunk hour after hour into, on both PC and Playstation 4. The more you grind the more difficult it seems to be to unlock new vehicles. The 'Wagers' (challenges in which you unlock extra ingame currency) are borderline impossible more often than not. People always bang on about Russian bias however, and let me tell you something, those people are speaking complete and utter..... sense. The Russian aircraft often take you down in a small burst whilst you watch your German aircraft pump 300 mg rounds plus 100 cannon rounds into a lower ""battle ranked"" aircraft.The graphics still hold up well but the question on reviews is would I recommend the game. In it's current, seemingly pay to win state, no, not one bit.			"

												War Thunder is frustrating. I long gave up on fighter combat, because I'm ♥♥♥♥ at air-to-air in anything and the balancing was stupid as all hell anyway, so I instead spend most of my playtime now in the mud. It sucks, because as it stands warthunder is the only non-simulator tank game that makes a tank feel like a tank (rather than the gliding-across-the-ground tanks you get in WoT and Armored Warfare), but the game is just SO so bad. The balance is terrible (How do you like facing Panzer IIIs in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cavalry tank that's not even up-armored enough to defeat .50s?), the grind is terrible (~500RP is a decent match, and it'll be costing you tens of thousands of RP to get most vehicles), the playerbase is terrible (have fun being the only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moving from beyond some useless camping positions!)Just don't bother. The playercount has been steadily shrinking for a while now, too, meaning the wait times between battles grow longer and longer (and Gaijin continues to do dumber and dumber things to ""fix"" that), and the quality of players grows lower and lower.
