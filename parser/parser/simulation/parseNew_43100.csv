												Fun game if you want to just goof around with adorable critters. bought the game with full excitement of ""OH MAN CUTE THINGS"" and was only disappointed to find that there are only these families to pick from for animals in the PC version:- Big Cats- Horses- Giraffes- Small Monkeys- Koalas- PandasThe disappointment sets in when you realize, the game for Wii, has the above plus the following:- Bears- Penguins- Crocodiles- Antelopes- Elephants I looked it up, maybe there was a code or something for getting the other families, nope! Turns out the World of Zoo group was apparently laid off by Blue Fang, leaving half of the PC version incomplete. SOOOOO DON'T EXPECT TO GET THE REST OF THOSE ANIMALS ON PC ANY TIME SOON.Other than that, if you've got no beef with the above I'd say buy it, it's really fun, I'm just a little peeved I don't get the game I was expecting. Know what you're getting into.Yes I'm mostly upset I can't have a virtual Croc buddy. I was excited due to the fact that I haven't got a Wii and I've wanted this game for a while now.A little let down, but it is a game meant for children, not 22 year olds with no life and tons of time on their hands. Feeling a little ripped off, glad I didn't buy it at full price, thanks Blue Fang. At least make some DLC for the rest of the animals or somethin? "

												It would be nice if the developers owned and embraced the fact the game is definetly oriented towards younger kids. I found out about it online while looking for a game for my kids so I bought it knowing full well what I was buying. I can see how some people may have bought the game thinking it was something more than what it is. Either way my 5 year old loves it and its something we get to do together so great game in that regard. Not recomended for gamers though.			"

												Cute game. A bit childish, but if you like cute animals or have a young kid to entertain it's a good way to pass the time. There is a nice variety of animals and plenty to do with them, toys to play with, and stuff to feed them. You can even design your own animals (fur pattern, body type, etc) to an extent. My only real wish is that you could rename the animals. Overall, not a bad game if you like cute, casual games. If you have a touchscreen laptop/monitor, it can be even more fun. And it runs fine on Windows 8, if that's what you happen to have.			"

												Only played this a little while, but damn it's cute!Reminds me of kinectimals, and nintendogs on my 3DS.But with a lot more variety...and probably more stuff to do.Started with the big cats (can't think why :P ) and now have a little cub in the exhibit too.  Hehe, too damn cute.Graphics are cute too, and the animals move quite well and realistically.  They behave as you'd expect, when stroking and brushing, and even have a little fun without you pestering them all the time.Just give em a toy, and watch em go...or sit back and let them make their own fun.I especially like the thought bubbles...makes it easier to do stuff with them, without having to search for ages in your bag to find what they wanted.

												In all honesty, this game is great! It's supposed to be a kid's game, but nothing wrong with getting in touch with your inner child every now and then. Originally bought this for when I watch my 4 year old nephew just to keep him occupied, but I found that I enjoy it as much as he does! Of course I had to operate the controls for him at first, but he caught on pretyy quickly and can play it on his own mostly now. It's  very entertaining for us both, and his reactions to the animals are priceless! Every now and then I'll play a half hour of it myself, kind of a refreshing change of pace from my usual games and a good time killer too. If you have a kid, get it. They will love it! And then you can act like a kid too when nobody is looking:D			"

												When I decide on games to buy for the Wii, I had one rule that prevent bowing money on bad games: Never buy a game from a third company except Okami.  World of Zoo is a good reason for the rule, even though I payed for this game dirt cheap on Steam instead of buying it for my Wii.  I do praise the game for being gentle on PC parts, temperature wise; I also praise it for including animal customization, believable animal sounds, a fun art style, and the attempt to be educational.  However, the game play is very poor from the controls, mechanics, and a lack of challenge.I will start with the controls.  I understand that this game is on the Nintendo Wii and the controls were meant for the Wii-Mote pointing at the screen.  The transition from Wii-Mote to mouse and keyboard went well, but I am very concerned about the left-handed people who want to play this.  Unless they go through the control panel, there is no way to play this on left handed mode.  In game, the clicking commands do not work 100% of the time.There is another in game issue and those are the mechanics, or how the game works.  The first thing that irks me is the fact that you are a camera stick in one position with the only movement being pivoting from the spot.  This causes some of the clicking command issues I have mentioned earlier.  For example, there was a treasure that was behind a play set structure.  Most of the clicks landed on the structure instead of the treasure spot.  If I had the ability to move my camera around more freely, stuff like that could have been prevented.  The animals also have response issues, especially since there is no ability to pick a specific one for separate commanding.  The last complaint in this department is the use of an annoying video game trope.  I don't know what it is called, but here's how it functions: You keep playing the game to unlock a needed thing, but it is useless because there is no more game play value (Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Time/Darkness is guilty for this, but I can't explain why because it will contain spoilers).  Going back to World of Zoo, the game made me play one enclosure for a long time with 2 animals just to unlock certain parts to create my ideal 3rd creature.  This is indeed optional, but nobody should have to deal with the struggle of staying awake in boredom for a creature that will barely be played with once the player leaves the exhibit.Speaking of struggling with wakefulness, the game lacks a good challenge.  Having a ""needs"" bars like hunger and sleepiness would be a good fix to this issue.  The challenges the game provides are too easy and they are not leveled according to animal count.  I know that this game is meant for kids, but that does not excuse it from this issue.  The Super Mario series are for kids, but they provide fair challenges that even stump some adults.Overall, this is not a good game to buy because of controls, mechanics, and a lack of challenge.  If you are a parent looking for educational material covering animals for your kids, I would pass this game and have them watch Zaboomafoo instead.			"

												It's a child's game, sure, but why did Blue Fang have to rip us off? Did they think we wouldn't notice because, perhaps, are kids wouldn't tell us thst half the game is missing. Do they enjoy ripping off small children? With out the additional animals the game can be completed in an hour. Did they think are kids would just keep playing the same game over and over agian? Why do they call it a zoo when they're are only five or six different types of animals to began with? Why did I pay fifteen dollars for half of a game? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A HUGE RIP OFF! I tell you. I don't understand? How hard it would have been to add the rest of the game to the pc when other platforms already have? More people play the pc than any other platforms. This is a serious marketing mistake. The people at Blue Fang should all be fired. No, wait, I'm firing them and will never buy a Blue Fang game agian for the pc.			"

												The game is intended for children with its colourful graphics, simple goals and educational cards about the animals but I'm having a lot of fun with it even as an adult. This is a perfect break from the usual zoo simulators. No need to worry about bankruptcy, slacking employees, complaining visitors or the animals getting jiggy with it a bit too much and overcrowding the enclosures. Just sit down with your friendly technicolour beasts and relax. Play with them, hand-feed them, clean them and build a few additions to their habitat while soothing music plays in the background. Definitely worth the purchase even at full price.			"

Even now it's still cute and charming, the graphics are simple enough that it ages well. Now I keep it on hand for when I babysit. I'll even sit down and play it myself sometimes if I'm stuck waiting in an airport or something equally as mind numbing.

												Looking for a masterpiece in a visual and aesthetic setting? Look no further, as World of Zoo throws the rule book out the window, then gets it back again and throws it out the window again, hitting an old woman on the head accidentally killing her.That's how groundbreaking this game is. Run you own ♥♥♥♥ing zoo. A ♥♥♥♥ING ZOO. Can you handle it? CAN YOU?			"

												World of Zoo is for kids. I seriously can’t recommend this to any gamer who is serious about gaming. While the name does bring up some Zoo Tycoon references, it plays absolutely nothing like it. If Nintendogs ever went zoo mode, this would be it.  You spend the entire game poking the animal you are taking care of, while also feeding them enough food to cause diabetes. Each and every animal have the same two personalities; happy because you pamper them and utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because you’re a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ zoo keeper. Apparently alligators do chase their tails, and lions won’t kill you if you chuck a beach ball at them. Total lack of realism in a flipping zoo game, sorry can’t recommend.			"

												This game is awesome, I'm a 22 year old male who has adopted a blue cat whom I've lovingly called Cheese-bus and he has a friend called Happy, it's nice to check up on them both every now and then.			"
