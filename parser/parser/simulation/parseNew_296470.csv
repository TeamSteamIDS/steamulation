												Basically you just di<k around trying to erect a man mountain while waiting for someone to co<k up. I'm not being hard-on the game when I say it isn't very s<hlong and doesn't contain a massive load of game modes or a penetrating plot, because overall it's a nice package. It's not expensive, so you won't feel shafted blowing your wad and your wallet will retain it's bulge. For me it's a definite wiener!...pen|s			"

												Men touching men. Swinging♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Low gravity mode. This game has everything! Pros: - It's funny, challenging, and a great game to mess around in with some friends.- Various game modes.- It's cheap.- You can put yourself in the damn game! Heads and bodies are customizable. Tired of dudes? Makes yourself a sexy woman. Sure, she'll still have a huge dong flopping between her legs, but I won't judge you.Cons:- It will get repetitive after you play for a while.- Gameplay is limited to what you can by just moving limbs.I also feel I should address a comment I saw in the community discussions about this game:""what the hell is this?? some group of gay shlong dingling donging around while they're nakedly trying to stack up on each other? hell no this is gross""^ That is why you should buy this game.

												...I just spent almost 2 hours in an online match with some random guy.  Neither of us were trying to win the game (bridge builder).  We were pretty much on par with one another skill-wise in the beginning.  Suddenly he pulls a fancy move and teabags my character, grabbing his head and smacking his junk against his face.  It was hysterical. I did the same thing right back, attempting to ride his face 'Gangnam style.' This went back and forth from a number of bizarre homo-erotic positions.  The novelty just did not seem to wear off.Thank you, random guy.   Sorry I ended up failing in the end and ruining our teabag-fest. Whether you're good at this game or terrible, it's guaranteed to bring numerous smirks and snickers if low-brow humour tickles your pickle.  The pros+ Hilarious 'QWOP' style ragdoll physics (albeit much easier to control)+ Multiplayer with friends or randoms+ A good variety of game modes and tweaks to keep things fresh for longer+ Likely a game that will be revisted a lot+ Amusing soundtrack and effects+ Lots of customizing options for your teamThe cons- Novelty may have the potential to wear off- Limited casual game, easy to try everything in one sitting9.5/10 -  Would put my dongle in a stranger's face again.

												This game is a tremendously moving social commentary on the current state of Corporate America, and the struggles of the middle-class citizen.  Each mounter represents a member of our capitalist society clambering to be successful and live the American Dream, only to be shoved away and sat upon by another of their fellow citizens.  The goat represents the economic food chain, in which those who are weak are crushed by those who have become mad with power and influence.Or maybe this is a game about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥physics.10/10			"

												As a heterosexual male this is the most fun I've ever had with swinging♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disregarding that one time at band camp, of course.In all seriousness, this is a fun little game to play, and even moreso with friends. The controls are pretty straightforward, and the different game modes are fun and keep the game fresh. The added customization aspects are a nice touch too. 10/10 like vertical QWOP with wieners.

												You spawn into the world, and proceed to climb on top of a goat. You strike a pose.Your friend spawns into the world, climbs ontop of the goat - grabbing you in questionable areas in the process - just to pose on top of your head in an even more terrifying manner. You spawn again, returning the favor, with a smile on your face.			"

												Where do we begin..? Where do we begin when reviewing this amazing physics-based and homoerotic ""Simulated 'Sportslike' Experience""?Well we begin with the fact that not only is it pretty addictive, it's pretty damn hilarious to boot. Definitely some of the loudest and most uncontrollable laughing moments I've ever had with friends online. The characters in the game are all 100% customizable too, you can put your face on the heads of these characters, change the limbs with other images, give them names, nationalities, and voices (grunts).After playing this game you will reach what is called 'englightenment', and you will be at peace with everything that is in this universe, because naked men climbing eachother just shows you the way.Liked this review?

												The premier dongle flailing simulatorDon't believe me? Check out these amazing reviews IGN - 10/10, My dongle flailed with the might of a norse god on cocaineGamespot - 5/5, My sister imploded from the raw sexuality on display in this gameSome wise old man - 10/10, I didn't ask for your life storyKotaku - 69/420,  Using this game alone I managed to train my dong to function as a form of propulsion and now am considerably a super hero. Metacritic - Prophet/10, Some say once in a lifetime, a new prophet is born and all must be there to praise it. In this case, to praise it you must raise your dong high. There is a new lord here, children.			"

												Mount your Friends is the pinnacle of adrenaline-pumping sports.You start out climbing ontop of a goat, then the next sportsman climbs ontop of the last in an ever-expanding tower.The sheer pressure under which the athletes must work is astonishing, nevermind their determination to reach the top anew with each passing round. You yourself as a spectator can even feel the pressure when they struggle to reach the top with each second ticking past them.Do not miss out on the sensation that is sure to sweep across Steam in a maelstrom of popularity and join today to mount friends and strangers in a struggle that is all too real and will surely leave you wanting more.

												I have played Mount Your Friends on Xbox for a little while now, always with friends, and it's the game that the group always ask to play first.At it's core there is a very simple premise that is executed very well. Get your man to the top of the pile in 60 seconds.But it's the great art style, wicked sense of humour and... well... that slapping of flesh on flesh that makes us laugh every single time.The game runs great for even those like me, who have an old, slow, crappy laptop as their only source of PC gaming and is a bargain coming in at the same cost of a sandwich.I can not wait to bring this out next time friends are round so that we may mount each other all over again.

												I made a dog-pile of eleven near-naked muscular sweaty men.  I do not regret this.Mount Your Friends is a simple competitive climbing game.You have four buttons, one for each limb, and a mouse or joystick to guide what direction you send them in.Multiplayer is turn-based and your aim is to climb to the highest point and finish your turn before the timer runs out, hopefully out-lasting your opponent in this game of 'dash up the man mountain'.Its silly fun and the controls, while challenging for the first two minutes, are very well executed.Its a game that achieves what it sets out to do.  9/10			"

												This game redifines the gaming genre as a whole. It pitches Competition, Teamwork, Betrayal, Sabatoge, Dedication, Inspiration, and of course Mounting all together in this homo-erotic masterpiece. This game defines what can come out of thinking about speedos and men all day. And the  multiple modes are just the cherry on top  for this fast paced, chest clenching gem of a game. If anybody asks me about modern art, I shall point them towards this game10/10 Would Mount again			"
