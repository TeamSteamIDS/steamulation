												5 hours in.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at this time in it's current state.1. The steering is terrible. (Sensitivity is very high without an adjustment in the options).2. Controller support is there, but not ALL there. (50% of the keybindings for the controller you are not even able to bind to the controller) So you can only do a few things and the rest must be done via keyboard.3. The way the garbage is done is just terrible and very slow. (There is no AI help when doing garbage) You drive the truck get out, then you have to push a button to ready the truck to accept the bin, then you have to go get the bin, slowly walk it back to the truck (some of the bins are the double bins that a person could NOT push IRL) hook it to the back of the truck, push the button again to lift the trash into the truck then watch a cut scene then you have to take the bin off, again slowly walk it back to where you got it from (usually 50 ft from the road) then go back to the truck and hit the button again to close the forks and then get in the truck.(So many things done wrong here.) Cut scenes WHY? Just let it do the animation.4. The trucks make this annoying shifting sound every few seconds. I mean WHY! There isn't even a in cab view so why even add the shifting sound. I mean ya, you can have a shifting sound, but holy hell it's so loud and annoying.5. The AI workers you can send out don't actually go out and do the jobs given to them. Your trucks just sit at your parking lot and say ""this truck is being used by a worker"". Very lame. It's 2015 and these people can't even make proper features in a game.6. The AI cars are just plain dumb. They ram you, cut you off, run stop signs and you get the ticket for hitting them.7. You get tickets for hitting cars and pedestrians, but not for running red lights.8. I have done all of the jobs except the gardening. The jobs themselves are very simplistic almost to the point where the game looks like it is targeting an audience of 6 yr olds.9. The economic gameplay is a joke. You can hire workers and fast forward time and just get millions in about 5 minutes.10. The models of the trucks are 7/10 - the world is 4/10 (looks like it's from 2005) - sounds are 3/10 - overall gameplay 4/10If you want to try it go for it. imo it's worth about $7Final Verdict - Don't buy until 50%+ sale.

												I enjoy playing simulation games with friend's so I got this game for me and my friend for the core matter it was multiplayer/co-op. First off all, all the vehicles only let 1 person in them ( So you cant stand on the back of the rubbish truck while your friend drives) which means you may drive but everyone else has to walk. You can only assign 1 challenge per group so you cant send your friend to go cut some grass or pick up some rubbish while your doing other jobs. The sensitivity on the keyboard is very low yet on a controller its very sensitive but unfortunatly the options wont let you change anything like that nor are the keybindings ""all there"". There is still alot of fun to be had in the game but when your truck sinks into invisible quicksand and your half way through the road and have to buy a new truck its just un-cool. The actual graphics of the trucks themselves is great and the buildings could be a bit more in depth graphically with more textures. BUT ! after saying this about the game it does have the possibility to be such a great game me and my friend enjoy it even with all the bugs, we just wish that it could actually be ""multiplayer"" so we can drive in same truck or even in 1st person would be nice. But to only be able to drive ""1"" manned vehicles at a time and do ""1"" mission while your friends waiting although he is there on screen does not make this game feel like a multiplayer nor a co-op. Lets just hope that futures updates will fix all this then I will change my review.			"

												One of the few things I did enjoy was the details of the trucks you play, but otherwise this game feels like an unpolished version of itself. It can see alot of improvements in graphics, modeling, multiplayer section, jobs and last, but not least, physics.On the pro side, I would like to give them thumbs up for the rich details of their trucks.On the con side, I would like to mention - No physics in play whatsoever - No driver seat view - No music - Night time darkness equivalent that of a black hole - Varied, but not very pretty modeling - Multiplayer is buggyAs the game stands to this date, I would not recommend purchasing it. Not even if it is on sale.It could be a very good gift for someone you do not like though.Check out my full review here:

												After giving this game some time for patches and finding an MP game finally today (Mp games are set up as no drop in support right now, but might change) This game dose have potentional to be good. The Dev team seems to be taking care of nagging issues and adding things to the game as they go along. The game itself. Picture the following. Any Garbage Truck simulator (That are terrible and slow) Tow Truck simulator (That is just.. god awful) Street Sweeper simulator (Slow, never worked for me) take all the problems out of them, you got a nice little buisness sim game, The controls are nice and do support controllers and wheels (Added support) No Interior views but the models themselves are greatly put together. There are a few problems to be ironed out (Aggressive AI traffic , A front loaded Recycling truck that needs to be manually loaded by hand instead of inside the cab, Some locations that have traffic just stop dead in the middle of the road and kill framerate. )Mutiplayer is OK in it's current state but needs much improvement when using some trucks. So is it worth the buy? Possibley, maybe when the price just drops a bit.			"

												First of i was pretty Hyped for this game so im going to give my feedback from playing a painfull couple of hours in single player and multi player.Gameplay in general- The controls are utter garbage, the controller support is poor.- AI behind your vehical there engine is far to loud.- Steering a multi ton garbage truck should feel like it not turning like you are driving on ice.- Seems to be an issue with weather effects grey box when raining.- No signal lights.- No fines for driving through red lights.- AI traffic are dumb AF.MultiPlayer.- No AI traffic.- Second players can not accept jobs, have to be the host. from what i've played.- No ingame chat/voice!!!

												OK, here are my thoughts at this point:Let's get the ""stupid review memes"" out of the way:-	11/10 - would push dumpsters again!-	Alternate Title: Cut Scene Watching Simulator 2016!Other reviewers have already pointed out a few of the shortcomings of this game: It seems pretty un-optimized, Bins spawn in unreachable places, the steering radii of the vehicles makes them annoyingly unmaneuverable, the truck sounds are garbage (pun intended), the AI vehicles are unerringly stupid, and Why oh Why does it seem to be raining every 5 minutes?!?! But all of these are fixable in future patches. The developer has already released a major patch within a day or two of release, and seems committed to further updates to please the users. Great news, right!Wrong. I'm afraid no level of updating is ever going to make this the great game you were hoping for. The freedom in this games' design is just too limiting within the confines of its skill tree and XP, and aside from unlocking the ability to move a different type of vehicle, over a different sewer, pothole, bin, car, hedge, or stain in a different part of the generic looking map to earn more XP leaves too little for the imagination beyond a few hours of grinding. Grinding can be fun but the mechanics and limitations in each skill tree are too similar. One issue I had was I was earning 3K and 250 XP per job for ""towing"" a car, then 6:00 AM the next morning it was 2K and 200 XP per job. Just when I thought I had found a way to earn quick cash for that next vehicle the rug was pulled under my feet! Also, hiring workers to do anything for you is useless when they earn 40% of what you would earn and take 4000% longer burning all of your fuel in the process.The tools we are given look promising and realistic, but the handling is wonky and their uses are very much ""on rails"". I have a lifter on the front of my Paper Recycling truck, so that should give me the ability to drive up and lift the bins without doing the ""dumpster drag"" right? Wrong, buddy you are dragging dumpsters again. And why is there a small version of anything? I have to buy it and unlock a bigger version with a bigger tank of whatever to do 20 missions to get a bigger one so I can do it over again? I will say that I enjoyed the mowing and hedge trimming skill tree the most of all, as I felt it provided the best mix of challenge and reward.And last and least, the setting. I'll give the developers an ""E"" for effort, as I can see touches in the map and city design that give it a little bit of flair. But on the whole the city you are doing these tasks in is just too bland and uninspiring to draw you back into doing any more grinding. In other games you can take a look out the window while you are doing whatever and just enjoy the setting in a relaxing way. Here there is just too little for the imagination to work with.While this had the look of something great in this genre ""on the tin"", I'm afraid there is too little on the inside at this point to recommend it. On the positive, I’m totally ready for the “Dumpster Pushing Nationals” next year!			"

												It's time to take out the trash!At first appearance Cityconomy is exactly what you'd expect - an unyieldingly focused simulation where you have to empty large bins into your lorry in real time, and keep doing this over and over. It lets you turn this into a career, able to expand your business (and gain new types of job to do) as you make money.But it mixes in some very unsimulation-like concepts taken directly from RPGs. You  receive job quests from quest-givers, complete with cartoony exclamation marks over their heads. And completing quests levels up your XP and increases your customer satisfaction levels, with which you can unlock skills on your skill tree and new jobs such as street sweeper.This is a blessing and a curse - it adds variety and gamifies a dry subject, but it also sets in stone the game as a grind where you have to really work at unlocking most of the game. From the start of the game you can only play as a bin man - the gardener, plumber, tow truck driver and street sweeper are locked behind walls of experience. You will need to empty 20+ bins (up to 2 hours of playing) before you can unlock your choice of one new job / unlock a new district on the map.Gameplay video for collecting trash:

			Yes, we're on the bins in our high-visibility let's play Cityconomy gameplay video... It's time to take out the trash! Subscribe for more games: http://bit.ly/1HpZqER In CITYCONOMY: Service for your...		

You start your career with access to two vehicles - bin lorry and recycling lorry. Both operate the same. You can buy new vehicles, but you'll need to unlock the relevant job if you want to actually use them to earn money. You can instantly swap between vehicles using tab, which is weird at first but essential for time-saving if your vehicles are spread across the map!Performing the garbage collection means knowing your vehicle - for each collection you drive as close to the bin as possible, open the ""arms"" of the vehicle, drag the bin over to the lorry, press the button to engage the emptying mechanism, take the bin back to where you got it from, close the arms again (if you're not driving far) and then tootle off again. Most quests involve emptying 4 bins in an area. It's fairly repetitive, but working out how to be super-efficient is oddly satisfying.Other types of job each have their own things to learn, and you'll have to learn a bunch of new keys to press (press O to show recommended keys, otherwise it won't tell you!). The street sweeper, for instance, requires you to fill your tank with water, extend brushes, engage brushes, and run over the instructed patch of oil on the street.All vehicles need maintenance (because you keep driving into a lamppost), emptying of trash etc and regular pitstops for fuel. Sometimes this is a bit mean - your bin lorry only has enough room for 10 bins of rubbish, so realistically you need to do this every 2 ""quests"".The open world, if not the best looking city, works well enough - you can do whatever you want in the course of the day, even to the extent of skipping hours at a time if you, say, fancied working at night. It's best at sunrise/sunset, when the light catches the buildings in a surprisingly fetching way.But the city's a bit plain and you cannot interact with it beyond doing your job - other vehicles and street furniture are unmovable objects that will stop you dead if you crash into them. There is a limited amount of traffic (which can be altered for performance), and very few pedestrians.So Cityconomy is a strange mix of simulation and RPG. There's little scope for playing for laughs (although you could probably get some off-piste fun out of the multiplayer), but if you're going to drop the best part of £20 on a game about collecting bins, you're not going to be taking this lightly!More Randomise User indie game videos "

												its a bit sad that this game has only mixed reviews, because its a really nice game, its so fresh from all the killing and blowing stuff up, especially if you enjoy things like simulators and managment games, it really is a great game. and $20 isnt a bad asking price, not when you have AAA games asking for an arm and a leg by giving you an unfinnished product and then trying to sell the rest to you bit by bit through DLC and bloody season pass'. what you have here is a developer that actually cares and listens, and has twice responded promptly to my issues, thoughts and suggestions. and not only responded but taken my suggestions and others suggestions and actually gave them serious consideration. so a big yes from me for a good game and a fantastic developer who i want to see do sucsesfully.

												Cityconomy is part manager, part simulation. If you like grinding away countless hours to keep your city running efficiently then this game is for you....and your friends if you like multiplayer mode. I enjoyed playing the game very much.PROS: Nice day/night time cycle & lighting. Highly detailed vehicles. Good use of warping/jumping from one vehicle to the next. UI and & management screens are easy to use. Guaranteed over 25+ hours of gaming to unlock all acheivements.CONS: No cockpit view. Wonky unrealistic turning. Lack of turn signals. Cinematics get repetitive. Garbage containers might get stuck in buildings.Part 1

												You would think that a game that builds on Construction Simulator 2015's engine would have been able to get over most of the hurdles and not make the same pitfalls again.Well this game makes all the same pitfalls and ignores all of the lessons they got from Construction Simulator 2015.For an example in this game the tasks become monotonous very quickly compared to CS 2015, and that isn't good if you need to repeat the same task with little variation or chance of creativity 20 times to unlock something.Also the it feels very little like a simulator, most of the actions that in CS allowed you to manipulate each of the machine's components, are now reduced to a single push of a button.The vehicle dynamics also feel very off in this game, the steering is so sluggish that backing up can be a hassle.The list of this game's problems goes on, in multiplayer the list is long, especially with desync issues.A classic is if you are riding along with someone in their vehicle, your map won't update as you travel along.This means that the minimap that guides you to your job doesn't do anything until you get out of the vehicle.There are also desync issues related to ""tickets"" for an example a light may be green for the host, but red for the client, and thus the client is ticketed.And because of this, the cash between the client and host aren't exactly in sync either and gets unpredictable very quickly.The ugliest problem of them all is the graphics, they are supposed to be DX11, but something about the shading and colors used, makes the graphics feel WORSE than CS 2015's DX9 graphics!Also the use of DX11 makes this game a no no through Wine for Linux users, where CS 2015 actually works.The good about this game is the improvement to the economy aspect of the game, something that was missed in CS 2015, the fuel parts could have made CS 2015 even better.However, in this game it is more of a hassle than an improvement and is lost in the troubling UI.And the final nail in the coffin for this game is that once you have started a game, you are LOCKED OUT of the options menu!If you need a control reference, you can pretty much forget about that or need to tweak a setting for your controls.All in all, you are better off buying CS 2015 for Coop simulator fun than this game, this game needs a couple of extra months of hard development to be a viable game, at the moment it is junk at best, and may be worth it on a 90% off sale.

												Ok; forst of all I want to thank everyone who helped me get this game up and running, a particular thanks to mayamak who was first on the scene to help, thank you very much :) Now that I have been able to play the game for a while; there are pros and cons to it, just like there are in most games. For anyone who is having issues getting this to run, the tips I got from mayamak and others were fantastic! mayamak 4 Dec @ 11:51am  what is your system settings?* If you are useing laptop try to force Nvidia Card to run a game. Here is a description how to do it > http://steamcommunity.com/app/304580/discussions/0/485624149150490370/*update your Graphic Card drivers* Options menu setup on low system configuration: - go to Video tab change Antialiasing and max. Anisotropy parameters to lower values. - you can also chenge resolution form Default to some any other that will increase your performance. - go to Performance tab nad set LOW presets and turn OFF all parameters.My laptop has a Radeon 5000 card in it so I downloaded and installed the AMD Catalyst Control Centre; and it worked!!!!!!PROSUnique idea: Not many have thought of the notion of a 'Utility Simulator' although I believe that there was one of these released before, but it was ham strung by limited missions!A good open world: Rather than being confined to a small area with little else to do after you have completed all tasks, the fact that this game has a huge map should help with playability!Good selection of vehicles: The vehicle selection in this is great with a good eye for detail!CONSThe game still tends to run slow at times; hopefully the devs will work on thisAI traffic is a nightmare, as another player pointed out; they crash into you and then you get fined, again the devs should look at this!!Most of the sounds are fine, however the sound of the drain cleaners should be changed, as it sounds nothing like a drain cleaner!!Overall though a decent shot at a game, there are a few things that would be grat to see in it, first of all the interaction between the player character and the vehicles should change, the only vehicles to have any interaction with them are the garbage trucks. The street repair with the tar lorry or 'hotbox' as it is really known could probably do with the player having to remove the old surface with a pneumatic hammer and then use the hotbox to fix the surface. It would be great if there was a weather change, were it snowed and gritting lorries with snow plows could be used. A wider range of waste products such as construction waste, industrial waste, hazardous waste and on street domestic refuse would beef up the realism of the game; with these different categories, different vehicles could also be used such as skip lorries and big hook lift lorries with big skips for construction waste and closed boxes for hazardous waste, but then again that is just me and my imagination ;) So my new review would be 7/10, well done devs!!!First ReviewIt would be nice if the devs could turn the system requirements down so as more could play this game, I got the game as I figured that my gaming laptop could handle it, it wouldn't even launch as apparently my GPU does not meet the minimum requirements!!!! :( I have other games here which are just as graphically demanding, but run fine such as Farming Simulator 2015, which I consider to be one of the most polished and well presented games on Steam!! Dig It - A digger simulator, again when I got this I was suspicious that it might not even run, I was surprised when it did without lag or drag. I do have others as well which have fantastic graphics and don't cause problems! So until the devs come up with a solution to this problem it is a 0/10 from me, as it really is a gamble as to whether or not this will run on your machine!!! :( :( :(			"

												I recommend this game ONLY for the simulation games collectors to add it in their game library. Other then that this game has one of the most boring gameplay. It is good for wasting a few min before going to sleep because it will definitelly make you sleepy. As for the game Itself, there are so many wrong things in it that the right ones are barelly noticeable. Weather, roads texture and design, car traffic, lack of diversity creates immense repetitiveness, no incentive to follow the traffic rules , even more, the game pretty much forces you to break them setting tragets on both sides of a 4 lane boulevard etc. "

												This game tests your abilities on how to run a city. Mostly in this game, you drive waste trucks around, collecting the towns rubbish. Unfortunately, for all of the vehicles in this game, there is no in-cab or cockpit view of inside the cabin. That is a huge let-down for me. If it had an in-cab view, I would recommend this game, but sadly because of that, I recommend the game as 'No'. Improvements must be made, CityConomy. 2.5 - 5 stars from me.			"

												Cityconomy is a city management simulation which I've been looking forward to for a couple of months. I am pretty pleased with it and do think there is quite a nice variety of city services on offer. So far I have only tried Garbage man and Tow truck specializations and am enjoying it so far. A few points I'm dissapointed about it the lack of a interior view and a ridiculously slow walking speed when moving bins.UPDATE #1: Nano games have released a patch introducing Turn signals, faster movement of bins and more. Impressed with their observations of reviews.			"

												For a game that is just released i am very pleased with it. Sure it needs a few tweaks on the controller side. Sensitivity has been changed for the controller. So now the game is perfect!ive played it 4 hours and i have 6 different trucks for my employees and my self to work with.Im loving this game!!			"

												There are some okay things like the fact that you actually get to do the work ie pushing the garbage can to the truck, dump it and then return it to the spot.Now for the reasons why not recommending this game:1. All the garbage/recycling trucks work the same.. Even the one that has the overhead arms and dumps in the top..2. The AI get so close to your truck constantly you either have to keep moving up and hope they give you enough room to fit the dumpster in or drive/park on the sidewalk3. it seems like every 5 minutes it is raiining yet again, and again, and again.4. no variations for garbage truck, yet you have 3 different trucks for recycling stuff.  5. Driving physics are poor. Can't drive somewhat decent and AI cars drive like they are driving a nascar race.6. AI hit you even when stopped and brake on and you get fined "

												I would not recommend getting this unless you have a gaming computer with a graphics card. I have a I3 Quad core processor and HD 5500 card. Please check your video card before purchasing. When I load the game the main menu comes up but when I load the profile I get a error message and then a big white screen with a letter X in red on the screen. Buyer beware.			"

												So far the game is really fun and the graphics are nice. The building are a little blah but the character model and trucks are very nice. I am running a gtx 980 and I did notice a few optimization issues that hopefully will be worked out. Dont think the game is worth the price of admission but I havent spent much time with it yet so thats not set in stone. If I change my mind about that statement I will update			"
