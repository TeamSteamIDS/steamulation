Summary:Broadsword: Age of Chivalry is a turn-based medieval strategy game ported from Android (where it's free with in-app purchases). It offers two single player campaign, skirmish games and hot seat (local) multiplayer.Gameplay is really simple, you get few units, a hero, a city and few research and upgrades, one whole tutorial campaign is enough for you to get into the game. But do you want it? I think you won't, Broadsword simply doesn't offer much entertainment for price of 20 euros, you can get way better turn-based strategies on Steam for this cost.Visuals wouldn't look bad on smartphones or tablets but on the PC it looks as a joke for a 2015 game with higher price tag. Option to see all battles in style of Advance Wars is nice but you'll look one or twice and then you'll rather skip those scenes - it takes so long and it even doesn't look appealing, you can actually laugh (or facepalm) at those poor fighter models swinging swords.Also, the whole interface is terribly designed as you have to do unnecessarily clicks for every single action - but this is the outcome from Android porting without many changes. Pros:- Units are voiced in good old style. With every movement or attack, they say their phrase. How nostalgic. - Hot seat local multiplayer.Cons:- Only two campaigns. Don't expect to get much playtime from this if you expect single-player experience. Get a better turn-based strategy game instead.- Mediocre graphics. Developers tried to make fight scenes in Advance Wars style but it doesn't look good in result.- Terribly designed interface.- On Steam page you can see mentioned ""Multi-player"" but there's only hot seat. Don't get misled.- High price. Broadsword: Age of Chivalry is simply not worth 20 euros.			"

Broadsword: Age of Chivalry Review - Rating: 6.8/10General ImpressionBroadsword: Age of Chivalry is a perfect combination of the action, simulation and indie genres. The graphics are pretty good, they are 2D while moving through the map, but they are 3D while you watch fight scenes between the factions. The atmosphere is about many areas on Europe, where you must capture towns, especially the fortification of each town. You must move your units, to take resources for your army, as well as combating your enemies, and the main objective: capturing the fortification. The audio is nice, I like the sound of the swords, screaming, moving, etc. The original music is from German film, with the composer being Jan Morgenstern. The gameplay is basically moving the units, which will construct buildings such as lumber yards, farms and gold stations. Lumber yards are necessary for the training of your new units, the farm is for the food of your units, the more farms you have, the more units you can have and the gold station are very important in order to train new units. Also, you must combat the enemies, as well as taking over the fortifications. The story is about the factions who fight in the medium era, fighting in Europe. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. The engines and the mechanics are alright, the units are well-designed when fighting/dying during the fight scenes, as well as the 2D are also well-designed, moving on the hexagons. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty solid, I haven’t any glitches around them. However, they are a little repetitive. Overall, it’s a pretty decent fighting scenes simulator and a turn-based strategy game.Positive PointsPretty nice 2D and 3D graphicsPretty nice soundtrack and SFXChallenging gameplaySeveral factions in the gameMany types of enemiesThe ability to construct buildingsThe ability to choose your own unitsTurn-based game and decent requirement of strategyLong missions and campaignsNeutral PointsA multiplayer feature would greatly improve the gameIt misses Steam trading cards and achievementsNegative PointsThe price tag is too high, this game is nowhere close to 25$The interface is too simpleThe “multiplayer” is just a local CO-OP option "

												This game is dumb-down version of Civilization the game with hexes and heroes that must stay alive or it's game over.  It has a simple turn-based game design with plenty of options, speeches and noce graphics to go along with it.  In the campaign, ther are two available factions you can choose to play as the French or the English with 5 missions each.  The gameplay and fighting mechanics are rather simple.  You can spawn units and create building and upgrade them.  My complains are the map and the AI is this game.  For the maps, they are pretty much the same are quite small for my liking and for the AI, they are not too intelligent.  As a final warning, there is no game save functionality in this game.  If your Hero dies you have to start the whole campaign from the beginning which is infuriating.  You can only save after completing the mission. The game is intriguing and I'm quite enjoying it.			"

												Tags : TBS            Tactics - SquadOkay I have seen all the content this has to offer :First campaign heavily reuses the same map - simply shifting the ennemy town from one place of the map to the other. Very tedious and not much of a challengeSecond Campaign is just managing your starting units and killing the ennemy starting units. Music doesnt cycle and instead repeats the same track over and over unless you quit game and rejoin. Game is uninsipired and very lackluster. It is, indeed, a very dumbed down civ game and also sometimes a squad management tactical game, also very dumbed down.I spent 6 hours on this and I am fairly certain I have not paid much for this, so one could consider I got my money's worth. But quite frankly this was a huge chore to get through, not much enjoyment at all.So to summarize this is simply not worth anyone's time on the PC. Maybe on the tablet when your options are limited. But even then...			"

												Short review after played a skirmish game.- Multiplayer is hotseat only.- Turn-based with battle cutscenes.- Clunky & Buggy. (You can even end turn for enemy AI)- Simple research developments, lord skills and upgrades available.- 4 factions in total. France, England, Spain and Germany. (Each faction has its own unique units.)- Skirmish. (Annihilate all enemy goal means exactly what it is. You've to destroy all the saw mills, farms, mines and etc.)I like gameplay though. It just need more contents and polishing.(*Archer shoots the mine* *facepalm* And those peasants clothing..)==================================================Suggesting add 'Comedy' tag. This game is totally a joke, even its price.			"

												---The good----The units in this game are voiced in an old accent style- Theres a battle scene every time you or the enemy attacks (can be disabled through settings)- Reminds me of older, but good, games- Battle scenes make me laugh sometimes (in a good way)- Has local multiplayer (hot seat)- Campaign is pretty ok (for me atleast)---The bad---- Battle scene animation is a little bad (for a 2015 game)- Only has 2 campaigns- The interface is also pretty bad (you pretty much click for every action)- Dont belive the multiplayer tag (its more of a locol co-op)- Price tag on this game shouldnt really be $20 (so get it as a giveaway, gift, or on sale)			"

												This game ... just no - you can get my reasons why you áin't supposed buy the game but it won't change the fact it sucks so move on or read below.20 dollars for a game with trash tutorial, doesn't explain the game mechanics that well.Horrible control, apparently you've to double click a unit for then selecting attack and then press enemy unit... wasn't enougth double clicking and then pressing enemy unit, nooooo it had to be a dumb system and not a actual smart one which actually benefits and makes the game easyer.Boring mission, barely any buildings and units .. not even fun.Very slow phased and mostly wwaste of time, the game have a idea it needs show the animation for when nigth and day swiftes (which is every ******* turn. so when you realize you've 2 hoursh in the game then i believe a good 30min is animation which sucks, the devs dind't make this game simple - you example can't build everywhere you've special location to build in order to place a farm, because we all know building a farm requires special dirt, with exactly a certain amount of water - makes the game a time sink once again, Bcz then your workers gets sent on missions out in the wild exploring the world .... which takes a long time since they've legs like a snail, they're so slow for a unit without armor where my swordmen they're basically wearing several tons of armor makes faster.

YouTube™ Video: Broadsword Age of Chivalry Steam Preview 

			Views: 1,934		

			Set in the middle ages, Broadsword: Age of Chivalry is a turn-based strategy game where the goal is to become the dominant force in Europe.		

The game was developed by Hoplite Research LLC and Published by KISS LTD and Funbox Media. The game will be released on the 15th May 2015. I do not have a great knowledge of mobile games but heard that this was a free-to-play android game with lots of micro transactions. This version do not have any though. I was provided a review copy by KISS and would like to thank them for that.The main setting of the game is from the hundred years war between the English and French, where you get to play campaign mode from either one of the two sides. The path for both sides in the campaign is linear and you don't get much choice but to just click on the next mission. I would also like to chirp in that there is also local multiplayer where you can go against one other person- Which I could not test as I am billy no mates :)I found the game very basic and the graphics to be pretty old. The combat is pretty funny but repetitive as the rest of the game. It was pretty cool to have a system where you can upgrade your home base in the midst of battle and research new techniques using Skill Points. You can also train new troops from these home bases. My main concern though is that there was nothing really making me feel compelled to play the game. Everything was just so basic from the fight system to the graphics. The character movements were very easy to pick up though after a few moments of trying to understand. You have to click on the character you want to control, then click on where you want them to move and then a box will pop up asking you if you would like for the unit to attack, merge or undo the move.I'm just happy that the game functions well and nothing is broken or buggy. For me it's one of those games which I can only play 10 minutes or so a day before I have to stop. You don't need a mind blowing PC to play this game as the specifications are really low. This game would really cater to the people with more low end PC's.If you enjoy games like Civilization and other turn based games then I would recommend this to any hardcore fan of the genre. However, if you're not familiar or only lightly into the genre then you may find the slowness of the game off putting. The price is slightly steep too.Thanks for reading :)			"

												Um , I dont count hotseat as multiplayer.  Cant even play a game against anyone, so why bother. this game suks I want my money back.  This was false advertising saying it was multiplayer.
