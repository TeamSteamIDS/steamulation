												AS OF 0700 6/22/2016 I HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM THE STEAM STAR CONFLICT FORUMS FOR POSTING AND REFUSING TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW.The Developers are censoring the Steam Forums and the Star Conflict Forums.This will be a long read so if you don't want the details then here's a TL;DR: The Dev's censor the forums, inflate their player numbers, lie and there are game breaking bugs that cause you to lose items purchased with real money. If you speak out publicly, they ban you.Below are my experiences.I'm a space game fanatic. As of writing this I have 19,205 hours in EVE Online. That's right. nineteen THOUSAND. I've played since 2003. Across the multiple accounts that I made to play Star Conflict (I was banned for posting about the vanishing item bug. (It was a positive post asking for help) I've racked up about 4000 hours. Probably just under 4000.At first the game was great! The prices for premium ship packs were crazy, but you don't need premium ships to enjoy the game. I enjoyed the game greatly.Then came destroyers. Destroyers completely broke the balance of power in the game.Eventually, they lost enough of their playerbase that they recognized that action was needed. They made it ""easier"" to obtain a destroyer. They made the rarest and most time consuming of destroyer parts drop in PVE/PVE matches. (It used to be open world only) However, they also increased the number of the materials that you needed exponentially. At this time several players started running numbers on both the information that the devs gave us and the drop rates of the items. Several people including myself ran these numbers. Out of 100 games, I got 5 of the ""Ore"". It takes 10 to create 1 ""Plate"". You need 16 plates to build one ""Structure""  and you need 2 ""Structures"" to build a destroyer(Minus the multitude of other parts required.) So, let's look at the math:10 X 16 X 2 = 320 ""Ore""If each game is about 15 minutes long (This is the average) and 100 games were played to get this data (I was premium so I even had a higher drop rate than a free to play player) then That means15 Minutes X 100 Games = 1500 Minutes ÷ 60 (60 minutes in an hour) = 25 HoursThis means that to obtain less than half of a ""Plate"" you have to play for 25 hours (WITH PREMIUM)So, let's finish our little bit of math here.25 X 2 = 50 Hours for 1 ""Plates""50 X 16 = 800 Hours for 16 ""Plates""800 ÷ 24 = 33.3 (Repeating) Days33.3 X 2 = 66.6 DaysThat's means that in order to get 2 Structures you have to play every second of every day (WITH PREMIUM) for two months in order to complete 1 of 6 parts that you need to build a destroyer. This is FAR different than the '50 a day"" drop rates one of the developers stated.Oh no, it gets better!When these numbers were posted, anyone who posted them was either banned or had their post removed. My posts were removed and I received a 7 day ban from the game. After 3 months I broke down and spent 200.00 USD ontop of the money I was already forking over for PREMIUM to buy their ""lockboxes"".Finally having enough materials, I began to build my Destroyer. Only to have the game kick me to the title screen when pressing the ""Build destroyer"" button. Logging back in, I went to repeat the process only to find my materials were gone. Going to my ship tree to look at my shiny new destroyer only increased my dismay as there was no destroyer. That's right. It took my materials that I had purchased with real money and had slowly grinded over 3 months and gave me no destroyer.>So, I filed a ticket. The ticket went unanswered for 2 weeks.>So, I posted on the Steam forums. The dev team deleted my post.>So, I posted on the Star Conflict forums.The dev team deleted my post and banned me.>So, I posted on the Russian forums (The dev team is Russian)The dev team deleted my post and banned me.So, I logged in just to make sure I didn't miss something or my destroyer wasn't sent to me in the in game mail.Nothing. After trying multiple methods to have my issue resolved, only to be silenced so no one would find out about the bug, I charged back my money and was thus, banned. After all, why would I allow them to keep my money when they failed to deliver the product?AS OF 7/1/2016 TARGEM GAMES HAS BEGUN TO USE ALT ACCOUNTS TO SPAM AND DOWNVOTE THIS REVIEW. http://puu.sh/pMy1L/a84ce9fe11.jpg "

												As of 8/13/2015 There have been lots of changes since the last review of this Game from me (Found at bottom), and much of what I had pointed out as an issue has been fixed, but much of it has not.I should note that this negative review is now based on a ""Personal"" opinon about Pay 2 win Games, if your fine with the above then yes, you should get this game, you'll have a lot of fun with it. For speecifics on why this review is still negative, Read on.Pro's -- Tons of content. There is a lot of options on how to play and lots to do includeing an Open mode.- A lot more ships have been added, and many of the moduels changes and updated.- Lots of people play this.- Has Guild Support- Has Crafting- Special ships and abilities etc, for Guilds. (If they build/Earn it)Cons:- Still Very much Pay2Win - (GS = Galactic Standards, the Pay For Currency in Star Conflict)While the liscense issue spoken about in the old review has been fixed, Synergy still remains an issue as well as the P2Fly Ships which start at max level, and can be purchased for any tier.* Synergy, Synergy in game is what your ship acquires as it fights, it is ship specific, and it is used to upgrade your ship. The Pay to play Ships which start at max level have an ability called ""Synergy Transfer"" which allows you to convert their unused synergy, into ""Free"" synergy, which can be applied to any ship.... At a cost. To transfer Synergy to free synergy you will need to pay 1 Galactic Standard (Pay For Currency), for every 300 Synergy...Sounds like a deal yea? It isn't. In the higher tiers you can use as much as 500k to 1 million Synergy in order to level your ship. This equates to about 15,000 - 30,000 GS, which is over 100$ USD. For a single ship level.* Now Granted. You don't have to use free synergy at all, you can simply grab a non p2p ship and level it manually. It is a very very long grind however, as to make and influence the obvious choice to simply ""Buy"" a better ship thats already leveled a much more convieient and optimal choice. And hey they are pretty cheap.* P2Use Modules, are common and they have some for every single catagory of module for your ship, they last 1 Battle, and generally cost anywhere from 20GS to 500GS for a single Use/Battle. They Give a 100% Synergy Bonus to your ship as well as being a Level 3 Module.* Boosts can increase anything from your damage, to your speed, to your looting chance, you can fit 2 on your ship at a time and they are also limited per battles, they usually last from 3-5 battles depending and costs around 300-500GS.* Liscense - Boosts all your non combat stats, such as Credit income per battle and gives other bonuses, this is basically SC's Subscription model, and there are several avaialble to choose from.----- Without useing any of the above, you can now progress in game, although it's very very slow. As would be expected, and since the game relies so heavily on people paying for gear, ships, and boosts which directly affect their preformance in battle, unless your willing to fork out the cash for ""Consist gear and ships"" Every single battle. It will be a long, slow arduous road for you.- Long Ques:* I played 25 battles, and managed to gain enough credits (Non paid currency) to upgrade a couple of my items a few times to Blue quality. Those battles took me around 5-6 hours to actually get into, ques seem to be very long depending on your tier of ship.I had to wait 10-15 minuets per match, even though the launcher says the max wait time is 4 minuets with an average of 1 minuet. So apparently this is broken.From what I was told in game any Tier above 3 is basically empty with very little players. But below and Tier 3 there are plenty of people to play with. I find this a bit sad considering the game has 15+ Levels of ships and over 7 Tiers.- Loot chance.The Game is heavily Geared to make you ""Purchase"" stuff with real money. Loot chances are exceedingly low. You will rarely get anything of value, but no fear the store in the crafting area in game will sell you anything you want, as long as your willing to fork over that cash for Galactic Standards.- Very GrindyExceedingly repetitive and grindy. - Controlls are very clunky in the larger ships. They want you to have a forward faceing view, but this makes it nigh impossible to target anything thats out of your 40 degree view range, and the larger ships are very slow to turn. (Obviously they are huge). There used to be a defense module you could equip on frigates that made this hendrance less of an issue, as it acted as a 360 degree defense module. I beleive they have removed it as I was unable to find it. Now it is so easy for you to die from something smaller then you as to be.. pointless to fly one of the frigates.Conclusion:As you can see the reoccuring theme seems to be - Gimme your money. And while the game has improved significantly (Vastly in fact, I am very Impressed). Based on this Money Grubbing Mentality the owners seem to have, I ""still"" can not in good concious reccomend this game. -----------------Old Review -I would love to recomend this game, I honestly would. I played it for a very long time, Baught many of the packs, and contributed as a community member... And loved every moment of it....The Game keep's growing, Keeps expanding, and keeps getting better and better content wise, as a game.However,As of late, in the last 6 months, the game seems to be degrading based on my below observations:1. F2p, P2p. Or Sub Based?* It is now 100% Pay to win (Actually it's sub based desguised as an F2P, you can download the game for free, even play for free ""Technically"", but if you actually want to progress your character you must purchases a Sub, or Licence). If you are not willing to spend money, do not install this game, I am one of the payers telling you this.I saw people complaining about this, so I let my licences and some other things run out, just to see what the deal was and if the complaints were valid, Sadly.... They were. You can not progress at all without one.2.  Power Tripping, Unprofessional, Abusive Admins and GM's.I am not going to sit here and insult the Admin Staff as a whole like some, as there are some who are generally good people who try to do the job properly.However,A great majority of the  ""Visable"", Admins, community managers, and GM's etc, are sadly infact exactly the above. They will make comments, level threats, make up rules, or interpret rules to their advantage so they can punish you, just to show you they can.Not because you actually did something ""wrong"" or violated a rule, but because you ""upset them personally"" with something you may have said or an opinion you have expressed.The main issue I suppose is that if the Admins etc, were to actually follow the rules and enforce them, they would be forced to permanently ban themselves for violating them.... Repeatedly.3. Some of the changes to the ships, have rendered them almost useless, when compared to other ships of the same class. Some small tweaks would fix this issue, and Balance between the races is now definitely an issue due to ship specializations, and specifically their assigned special weapons/abilities.An easy fix to this would be to allow the player to change these like any other module, to whatever they want.So with that, I can not conciously recomend this, what could be, a fantastic game. Update: I stopped playing this over 6 months ago, of course if the above changes, and the Dev's crack down and get professional admins, rather then immature ones, as well as fix some of the other issues, I will happily change this review, and recomend it in the future, and start playing again.Try this game if you like however, it's free after all.~Mal			"

												Grindfest to the max. Pretty much just doing the same thing over and over, day in and day out, feeling like you're actually achieveing something. This game used to be a lot of fun. Maybe because the lower tier ships weren't so maddeningly far out of reach. I used to feel like I didn't have to spend money to enjoy this game. Then I bought a 3 month license just to start progressing. After all the effort I put into the game and not progressing very much, I had to take a long break from it. Came back after roughly 3 months and it's still pretty much the same game. Ridiculously long wait times to actually play, even more attempts to convince you to spend real money on the game. The devs are moving it in a new direction, which is nice, but this is one of those games where I wish it wasn't just a perpetual beta. Just like FireFall, it seems the devs are focusing on the wrong areas and are adding new content without addressing existing issues. Feels like a huge letdown. Granted, it is free to play, but I was hoping for something more.If you've played World of Tanks, you've already played Star Conflict. Sadly, I had let them both go. Seems too many games fade out because it's all a money grab... It might be for you, but after more than a year, I've come to realize this is not for me. Take my input with a grain of salt. You never know what you'll like unless you play it.			"

												I started playing this game when it was in a very early stage. You might even say it was a beta stage. The game was great, 2 PvE levels, a good ship tiering system, balanced gameplay for paying and non-paying players... ... But all that changed when 'the update' came (around last year or so). Ships that had certain powers suddenly had different (underpowered) powers, other ships that had certain 'roles' suddenly became other roles and you had to dismantle your entire ship and buy new items for it. PvE became less rewarding and paying players became extremely overpowered, almost forcing you to buy stuff/experience yourself.And when a F2P game is forcing me to buy stuff, that is where I draw the line and stop playing. You should not even start this up, it will only end in frustration.			"

												Star Conflict is a good looking arcadish space sim with pretty fun gameplay and enjoyable flight physics. The ship models looks great with some really well designed maps and sky boxes.Unfortunately, just like vast majority of free to play titles, this is an incredibly grindy game as you progress up the tiers while it feels more and more pay to win too. I think it is also a bait and switch as the first couple of tiers are pretty fair and enjoyable but as you move up the tiers of your ship, the grind and pay to win gets exponentially worse.Avoid it at all cost. I do not recommend this grind fest. A game should be an enjoyable experience, not a grindy mechanism that feels like a second job.			"

												Used to play this game a lot. Absolutely loved it and now? What happened? It legit turned into crap. Admins are very biased if you aren't russian and the new update and tier changes just ruined the game. Don't even bother after T3. You'll get clobbered. PvE was a lot of fun with my engineer ship and for PvP when protecting the VIP player. It's all down the drain now. Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shame			"

												Abusive Admins. WARNING!!!!!I want to give a positive review, I really do, but it feels dishonest to do so.This game is plagued by its own development team. Unless you are a member of the Russian Master Race your problems and concerns are of no interest to them. The Devs do not want to support a non-Russian community, provide materials for the non-Russian Wiki, collect feedback from non-Russian players or even give complete patch notes to the non-Russian player base. They don't want to fix glaring issues with the game, they don't want to know about what you find fun, and they sure as hell don't want to provide a quality experience - that might get in the way of monetising you!The core mechanics of the game are good, but used to be better. Much of the game's content is burdened by insane amounts of grind to coax money out of you, and other elements of the game are sealed behind paywalls to ensure proper Pay to Win behaviour is enforced.Play it by all means - you can have fun providing you don't go beyond Tier 3 - but don't invest any money in it.

												*Updated for 1.2*Pros- Game combat can be enjoyable, not always though, in fact mostly not enjoyable unless you're fully decked out with equipment. Open space mode is most fun for gameplay though.- Open space mode can have really nice battles between corporations, but not often enough. Though it can be enjoyable alone, just roaming around exploring the limited amount of sectors. Just be aware of aliens, they are OP.- Graphics and effects are nice, could use a optional graphic pack for 4k texture or something higher.- You can join games already running, so playing isn't an issue much anymore, though it can really change how matches turn out.- A lot of really well designed ships, really enjoyable just to look at the ships and their detail.Cons- A lot of ping issues, which is the reason for your ship wobbling on its own. The admins just tell you to read over a connection issue forum post, but new players shouldn't have to do that, and instead the servers should be good enough, and setup well enough. Like good hosts that have the best location for the players on the game with good networking.- The game is really really grindy, not as bad as some other games, but could be more focused on having fun. - Once you reach Tier 3 pvp, it becomes really difficult for new pilots to adapt, and have any chance. Usually the reason why people quit the game. They enjoy it until T3, which is when they meet fully equipped, mk4 premiums that are almost impossible for new pilots to do anything.- Not enough population on the game, all bad factors contribute to this, and its only getting worse.- A few ships feel like they are pay-to-win, not saying they are, but having bonuses they are seen as p2w, such as the Spark, a lot of veterans use it because of the advantages over the Lightbringer. Mauler has advantages over Inquisitor AE. Dessert Eagle and Nukem I are a clear advantage over any of gunships in T3.- Isn't really enjoyable playing alone, in order to enjoy the game fully, being in a team is needed, which is hard to play as a team.- People have the image that are non-US corps cheat, which would probably be something to do with ping. Most of the Russian corps in game always seem to kill you faster then what anyone else would be able to do, again, probably because of ping.- Teamwork isn't encouraged by the game, being in a squad will take forever to get a match. Which is ridiculous, but thats the game for you. Even with the new queue system where you can join matches at any time, it still takes forever to get a match.- Developers released dreadnoughts, and basically said ""Hey, here are 3 dreadnoughts, you can't change them after you chose one, and here is no information about each of them. Chose wisely."" They don't give us information we need to make good choices in game.- There is a story about a corp, I will not speak of the corp or the user who got banned, but the user had an argument with a moderator, not a terrible argument, and this was on the forums. The user got banned from both the forums and in game for around 45 years. The corp he was a part of were going to speak up against the issue, but decided to quit instead, a medium/large size corp mostly quit together because of a moderators action. The corp leader even put tons of money into the game to help it.I do not recommend as there is to many problems with a game that has so much potential.If people think the game is so good, then people shouldn't be leaving. Being blind to the reasons the game is bad will waste your time and money.Some players are even trying to get others to downvote reviews on steam, but people should not hide the truth of what is wrong with the game. Servers are definately the worst part, fixing that issue alone could potentially make the game 500% more enjoyable, oh, and actually get a population. No one wants to play with their ship rotating on its own, and having a 5 second delay on their weapons.Suggestions for the game:1. Lower the price of the DLC, it would really increase sales. Lower price, higher volume sold. This would allow the game to buy better servers, like from Amazon. The price of some DLC are more expensive then practically all brand new games, its ridiculous. Grand theft auto? $60.00. 1 star conflict DLC? $87.00. What do you get from the DLC? Not enough for sure.			"

												Update 02.03.2016:TL;DR at the bottomLooks more fancy than the last time, the shiptree and missions pages especially. The new ships - the Destroyers - look very good (much like the rest of the ships) but are, like everything else in this game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly expensive. The grind has not lessened one bit (and is still real - 109k synergy for a rank8 ship from synergy 8 to 9 at 1 to 2k synergy per battle (only if you win)) and the balance is still terrible (though it's not far from patch 3.3 Smite - not sure whether that's an insult to either game or not). PvE is still godawefully boring but at least I managed to destroy that alien commander now which I failed miserably at the last time. Guess they nerfed them.Update 01.10.2015:Played it for about a week again to give it a fair chance at not being bad - I really like space games - but alas to no avail. Let's see- Matchmaking is a lot quicker now than it was before but no more balanced which means it can be attributed mainly to rising player numbers- PvP balancing... yeah no don't get me started on that- PvE balan... PvE is godawefully boring - admittedly that's the general problem of PvE everywhere in every game but this here takes it a step further- Ships are still the way they are after the evil wizard (see below) but somehow they managed to make it half decent with the weapon locks to classes and so on. Still bad though as you have to grind redundant ships to get the ones you really want - e.g. Jericho Guard-Frigattes are jsut way more sensible than Federation as former have way more base shielding to use their special with. Oh yeah and they are still absurdly expensive.Once upon a time - this was a fun game where you could do space dogfighting as though there was air. The factions were pretty starkly contrasted in their attributes and special abilities on ships making for some interessting choices. It had an OK progression for a FTP game - the premium content was actually more powerful than what could be gained from grinding but it wasn't gamebreaking.Then came the evil wiz-----a patch.Aaaand suddenly it doesn't suffice to grind enough ""standing"" - now you have to grind synergy to unlock new ships that might or might not have a similar ability to the one you currently grind. Abilities got spread around more and some ships received things that are completely pointless on that hull and should've stayed where they once were. Then they switched around the weaponsystems, removing the cool ones and limiting the selection for ships even more than it was before (where at least you could find cool weaponsystems for all classes of hulls). Once you actually grinded enough synergy you hopefully have an astronomic amount of currency to actually buy that new ship as well. Did I mention volunteer secondary missions that lock the ships you select for them out for up to AN ENTIRE WEEK? Yeah - very fun gameplay element that. The premium content is basically mandatory if you ever want to get anywhere.Now it's a shipwreck (literally) of what it could've been, heck of what it WAS.Updated 02.03.2016 TL;DR*:DON'TPLAY*still			"

												Well i played this game when it was at an early stage, even bought a pack, then suddenly after the patch where some ( alot ) of ships where remade and most turned obsolete and some given to the russian comunity in a tier that about the majority of the rest of the comunity didn't have i lost my faith in this game. You couldnt play against russian teams because they either abused games or just used aimbots to do their dirty work. The forums of this game are a joke, the mods there are either abusive or rude or both and have little concept of what they should do in there. The game turned from fun in PvP to a grind where some are carried by the dev team and the rest are the cash cows. If this is still the case, stay away from this game or dont bother buying stuff, i did it and i regret it.			"

												StarConflict was honest and skill-dependent 3d space arcade.With quite nice graphical part and high potential. New friends have been found, and some of best time spent playing.Due to greedy managing and questionable developers all positive sides degraded into awful matter.This is not simply a Pay2Win game. This is a Keep Paying 2 Win. (©Gizmo.mac)Greed is good. This is developer’s motto. Development process was simplified: Create new IMBA ship which will dominate the battlefield.Make it expensive and available for real money. Make grind to new ship long and painful.As soon as ordinary players get enough resources to get this dominating ship - nerf it, and roll out new IMBA.Even investing 600$ may only grant you domination for a month or two, then your precious ship will be nerfed to brick.You pay more, or die from another ""happy customer"" as everyone else.Nobody cares about player’s opinion. Player can be banned for little to no reason. But - if you invest enough money in game - your ban can be revoked, allowing you to scam, grief and cheat again.Forum ban can be gained just for having your own opinion, or not hailing developers.In-game chat ban can be gained just automatically - with no reason.Full account ban can be gained by cheating, or arguing with GM, or writing a negative Steam review.All bans can be revoked by writing a positive Steam review.Look at game time on positive reviews - how much players recently exceed game time of 100 hours? Targem just forges positive ratings by fake accounts IMO.There is no control over GM's and CM's, with complete disrespect to players from their side.Example - Community manger calling me ""scum"" constantly on his stream, ended up treating to ban my whole team - because he was killed and we were clearly winning.Another example - league system discussion stream. Top corporation’s leaders present, decision was made that leagues will be in 8vs8 format.Leagues were started as 4vs4 - nobody cares about player’s opinion, even if they ask.For all years of the game existence I witnessed an ad less than five times. When the game was released on Steam - there were high online - for a month. Somehow people in charge wasn't aware that their servers already operated at peak power, and lots of new players just pushed the system to lag hell.No new servers were added, new players went elsewhere, and with maximum online of 600 I may get ""Server under heavy load"" message.Now, what will you get if you will try to play StarConflict now?Until you will reach Rank 4 ships - there will be a pale shadow of its former beauty and glory.Almost balanced, somewhat slow, with less options for modules but so nice.Progressing further will bring you into feeding frenzy of epic proportions. Unless you will invest A LOT in the game - you will be cannon fodder. Again and again, with progression slowed on purpose, hard caps on income unless by money investment and matchmaking weird enough to put you against ships 5 ranks higher than yours.Old days, when skill determined an outcome of the fight are gone. It's hard to overcome auto-aiming weapons, auto-healing enemy ships, and your team hiding under brown rocks whole match.Certain team compositions are unkillable on progression ships. Until you will farm or pay enough to get a counter-class ship yourself - you will be farmed. With little to no chance you will be stomped upon.If your stats become high - expect totally useless team as a boulder on your neck, have a happy time carrying these. And again. And again.And be prepared - some in-game activity can be accessed only through third-party site. There are no control about that site, but rewards and progression are counted on it. So pay no attention if there are shifts in final teams, or people not present in battles are rewarded.Latest addition - game items stockpile are limited now - so you can't stockpile resources now, you have no motivation to do quests, or everything you gain get burned.All my DLC are next to useless now.All my premium ships are next to useless now.All my time spent on leveling progression ships is wasted now.This is official cheating from developers.Conclusion: Targem and Gaijin combined efforts have killed StarConflict. Not worthy of your time now, not recommended anymore. R.I.P.			"

												I've been putting a lot of hours into this game. It's generally good game in terms of gameplay, variety and battles but I'll list out  the major cons:-Extremely grindy-Despite being called ""free to play"", people can just pay and advance to higher tiers/ranks. Lets call them Wallet players-Wallet players who reach higher tiers will get all implants (implants are like the point system tree in borderlands, payday 2 etc)-Wallet players who have all these implants can go back to lower tiers, are pretty much invincible and have the upper hand in every battle. YOU WILL GET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥HANDED TO YOU.Now you may ask Oh my, why would they come back to lower tier games and spoil our fun?. I'll tell you why...People think this game is really free to play and come into the lower tiers which are the only popluated matches available for instant battles. So the wallet players will just come into lower ranked games because nobody wants to wait 5 minutes for match. This is unsportive behaviour.-The game developers only seem to update the game in a way that favours wallet players.-Extra synergy (synergy is experience, you need this to access higher rank ships and higher tiers) cannot be transferred to ships which dont have full synergy. If you want to, you need to pay a lot of money.-Upgrading weapons to the max requires loyalty points (these can be done by doing special challenges like 'kill 3 ships in one battle'. These challenges are called contracts) And this requires another longg rinding process because contracts can only be done certain times. Some contracts can only be done once per day. Or you can just pay money and upgrade your weapons.-The game has an option to enable the profanity filter to filter explicit words for the faint hearted man-children. Despite this, uttering an explicit word in a moment of frustration will get you chat muted. This has happened to me countless times.Now you might say ""Oh you're just talking out of your behind, there's no such thing as paying to get an advantge in this game!""You are either blind and didn't read all the aboveORYou already spent a ♥♥♥♥ton of money on the game and are comfortable knowing that you spent $$$ on digital flying machines. ANY game that offers you the chance to pay money and progress in any way that puts you in a place that is unreachable to the common player without tremendous grinding is known as ""Pay to win"". And this game is a shining example of it.			"

												I started to play this in March 2013, was involved in 3 years of community & corporation building and loved it. Met many awesome people and perspectives and was totally hooked. I respected the devs for making their vision a reality and not give in to peoples demands of bigger ships, more auto aim weaponry and the overall dominance of skilled - play in this game made this game so much more challenging than a lot of other titles. If you played well you won, if you played♥♥♥♥♥♥you lose. There was always issues but the core gameplay was (mostly) fine and fluent. Unfortunatly the first cornerstone was Open space. With that, the whole mission bs started, Missions that contained 0 fun, 0 gameplay, 0 surprise, just grind, in its purest form. And they are still like that. it took them half a year to start ajusting the insane restrictions and they are still there.I will not list the issues in chronological order because i cant remember what happened when exactly. - Removal of squads, thats right, you cannot play with your friends, nor train your corpmates. - introduction of destroyers and ""live"" balancing that will go for antoher half a year.- removal of social features. You cannot see what your friends are doing, at all.- Promotion of sit and tank gameplay and the systematic nerfing of skill & endurance played classes. (limiting of firing arc, wich isnt that bad, but the implementation is) Todays interceptor of choice is the ECM. No skill in that.- Leagues, the ""new"" supplement for squadplay. It's the old sector conquest relived with a new name and a very narrow timeframe of playability. I could only play 1 hour of leagues per day if i wanted to. Plus further restrictions, like your team has to be set befor the timer starts and the fact that training less experienced players there, is futile and just a slap in the face for any pilots motivation. Nothing bad with losing, but very frustrating when you have no opportunities to train.- The ultimate ""mood killer"" for me as Vp of a corp was the fact that our communitiy that has a very intimate nature of communication and relies on friendships and not so much on other things to work, was that the devs actively tried to disrupt this with limiting information and keeping the flow of playing together disrupted. I feel that they don't deserve a recruiting corp like us that literally ripped their asses out at times to keep things going.- They failed to thoroughly remove items from older players for years, giving them advantages at times and when they introduced destroyers they turned the tide. Suddenly new players could simply obtain the parts by leveling up, whereas older generations of players like me still dont have destros. Because we have to grind this♥♥♥♥♥♥ no thank you. ( ispent all gs i got since then on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ jsut to see if i could eventually reach it but nono)There is more, but nobody cares.These devs inferiority complex will kill the game. They are a niche game with a great competitive potential but they dumped it. Or is it their publisher? nobody cares, sc numbers go down until the next big feature and then it will happen again and again until the pond is empty.I cannot recommend this game to anyone anymore. Exept maybe, you are russian and you really really want to play with other russians.Have i mentioned grind? :D Just look for yourself! "

												I rate this game negative albeit I intend to play it further a bit and had some fun with it.It can be fun and is challenging but there are many negative aspects.- Pay to win. All currently available DLC's cost you 223,94 €. You get 4 or 5 AAA Titles for that.- There is a short Tutorial but the game is very complex and most things are unexplained. The Wiki is mostly in russian language.- Grind. All you do is to level up different ships to get a better one with slightly improved stats. rinse and repeat.- You can loot occassionaly usefull things for a certain module but since there are so many modules you can rarely update the stuff you need right now.- Balancing. The balancing is NOT for a fun game experience but solely for generating money for the developers. You will see MANY artifical walls which restrict you from progress when you don't want to pay the ""incredible"" prices for things that should be in there right away. this appears like extortion to me. And this will never end no matter how much you have paid already.- Long waiting times (1-5 minutes, European Server) when you want to do a battle. Be sure to have something to read for that time.- Depending on time of day few players so the battles are filled up with ""stupid"" bots.I have not done much PvE and been not in a Corp so I cannot rate these aspects. But corps mainly require Voice Coms (Teamspeak) so this only works if you live alone.Other reviews have mentioned unfair bans. I have none experienced myself but I will certainly NOT pay (waste) hundreds of Euros when the game can restrict me from playing it that easily.So the game can be fun if you like Grind and are willing to pay many money. Everyone else should be aware that this is a simple cash mashine for the developers where you provide them the content (opponents) and shall even pay for it. The more I think about it the more I dislike this business model.as reply to TigusVidikis's comment:>Pay to Win??? why?Because you can speed up your progress significantly with real money. Faster progress means faster success and an advantage over players who don't do it.> Premium ships are just different ships. Better in some stats, worse in others.But they start fully leveled. Non-premium ships are therefore worse from their stats until they are leveled up also. but there is little point in flying a leveled ship any more since you mostly want to level up the next one. so for most of the time the premium ship IS better.>The only real thing to give you an edge is and indirect bonus, if you go premium you get more XP and more loot.more xp and more loot (items, upgrades) means better stats than one who doesn't pay. better stats means better chances. better chances means winning more often. winning more often means even faster progress. so from my conclusion this IS pay to win.from what i have seen you can achieve most things by stupid grind. but it will take you a long while and will certainly not be fun for the most time. the game is purely balanced to annoy you so much until you pay. and the developers are greedy.for 1 € (euro) i get 300 galactic standards (gs).one month of premium licence (+50% xp, extra loot) cost you 3000 gs = 10 €a second set of implants cost you 2000 gs = 6,7 €a rank 11 ship costs you 6.2 million ingame credits this are around 12000 gs and thus 40 €.to change ONE visual aspect of ONE ship costs you 150 gs = 0,5 €.even beeing the mentor of a new character afaik costs you 200 gs = 0,7 €.so if you want to play it seriously and have fun doing it you have little chance without paying. thats what everyone starting this game must be aware of. if you have plenty of real money to spend play it. but don't let you fool by the ""free to play"" tag because this is a lie.I see that the developers must eat and want to be payed for their work. but the payment scheme applied in this game is obviously greedy and reminds me of extortion. and this is not only my opinion i have heard several other people mentioning this as the most annoying aspect of the game.update #2I have now spend lots of time in the game (and also few euros) and want to explain my long term experiences.Corp/buddies is important to have for flying together and get some tips.PVE is quite boring and repetitive.IDIOTS. I can't describe how frustrating this game is because of the idiots in it. there are many bad players who don't contribute to winning, refuse to help their teammates etc.. Its very frustrating when you constanly loose a match because of such people. And there are the players which have spent many time in game already (you are too late!) and have top (premium) ships, best equipment and experience. If you have those in enemy team you have mostly lost already before the fight even starts. So if you are a ""medium"" or average player like me you will recive constant frustration.The matchmaking system seriously SUCKS. If you want to team up with someone you have significantly increased waiting times (you spent half of the time in this game waiting for a match anyway). So if you want to play together (its multiplayer, right?) you will actually have less fun.And the teams are often very unbalanced with one side having a clear advantage over the other. The balanced and fair (=the fun) fights are 1/3 approximately.So with the greedy developers, the idtiot community and the crappy matchmaking system I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone. I'm sure there are better gaming experiences out there. Once my licence epxires i will leave the game for these reasons. Gaming should be fair fun and not unfair frustration.			"

												Grind Simulator 2015Braindead Developers EditionThe game itself was good in the beginning, I had a lot of fun with it. But everytime it became balanced and fun, developers just messed it up entirely. Since the game came out of beta, they didn't just make small balance changes to make the game interesting, they screwed up the core of the gameplay several times. They never listen to the community, the official forum is a joke and the grind is so slow, that everyone I wanted to invite to the game just gave up in the beginning. Since the 1.2.4. the game just became unplayable, they teared apart the community, no teamplay available anymore, since they took out 4-man-squads. The game is getting more and more bugs with every patch, the servers are terrible. I really liked this game, but now it reached a point where I no longer have fun anymore. When dev's can get their ♥♥♥♥♥ together and finally listen to the community and concentrate on the most important things, not just fixing two pixels in the corner and put an air-conditioner into a space-ship, then maybe I'll change my review. But for now, the first two lines are perfectly describes the current state of this game.Update:Now all tiers are terrible except T5, destroyers are unbalanced, they introduced more grindy ships what you can ""reach easier with money"" and still no 4-man squads. Getting better, isn't it?			"

												I really wish I could give this game a positive review, and I would have a year or two ago before destroyers and before all the pay to win garbage was added.This game used to be great. My favorite game last year by far. But so many things have changed since then that have slowed down the game and turned it into a complete grind fest that eventually makes each match just whoever has more destroyers or more of the new alien ships, that you pretty much need to pay for to get, wins.Main thing is destroyers, before destroyers were introduced it was fine for the most part. Biggest problem was holoships just cause they were a little bit annoying. But destroyers upset the whole balance of the game and how the game plays out. The first set of destroyers, the T3(Rank8) ones, were ok, they still slowed down the game heavily and me and many of my friends were frustrated in how even mediocre pilots could completely carry games against much better opponents on their own without much effort, only because they were in a destroyer. But the real problem was in the T4 destroyers, and the destroyer modules that came with them. The Gravity lens module can completely stop whole teams from capturing a beacon unless they had an ecm with system hack that didn't die before it got in range. And against slow ships the gravity lens would suck them in and make it so they could not move. You could not imagaine how frustrating it is to not even be able to do anything against this since active mods didn't work to stop the gravity lens from pulling you like they did against tackler slows. And this mod alone completely changed the game, beacon matches turned into whoever had the most skilled interceptor and tackler pilots wins to whoever had the most destoyers with gravity lens wins. And then, we get to the T5 destroyers, which were, for the most part just as bad as the T4 counterpart until the Vigilant came along. The Vigilant was just like all the other invincible empire destroyers in that it  easily had more then 15x a well built empire gunship's survivability and better DPS modules. But the biggest part that was different from it and all other destroyers is its weapon. It received a special weapon just for it that can easily keep up with a max DPS spark with overdrive and aiming overcharge on whilst being able to apply all of that DPS at 10km.   So, all this destroyer stuff is pretty bad, but another terrible part about this, that almost makes the game completely pay to win is to play these destroyers and even have a chance of winning matches you will need to do weeks of grinding at a time to get a destroyer, if you play the game 2+ hours a day every day. I did open space grinding for about 3-4 weeks after T4 destryers were released because I missed a few of the events.  And then after all of this, the new premium ships being released that have much better bonuses and special weapons that are much better then their standard counterparts. And to get these premium ships without grinding for months on end you can easily drop more then 100$ getting one if its above R9 or so. And that also brings us to the new alien faction that is completely overpowered as ♥♥♥♥. Can't really elaborate on this as much as othe other subjects as I quit the game, with more then 4000hrs+hrs (lots of it wasn't using steam) into the game, a few days after they were released.  Also another thing, that I forgot to add in earlier, and that im far too lazy to find a proper place for is the devs also know that destroyers are a problem, but they refuse to solve the root of the problem, and instead they make a bunch of stuff that is better against destroyers and say ''if you pay for all of these things you can stand a small chance against a destroyer when you have more then 4 ppl shooting at it'' The most recent of these additions has been the New Years weapons, that do 2x more damage to destroyers because they take forever to kill when less then maybe 4 or 5 people are shooting at them. These weapons make destroyers much more interactive then they are as you can actually stand a chance against them sometimes, without these weapons its kinda just like attack destroyer=die, avoid destroyer=destroyer takes objectives and you lose, and die, and go to other objectives and destroyers melts you in less then 2 seconds from 10km away (vigilant, it can and often does spawncamp whole teams at a time without destroyers). Got a litte of topic but the point is, these weapons are great, but devs need you to pay for them if you want to use them.And that is prettymuch what Star Conflict has become. A P2W game with horrendus balance. The combination of all of these things caused almost all of my friends to quit, almost all the pro players to quit, and also causes alot of new players getting wrecked by destroyers in R4 ships to quit. It is a real shame compared to the amazing game that used to be in 2014-2015.			"

												Mixed feelings. Good Game, but a few issues hurt this games potential. Game it self is good and highly addicting. Its a space shooter the maps look good. Not many like it. Its grindy like most free to plays.This game is not pay to win. It pay to grind less. but the money you spend give you very little extra advancement. In order to advance faster you will end up spending alot in the long run. Once you progress to the upper tiers, their matchmaking takes a long time. Sometimes longer than 10 minutes for a round that last as short as 2 minutes. If you like the game and want to get some things for it I recommend to wait for the steam DLC sales. Elite pilot has the most bang for your buck. Also the DLC bonuses stack, so if you wish to get more than one its allowed.If you buy gold be careful there are a lot of gold stealing options. The so called free itmes are not free half of the time unless you don't have gold. The punish you for buying gold. The support for this game is terible. Even for people like me who have wasted Thousands of dollars, they still will treat you like crap.If you don't have time to grind your life away I recommend these shipsFor open space Get the Rockwell Equip it with sentry and heavy drone and shield and hull heal. Use cruis engine for speed. master the ship and open space will be easy to do.For PVP T5Mauler, Rockwell, Mammoth, Berserker, Patriarch or Karud. I recommend getting any 4 of the ships I mentioned above during the sales. Do not play T5 PVP unless you have 4 ships otherwise the match will be short because many of the matches are one death per ship.			"

												This game has been destroyed since the Destroyers update. It is extremely imbalanced. In order to have fun you need to grind for days, weeks and months or PAY TO WIN!Therefore, player base has been depleted successfully by the developers. Just have a look at the steam community page stats: No one plays this mess anymore compared to the years before and the queue is getting really slow.Honestly, this was one of the best space MMOs out there when it comes to balanced PvP. I'm sad to say this, but it's not worth a try now.			"

												This is an instance where I wish there was a ""meh"" option instead of just the yes or no on the recommendation. As F2P games go it's not terrible, a bit like a space-WarThunder. But I'd have to say no on the recommendation anyway because the amount of progress you make in the free sense trails off pretty quickly. It's pretty, it's fun, it's amusing, but unless you start throwing money at it you never feel like you make it past level 5 or so, and that's intensely frustrating as you start getting thrown into matches with the players who HAVE paid and will slaughter you.

												This game used to have it all. The best (and only) F2P game that I actually played long-term. A self-proclaimed critic of the entire F2P model (and no great fan of multiplayer interaction), this game managed to pull me in. It was gorgeous, controls were intuitive and responsive, ships felt and looked great, phenomenal weapon and component selection. I could tinker with my ship for hours! I always thought that if this had been made into a single-player campaign game, it would've topped them all....and then they got greedy. The shift wasn't even terribly subtle. They annihilated the balance, and the only fix was to pay more. I kept hoping for a patch-fix that, of course, never came. In the end, they proved my every concern to be true. They just took a bit longer than usual to reach the inevitable point of screwing up a Good Thing™.What a waste.====================Below is my response to the following comment from Gaijin: ""Hello. We never anihilated balance and never ecouraged anyone to pay for anything. Star Conflict is a free game, where every pilot can do and earn anything without any payment. Premium license gives you advantages in faster rank progression, but not in battles.""The same geriatric excuse trundled out by every game that goes P2W? Yikes. Sure, a free pilot is structured within the same progression as a premium player. However, by the time they reach the same point as the premium pilots they're playing against (because matchmaking went out the window too), the universe will have have terminated entirely through heat-death. Where a player's two choices of keeping up are either ""pay through the nose"" or ""quit your job and play the game full-time"", your game is pay-to-win. The attempt to downplay the correlation between battle advantage and faster rank progression is just weak. See, there used to be a reasonable middle ground. Players who could pay for a bit here and there. There was enough progression without paying that it was feasible to play normally for the most part, then just buy some GS & a license every so often. You got your money out of us - heck, I even picked up a premium ship. The problem was, you distanced those two sides of things so much that it was no longer a remotely workable option. Crafting became a pipe-dream and progression without GS slowed to a pained hobble. It was either ""shell out the big bucks"" or ""go home"". So congrats on turning away paying customers too I guess?Oh, and you ""never encouraged anyone to pay for anything""? Do you know what normal people call that? A ""lie"". It's called a lie.			"

												I played this game with a few friends of mine. We were all excited about it and even bought several of the packages ($49.99) ones.Summary: The game has a solid foundation and could be a great arena/World of Tanks alternative. Unfortunately the developers (like several other eastern european developers) rely heavily on cash shop purchases, premium time purchases, an incredibly steep progression curve (post rank 7), and a near impossible PvE environment. Do to the difficulty, extreme progression curve and the steep cash requirement to progress or even play the game beyond rank 7, I cannot fully recommend the game.Pros:-Ships in space!-Lovely graphics, awesome ship designs with personality (unlike the flying turds in Eve).-An interesting open world element starting at rank 4. In many ways similar to Eve Online. If the developer capitalized on this and rebalanced the AI encounters found in open space, this game could have been a winner. See Cons.-Ship role customization, although limited it does allow some degree of freedom to tailor your ship to your liking.-Includes both PvE and PvP missions.-The crux of the game takes place in Arena style battlegrounds or instances.Cons:-Steep difficulty curve in PvE missions starting at rank 4. These become near impossible without fully upgraded, fully tiered ships which can be either incredibly expensive or take an inordinate amount of time.-Open World exploration loses its luster at around rank 6, as NPCs send you on suicidal near impossibly difficult sectors of space (which are open to PvP ganking). This relegated open world to only end-game fully upgraded (think all purple equipment) ships or gank squads.-Cash shop solution for nearly anything. Equipment requires faction marks in order to level it to Rare (blue) status. Unfortunately it is prohibitively expensive to switch factions in order to grind their marks. Although a Cash Shop solution is offered.-All weapons, modules, and ship equipment can be ranked up (improved) all the way to purple status using the Cash Shop gold emblems.-PvP arenas can be hit or miss depending on whether or not your ship is fully leveled and equipped for that tier. Again, since you can do everything through the cash shop, you can easily fully gear up a ship with purples for PvP. Also, be prepared to encounter fully upgraded, cash shop ships out in open space as they suffer no repair costs when destroyed.If I knew the developer had plans to lessen the PvE difficulty curve as well as remove the cash shop/cash requirements for switching factions, I might recomend the game. Until they do that I strongly recomend you steer clear of it. It is my understanding that this developer has no plans to do that and would rather run it into the ground.			"

A nice space shooter, a (somewhat) fair, but grindy game.Unfortunately there's no ""maybe"" rating for this review. The game definitely isn't something for everyone. It's possible to have fun with it, but at times its really just boring.At first the game might look like a perfect ""pay to win"" candidate, considering there are several DLC packs available unlocking ships for you. However, that's not really the case.All ships available as part of DLC offers or to be bought with real world currency are more or less sidegrades or shortcuts. The most powerful ships however, can only be unlocked by playing the game. That's very nice and fair. And here's the catch: Unfortunately, you can describe the game with three words: ONE HUGE GRINDFEST. And to be honest, that's sad, very sad, and also the reason why I can't really recommend this game without warning about this.Let me explain the game in a few sentences:You start out with the factions' basic ships. To obtain bigger ships, you'll have to earn ""sync"" points. With these you're able to level up ships. Once you've leveled a ship, you'll be able to unlock the next ship in the tech tree that's usually a small upgrade or a new ship fitting a different role.In addition, you're able to upgrade parts of the ships or more specific modules that are installed on them: a primary weapon system (turrets), secondary weapon systems (typically missiles), a ship specific special ability (not upgradeable), and two support abilities. The problem: Upgrades won't transfer between tiers.So game progress looks like this:- Obtain a new ship.- Invest (ingame) money, mission rewards (or real money) to level up the ship modules.- Level up the ship to improve its power and unlock the next ship.- Obtain a new ship and start over again.And that's it, unfortunately. I guess I don't have to say that leveling the ships appears to take ages. While it's perfectly fine to not ""finish"" the progression part of the game within a week, it's really slow and tedious. Add to this the fact that the game's population isn't that high (typically 1000-3000 players online right now according to stats in the game), it happens that you'll have to wait one or two minutes to finally get into a PvE game. Queue times for PvP are usually slightly longer (sometimes 5 minutes or more).And here's another problem: Due to the low population (and a very limited number of PvE missions), you're usually fighting with or against significantly stronger enemies. It's not uncommon to die within seconds versus a sniping frigate that's simply out of range for you. Once you're dead, you'll either have to wait 30-60 seconds (seems to depend on game mode) or till the next stage of the mission (in PvE). In addition, most mission stages take only two or three minutes, but there's a full minute of wait time between stages.""Fortunately"" there are ways to progress faster: You can buy the classic ""booster"" to gain more points, but you're also able to buy different ammo that will double your synergy gain. The unfair part: The costs! The initial price of the ammo module is 2 Standarts. That's not a lot. However, once unlocked it no longer shows any price. Although the module will still take 2 Standarts for every round you're playing. You won't see this unless you're paying close attention. And some of the costs... To upgrade a weapon from level 2 to level 3 you'll need something like 30,000 units of mission rewards: You'll get about 600 per mission - or buy the upgrade with real money. Do the math yourself.And one more thing to remember: This game can only be played using keyboard and mouse. There is no controller support (neither gamepad nor joysticks). Also there seems to be a significant amount of auto-aim involved or there are really just big hitboxes. It's definitely far easier to hit enemies as it is in other games of this genre.TL; DR: Star Conflict is a nice space shooter with great graphics (especially for a free to play game) and good sound, but overall the whole game is just one huge grindfest, which is sad and lowers the overall gameplay experience a lot. If you don't mind not progressing for a while or really having to start over several times, give it a try. You might like it. But don't expect to win dogfights from the beginning or progress in one straight line.			"

												Used to be good game where were many strategies to play and win but now its pretty much grinding to get your own destroyer, or with money you always get:premium ships,premium guns, premium ammo, premium missiles. premium devices.Nowadays half of the ships arent good for winning becouse new premium ships,DLCs and matchmaking. If i could just go back to play the 2013 version of this i would love it.			"

												This is the only game I ever written a review for, and sorry it has to be negative.1. This game is adamant on putting you into the Russian server after an abyssmally long wait time. It is unplayable. Massive packet loss and lag makes you unable to enjoy this game at all. I would rather play with bots on an emptier server, by myself.2. Starting out, this game seems easy enough to tier up and get more powerful. And then everything gets EXPONENTIALLY harder to purchase or level up. Combine this with constantly being put on an unplayable server you see how unpleasant it gets.3. Ship designs are recycled. Come on man, it's the same thing with a different shade of paint. Even the voices get tiring after awhile.4. PVE quests lack direction. Questing has to be challenging but not frustrating, Combat challenge > Wandering around trying to find a space rock.			"

												Grindy space game which you can play a variant of in The Old Republic (the Star Wars MMORPG) which comes with cool laser sounds.this game starts out okay and quickly turns into your standard grind or you can spend money to speed that up. Not sure if that is bad or not, I personally love endless unlocks and working for reward.This game is plagued by admin abuse, bad matchmaking, and while a fun space game never really feels like youre hurtling through a void but sort of... motorboating around Florida wetlands. BUT in three dimensions. I have been constantly amazed at some of the games that come out of Russia, this one is not one of them however. I even curiously googled the admin abuse issue and found lots of cached topics that have since been deleted but thanks to the semi permanence of the internet can see all the locked and deleted posts which are hardly worthy of being deleted. Unless you are trying to hide some really bad PR, which is what it is. When in doubt, do what Putin would do!So bottom line is it's Sochi in space and pink eye is a serious risk?			"

												Hi all, I played this game for a long time as you can see and I have a lot of friends in this game and we all have the same feeling, that this game is turning into a job. The fact is that the devs lost the war with star conflict and they need money. All in this game is based on it. You get less reward for free because they want you to buy ! Let me give you some examples. - You have secret ships and you need monocrystal resource to build them, mono will allow you to build ships parts to build the secret ship you want. Before in operation special (team of 12 pilots) it was possible to win some ships part (around 20 mono the part) , now it's finished; the devs removed it. No more ship parts in operation special (=OPS) - You can get the mono in open space, the game have 3 factions and each have his own missions in open space. before it was 3 mono per faction, now it's 2 mono or 1 only per faction if you don't have premium account.You have a new faction aliens it give 2 mono too, so even with a new faction you got less mono than before. The game is based on marathons and farming dailies. - You have a lot of marathons, I will take for example a marathon rank 13 or rank 15.This kind of marathon need 600 parts to get the ship.To complete it and to play it for free you have to farm, the drop is 10 part per day maximum, each victory should give 1 part but not sure, sometimes nothing.A fight is around 7 or 8 mins in pro squad ! I said pro squad ! And after 10 victory you can get a container, the container give you 2 parts most of the time.it mean that to get 600 part ...12 per day max...7 mins in pro squad x 10 fight ... 70 mins minimum x50 !!!! 600/12= 50 right ? so minimum 50 days to get a ship If you play 70mins per day in pro squad. And I cannot imagine a new players playing directly in pro squad, you will keep dying and it will be hard. So you have the possibility to marathon for mono or to buy it in bundle, bundle container are expensive even with promo. Get a ship for free = work on it a couple of hours per day !Imagine u start a marathon, and u not in pro squad...u will get a victory each 30 mins and u need 10 wins...and when u won u not sure to got a part.but with all of this do not forget to collect your mono in OS (OS= open space). so the marathon time + OS time = ....too much MoreTo play marathon that i explained, you need a ships maxed (full synergy) to be able to play the marathon ! But to max your ships, this game have a bad matchmaking ! 9 pilots out of 10 give up ! pvp = lost cause ! It's what i hear most of the time, "" i not play pvp because i always lost "" and I can understand it, matchmaking suck. Maybe not always for me but yes for the new pilots, and it's one reason why this game has lost a lot of players. Also, I have a destroyer. To get a destroyer you need to farm. For example last destroyer rank 14 needs 720 electrum (it's one resource for destroyer)   We were in the game and farming 10 wins until 720 electrum...we were tired ! Because the devs work with deadline, we had only one month to get the destroyer, so forced to farm. 2h per day in pve during 3 month ! And had 3 destroyer with deadline, so during 3 month some of us were always in the same map to get 1 electrum per win ! during 3 month !!Do you understand now why I talked about a job ?And destroyer also need neodium, beryllium, electrum and mono ! Must farm them all ! To help you of course the devs call their game free to play and give some dailies to get some neo bery or elec, but it changed nothing that we had to farm 10 wins every day during 3 month. And this kind of dailies asked you to use another destroyer to play it.Miss a day = buy a container with real money to get all part for the destroyer. Devs did it to force us to buy, like if they said "" it's called free to play and you can farm for free, if you cannot just buy but buy it before the deadline"". One way to get money fast ;-) And do not forget that u need ships maxed to play it, so it mean that if you don't have ships maxed(full synergy) that you have to up your ship and unlock them, so it include if u want play marathon r7...need unlock r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 + r6 + r7 (r=rank) if wanna play marathon r14 for destroyer need unlock r1+ r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 + r6+ r7 + r8 + r9 + r10 + r11 + r12 + r13 to unlock r14 and max your r14 too.All of this is too much right ? And now it's not all, we have dailies with new aliens faction, it mean that we have to farm and play as we did for the destroyers but now it's for the aliens ships. And more, the ships module are blocked ! you need to play dailies to unlock it ! THIS GAME TURN LIKE A JOB ! The matchmaking suck and to complete the dailies I cannot imagine a new player do it. Some new players will try during 2h to do it and give up. Yes it's called free to play but also...It's pay to win ! I already asked some new map to have some fun and we still don't have new map ..why ? DEVS DONT GAIN ANYTHING WITH PVE. Some strong pilot always play pvp and they want to get the new ships quickly and they keep spending money anyway. Problem is that this kind of ships are strong and some pilot like to feel strong, so they buy the ships. They not buy it to play pve ! They buy it to play pvp. But to play a marathon, if u keep dying in pvp, how you will play it ? You will play 50 day on the same map ? Or on the 9 map that the game have ? And you have also more than one marathon so, I don't know I say it like this but do you think that you will play 100 time each map ? Game miss pve map and it's a fact. When we ask an update, for example one weapon doesn't work correctly...no update ! Devs looks like vampires, feeling is that this game is on the way to die and that money is the priority and that deadline is necessary for them to get money fast and that other updates to have fun do not have place in their planning ! Matchmaking, sometimes you come in a fight pvp and you see the problem, for example when you join you see  3 - 15 kills for the enemies (killed 12 more than your team) 1 - 3 beacons for the enemies (captured 2 more beacon than your team) So they will win of course...And with all of this when you come in this kind of fight you lost your ranking rating pilots. So honestly you can find good friends in this game, sometimes I want to quit and my friends keep me on.But the game is boring.The graphic are good, all is not bad.That's why some stop playing, I received some pm ""Odin I stopped playing this game, it is going to die and it's a waste of time""In fact the more I play, the more I see the devs becoming greedy, more i see them like vampire ! Need money, need money ! All is based on money, I bought all dlc ! Spatial scanner, premium ships , I also have a premium account since I play and they make me feel that I need to spend money again.Hell no ! This game is not a free to play but a pay to win without end !So if you want enter in this world...up to you but be wary. If they change their mind and their way, I will remove my red thumb. Honestly I already removed my blue to put a red. I am French but i wanted to explain it to English talkers, people have to know and we are not many to talk French there. Sorry if my English is not perfect. I will continue playing but I will slow down with all of this, game is going to die so its smart to not wast time there. For now I will just collect my free dailies without spend too much time there, and with the hope that the game will survive. But honesty I doubt it. If you want to know more or talk, just send me a message.Edit : read my comment to know more :)			"

												You would think with almost 1500 hours and at least a third of that being money invested I'd rabidly defend this game, but I am not happy with the development direction. I'll probably still play for as long as I can considering what I've invested already, but . . . This game has long deviated from what made me fall in love with it. Remnants are there but I can't help but comparing. What I really take issue with is how I see customers getting treated. Not me specifically, I am the way I am and I've just learned to accept any incoming consequences as a fact of life, to brush them off, and just keep going, but other people who go into things with a certain set of assumptions about their investment both time and money wise . . The latest example would have to be the transition from destroyers to alien ships. I am not a person who likes the idea of destroyers in the game as it has been put into practice. On paper great, but initially they were very strong. Yes they had events to get these ships easily, but now they are difficult to get and have a sort of air of exclusivity. On this basis you would think that at the very least, customers are rewarded with a strong ship for investing real money.  But now they've been nerfed into the ground. They needed it to be honest, but it coincidentally happened the same time they moved to the new faction with the alien ships.  The starter kit for which costs 40$ USD if you want to ""convenience"" your way to them and they are quite powerful. Maybe not so much in the hands of a new player but they can easily vs a whole team. Right now there is a broker mission and some grinding you can to do to get there for free, but I imagine by the time the general community finally gets to them they could be nerfed as the new ship is released, with a new 40$ starter kit.  I've seen this sort of game balance strategy before and it ruined the community of a game I cared very much about. MWO is now dead because of this sort of economic model. Maybe I'm wrong. That would be nice. I get very passionate about things I care about and trust me I would love to be wrong on this.So no, at this time I don't want to recommend this game because of my own opinion, but I will say:It's free, so it's not like you have to spend money to try it out. If you really like space games A negative review isn't going to stop you and If you feel you're having enough fun to spend money on it, that's great, there are a few DLC that have quite a bit of utility value especially when on sale. If I see you asking in game I'll probably even tell you which ones to get. I'm sure that if you like this game when you try it you'll leave a great positive review to offset this salty vet, but I still believe that if you feel like you need to spend money to have fun, then the game is playing you.

												It's Primo Pay2Weeno. Everything you want to work for (It will be work, not fun) can just be paid for. Everything that can be paid for is more powerful than anything that can't be.According to the Dev/Pub, 5 hours is a normal amount of time to spend playing their game daily.♥♥♥♥ anything about the game, the community behind it is absolutely awful. The Devs hate the NA players, don't host any english speaking events, don't regard NA player desires for the game at all and treat them like♥♥♥♥♥♥on their own forums. I have reason to beleive they want to kill the NA playerbase entirely.Everything Here as of the Age of Destroyers update is still true and relevant, none of these things having changed.Here's everything you need to know about Destroyers:-They aren't fun to fight against-They aren't fun to try and attain-So far Tier 3 and 4 has Destroyers, but they're made with T5 salvage parts and materials with ungodly low drop rates, OR by flying premium ships.AS OF 1.3.3: T4 destroyers added, Rewards for Ranking up turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was almost able to make a destoyer until they turned the reward from 10 neodium plates to 1. This is a publisher that actively hates its players.The menu and UI are even more confusing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than before. After playing for a while longer I'd add broken and more unbalanced than before. Interceptors and no longer viable for any US players due to the horrible ping issues such as uncontrollable ship wobble, and ships are now meshing between teirs, leaking T4 ships into the t3 pvp pool. pathetic. HERE: http://pastebin.com/qeFHCQiq Are my reviews from previous updates. Ive condensed them there to make my new review more simple. Now I present to you: *FACTS* About Star Conflict. > 90% of the servers are russian based, unsuring lots of high ping and connection issues. > Power can be bought with real world currency. Let me explain how:    -All Ships and Ship parts can/should be leveled up/upgraded.    -Ships are leveled with Synergy, gained from winning battles and completing main missions (Called  ""Contacts""). Different ships have different amounts of Synergy Levels, and with each Synergy Level you add to a ship, it's base stats increase, as well as role specific stat boosts. Alternatively, each of the three playable factions have a row of ships that you can BUY (with real $ turned into Gold Currency) and don't need to be leveled at all, all of their synergy based stats come maxed.    -Ship Parts are *ALL* Leveled in 4 teirs: Mk.1 (when you buy a part), Mk.2 (which can be paid for with earned in game credits), Mk.3 (which is paid for with faction specific ""Vouchers"", earned by completing specific goals in battle), and Mk.4 (Which is paid for with Iridium Crystals) and more recently Mk. 5, which is crafted from many different hard to aqquire resources. Alternatively, you can buy gold currency and use it to level your Ship Parts. Ship Parts include: Weapons, Engines, Sheilds, Armor, Capacitors and Targeting Computers.    -Spending GALACTIC STANDARDS (The Premium Currency bought with real world money) to level any Ship Part permanently turns that part gold as well as increasing the level. Gold Parts increase the synergy gained from battle.    -(WARNING OPINIONS HERE) The rate of Real World Currency to Galactic Standards is unreasonable, with prices being $15+ dollars for ship. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- > Open space is restriced to Teir 3+ ships in most sectors. Each station has a maximum of 6 sectors (maps) accessable to under rank 7 ships. > Flying into open space with anything less than a High, Teir 3 ship = automatic suicide. The AI enemies are too powerful. > Open space also has PVP sectors where you may be randomly destroyed by other players with higher teir ships. > Just under $5 worth of GS can be earned through acheivements, for 10 GS each. > At Ship Teir 3 (Currently the most populated teir out of the 1k Playerbase) Reaching max synergy level on any given ship at that teir will take approx 500,000+ synergy. The synergy payout per 1 battle with 1 enemy destroyed and 0 capture points is approx 2,750 (also with no gold parts). The Grind is Real. The higher Teir Ship, the more Synergy it needs. > The incoming playerbase is nearly non-existant > The remaining playerbase has all of their ships MAXED, ensuring any new players get effectively stomped at any level. > New content is only released for T3 and up. > Global Chat Moderators are not official staff, and are rude and abusive of their power. > (WARNING OPINIONS HERE) Developers are just dumb, making 'balance' changes that break the weapons when they're fun and turn previously broken weapons into unfun to fight against. They say they make these changes based on 'feedback', but all the feedback comes from a micro-echelon of the highest teir players who make a point to gang up on and shun feedback that they don't like, such as ""game is p2w"". > This game is designed to take money and be un-fun after a certain point. The only reason it's still getting content updates (As well as the reason all the content is endgame) is because there's a market of around a thousand players who have been either playing since the beta to grind to the endgame, or paid to get there. > Player Profiles in game show the amount of ships you own, amount of ships at max level, and amount of premium ships. It is rare to find a player that has the first two amounts high without the third. > If the game was 1/3rd of the grind it is and didn't have the ability to buy power, I would have paid at least 20 dollars for it. Instead Gaijin released it as a free to play, and Im here telling you not to give them more money. Do yourself a favor, save some money, buy a better game.If my review isn't enough: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212070/reviews/?p=1&browsefilter=toprated.			"

												This game had a suprisingly strong start, showing an impressive amounts of polish and strong gameplay when it started as open beta. From that point, it basically got worse and worse.Star Conflict is WoT in space, with huge selection of ships, great graphics and pretty enjoyable combat mechanics. Just as WoT, it's horribly grindy and developers made a few misguided decisions that made progression even harder and slower then it was at the beginning. The strongest example is the contract system: contracts are missions that pay you with reputation, that you can spend for unlocking high-grade gear for your ships. At first, they were an additional source of reputation, that you could also get just by fighting in matches. Then, it became the only source of reputation, what made unlocking good gear much harder (and slower/boring). Then, they changed the mechanism from unlocking gear, that you could then buy for every ship you own, to upgrading single pieces of equipment. I salute everyone that didn't want to barf at the sole thought of how much grinding it will get them to equip a new ship decently. And it's only one of the changes that made the grinding much more painfull then it originally was.The game has pretty good variety when it goes to game modes and maps, which gives decent potencial for organized teams to dominate the game, maybe more then in WoT thanks to the much more dynamic battles. It also has a decent clan wars system, that can have some appeal for dedicated players. Still, the grindfest stays as the main complain that will probably make all but those with really strong will drop this game - and it really seems that since the release SC playerbase is rather getting smaller. I invested 60 euro in the elite pilot pack, but after a month I couldn't force myself to play this game any more. So, unless you're a die-hard fan of WoT that wants a new game in similar style, or you want a somewhat-casual space shooter and won't care at all about painfully slow progression, you probably shouldn't give much time to this game (though you can always try it out for some initial fun, it's F2P after all).

												Apperehently the devs who made this game, which is okay at best, are very shady. This game has a premium pack and other in-game purchases. The problem is that the devs are shady as ♥♥♥♥. I have seen cases where people spend hundreds of dollars for parts to build a big ship, and there is a bug in it. So when those people speak out about it, what happens? They get banned from the game! Like what the hell devs, you should never censor the community like a communist piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Other than that I do apologize that this is not an actual review of my experience.

												It is basically a 99% pay to win game. You can get lots of stuff by simply playing but that will take a very very long time. The game has a horrible boring grind that is not too rewarding. There are multiple ship classes and thats nice but if you decide to one class of ship when you upgrade to the next rank it is not very rewarding. There is no new abilities and it feels like there is no point progressing. Unless you have a fat wallet or a lot of patience I would not recommend this game.			"

												Third review for this game, and this one is a direct response to the dev team basically saying ""♥♥♥♥♥♥off!"" to its veteran community.Do NOT support this game. The Devs do not care about how much time or money you put in - their goal is to offer shiny things to new players, not to reward loyalty.Veteran players have been informed they will not be getting any progression rewards that were added in the latest patch, meaning anyone who's been playing the game prior to v1.3.0 gets a year and a half extra grind onto their progression.They will do this with the next big update to the next wave of ""vets"".Show them what happens to games that treat their players with contempt. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME! Spend no money on it, force them to look after their players or starve.			"

												What can i tell about this game ? Well, i've played it during 3 years, and now, there's no telling how i am disapointed. We all now that the objective of the devs is to make profit, but now it became a vicious circle. One year ago, the first destroyers rank 8 has been added to the game, I can only remember how many hours i've farmed to get the ressources. And Now, Alien ships are added to the game ? And Now, Some weapons deals 2* damages on destroyers ? And Now, the damage dealt by the weapons of the detroyers are divided by 2 ? I can admit that the destoyers were very powerful, but, they were capital ships, created in the purpose to support all of the allied ships. How many people have invested money in this game to buy these ships to realize that now, they became some sort of sh*t ? In 2017 will appear the aliens ships, they will be over OP and will kill every destroyer easily.So, what....in 2018, ""Profaners of world"" will appear to destroy these aliens ships ? I'm sorry, but even by paying, there is NO WAY to get a 'strong, powerful ship' because they are nerfed at every update.All in all, Star conflict, it's all over for me.			"

												This game had great potential but paywalls, inferior matching systems, and endless grinds ruin it. I'm all for micro transactions, their an important part of a healthy free to play game, however star conflict takes those micro transactions and shove them in your face at every turn, every ship, every weapon, has a superior counterpart that can only be obtained either through a year of grinding (not exaggerating) or with the real money currency. The game is so unbalanced because of this and their introduction of destroyers, which take multiple players to take down, only makes it worse. I spent a lot of time in this game, 541 on record, and I just can't bring myself to start it up anymore.			"

												No longer worth playing ever since patch 14.3(Yesterday) The patch they implimented resource cap limits, and destruction(complete destruction, no in game credit compensation) of acquired resources that would put you past the cap, including those that are extremely rare, and require already retard amounts to be actually useful.  DO NOT support this game until they change things back, it's not worth playing if it's going to be PURELY Pay2Win.  Take it from someone who has THE S**TIEST luck with RNG stuff, and ends up having to do P2W a lot.  This game isn't worth it.  Even with my S**t luck for RNG, this game(prior to this lame excuse of an update) was one of THE VERY FEW that my RNG luck WASN'T -10000000%, and I was SO CLOSE to getting what I needed for something.  Then this update happened.  Now I can't MAKE the required part for a ship, because the amount of resources required is MORE than what the cap allows for that resource.  I ask that anyone who see's this, and knows someone who plays/has played, or who was thinking of playing/returning, to boycott the game, until the Idiot's decide to undo what they've done.			"

												R.I.P. you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. :( Most of my time logged into this game comes from the first iterations of the game, when it was akin to programmed gold. Seriously, the dog fighting and team PVP missions were so tight and awesome, but at the same time, a couple of guys with a sense of adventure and a good eye could make a big difference. I tried coming back into it after some sort of calamitous event, these new expansions or updates or whatever you want to call them. These ♥♥♥♥ers killed one of my favorite games. IF you can even get into a match now before the 1 hour mark has passed, you'll be subject to people who, despite sharing a level of ship sort of similar to your own, have premium equipment that you cannot stand up to if you haven't dolled out the dough. Or you can go to the PvE free-roam.. thing.. and fight against bots. Good freaking luck if you're solo, though. None of this♥♥♥♥♥♥was necessary, and it screams of cash grabbing tactics. Screw ambitions driven by greed and screw the monstrous blod this game has become. >:C Now I have to go play Crimson Skies to make myself feel better.			"

												If you are interested in this game because they recently advertised the possibility of commanding destroyers, good for you.ONLY, you won't have one. Why? Because you aren't ready to spend $500 to get all destroyer parts from lottery shop. Don't repeat my mistake. I've spent $200 to get parts and I don't have even 1/3 of what I need to build most basic destroyer. Anyway, I suggest you to forget about getting destroyer for $100 or less. Well, you also can grind like mad for it, but you need to forget about school/job, family and any other real life stuff.			"

												Lets see..where to begin...So i started playing in OBT a long while ago...i played more then my 7 hours on profile says (not sure why it wasnt tracking). I played it up until i reinstalled steam on another computer and the game fell into a hole and i never realized it was gone...This went on for some time until i recently picked it back up...and subsequently set in back in the hole and walked away. Heres why,Admins are asshats. Any review you look at in recent weeks will show this.Gameplay, while rather fun was far better in OBT. Now you wait 2 mins or longer to be put against 1-2 other people (generally who may leave or atleast one will) and then its you vs a ton of bots..not exactly a challange. It seems like the game has litteraly died, what was once a very active (and fun) low tier is now fully dead..and T2 stuff isnt much better; you simply die faster to better geared pilots.Progression is much like WoT, which i dont mind as i play world of tanks...unfortunately for this game the tree's dance all over the place. Unline in WoT where, for example, you go from Hellcat up to T110E4, and stay in TD's the whole way...This game places you from class to class in most cases..and it gets very slow after T2-3.Graphics imo are on par..solid stuff. It runs smooth, there isnt much clutter, and overall its a good first impression. The problem starts after you get a little further into it. Lucky for me i had already got a lot of progression out of the way in OBT and ended up with some very nice gear to use at tier..stuff you seem to simply not be able to get anymore. I think the game could be very good...but at the moment..there is no justification to recommend this to anyone..it simply loses luster after a few short hours...pity..			"

												This is a great example of a great MMO action game ruined by bad balancing and bad design desisions of developers driven by greed, sloth and rush for spectacle creep. The best version of the game was last one with shared weapons and modules deep into OBT and prior to soft launch in Steam. All changes to the game in versions released after that didn't make the game better at all, it didn't even make the game more diverse, while making it a lot bigger, a lot more grindy and a lot more convoluted. What was once a game of tactical freedom and custom space ship building mastery became game with just several winning builds and just several winning strategies, but didn't stay this way for too long. After introduction of ""open space"", destroyers and new, more powerful premium ships it became a P2W grindfest where you either grind other players and mobs to get your own destroyer, or you've already grinded and/or paid enough to grind other player for no other reason than love for easy wins.I wouldn't recomend installing or playing this game nowdays or any time in future. However, if you can acquire a time machine somehow, try going back to 2012 or 2013 to play Star Conflict open beta, it was one of the best action games I've ever played.			"

												I've changed my review for this game 3 times now.  I wish there was a neutral button instead of a simple yes or no.My latest review was a positive one, that is until they released a new class of ships called ""Destroyers"", which essentially let you faceroll any other class of ship, to the point where usually whoever has the better ball of destroyers wins the match.  Obviously not a lot of thought went into their implementation either, as these massive hulking ships with ~5-6 times the effective hitpoints of the closest class of ship are worth the same amount of points in Team Deathmatch as a tiny interceptor that dies in seconds.  Not to mention it takes like a month to get a destroyer without paying real money.On the other side, I really like the graphics and the combat in general.  It's fast paced, and heavily skill reliant.  That being said, it gets stupidly grindy eventually.All in all, it has its ups and its downs, but the balance issues with Destroyers kills it for me. "

How to ruin a game to the worst. Old annoying bug like the auto-afterburner automatically enabled and reenabled randomly despite user preferences never got fixed. A classical case when dev don't listen to the users that invested YEARS playing it and don't look at the stats and understand why people don't play it anymore.When a game it's based on balanced skill and equipment the algorithm that choose who to put in your team it's the most important piece of code that never got fixed and unbalancing factor just became worst with the destroyer introduction. what a pitty!

Basically it is like a team domination game (like in unreal tournament) but in space, with very unbalanced players, and when you rank up you will have to start over again to build up your new ship. All the points you earned in previous battles wiht your last ship cannot be transferred (unless you pay), weapons from your last ship rarely can be transferred an basically you do the same over and over again. Anyway, you can give it a try during a couple of days like I did until you get bored.			"

												Pay 2 win game,The game is fun with friends, but when you must queue by yourself (because no one plays the god damn game) at higher tier you're screwed. What's even worse is leveling ships, a horrible cancerous grind because starting with the worst modules and you'll lose most of the time (against paid ships and purple level modules/weapons), and since it's based on performance you'll get little to nothing and spend hours doing PvE instead.There's free roam which takes hours getting place to place for a daily missionThere's PvP with leveling ships vs paid ships (not really balanced at all then since lower ships vs higher ships)There's PvE which is the only thing worth doing, but you must wait for the ""good ones"" since some take forever or difficult.And that's all there is, I never cared for this game, i only feel the developers tugging at my wallet.If you like mindlessly grinding for hours, this is your game.

												Let me open by saying, I REALLY want to recommend this game. Truely. And if the game was as it was around when I first started playing (about three years ago), I would. But as it stands, I simply cannot. I loved this game before. The PvP, while quirky and a bit biased towards premium ships, was fairly balanced. And the PvE was great and a simple way to get your daily win in if MM was being a pain, or if you just weren't doing so hot against a player. Then the slow descent started. And then there were destroyers. At first, I was SO hyped for destroyers. then it came that they were acquired with components gained mainly through PVP, and very rarely, the ""open world"", which was broken as hell.PVP has degraded to destroyer battles, and occasionaly a player with something other than a destroyer getting casually swatted away by one who does. And as another reviewer has said, you can determine if you're going to win or lose by the first few minutes of a match.And then PvE. Originally it was great. A challenge if you were new, inexperienced, foolish, or just had a stock ship. But if you knew what you were doing and had good gear, it was a simple way to grind money for new gear/ships. I remember taking  a couple Premium Tier 3 frigates and a tier 3 fighter and grinding  missions for a few hours and only now and then encountering trouble by accidently aggroing a bunch of mooks at once (a bunch being 7-10). The enemies were usually fighters and interceptors en masse, and occasionaly a frigate or two. Now, I take the same three ships out and get put up against multiple destroyers at a time, and non destroyers are controlled by an AI that (I assume) is designed to mimic a human pilot, but with ridiculous buffs that come with being a bot: Always accurate attacks, All Seeing AI, super reflexes, you get the idea. great for the VS bot arena. Not great for the PvE scenario set ups. Ive had interceptors (2 guns) with railguns (bad vs shields) strip my guard (read: tank) frigate's kinetic shields (even stronger vs railguns than usual) in a couple seconds when bot controlled, but players taking much longer.Overall, Gaijin took what was good, set it on a table, and proceeded to violently flip said table. It was good, not so much any more.Final Verdict: If you have to have a gaijin game, get War Thunder. Russian bias aside, its much better built/balanced. Otherwise steer clear. There are better space based games to have.			"

												TL;DR - Devs are money grabbing, balance is crap, and they screw over paying customers. It has degraded so badly.So this game used to be a really solid 3rd person space shooter. I began playing soon after it released in 2013. It hands down had the best manuverable ships, and there was decent balance between their ship types. Then they overhauled all the ships and made special modules multi-faction. However, there was a huge red-flag. Some ships became different class ships than before, and if you paid for a ship it could have a different special now. Everyone with a special ship should have been refunded their Gold, but no.Then came the camera patch. Before you could zoom way out behind your ship, really to a degree that nobody every played at. Somehow the devs thought it was a problem and shoved the camera right in behind your ship, so you couldn't see anything. Frigates almost couldn't see anything. After two or three months they finally gave the frigates a bit more camera breathing room, but still the others were too close to properly see. They don't give the option for first person, they just made it super hard to see anything.That's when I roughly stopped playing. However, at that point I swore off giving them any money. They were obviously not fair to their customers, and could by no means be trusted.Then I came back 8-9 months later. They seemed to give the cameras a bit more of a break (but I may have just been gone long enough), and it seemed ok. However balance and queues were degrading. They implemented their open world, but it was about as boring as a WoW questing zone in space. I played a bit of PvP, it was still okay-ish. Then about a month ago I logged on. Balance is non-existent, it's empty, and it's just as grindy as ever. Plus when you do get in game, a destroyer just shows up and yeah...Don't bother yourself.			"

												Good game turned bad because of the money-hungry ♥♥♥♥♥s working in the development team. This used to be great back in it's early days (played since open beta myself, took a break then made another account through steam), but as soon as the devs got a taste of the money that the increasing popularity of their game brings, things went down the drain.Don't get me wrong, the game in itself would still have a positive review should it have not turned the way it did, after all, it's well made, not to mention it's one of the last remaining 3D action space dog-fight simulator (etc.) games after the death of Black Prophecy.If you still with to give it a try, go for it, you'll enjoy yourself for a while, but don't put too much effort or money into it, the pay-to-win is real.

This game offers nothing in the realm of detailed tutorial nor does it explain how to rank up, instead it runs you through controls and basic fight scenarios and then it throws you to the mercy of the rest of the playing field. You have to rank up with 0 control of how you do so, there are ZERO PVE Zones to test your ship and your own abilities. this game Claims to be PVP and PVE but it is simply arena based PVE / PVP of which you dont control which you get. Dont waste your time or money on this game and send this developer a desounding answer of their attempt as making a get rich quick game. This game sucks plain and simple.			"

Short Version:As said by many others, it used to be good, but not any more. It's another game where all the devs care about now is making money, not the game, and certainly not its players. Don't download it, and definitely don't spend money on it, just avoid it.Long Version:Some fifteen, to twenty years ago online games were a niche thing, devs didn't make them expecting to make mountains of money, they were just in it to make games, and with all being pay to play games, they focused on making them their own brand of fun, so people that liked it would keep paying for subscriptions. Then the free to play (F2P) model became a thing, and over time more F2P PC games adopted the more abusive F2P model that used to just be the kind of thing seen in browser, and mobile games, where your only real options to get ahead in time was to no life the game, or spend money, lots of money. Now more, and more online games just seem like they're only there to make money, and nothing else, fun be damned. In fact, they'll purposely put in things that are frustrating, just so they can say ""look, you can alleviate your frustration with the cash shop.""That's what has happened here. In the early days they defended paid premium ships as just things that were a different variant of the ships you can get without spending money, as they provided no real game play advantage, which was largely true then, other things to spend money on were cosmetics, and modest boosters to gains. Now decision after decision seems to have no other reasoning other than to milk as much money as they can from players too easily parted with their money. Short on the parts needed to make that new super powerful item/ship since they just increased the volume of materials you need multiple times over, without increasing in-game material rate of accusation, or are about to remove that ship from production? No problem, you can now buy those materials in their cash shop, through random boxes, even materials to make in-game items you can gain in no other way, that's right, such things can basically be called cash shop equipment like weapons. Want to grind it instead, well maybe, but if that is possible you may need to spend hours a day for months, and you likely need to fly fully levelled ships, so all that XP you're getting is wasted, unless you're willing to spend real money to transfer the excess XP to other ships. They will make new items, and classes of powerful ships after a short release event timed exclusives not available again for a period of months just to create more demand for them during the release event, and get people to spend up to several hundred dollars US to get ONE ship before they're gone.All this can come at the expense of balance, and game play since they're removing the ability of other players to get said items, providing the whales with an advantage. The game feels like it's losing players too, causing them to keep making increasingly desperate (and unpopular) changes to their matchmaker rules so rounds can start more easily, since most of the game needs other players for you to even play. The part that doesn't need other players (open space) just gets ignored, and gutted to make other parts ""better,"" with nothing but the promise of some all important fix all update that has been delayed for months. Although, if that update is as effective as their recent module upgrade update, then it will just make things grindier, and all around worse. What it comes down to is that any company willing to hurt their game, and their players to make money, doesn't deserve your money, or time, just don't bother.			"

												If you like pulling your hair out at horrid matchmaking, grinding endlessly to get part of what you want, and suffering along alongside your dearest friends at what the devs think 'balance' is, then this game is for you.If not, go somewhere else. This game is not for you.			"

												Nope. Sorry, but nope.I've sticked to this game since I discovered that Steam was a thing, amazed by its pretty lights, shiny ships, intensive collision physics, and of course, the spaceship Spiderman kiss.But now, update after update, the game's slowly gotten to the point that, unless you spend ~450€, or waste a year's worth of grinding, you're not going past tier 3 ships (And pray that you get enough resources to get a Destroyer, the one that is oddly enough, easy to kill in-game), as anything above will become a clusterf*ck. Of the non-pleasant ones.I did enjoyed the game. Enjoyed. Now it has become the equivalent of doing a daily chore, one that you can skip if you simply have better things to do, and the low numbers of players and long times to find matches prove that what once was a little jewel, has eroded into a chunk of rock.Perhaps in a future update, things will start being about rainbow ships in space shooting unicorns that dispense ice-cream, but we all know that it won't ever happen. T'was fun while it lasted.			"

												Sadly, I do not recommend this game. It had great gameplay before the patch of last year, and I gave up since. I decided to give the game a fair try by playing on my friend's account (he is on tier 4) and the pay-to-win factor is at an all time high. It gets rather annoying, knowing that a ""free"" to play game is so prominately dominated by people who buy their ships and weapons. Whereas in games like tf2, the people who pay get equipment that is grossly overpowered, and people who stay free--either due to no money or no care to buy things--seemingly cant win. Above this, however, I've seen problems with the administrators. They seem rather...rude, to put it in nice terms. And with that concept, they are fairly jerks. The devs are the same way, though in more of a racist aspect (Russians being the overlords). Anyway, to kilter back to subject, I do NOT reccomend this game unless you want a fair share of ragequits and unenjoyable experiences.			"

												tl:dr this game has all the core technical features of a great eSport - high skill cap, strong team-based gameplay, and just fun to play/watch - but with literally EVERYTHING else going against it nowadays:1) impossible to actually practice with people and improve2) impossible to coordinate any sort of strategy in hot-join matches3) extremely low quality forums, full of complaining and no strategic discussion whatsoever4) new patches focus on adding more grind rather than dealing with core gameplay problemslong version:I'd say I'm an above-average player, have a 1.32 win/loss ratio from 1600 PvP games, all from solo queuing and mostly t3-t5. Recently I feel like I've hit a giant brick wall with this game. Here's what I see of this game: it's a very high skill-cap and rewarding game which almost deliberately makes it impossible for you to improve your own gameplay. Ironic, isn't it? Let me explain.Typically in team games it's hard to see whether you lost because you misplayed or because your teammates failed. This problem happens in MOBA's like DotA a lot. However, those games have a nice replay system where you can actually go back and analyze what you did wrong to improve as a player. Star Conflict has nothing like that. Every loss just feels one-sided, frustrating, and not constructive at all. I don't mind losing if I can take something away from it, see what I did wrong, etc. but I can't here. There are often times during a game where I'm not quite sure what I need to do in order to turn the tide of a game. Unfortunately there's no way for me to actually post a replay on a forum, ask for advice, get better, etc. as I used to do with any other competitive game. One, because there is no replay system, and two, because the official forums for this game seem to be inhabited by 10-year olds. The quality of posts on the official forum is downright disgusting; people start arguing with each other on every possible thread and drown out any constructive conversation. So maybe one solution is to play with people to improve right? Well, not really... that brings us to:Team play. How to?Dreadnought battles between corporations are actually a lot of fun. However you can only do one battle once per day realistically (the game limits you to 3, but for most people 2 of those are during work/sleep hours), so it's really hard to actually get better at the game by playing these. Most of the hotjoin matches you play, everyone else speaks Russian. You can't talk to them, and they can't talk to you. It gets boring/frustrating really fast watching your team throw the game and not even being able to coordinate any sort of strategy with them. And guess what, you can't actually hotjoin matches with a friend unless you sync and get lucky or are content with waiting 20 minutes between games, and you can't hotjoin matches with more than one other person period. Apparently this is a actually a feature of the game. There's this mythical game mode called Leagues where you can play with large pre-formed teams using end-game ships. My corporation supposedly has a team for this but I think they are able to play a grand total of two games a season. There's also t3 tournaments which used to be good I think, but with the addition of destroyers, the few that I've played have consisted entirely of: Mexican standoff until one minute before time runs out, then rush in and try to grab kills in the last minute. Oh and they're also Sunday-only.This review is from the perspective of someone who likes playing challenging games and wants to improve and outplay other people. This game feels like it should be an appropriate game, and the sad part is I think it used to be, but it really isn't anymore.			"

												I see a lot of people throwing out P2W and F2P and all that, here's my take on it as a former top 100 (kda, kps, win%) player who tried to avoid queuing with overpowered veterans.There's lots of interesting game modes, and plenty of action and learning curve and skill ceiling... but that's balanced by sigh-levels of grind. I'm probably well below 15-20% of the total grind in the game; look forward to 500+ hours of ""intense"" and ""successful"" grinding -- victories give more rewards than defeats afterall.Q: Is there skill involved in PVP? A: Yes, depending on the matchup, up to 90% of a fight is determined by it. Skill is, very broadly, tracking enemies with your mouse like an FPS, and far more importantly, tactical decisions such as positioning, when to run, seeing what enemies (ship types, player names) are coming and how your team should counter, knowing which 1v2s to take and which 2v1s to avoid -- ship types, and even specific item builds for each ship, require specific counters soft or hard; for example, two scissors won't beat a rock.Q: Can you buy the best ships from lvl 1? A: More or less, yes.Q: Does that mean you'll start stomping?A: Probably not; I've beaten more than my fair share of opponents who have ""double my hp and dps"" in both 1v1 and 5v5 situations (quickly ascertain who the 'easiest' enemies are to kill and just farm them over and over -- fodder players cost the same resource as a pro player in deathmatch ""first team to X kills"" rules) My final mention is that some players have winrates well into the high 90s (like 16:1) because they generally queue with other top players and the weightedness of skill, ping (RIP if you dont live near a populated server) aswell as matchmaking (low population) is broken enough that they'll basically win every match. Unless you don't mind being tossed against the best players in the game while you're still tiering up and learning the mid-lategame and getting utterly decimated, prepare to log off or play non-PVP modes (serious...yawnfests; destroy this 5000000 hp target followed by this 500000hp target while infinitely respawning 500 hp enemy fighters try to swarm you) for a few hours.I met about 12 people from I started to when I stopped. One still plays! and he has almost 2000 hours. So it can be ""fun"" for sure if you like third person space shooters with plenty of tactical options and very different ships providing very different gameplay styles. The lack of a balanced endgame sealed it for me though; the grind and paywalls didn't exactly encourage me to spend another 200-300 hours to reach the extremely unappealing endgame.			"

Once you have your controls figured out and you've gotten accustomed to the unending stream of colourful stimuli being blasted at you from all directions, you can begin to appreciate how utterly awesome this game really is. From the Galactic Trichotomy where no faction is 100% good nor 100% evil, to the elaborate ship design, fun customisable decoration and weapons systems, stunning graphics, and intense PVP or co-operative team PVE space missions. Ironically, this game is narrated by disgruntled voice actors who seem to find spaceships, explosions and laser beams amidst asteroids and stars extremely blasé.			"

												The game itself is a very nice-looking space shooter with the balance between realism and fun tipping towards the fun part for an overall good experience.A nr of things made me finally uninstall it though:- Yes theoretically you can progress through the game without buying credits, but in practice the long grind needed to play that way quickly kills the fun factor.- All game modes require queueing to get a certain minimum of players added to the matches. Unfortunately the current matching process means you'll spend more time waiting than playing.- There is a prominent 'Customization' button center bottom of the UI. This button leads to a menu where credits can be spent for paintjobs and decals for your ships. You get a tiny amount of such credits through tutorial and as some rewards, but for any real customizing you will have to spend actual cash. I get it, they have to make money, but why for the love of Pixels and Bits does that button have to keep flashing every 3 seconds?? It keeps drawing attention even knowing what it is, because in every other UI such a flashing means THERE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE YOU NEED TO LOOK AT! This single thing finally ended up irritating me enough to uninstall the entire game. Sorry dudes, but intentionally badgering me to spend credits, in this game or anywhere else, will ALWAYS make me do exactly the opposite. "

After the devs implemented all their good ideas, they started to impelent the bad ideas as well. I don't say the game is not enjoyable sometime, but some of the content is seriously unbalanced, all the new ingame content cost crazy expensive and you have no option to buy it on a fixed price. (Some ships cost 2-300 EUR if you want to get it from the lottery packages whats the only way to get it.)Even if the devs made some good steps to support teamplay (again), its still far from the version what they had 4exampel in 2014.The new OP alien ship is comming.

												First of all I really need one neutral button. What does it means? Well below I will tell you why I can give thumb up and down.First of all of course thumb up is for:- small dogfights in space'- fast combats;- if you have upgraded weapons you can slayghter everyone in matter of seconds;- 3 big progress trees with many ships each;- maps are full 3D so it matters what maneuvers you do;- Fights are quite short and you won't spend much time in one fight (at least in the beginning);- The sounds are good for the ears;- Graphics are good;And now for the part that really drive me away and give my thumb down:- When you start the game in the beginning, probably and in most cases you will die a lot. Your ship will get rekt many times and probably you won't be able to do something about it. No matter what skills you have, if the enemy already upgraded, you have very small chance to oppose them.- Murphy's law- game puts you in a team, full of new players and the enemy team is with better ships, betters skills and when you spawn, you will die after 1 minute max.- Of course you can buy some ships that are exclusive for the money giving people (donaters) and those ships as you can think, are slightly better, at least what I saw.- If you enjoy capital space battles more than the dogfights, this is not the game for you. Go play Fractured space (Alpha version) or Dreadnought.- With the thing above,  FOR ME  game is somewhat not welcome to the new players. Making it too predictive for the future of what is to come- you either play many hours to unlock several better ships, or give some money for the better ships so you can enjoy the game.But that is for all free-to-play games, right?In the end: I am willing to spend start price for a game, where things are in equilibrium and I will know that people won't have advantage of this.And yes- matchmaking in all games can suck- a lot of times. So this is not exception.But still I have really few hours, even not scratched the full scale of things, but I can't go on. Too unfriendly fights.So overall I am neutral to the game, but can't give my neutral horizontal thumb.P.S. At least devs are good people and collect feedback from everybody.P.S.S. I will look for updates of the game and in future I am willing to try it again.			"

												Well, I decided to buck the disturbing trend in reviews, talking about this game as overly money-hungry, pay-to-win, and overly poor in the balance department.  I even plopped down over $100 for myself and my family for premium accounts, since progress without premium is incredibly, mind-numbingly slow, and the game is really fun and flows smoothly at first.  Plus, I like War Thunder (though I've hit a steep increase in the grind curve and haven't played it for quite a while), and so decided to give it a chance because Gaijin did at least some things very well.Well hoo hoo.  What a fool am I.  Everything they said is true.  And I feel like an idiot for giving the devs my money.A quick aside.  I used to play Warframe for quite a while.  I eventually left it in disgust for what became more and more clear -- the devs' focus on the exploitative aspects of the game, rather than improving the experience for the players and developing the depth of the game, and disrespect of the playerbase -- particularly their time.  And, most of all, its terrible grind that makes the game end up feeling like a job -- it progresses nicely and evenly at first, but then, even with a premium account, it takes forever.  And then there are time-limited goodies to get, but the gambling/loot system is rigged to screw you over so much that you have to put in an inordinate amount of time to get the time-limited goal/goodie fair and square by legitimate gameplay...  so why don't you just pay for it already and skip the grind, hmm?I got sick and tired of it.  Quit after a long enough time that I'm embarrassed to say it.  But I'm a lot quicker to spot this kind of game this time around -- after a couple of weeks, I'm already done with Star Conflict.  Had enough of grinding fights against players who you can't damage but who demolish you in seconds every time you pop your head up (because the matchmaking system pits you against players with ships far more powerful than yours).The straw that broke the camel's back was and then spending real money on gambling chests that promise all sorts of interesting things, though 5 of the items they can provide -- hardly noticeable in that impressive list of cool things -- are just small amounts of mundane resources that you get at the end of every mission and are sick of by the time you've played a week.  But that's 5 out of 40 items, surely I'd get at least one or two good things.Nope.  Bought a pack of 5 of these chests and got nothing but the mundane resources and a few crystals.  Really?  I guess they want you to buy chests, get nothing interesting, then keep buying more.  It's a mechanism used in a lot of exploitative games.The game has a lot of promise, and is fun, until you hit about rank 6 or 7, and then suddenly the grind increases a LOT to progress just a little, and you find it necessary to play PvP, where skill matters little and your equipment is massively underleveled.  You watch your hits ever so slightly decrement their shields, then suddenly you get rapid-fire 5-shotted in a matter of 1-2 seconds.  Not so fun anymore -- your job is now to be farmed, while you grind away, hoping some day to progress to the point where you are competitive, or at least can hold your own.  Or...  why don't you just buy the premium ships and pay for a ship that can win already?Just pay to win and stop complaining.Screw that.  No thanks.Not recommended, at all.  This business model and the mentality it encourages completely poisons every aspect of the game.			"

												Star Conflict... the description of ""World of Tanks in Space"" works pretty well to describe it. While it lacks the intricacy of research and training crew that World of Tanks does, it still has a very similar experience grind that many other Free-to-Play games have used (Mechwarrior Online comes to mind.)You spend time working your way through the tiers of each faction, factions you can change if you have enough credit earned from fights, each tier more powerful than the last. You have four basic types available to you ranging from small Covert Ops ships, intended for sneaky hit-and-runs against specific targets, to larger frigates that are there for longer range support with repair abilities.The game looks absolutely stunning overall, with great dynamic lighting effects that I would have never expected from a DirectX9-based game. Effects are easily recognizable as well, giving you an easy way of knowing what is coming at you and what is going out.The UI is serviceable. It lacks a certain flavor that would compliment the theme of the game, going fo ra simple ""MMO"" styled hot-button interface for extra utilities that your ship may have that dominates the bottom of the screen. The targeting cursor, or the mouse in combat, can also get lost in the middle of combat as well. Since the cursor is a a little too minimalist, and the HDR causes the screen to flash white violently at times, it becomes far too difficult to figure out just where your turrets are aiming.Audio is alright. Voice acting is pretty poor, with quality on par with a modding team that doesn't quite have the experience needed to pull off something believable. ""We have lost our commander!"" comes out as someone just fresh from high-school trying to pretend to be in a position of authority with no believable emotion what-so-ever. They try to emphasize a lot, and in the end they sound pretty silly and cringe-worthy.On the case of balance, low-tier equipment seems to do pretty well against anyone you'd get matched up with, but as you start pushing to higher tiered fights, the discrepancy between earnable ships and paid for or ""Premium"" ships starts becoming readily apparent. Ships purchased by ""Gold Standards"" with premium status have higher base stats than their earnable counter-parts and also manage to avoid the costs of repairs. Equipment purchased with ""Gold Standards"" also gives a top tier benefit that one must grind for with a specific faction to get, allowing people who pay cash to not only have a better core ship, but better equipment compared to the rest of their competitors.The game's currency rate seems a bit strange. After checking the math, it comes to about 300 ""Gold Standards"" per US$1 which translates to $2.20 for the cheapest premium ship, $27.50 for one of the most expensive ships, $10 for a single month ""license"" that grants you increased chances for loot if you win a battle (which in turn grants credits and rare equipment), or $48 for a six-month ""license"" for loot as well.While the licenses are less expensive than that of a standard MMORPG or MMO game in any right, everything else seems to tack on as extras. Cosmetics also cost roughly US$0.05 each depending on their type, certain equipment to mount on your ships also add to the cost, and really feels like the entire game is based on either trying to pull as much money out of you as it can for mid-tier (as that's where most players are), or nickel and diming you to death for cosmetic design.Overall, the game can be fun, but the mid-tier combat is very much dominated by that of people who have either (rightfully) earned their equipment, or purchased it all, with premium ships looking more flashy than that of their earnable counterparts. This sets up a sense of each fight being unfair, regardless of the skill involved.If you can tolerate the mid-field tendency for pay-to-win behaviors, and hopefully push to ""end-game"" tiers, then you'll have a great time with this game, but if you're sensitive to the possibility of buying out a win by equipment advantages, it may not be for you.

												I'm not one to write reviews, but here we go:Star Conflict... At one point, had a special place in my heart. Before destroyers, before the open-world, before I had to fork over $5 just to progress in any meaningful way. I had sunk my teeth into a game that thoroughly entertained. Had I written a review earlier in it's history, I would easily recommend it. But what it is now, I can no longer say so...     Before all the open world updates, when the game was solely PvP, the experience was greatly enjoyable. Battles were intense, fighters zipping about, and me in a frigate with the healy-buffs. When I had a little free time waiting for the foe to respawn, the scenery could be enjoyed. Battle finishes, loot obtained, and I finally have enough synergy/credits to buy the next tier ship and equipment for loadout. It was satisfying, the whole experience...     First Open World updates were released. It's exciting! You can explore the greater universe the devs probably inteded. Killing mooks, accomplishing missions, mining for resources... It was a gratifying experience... People were in the open world, but the arena was still in good use. Finding battles between 1 to 3 minutes, instead of the first few seconds.     Then, the aliens came... You know, the first, small waves at home base. It was new, enticing. Had to be cautious as we didn't know their capabilities... Then, more and more alien updates... The beautiful open world maps turned dark, ashen-grey. Especially the low-tier Federation locations (Abandoned Beacon, which was my favorite before the update). However, you couldn't fight them alone. I had to run for my life just to get where I needed to go. You could no longer enjoy the scenery for fear of getting wiped. It was devestating... It was war... But soon, against the wrong enemy...     Dreadnoughts came along; the huge, hulking brutes. There was hope against the aliens... But being a solo player, away from the corporations, I have no say in that matter.     PvE, Destroyers, Open World getting brutalized further... Pesonally, it all came by too fast for me, with spare time getting harder to come by... Barely anybody in the arena anymore, save for the lowest tiers, with the noobs, Seal Clubbers, or people simply not wanting to PvE or Open World. Game's getting buggy with the new updates, destroyers screwing up the balance... It was a mess...With all the new Premium Ships and destroyers, you couldn't fight a satisfying battle, clawing tooth-and-nail with enemies of similar caliber. It was F2P, small cash spenders, and P2W. Granted, it was like that earlier in the games life, but not by the sheer magnitude of the newest updates. In order to get a Destroyer, you need to spend either:A. Copious amounts of cashB. Copious amounts of time    Neither is very entertaining...     ""Playing"" the game was no longer satisfying. I paid a little cash here and there, yes, even buying the Soldiers of Fortune pack while on sale, but the grind was getting horrid. You couldn't grind in the arena save for PvE, which got booring quickly, and basically nobody in the middle tiers playing PvP (Tiers 6-12). Open world was almost too punishing unless you were/had:A. Good at the gameB. Premium and/or high tier ships already.C. Spent the money needed to get to B.D. All of the above.     I'm not dissapointed that I DID spend money on what is now classified as a Cash Grab, but the REASON I spent it: For the betterment of gameplay. What I mean is, payed subscriptions for MMOs are one thing, but being forced to pay left and right just to get an edge that almost didn't mean anything anyway...     I cannot continue to play Star Conflict for entertainment anymore. Which is what games are meant to do. Star Conflict, at one point, was a fantastic and satisfying game to play. But over time, got dragged down by its developers, and was transformed into what it is now: a Cash Grab.			"

												This game if trash tbh:CONS:God awful balancePay 2 winMassive grind if you dont pay for stuffManufacturing ships takes insane amounts of time that no one has time to doSome new ship called Thar'Ga ♥♥♥♥ed up balance even more(Example: High tier versions of Thar'Ga can do up to 15,000 damage in a hit with their main weapons, effectively one shotting all fighters and/or interceptors class ships)Pretty much every ship that can be manufactured is so difficult to get legit you end up buying all the resources needed.(EXAMPLE: WHEN THEY MADE IT SO YOU NEED EVEN MORE OF THE RAREST RESOURCE IN THE GAME FOR ONE SHIP)(ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF GREEDY♥♥♥♥♥♥ Theres some ships where you need individual parts to manufacture, these parts are also incredibly rare, YOU NEED 200 - 600 OF THESE TO BUILD CERTAIN SHIPS.)Pretty much every ship that can be manufactured is so difficult to get legit you end up buying all the resources needed.Progression is very slowFor some reason theres a premium DLC for 80 dollarsAll ship customization require premium currencyDevs clearly dont want to even try to listen to their community feedbackEvery update increasingly makes everything worsePROS:Gameplay is sometimes funactually getting♥♥♥♥♥♥legit is satifyingOpen spaceIf you dont want to deal with the awful balance of PVP you can just play PVE or Open SpaceStill better than No Man's SkyIn summary its just a bunch of greedy devs trying to keep their awful game alive and I still have no idea why I still play it.UPDATE, 3/28/17: The devs added trading and which OF COURSE requires premium currency to use, and they said you could trade resources between players (Things like ores and other materials) but instead you can only trade for parts for 2 ships and blueprints.

												First I was very happy to find this game. Its a Shooter not a Simulation.Was telling an interested friend ""wow - i can totaly personalize my ship (modules, weapons, crew, ...)"".The Game was cool until Tier III. But then you will have to pay or accept it as your new 8h-Job and forget about real life.So its more a DEMO than F2P!If you dont want to pay it becomes boring very fast, because if you want to proceed you need to do:PvE-MissionsWaiting to start 2-6 minutes for 4 players and 2 stupid bots.(First i didn't think ""lame PvE-Missions"" and ""stupid bots"" but if you have to do them 20-30 times just to level up and get a ship which is worse than your actual one, because its fresh and not leveled, you begin to forget very or less fast that this is/was a fun game and not your boring job.)PvP-MissionsThere you will propably be matched vs. ships 2 levels higher than yours or some one who bought an imba special ship for money. But there is more. The big destroyers. i liked the game without them. The matches were dynamic and fast. Now its more like a siege or static warfare than a good (dog) fight.Even tha maps changed into something cold and uninspiring. Since some patches the whole thing is mostly green and dark...Its soooooo sad. I liked it very much in the beginning!			"

												The game is fun for a little while, but there are several issues later on in the open world part of the game. You are pitted against super accurate pirates, cartels, etc. in a laggy environment. Facing one or two at a time is managable, but these enemies are nearly impossible to defeat in groups due to the fact that they almost never miss any shots. The missions, on the other hand, are okay, albeit difficult. Missions are supposed to require teamwork to complete, which is something that does not happen very often. I cannot count this fact against the developers, though, as promoting teamwork is usually more complex than adding different classes of ships into the game.Although the open world portion is only one part of the game, it is a rather large area that still needs work. I doubt I will play Star Conflict much or at all until it is fixed. (Making the pirates miss from time to time like a person would is probably the best change the devs can make.)			"

												It is fun only for an hour or two, before you get matched with players having ships 3 lvls above you. Unfortunately there is no way back, so buying premium t1 ships makes no sense and if you buy them you will regret about it.On the other side progressing on higher levels was feeling like a second job before, now it is 58% slower according to patch notes (1.2.1). With such kind of changes you will retire from your main job before you will make any reasonable progress here.Definitely not recommend.			"

												EN _(на русском читать ниже)_Don't ever ever play this game.In the beginning you might like it. But after learning more of it you'll hate the guts of its developers. Because they're ridiculously lame and have special ability of turning a really promising game into complete piece of sh**.Cons:1) Awful devs, they'll always be able to surprise you in a bad way with their development decisions.2) The community is toxic and mostly consists of 6-16 y.o. teens. Most of skilled and mature players have already left this game.3) English-speaking community was tiny even on its peak which was couple of years ago, nowadays it's even smaller.4) Devs and moderators have no respect to players. They often ban players on fictitios reasons or to enforce censorship (you can't criticize the devs openly).5) Year or two ago pay-to-win element was almost nonexistent but today those who donate money have much easier access to the best ships.6) Previously it was a 6 degrees-of-freedom game, but the devs chose to make the game easier for players unable to master proper skills, and they degraded this game to 4 DOF.7) This is a session-based pvp game, so having a good match balancer is crucial. But in SC the matchmaker is awful: don't expect evenly balanced tough fights - they're super rare. Most of the time you either will be stomping the enemy or get stomped.8) Some time ago the devs declared they were aiming for cybersports. But that was nothing more than talk.Avoid this game or you'll regret it later.====================RUПо-русски скажу короче и понятней.Эта игра - то самое худшее что можно найти на го*но-фришардах ла2: абсолютно упоротые разрабы, невменяемая модерация и цензура (нельзя критиковать), донат (без доната каждый из 2 десятков наиболее сильных кораблей строится 2 месяца, с донатом - день-два).С каждой обновой игру делают хуже и хуже. Если думаешь, что хуже уже не будет и что потолок идиотизма теперь точно не пробить -- ты будешь неприятно удивлён.У старконфликта был офигенный потенциал. Но эти разрабы умудрились его проср*ть. И они продолжают двигаться в этом направлении.			"

												TL:DR - Too grindy, pay to win. Devs have no foresight, and don't care about their community. Game is being used only to generate money (only way I can explain the decisions they've made).When I first started playing Star Conflict four years ago, I was absolutely hooked. It provided awesome full 3D space combat with gorgeous visuals and lovely sound design (including music). Unfortunately, I got to know the game. Over the last four years, not much has changed in terms of outward appearance, but the mechanics have taken a drastic turn for the worst.It was always a grind (and a bad one at that), but it has gotten worse. Not only have they rearranged the tech tree into a jumbled mess, but they have added new ship types that just boggle the mind when it comes to obtaining them. The Destroyers, for example, require components to build which, in turn, require resources that could drop from post-mission looting or might drop from open space resource nodes. You can spend real money to purchase resource crates, but even they have an RNG component which randomizes what you get from them.They are doing the same thing for premium ships. What you were once able to purchase using real money for a respectable price, they are now changing their acquisition method to resources unique to each premium ship, which are just as rare (if not rarer because there are so many items now diluting the drop pool) than other ship components from random drops. If you want to buy the resources outright, it is once again a random drop from a crate. Doing the maths; premium ships cost WAY more than before.Ship module upgrades are a must-have if you want to remain competitive in PvP. But, not only has item upgrading been made even more tedious than it was before, you are able to instantly upgrade an item using premium currency. If that isn't pay-to-win, I don't know what is.This game was made by the same company as the one that made War Thunder. Despite Star Conflict being developed by a different studio, the problems with the developers persist. They are toxic about feedback. If you slander their game publicly, they will retaliate with bans or something else, and they don't listen to community feedback (where economics are concerned at least). They also seem to have no grasp of game economy mechanics. Having an RNG loot table is all well and good, but putting critical progression items into that table, diluting it with useless garbage like small credits caches, and then continuing to pile even more progression critical items means that it just becomes impossible to get anything with any reasonable reliability. They don't seem to have any intention to fix that, and why would they? It would mean people won't buy crates.This has turned into a bit of a rant, so I'll end it here. You only need to glance at other reviews to see how downhill this game has gone, and it is only continuing its depressing descent with every new update.			"

												Very slow progress, with rewards being lower compared to costs the higher you go.  This is made worse by the fact that you need most of a decent setup together before you're likely to do well in a given tier, so if you want enjoyable games you're stuck in the tier below the gear you're grinding to get.Recently had an interest in playing the game again, but a quick skim of forums makes it pretty clear that the grind and buisness model is as bad as ever, possibly worse.

												Simply calling this WoT in space would be a crime. It is listed as an MMO but is nothing of the sort- yet. Right now its more of a Multiplayer Online Game with lobby based gameplay in team vs team or Team vs PvE gameplay modes. The game is still in Open Beta state as well and there's many changes being done here and there. I don't recommend buying into the game just yet unless you'll be comfortable with some possible MAJOR changes to the game. If you enjoyed space flight sims like X3, Freespace, Colony Wars, etc. then maybe this might satisfy an itch for competitive if at times unfair combat.The Bad, yes the bad. Match making can be really one sided, PvE matches can be set at higher Tier difficulty making new / lower tier ships feel helpless to complete them. Some of the cash shop items are priced a bit too high for how long they'll be useful to you.I stopped playing this game when The OBT patch v 0.8.0 went live, the patch was absolutely horrible and imbalanced, it also took the ""Flavor"" of faction ships away. The game pre 8.0 was absolutely awesome. I haven't seen anything since to make me go back to want to play it.IF you can stomach the bads, and the changes during this open beta then maybe Star Conflict might be for you.			"

												Personally, I WISH, I REALLY WISH I could recommend this game to people and ask them to play to max tier with me.However, I can't. Being from North America, that, unfortunately, almost instantly entails that I'll get the short end of the stick from Gaijin, who FREQUENTLY bans anyone on their forums who so much as say a single sentence bad about the devs.I love this game, only because I know what it used to be. Back in beta, I played this game as much as I could. It was hard, yes, but it was a lot of fun. Sure, there was the grindy nature of the MMO world in it, but it was FUN. You could jump in a game, and not have too many issues. Now, I enter a game, and unless I select the EXACT MISSION I want in PvE, or have the EXACT ships that many people are flying in PvP, I'm screwed. Last time I played, I PLAYED THE EXACT SAME DESTROYER PvE TWENTY-TWO TIMES. Not that I mind, but I like variety in my games.Destroyers really was the icing on the proverbial cake, which set off the powderkeg of their current state of Star Conflict.I can stomach MAYBE 30 minutes before I have to play something ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE so that I can get the taste of Star Conflict out. Honestly, unless you are willing to 1) FARMFARMFARM, 2) Get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you as soon as you join a new tier of ships, and 3) Watch as people kill you in open space simply because all support NPC ships are downright useless, then I recommend staying away.

												So yet so not werry positive review ! But hey nothing new right ?BTW sorry for my english im tired.so back to the question should i play this game .. if you enjoy hating yourself for playing for near no reward go ahead and try it ! But if you want to spend money in this game BE SURE TO FORGET TO DO THAT. Because your happines wont last that long ... maybe ... or maybe you just want to throw money at the monitor ..I played this game since CLOSED BETA.. It was great concept with good combat and it was fun i enjoyed every bit of it even if there were things that i really didnt enjoy ... then they made it even better in open beta  but then balance changed since there were most of the things broken .....but now for plot twist IT WASNT THE GAME THAT I ENJOYED ANYMORE. After it came out as full game it discusted me as how much the premium stuff you need to succeed . the whole concept of FREEMIUM GAME is kindof broken in this game if you want something you will most likely throw money at the screen before you know that you wasted your life trying to get something you really want instead of going free. Balance isues with destroyers , bugs , infinite grinding , weapons that just shouldnt even exist in this game ... it all ruins it for me .... BUT hey i still wasted time .. RIGHT ? also if you go premium this game is not cheap just warning so about to sum it up IF YOU WANT TO HATE WHAT HAPENED TO THE GAME OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN > then go ahead try it maybe like it it may be good if devs relise that they are doing something wrongGL and hate yourself			"

												Does anyone remember Decent or Forsaken? Games from the early days of 3D graphics and when you had a graphics card you were considered to have a powerful rig. The 6DOF genre came into existance and basically it took the normal strafing from games like Doom and Hexen but then added strafing in all directions. Since the game engines of the time couldn't handle open spaces very well, these early space-sims had you flying around corridors. Oddly enough it worked because it wasn't trying to capture the style of those movies with little ships zipping around amidst two fleets facing off against one another like we had seen in films like Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica. However, you also had the other kind of space battle seen in Star Trek with large capital ships slowly moving around each other in some kind of space version of the classic galleon vs galleon battles from the naval days of old. These were also very impressive and the size of the vessels themselves really wouldn't have looked right if they were zipping around and barrel-rolling this way and that. But with those large ship to ship battles the aim wasn't to hit the other ship since that was actually very easy, the aim was to hit specific parts of the ship to give you a tactical advantage. Weaken shields on this side/that side, knock out weapons/propulsion. It was more about managing the situation than needing to aim straight and that still made things interesting.So then, is Star Conflict more Star Wars or Star Trek? Well, not even the developers can decide and this has led to one of the most bizzare results I could have imagined. You see, unlike games such as Freespace or Strike Suit Zero the controls in SC allow for aiming with the mouse as you pilot the ship around. This is a novel idea but paradoxically it actually means that playing with a HOTAS flight-stick will severely handicap you. But further to this, the fighters and inteceptors handle like frigates with very tiny turning circles even at top speed as long as you're not using afterburners. This means the usual ballet that ensures as pilots in other games adjust their speed and pitch to line up shots is completely lost and the fact that you can mouse-aim removes all of the dog-fighting you'd expect from a space-sim. This control behavior has led to SC players actually not moving around at all. In fact, the best way to play this game is to park your ship behind some cover and peer around it taking shots at someone else. If you attempt to actually engage in a furball with another ship you basically end up in pieces very quickly because once you're at mid-range it is almost impossible for you to miss the other ship as you track it with your cursor while staying completely still.  It's like how you play Counter Strike, only people have been replaced by ships. The speed of the ships is also incredibly slow with the exception of the Inteceptors so evading incoming fire is a waste of time.The end result in many of these encounters becomes a bunch of ships hiding behind cover and very slowly strafing back and forth - even if they are lighter class ships. It just looks and feels wrong in every way when you see a tiny, sleek and agile looking fighter suspended almost motionless in space while sheepishly taking pot-shots from behind an asteroid.  For the larger class vessels however, this doesn't look or feel unusual but results in some very slow paced and tedious game of peek-a-boo in space. Star Conflict has almost created some wierd slow paced 6DOF game as a result and I really can't recommand it to anyone looking for a genuinely entertaining space-sim MMO.			"

												Visually pretty spectacular game got me in.BUT a confusing interface thats not for the casual gamer unless you like reading lots of stats..basically information overload just to select a ship.PVE is sort of fun, but PVP expect to get spanked unless you have high tier craft, paid money and have played a lot.There was only a couple of players on and after looking at the specs of the craft that killed me (many many times...lol). Yeah not noob friendly tier matching at all... (steam community confirms this sadly)So yeah don't bother.. there are other games that are easier to pick up and more probably more fun.			"

												I'm so sick of these pay to win games. Otherwise it's great, but for a poor schlub like me this is insanely unfair. I get the pay to win mentality, but they screw over everyone who's poor. I don't make much, and lucky if I have money to spare on myself or for just joy. So enter the free to play games. This one starts off strong but since the introduction of giant ships their mentality of parts being easily grabbed after missions was also bs. I'm tired of getting so engrossed into a game to find out i have to pour money into it just to progress. This is one of those games. You're skill will only get you so far, after that....you need money. Thier matmacking system is shot as well. Oh, you just got to level 6, lets fight level 12 enemies before you can upgrade your new weapons..............			"

												As a player with 8000+ pilot rating .I REALLY LOVE  this game . BUT I had to say ,this game is TERRIBLE .In the beginning,this game was so good,Just in the beginning.Since one updata, i cant remember which one .till now . the interceptor became more and more powerfull .So we called  this game Interceptor Conflict from then .Now the destroyers come out , this game became more imbalance  . more unplayable .Just like the title say : Age of DestroyerAlso .the server is so terrible .May be I'll change my mind when game becomes balance------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right .since players can buy the alien ship (YES ,i mean BUY ,use your money ,buy one ,not by manufacturing) ,this game became more imba , an alien ship can fight against more than 5 normal ships .im not kidding .In T5 PVP , one alien ship can kill you even without lose his shield . When you almost kill it ,it jump away ,and get back with max shield and hull in 5 seconds ,ha ,is funny isn't it? even 5 players lock on it ,but you just CAN NOT KILL IT !So ,this game is becoming more imbalance ,more unplayable ,I hope the Star Gem or Gaijin can balance it .

												The game forces you to jum between factions to upgrade things on a ship which seems silly.I don't see the point of the armoury, as you can not fit devices on to some ships, you have the menu on the ship for what does fit and you can upgrade them there.The PvE missions are too hard and force you to either wait until everyone dies or pay to spawn back in. And the missions can take some time with many stages.I feel that the Pay to Win might factor into the strength of some combats too much.			"

												After a few thousands hour playing this game and following the development for a couple of years, I can say that the game is just going into a more and more unbalanced state every patch and everything that is OP is either behind a pay or a grind wall or just no accesable anymore coz reasons. Examples:Phoenix: Premium Engie with OP drones that don't switch to healing when the shield is doneThar'Ga: Alien Gunship behind a ridicilous Grind Wall with an imense DMG Output while being fast and durable, the only thing that this ship is bad in is healingVigilant, Sirius, Tyrant: only T5 Destroyers but can't be build anymore and where behind a grindwall beforeDart, Gargoyle: OP Premium Ships that were behind a paywall but are not avaible anymore-----So much for the Balancing in this game, but the new changed Sector mode is clearly showing what the devs want from this game: quantity, not quality, You get an sector if your corp is bigger then another but you don't have to be better and the devs also increased only a few month ago the maximum size of a Corporation so that Corp leaders can spend more money for their roster...I could write so more points about  what is going wrong in this game, but I think it is better if I just stop...Or just read Gizmo.mac's review, hes hitting the nail right on the head with his discription on how this game is going atm.

												Not a bad game but the wait times between matches will have you falling asleep before each match starts. the wait times are genarally around 4-7 minutes or more, depending on how many people are playing. And they recently changed the match system so now the matches can be highly unbalanced at times. One match i was in there were 0 kills on one side. (It was a massacre!!!).

												Fun game, free to play.To win at this game it's all about chance that your ship type can counteract any other player's ship in the game & maxing out all modules to the highest level in order to get an advantage.***-NOTE: Before you play this game you should know that it has a lack of funding & the game & in-game chat is moderated by regular biased players who are *NOT PAID OR TRAINED IN-HOUSE STAFF* who are given total unchecked authority to mute & censor anybody they please in the game's chat with moderation powers granted by the devs. The unpaid moderation staff break the rules all the time & arbitrarily mute & ban players for houres & sometimes up to weeks at a time if they felt you did something to them on a person level that they didn't like, without any regard to the actual rules written. The appeals system for these regular players arbitrarily censoring & banning you is grossly ineffective as you cannot chat or reply back in any way in-game or on the game making in game appeals to other unpaid moderators or devs in-game to appeal your cencorship or ban impossible. Other alternatives are signing up to their forum & contacting a moderator there to review your cencorship, but more often than not you cannot reach them at a modest time & your censorship/ban has already ended-expired because you werent able to contact them quick enough.This is an extremely unjust moderation system & I have never seen this in any other game I have played in my entire life, there is automatic anti-spam filters, & automatic anti-curseword filters to prevent bad behavior on this game that the dev's rulebook says you cannot be banned or cencored for these counts of rulebreaking, but their unpaid team of regular player's with moderation powers ban you for these counts anyhow & thus ending up breaking the rules themselves in this regard often enough. When you are banned or cencored you are also never informed of what offence you have 'done wrong' or anything of the sort. You are just banned out of the blue (I've woken up & logged on without days of palying before to find out I've been cencored fo near 6+ days before without any kind of warning from devs or unpaid mods alike or anything telling you what offence you comitted/or did wrong which is not only total clueless injustice to the player playing this game, but it is total blind sabotage to their own system promoting the offender to go out & 'offend' again unknowingly & do the same thing wrong again because he was never properly told what he did wrong.)(You also dont know which official dealt it out either so you dont know who to watch out for/behave extra well around either which also promotes repeat offences as well). I have inquired both the lead administrator who is presumably paid on their game's forum, the unpaid moderation team members, & devs alike how their game's cencorship/& moderation is dealt out & I am told it really just amounts to sheer numbers of reports (So you beat somebody in-game they dislike this, they call you a name or something right, you respond back, even if you didn't do anything wrong, if the reporter or other people combined/or separate over the total net worth of reports is more reports on your head than it is on yours, you will be banned. The unpaid moderators are not impartial, they do not look for truth in both sides of the reports, & they ban simply based on sheer numbers towards 1 side, weather the side with the most reports is right or wrong which promotes mass reporting to have people you dislike banned from the game.). There are 2 general kinds of bans on this game, regular player ban (for exploiters/hackers), & cencorship/chat ban.In order to regular-ban somebody form playing the dev suggesting ban or mod sugegsting ban need to get an overall agreement on it at a meeting w/ all the devs. The chat bans are dealt out & totally not answerable to anybody.A mod could ban you & aside from him & you he'd be the only one who knows about it. Devs/mods can look up ban history & review bans but its still a death sentence because you're cencored & all the dev sees is a reported/banned-for out of context comment, & only the mod's half of the story. You dont get a fair appeal or your side of the story exposed.I like this game, it's a good game, but I havenever seen such a corrupt/abusive ineffective moderation system like this ever before in my entire life. This game is a 100% total appalling inefficient travesty in this regard. Moderation on this game really shouldn't be used at all since it's all automated, in-game grudges ruins an otherwise fine game because regular players have moderation powers on here.-***Don't let above^ review discourage you from downloading this game, it's a good game, it's totally balanced & it's well designed in terms of a company that's got moderate-to-low-funding, & it is worth playing.This is no pay to win game either. I have purchased lots of $ worth of their in-game DLC purchasable ships & for the most part they are not at all end-game totally unbeatable over pwoered ships, by playing free you can equal the premiuum ship's capabilities & power it just takes you more game time to do it (Which is the catch of course, premium just lets you get stronger stuff faster, as opposed to just unbeatable storng stuff in general/period.).I do recommend you play this game & purchase some DLC (If you want to, again playing free can equal paid for ships ^^^as said above), & this game is fine as it is & it's worth playing, it's a good game. However the moderation system on this game is very very extremely appalling & if it weren't for this very very horrible system of moderation that lets regular player's in-game bias & team death match grudges ruin your time & experience on this game because they abuse & take it out on other players, this game would be absolutely 100% fine.I have played this game for 1,200 legitimate hours worth, & I have purchase some of the developer's in-game premium DLC this is not some angry rant or biased report leaning either way on soe short-term weak whim, I have been around the community the moderation methods & the gameplay for thousands of hours worth over the course of 9 months or more I do know what goes on on this game in its entirety.So long story short;Is this a good game?: YesShould you play this game?: YesIs this game balanced?: YesIs this game pay-to-win?: NoAre there multiple/well varied game modes in this game?: YesIs this game worth spending my money on?: Yes, if you like the game enoughIs the game's community in general alright/polite/nice?: Yes, there are always bad eggs on every game just don't run into a bad egg with moderation powers on this game in particular.If I had 1 thing to comment/say to the devs behind this game it would be this:I don't see why this game needs any moderation at all everything is automated so every 'punishable' offence is covered. I've seen games without any moderation filters or moderation staff at all what so ever do perfectly fine. The payless staff just abuse on players whenever they feel like it or if they get mad over a multiplayer match in-game, they just ruin a game that would be 100% fine without this.I really hope you fix this problem it's a complete massive & unecissary blight on the game at large, & thanks.

												While the core gameplay is fantastic (I'd describe it as World of Tanks IN SPACE with a little RPG thrown in) it's ultimately undone by the absolutely insipid progression system.Basically before you can progress to a certain tier you need to have purchased a certain number of ships from the previous ones, meaning you're constantly getting dragged back to play low-tier ships you don't care about to unlock more low-tier ships to buy so that the game will arbitrarily allow you to progress to the next ship you actually want to play.Well, until you want to go to the next tier anyway, then you get to do it all over again with those other low-tier ships you just unlocked to unlock even more ships! Oh, and what Tier you are is seperate for each of the three factions, so you have to do all this three times over!It's definitely worth at least a look, but don't invest more than a few dollars in it (if that). I'm at Tier 9 right now, and while I enjoy the gameplay every time I consider trying to progress I quickly find myself thinking ""That's what, 5-6 different ships I'd have to grind up? F*ck that!""

												I enjoyed this game to the point when i ran into the ""buy more ships"" ranking system. Not only does this game force you to essentially play all 3 races in order to get race tokens to upgrade with (or wait and hope for a kit to drop) but also it makes it mandatory for you to level up other ships just for the sake of advancing your choice of role.In essence: You want to play medic (engineer)? Sure son, level up heavy, sniper and spy for it. So not only do i have to level up the synergy of the engineer branch, but hey, just to make sure you play for a long long time: Level up EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES, because thats how you advance your one single chosen role.I like the game, good graphic, enjoyable battles, good weapons, interesting ship tweaking and so on, but leveling up a branch is hard on its own. The moment you understand that you basically need to level up everything: Its gone. There is in no god damn way enough diversity in this game to justify 999999999999999999 hours till you max out basically everything, and then we still didnt speak a damn thing about rare crafting mats and what not.This software makes a korean farming simulator look like a cozy little stroll in the park on a warm spring afternoon.

												I want to like this game, I really do.I like the graphics. I like the dueling, and some of the maps are really challenging. Progression if you spend a little money is not too slow.The problem lies in three directions: 1) most of the players and servers are in Europe or Russia. If you live in the USA, maybe won't be too bad. But playing from Taiwan, I'm getting 500+ ping and rubberbanding anytime I play past Tier 1 (the lvl 1-3 ships). Sure there's a southeast asia option, but 10 queues later, I get an average of 1-2 games out of 10 that are located here. After 5 minutes I get drafted into another Russian game.2) The synergy build is geared to make you spend money. Sure there's a feeling of building up ships and weaponry as progression, but when you've finally maxed out all the stats on one ship, that means you ought to move on to another ship, or else waste all that ship exp/spend money to move it to ""free synergy.""3) PvE is a ridiculously hard compared to PvP. Invasion mode is not bad, but the rewards are terrible. The PvE missions require a high amount of coordination, so unless you have 3 other friends that want to play, forget about those. And then you're left with just PvP.. against other people at 500 ping.I want to like this game, but the way it's set up is making it impossible to.***EDIT: also, not enough English-speakers around.

												I have invested nearly 800 hours into this game and bought all of the DLC, and I have to say I am severely disappointed. I have watched the community slowly divide while the developers push out more and more greedy updates. The drop rate of Berylium was the final straw for me. Your opinion means nothing to the developers unless you are funding half of the team with your purchases alone. Until the developers get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and start listening to the community, don't come anywhere near this game.Edit: In an old review I dug up, ST_Team (the official steam profile of the Star Conflict developers) told a reviewer who said much the same thing as I did that ""we always listen to the community, but sometimes they aren't right""It would seem, however, that the community has never been right, as I have yet to see or hear of an update even minorly influenced by the playerbase. Gaijin/Stargem essentially told us ""♥♥♥♥ off, your opinion isn't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;			"

												SoOverall this is a good game. Nice mechanics, nice graphics, good level of detail.There is one tweak, though. The game gives you very limited opportunities to earn the synergy which is required basically for almost everything in the game. Not to mention ship repairs and ammunition refills. And without your ship repaired and rockets to fire - guess what, you cannot fly out there and provide a good result in the battles.Glad there is one way to fix that - money. That's right, pay al least 4,5 usd for a small bundle and here you go - repair your ship, buy ammo, spend it on everythnig and anything you want.So, short to say, it is kinda free and gool up to the moment you come short on synergy and stop enjoying the game.p2wEdit: Oh, did I also mentioned that matchmaking is waaaaay crappy?

												Star Conflict features excellent ship designs and maintains a high graphical fidelity. However, the gameplay feels stale and overly repetitive. It didn't catch my interest the little time I got around to playing it.			"

												I played this game for a good while back before all of this open space stuff came out.I've got several rank 7 ships and many below that.I took out one of my better ships into the world in my first attempt at undocking.What I found was just a lot of emptyness and confussion.The missions seem to go from ""go pick up fuel and go kill this weak ship which dies in one hit"" to ""go have a dogfight with 10 ships that don't take any dmg from your weapons and all gang up on you and wreck you in two second, just so you can lose more money in the process""There is this mind bogglingly stupid fuel system where you lose about a 4th of your fuel making jumps into new sections of space.Which sounds bad enough knowing you can't go more than two jumps out or you're stranded.But the worst part about it is you lose fuel just flying in empty sections of space as well.So, in the end you have 3 jumps, one of which needs you be to your home system.Fear not though!For the low price of 1.25 cents worth of in game currency, you can transport back to the hanger! (it costs this much each time if you do it, no matter how far away you are)The fast way home is to of course die, which drains your money obviously.When this game was just pve missions and pvp quick play, I never felt like I needed to spend hours grinding or throw money at the game for success.But now it feels like I have an anchor attached to my ship.Each gate is 10-20 km out from the last, and it takes a minute or two just to fly to each of them in a decent ship.The missions only seems suited to tankier classes of ships as well so far, which means loss of fuel, loss of time, loss of fun.I convinced myself to redownload this game just today, and I didn't quit the game because I didn't like it either, I had just moved on to other things after 80+ hours of play time.But now I'm finding it frustrating, confusing, and just generally a slog.Been in now for almost 3 hours, and the most fun I've had so far was looking at all of my old ships.Sadly 90% of them can't do diddly out in space anymore, and every single action I make prompts a pay option to win. (even an option to respawn out in the world for real life money as well)I'm going to keep giving this a shot, but I gotta say, unless they take out this stupid fuel system, speed up travel time, add quick jumping, and stop punishing you every single time you die (TAKE OUT AMMO AND REPAIR COSTS YOU SADISTS) then I would tell you to just not play this.Even the people who currently like this model have more money than brains, and I can just picture the devs rubbing their hands together in joy at all the microtransaction money.500 dollars worth of DLC?What a joke.

												The matchmaking is horrendous. My understanding of the matchmaking process is that if you're in a group then it tries to match you with a group that's similar to your own. This results in 10-20+ minute wait times for matchmaking when the game states the average wait time is less than a minute.No thanks. I'm not going to waste my time waiting for this game to match me up despite how much I enjoyed it.			"

												Nice game with nice visuals and pretty good gameplay for a space shoot em up but has a few problems. The game brags about PVE, but the PVE is terrible and most of the PVE stuff is over within minutes.The PVP is even worse, the ques get longer and longer as more and more desert the game, the estimate is around 1k playerbase left so if you do manage to get into one then expect every enemy to have all purples etc, not fun.One gripe is that the grind is way too much, but the biggest problem is the cost for this FTP game, to do anything will cost you your ingame emblems, you will quickly run out of these so you are more or less left with no choice but to keep purchasing them. There is a cost for everything, from putting a pic on your character to changing the flag you unlocked.I like the game but it is the greedy over charge for everything you click that drags it down and completely ruins the experience.Yes you can even pay to win, a little ship can cost you £50 but when you use this ship you have to pay emblems again to have the xp from it that you earn, so you have to pay more everytime you use a ship you already paid for.Too much greed so i would actually avoid this unless you like to pay to respawn, and yes this game has that.EDIT:The is dead as a dodo, move on and try something like Dreadnought or somthing similiar, this one is now completely dead.

												I loved this game quite a while ago. And even let myself be lured into investing some money into it...Yes, they are pretty good at doing that to  you and your wallet. I did not mind back then and was happy with the experience I got for my money. I took a break of more than a year from the game. Lately I felt the urge to enjoy the game again...yea...stupid me...To summarize it in one sentence: Holy f*ck, what the hell did they do to this game?!?!?!It used to be bearable, but now this game has become pay2win beyond belief. Normally a player hits a grinding wall in this kind of games. At that is what Star conflict WAS like and as said: it was bearable.With the recent updates, things have changed:Now the grind/pay wall hits you instead, pursues you, hits you even more, then tramples on you, rips your ribcage open and rapes your guts.And if you still do not want to pay after that, then apply the above to other players who have paid after tier6.

												I haven't played the game in a while, but during the time I had played it the experience was rather fun. It's just there was too much premium stuff in the game and I knew it wasn't going to hold a strong player base. A few friends agreed on that part based on their experience too. It was pretty fun to play back then, but I'm not sure how this game's future is looking.(Review may change based on my experience after giving it another go.)EDIT: It's not too bad, but it doesn't feel the way it used to. If you plan to play this I suggest do it with friends.			"

Product received for free
												Great game play and beautiful visuals... if you don't mind NEVER being in battle during early stages of play or at least enough to level-up so you can explore 'free space'. In-app purchases and needing to use real money to buy game money takes-away from what could be a really good game overall - I guess that's why it's free to play.This game was exciting to start, and exciting in the trailers; however sadly a true dissapointment after seven hours across two days of experience within.

												There's just too much grinding that people aren't willing to put up with, And after you're done grinding..... there isn't much reward to be honest. Sure you can start up a corporation named Fugworld invest $150 into it and get it into the top 30 ranked corporations and get to the max tier of ships ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE GAMES COMMUNITY IS BASICALLY DEAD, DO NOT go into this game expecting to get alot out of it. I WANTED to love this game as it's made by the same company who made Warthunder! A game that I have 1300+ hours in! I just can't recommend this game due to the current state of it's community.. I LOVE how well it does open space exploration though..... I still can't recommend you playing it though. There are other games worth your time			"

												This is an AMAZING game, good graphics, great and thrilling fire fights, and excellent controls...when it is actually working! This damn game crashes whenever ANYTHING happens, whether it be a miner mod update for another game, you get a steam message, you transition from the Hangar to  battle or a battle to the Hanger, and if you can somehow get into a battle than it'll, and in the midst of being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥i DID calculate this, ""5.8"" times per battle. And the amazing stunning gameplay is nothing more than a taunt to make you angrier in the end. I love this game but hate it all the same so im afriad ill have to give it a thumbs down. I would also like to point out im playing on a top of the line computer with a fully updated operating system. I guess you could atleast test the game and if you don't have these problems than GREAT! good for you. I suggest reading the other reviews along with this one, after all this is just my personal one.			"

												Great Free to Play Space Battle Game. Many say ""World of Tanks in space"", they say that because of the following things in common : Ships organised in 3 Factions and Tech Tree, 10 minute PvP Fights (in WoT it's 20 min), Synergy gain (in WoT Experience), Clans, and a Conquest map. That is not something original or specific only to World of Tanks, but because it is so popular, that may be a reason for many to say this is WoT in space, i personally don't know. But what i do know, is that this game is fast entertainment, as soon as you hit Battle, and fight, you just enjoy it.✓Graphics✓Gameplay✓Sound✓Players✓PvE (Not in WoT :P)✗Corporations(Clans) don't have their own page in game, when you search trough them you got no APPLY button, they don't have description so you could see who can you contact to get in, hell not even displaying the leader of the clan, so you could contact him. I really don't know why, but only way you can get in a corp, is by waiting for someone to recruit on global chat, and speak with them, no other means of contact, sad thing.✗Full synergy ships, should get more credits and/or free synergy(like in WoT :D), at least 20% bonus, but they don't do anything special, only adding to your Fleet Strenght (a percentage based on fully synergysed ships that makes you get more synergy)✗There is no method (or no easy to spot method) of contacting the Devs about the upper 2 problems, or whatever inovation you want to suggest. There is a Q@A section on the official forum... ALL CLOSED, yeah :|✗The time to enter a battle either solo or with party, takes some time (~ 5 minutes) and there are some times when it can get to 10 minutes.Other that that this is an entertaining game, which could get you 50 hours easy, BUT, any more than that and you can get bored, depends on you and your personality, but because of that Clan contacting problem, if you are not lucky to find yourself some mates, you will eventually get bored. Try getting some friends to play with you, I mean it's freaking free, what they got to loose :)Why do i say it gets boring? It's kinda grindy and repetitive, so that might get you sooner or later, it's not so very complex, but it's fun for what it is. That 'repetitive stuff' is kinda entertaining and fun, but as i said, you won't probably play this a lot, except if you got friends to play with, or a clan with nice mates.Even with it's flawss, i still recommend this game, because i consider it fun to play.

												Exact same timesink as World of Tanks.Game matchmaker for this and WoT feels more like a science experiment on time management. Fun till you hit t7 then gameplay mimics the matchmaker of grind to play games.Every game deserves a fair review so for other players new to the grind to play match making system. The game is fun. WoT in space is a great idea. The ship variety is excellent. The graphics and game design and game modes are excellent. I especially like defend the commander recon mode. The reason I did not recommend the game is the match maker.After playing last night, I analyzed an 11 game losing streak. Unlike WoT I accumulated some in game currency. I have not hit t8 or higher so that is a plus (its not worse than WoT). T7 ships are cool so playing them without worry of paying to stay in game is notable. WoT you lose money at high tiers and have to grind your lower tier tanks to keep in the high tier game (or spend money). I dropped $10 into this game. Good money well spent (mercenary pack). $10 for a fun game is worthwhile for the extras from the on sale poack. I will keep playing but limit my time in game because of the match making ""formula"".     The 11 game losing streak  felt exactly like WoT. All my scores were average. Some scores high some scores low but overall in the losing streak my gameplay was average and at t7 I was usually the low man on the teams.You hit winning streaks and losing streaks just like WoT. They are not random. The gameply design is to keep you playing the game. Then you realize you have to beat the system. When you have to beat a system and a match maker is not random, it does not feel like a game.That is why the recommendation to other players is a no.World of Battles had an excellent system for matchmaking and pvp games. The developers can look at WoB fororiginal in game economy ideas. Copying or utilizing the match making game economy of WoT drove me away permanently from WoT as a hobby.			"

												While the game itself is somewhat well-rounded, fun, and so forth. The developers -Very- frequently ask you to pay Galactic Standards (Real money game currency) for almost every action aside from purchasing (Most) weapons, ships, and so forth. I feel the game asks this far to frequently. Galactic Standards are required to transfer Synergy (Ship Experience, basically) from one ship into the central pond, called Free Synergy. You cannot customize your ship's appearence whatsoever without paying Galactic Standards either. I once purchased a Black color for one of my ships to also find that 1. I could not make any other ship black. 2. When I removed that permenant black color I had purchased to see if I could switch it to another ship, it locked me out of it again, and asked me to pay the required 110 Galactic Seals all over again. You can also purchase Premium 'Liscenses' to get the -FULL- amount of Experience and Credits from each round you play, instead of having it reduced by 25% without said liscense, these liscenses also expire over time. The game is good, the payment requirements to do anything are, however: absurd, foolish, a turn off, and several other unhappy things I could name, end rant there. The game does offer 'Premium' ammunitions and other forms as well-you can also exchange Galactic Seals for Credits, allowing the whole of the game atmosphere to be seen in a very Pay To Win atmosphere. If you don't mind this as much (Thankfully the Premium ammo/etc are semi balanced with the standard ammunitions and so forth), and you solely want this game for its gameplay? Then Star Conflict might be a good addition to your game repertoire, the 'Pay for Freedom' in the game that I see however isn't going to call me back anytime soon, unfortunately.			"

												Recommended to downloadI downloaded this game last night around 6PM and got off at 12AM, 6 hours of gameplay and my first loss was when I became rank 4, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because when your rank 4 the PvP matchmaking is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ but still, here are my Pros and Cons (A crap list).Pros:- Amazing graphics performance- Great movement system- Smart quests/missions- Amazing teir systems (Kind of like World of Tanks)- Great ideas with the weapon and ability systems- Fantastic gameplay- Great PvE missionsCons:- Broker quest's is confusing and half the people have no idea what the hell to do- Premium ships kinda make it pay to get good as well as DLC Ships- Destroyers are annoying especially when your a low rank and getting juan shot by some laser gun- Confusing store- Matchmaking over rank 4 is screwed- The fact that players have to get to rank 6 just to go into a nice open world- Landing on your gear seems to damage you a bit, I think we should beable to land freely- Maps have an 'Ok' detail, not much buildings but a bunch of rocks- Getting those coin thingy's should be gotton daily than having to buy them with real money.- PvE rocketeers are too op, infinite missles that never stop is pretty annoying which can screw us over.- The PvE map where we defend 3 points around a broken ship area and has that boss with like 12 lasers on its front is annoying, the boss can easily kill you because its lasers just never stop firing, making it a 10 second aimbot kill.- We have a voicechat system yet no one uses it, which pisses me off so I think voice chat should be autoenabled and have people talk more. It feels like playing world of warplanes where no one talks but you.---------------------------------All in all this game has a bit of problems but the game is just full on great, I would recommend downloading it and giving it a few hours of gameplay.

												This game has a realy good gameplay.Since mid of 2015 this game sadly got a realy bad interface. I tried it multible times since then but its get worse every update. The core game is still really great, but its a mess to play this game.As an example: the ship level system did not change but they change the ship overview from ""left to right"" to ""top to bottom"". This view makes an overview over all your ships nearly impossible. In consusion: every time I start this game, I want to quit it immediately because of the bad interface it got over the updates :(I still love the gameplay and I hope this game will get a good interface again such that is makes fun to play it.

												I love the idea of a derivative of Descent: Freespace. The graphics are perfect for a space shooter (though first-person cockpit would be nice). The main problem is the clunky controls. If you're going to write Linux software, you have to account for the fact that DirectInput is NOT supported; that's Microsoft technology. You would find the joystick under /dev/input/js# , # being which one. It's no fun flying with a mouse and keyboard. I doubt any serious flight simmer would spend money on decent hardware for it just to be put on the shelf. Fortunately, I have X-Plane, MSFS, Descent, and a few others.			"

												Nice game but...From what I can tell, the community kinda sucks now. I never get protection in the ships that need protection.  And from what I heard, the devs are making bad decisions. Don't know what specifically.My friend enjoys it, but I just don't see why if you NEVER GET PROTECTED LIKE WTF.Overall, Elite Dangerous: Arena is better than this to put money into. Atleast there you don't absolutely require the team to not be idiots... Infact, most people there aren't. And its HOTAS support is better than this game's.tl;dr don't pay money on this game. If you enjoy it somehow, good for you, but if you plan on paying money, I'd pay for ED:A instead unless your preference is strictly the PVE stuff in this game.			"

												Can't recommend this game.It's a shame really, because although it has great art design, amazing combat and flight mechanics and some really enjoyable game modes, it's clearly pay-to-win, very expensive in that and the new ship types, weapons and modules - wich are pretty hard to obtain for newer and F2P pilots - are ridiculously overpowered and can ruin the overall experience with this game very quickly.If you are a skilled pilot, can hook up with a successful corporation and don't mind to invest a considerable amount of money and time into this game, you might end up enjoying it.But personally, I don't think it's worth it.

												This game has some seriouse matchmaking isues, I will let others explain the good things but I will write this review about some of the bad things.First of all, getting in a game just takes too long. I ended up waiting 5 minutes just to get into a game that lasted 2.Second, this game is obviously pay2win in multiplayer, so far every game I've been in was full of players with dlc weapons or weapons that they shouldnt have at their rank. People were killlng me with guns that did 12,000 damage a shot when mine dont even do 2,000, So clearly the devs need to do something about that. I would much rather wait an extra minute to get into a game againts people I can beat instead of getting destroyed by kids who begged their parents for money.So I tried some PVE, which was worse. it took around 6 minutes for me to get into a game and when I did nobody knew what they were doing. So it was either PVP which is p2w or PVE which was noob fest.So in conclusion I do not recommend this game unless they do something about the p2w multiplayer and fix matchmaking times.			"

												This game has so much potential but falls short. Great looking graphics and a fun concept for a game. The biggest downfalls are the PVP. There seems to be no sort of matchmaking involved. If you're new to the game you'll be dropped into battle with ships that can knock out your shields with a single round from their guns and destroy you with the second because they are two or three levels higher than you with guns and shields way more powerful than you.The only time there is ""matchmaking"" is when you and a friend form a group and try to do PVP. Then you'll set there for 20 minutes waiting for the game to try and pair you against another group of the same levels. And the enemy has to have a group that matches your group, not solitary players that happen to be playing at the same time. for example, if the enemy team is made of up 5 solitary players, your group won't get put into that game. Not unless at least two of those enemy players are in a group together that matches the levels of your group. Also, you're allowed three people in a group or squad, but you cannot play PVP with a squad of three, only two. There are Player Versus Enemy missions but some of your ship upgrades cost tokens only received from doing missions by playing PVP. So then you're forced into the very lopside PVP arena			"

If you haven't started playing already, just don't. It's not worth starting it at this point.The problems it has are not unfixable, in fact, many solutions have been offered that (if the devs would listen) would make the game amazing! but that's where the problem lies: They know, they hear, and they say ""who cares? buy premium xaxaxaxa""would be an amazing game if it had Star Citizen's development team.

												This game used to be great! I would have recomended it back in 2015 and early 2016.But then they added destroyers. Huge ships that have massive amounts of health and do insane damage at insane range.  Want one? Well it's going to take weeks of hardcore grinding to build, sorry. ); Oh, and you're going to have to time travel back a few months if you want to build the best destroyers. They're inaccessible now. They're also in every match so have fun fighting them!

												I'm only a few hours in and I can smell the P2W a mile away.It seems there's an upgrade discrepancy. Upgrading takes time and resources or you can put in $$$ and get it done immediately. Thusly, a game with a fun layout turns into ""mom and dad's credit card"" slugfest. Another (personally at least) issue is the fact that the game quite literally shows you where to shoot to damage individuals. There's no guessing game as to where you need to place your cursor to lead onto targets. Kind of spoils the entire fun really and basically assures that no matter what kind of engagement both sides will be taking losses (unless your motor skills are just slightly better than a spider monkey's and can't follow a small circle's general direction). This also makes it feel like there's little to no maneuvers that one can do to try and mitigate damage....Which brings us to the next problem. Upgrading gives ships health. So not only do you have more damage you also have more health. And since previously stated it is very difficult to mitigate damage (besides trying to play peek-a-boo with a floating celestial body) it makes it almost nearly mandatory to keep on your person a health kit unless you're just that type of ""team player"" that enjoys the skills that make each ship unique. Thus, every battle feels sort of spam spam spam instead of taking each tactical role and applying it.Then again, it might be better in the later stages/levels but honestly I'm just not ""wow'd"" enough past the paygrind to try and get there.Don't get me wrong, it's a good game just to pick up every now and then and shoot some AI ships or shoot some player ships go pew pew. But I am already seeing a pattern with how much ingame currency you get vs how much gets chewd up by the game's Uncle Sam: the Repair Bill.			"

You can outright buy the most overpowering ships at level 1, and dominate anyone else you play with.It's like comparing a mosquito to a pterodactyl. It ruined the game in War Thunder, and it's going to ruin this one too. Too bad. This game seemed really fun at first.			"

												A fun game at first, with crisp play control and decent graphics, Star Conflict quickly loses focus with major gaps in ship power starting at Tier 2.  From Tier 3 and on, if you aren't a paying player, you have an uphill climb to get enough money/upgrades/synergy to make yourself as powerful as the next guy.  If you've used the cash shop in this game, you know how utterly effortless the game can become.  You have the most powerful upgrades and ships, and you WILL dominate.  Skill IS a factor, however, and it takes immense skill to dominate Tier 5 even once you've maxed your upgrades. (through thousands of boring pvp battles, each the same as the last)  The playerbase is largely European and Russian, and queue times for a US player can suffer after dark because of this.  You do have the option to play on Russia/EU/China servers, but they are notoriously laggy and unreliable unless you come from that area.The short of it is that as a Free to Play game, I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.  It's a grueling trek uphill, a neverending reminder of how much more OP you'd be if you just spent 20 dollars or so.  Though, if you like the idea of putting 60-100USD into it, this can be one of the most enertaining games you could ever play.			"

												This could be a cool game but its ultimately too buggy and too hard to get into the actual game right now.I tried to queue for pve and pvp several times and got in less than half the time.  I got to play through a few pve missions,  but half the time my teammates lagged out or quit leaving us out gunned in our level one newbie ships.  I never managed to get into pvp--the queue either quit on me our went on for 5+ minutes with no game found.I finally gave up on the game when I queued for a game but got stuck outside of it.  My ships were in a battle, but I was stuck in the hangar until the game finished.  Apparently this was the games punishment mode for leaving a battle; your ships are locked until the mission or fight finishes,  That isn't a bad idea except that I was stuck for 15+ minutes not even able to queue because of a bug.Maybe if they polish this up a bit I'll try it in a few weeks, but in its current state this game isn't worth playing.

												This used to be a good game. Back in 2013 when it was at it's prime, I would've certainly recommended it. Now, I can't. I'll keep it simple and cut to the point;-Requires a ♥♥♥♥ ton of grinding.It seems with every update, it requires more grinding. That burns the fun out of the game eventually.-Devs NEVER listen to the playerbase suggestions. This is a huge problem that 98% of the players have. The devs have claimed to listen to our ideas on the fourms, but it's clear they're lying. There have been many good ideas that would make the game much better, that could be added. Yet they never do even if they claim they will. -Abusive Gm's/admins. Basically, they're either absent most of the time and let tons of rules be broken, or they're there and chat ban people who aren't doing anything wrong or breaking rules.-Server Lag.In all honesty, if they spent more time adding more servers, and making the ones they already have more stable, that alone would make the game a thousand times better.  There's like, 8 RU servers, 4 EU, and like... 2 US. Not enough, not stable. -Lottery Style Bundles. It's a Free to play, so of course they need money. Sure. But the bundles have a CHANCE of giving you the things they advertise, instead of a guarantee. It's a waste. -Matchmaking.Due to other issues players have, alot of people quit at rank 7, 8, or 9. This is the reason for the small playerbase, and terrible matchmaking -- most of the time the game can't find someone to match you against. I smell a Domino Effect.TL:DR -- Devs are braindead, and don't care about the players. Admins are HIGHLY abusive. Game is as money grubbing as EA. Matchmaking is bad. Server number is small and stability is poor. And last but not least, it's all fun and games until things turn Russian.  "

Ships really vary in abilities and strategy you have to use to succeed in battles.But the game is a hollow shell, with just a few small maps that you play over and over again. Nothing else there.The free space roaming part is a complete lie. Its just that - a completely aimless drifting thru few interconnected maps with >nothing< in them to do. No missions, nothing.I feel a bit bad for giving this game a thumb down, because I had a week of fun for free with it, but if I should ultimately choose whether the game is good or bad, I go with .. useless.

												This game was pretty sweet, untill they updated the game several times in the last months.Now it basicly trows features at you where in reality you'll end up paying or seriously grinding the game, some are even purchase only items while they are advertised as a 'balancing item'.Beyond that, PvP is the only gamemode worth your time. PvE is pretty steep when you're low level and almost absurdly easy when you're leveled, and in PvE there are 3 difficulties depending on your level, so you'll end up experiencing it 3 times.Open space has been balanced so pretty much whatever enemy you encounter will own you. Loads of people will then say you need light nimble craft to fly in open space, in other words, forget about using you leveled frigate there (incase you only unlocked frigates .. you're screwed).PvAI* was pretty fun since the AI spawned in ships roughly equal to your level. It was said this was too easy and would be fun if they could lenghten the mission, so the devs did, by making you fight ships 5-6 levels above your own. Now PvAI means you'll need to team up to take down an AI ship, but since they also team up (somewhat) you're better off expecting to die. If I want to die I'll just play PvP, and just PvP does not make for a good game, at least not in this game, imo.*PvAI = like PvP, but vs AI controlled ships, not the same as PvE			"

Lots of players (over 95% of them, proof ingame!) are quitting very early after less then 10h. You can have hope that the next update will add sth awesome but it will add less then 1% of players exceptions.This is how I vote this game:4/5 - Graphic, look, interface0/5 - Teamplay, Esport, pvp, balancement1/5 - openplay, sandbox, custom content, api etc0/5 - Premium content0/5 - Community, friendship, wiki etc+*ship improvements, upgrades etc*around 150 free ships*technology tree like in warthunder or world of tanks*free to play sci-fi space game (but without physics etc)*have Oculus Rift option, but I never tested it here*interface looks very nice-*unfriendly for new players*if you are a new players, you will wait for over 30 minutes in queue for a single 3-5 minute match*from my account: ""time in game: 7days 22hours"" and this ""time in battle: 2days 16hours"" - 66% of time spent is just waiting for a match*most of ships looks very bad*phisics in this game doesn't exist*not esport friendly at all, and with that content and balancement will NEVER be!*lots of unbalanced content, I have over 85% win rate if I decide to pickup unbalanced ships+weapons, and those things weren't fixed for years, every update fked balancement more*braindead devs, im agree with that too (who dont?)*they wanted to make an awesome teamplay game, but they made an dynamicless campful games*luck of community made wiki etc, maybe becouse this game isnt worth it, volunteers wont made wiki for sth like this*very low amount of configuration options, you can't configure your hud except for few minimal things*open space is very, very bad. It isn't ""open"" at all!*PVE missions are made without any nice idea*premium content is very unbalanced, many pay2win, with extremally sick prices, it's better to buy other game then 1 ship in this game*ships movement, manuvering etc is a joke, easy to learn but slow and annoying*very unfriendly pvp modes (read: braindead devs)*very monotony gameplay, this game doesnt grow, updates adds less then 1% of player's expectations*this game is full of vetarans whose accepted all those bad things*devs dont care about community, they only listening to few veterans			"

												Good game as long as you do not mind a long grind.  The gameplay and selection of ships is great.   Worked great on linux, until march of 2016.  Now it wont even run and there is no easy fix as of yet.  This is also not the first time I have had problems with this game   With that being said i cannot recomend that money be spent on a game that you may not be able to play the next time you go to log in.  The support from the devs is my biggest issue it may be six months more befor they address the issue seriously.  If they ever get their ducks in a row and handle their programing issues better i may return.  But for now i cannot recomend.  This is one of the only game on linux I have a problem with all others work flawlessly wether it's on steam, POL, or wine.			"

												Star Conflict is a free to play third person shooter in space ships. It's not a MMO, despite the store page telling you something else.The game is a team based arena shooter where players can group together in corperations to accomplish bigger projects.GameplayThe gameplay is smooth, fast paced and leaves alot of room for tactical play. In contrast the game is very grind heavy if you wish to fly everything it has to offer.You buy spaceships and then pew pew either against other players or npc. There are 3 different factions with three different ship sizes devided into nine classes. A fourth ship size will be added soon. Each faction prefers a other style of gameplay as does each ship size or class. I'll only be going into the sizes in this review to keep it relatively short.Interceptor: small and very agile. Can relocate very quickly and generally can always be where it needs to be at a given time. Survivability is low.Frigate:large and slow. High firepower or alot of buff abilities. Survivability is high.Fighter:Medium sized and located between the two above mentioned in terms of speed and survivability. Each ship has slots for modules and weapons that you can fit to tailor the ship to your needs and playstyle. The customizability is high for a arena based shooter. The ships and modules, as well as pilot modifications are devided into 15 ranks. The higher the rank gets, the better will the ships and equipment become. It's kept simple for new players, because you will only have a small amount of modules and weapons available at the start. As you progress, more and more options will open up. In order to progress, you'll have to level the ships by playing with them. PVPThe gamemode you'll be playing the most is skirmish. Players in queue will be thrown into team based matches depending on their rank. (There is much more to the matchmaking, but this would be too much for the review)The matches will have different objectives, with more opening up to you as progression comes along.More advanced and interesting pvp modes like leagues or dreadnought will be available to you as you move up the ranks.PVEFour players have to tackle a mission with set goals against npc. There are nine different missions. Until rank four you'll have access to four of them. As in PVP, you'll get more content as you progress in ranks. Such as special missions against giant alien space ships with 12-15 players vs. NPC. Free RoamA set of maps connected together by warp gates where you can either pve or pvp. Unfortunately, one and the same map can exist on multiple servers. So not every player on a particular map will be able to interact with other players on that map, because he might be on a other server. MonetizationThis game gets it right. No pay to win can be found here. You have your standard customization options for your ships, which can be bought for permanent use with real money or for temporary use with in game currency.There are premium modules/weapons as well as premium ammo, but these only give you more experience and let you level faster.Premium ships do not need repairs and earn more experience and income. They aren't stronger than their normal counter parts.Finally, we've got the typical premium subscription, which will boost your income and experience gain.To sum this section up, paying players will grind alot less, advance faster in the ranks, but will not have an advantage in battle. ControlsStandard as in most shooters, mouse and keyboard. Keys are all fully bindable. Controllers and Oculus Rift are also supported. GraphicsNice and as good as they need to be for this type of game. They won't blow your mind, but compliment the game play and also run very well on older machines. Some maps tend to be more demanding than others. SoundThe sound is good, if you ignore the random chatter the game throws at you occaisonally. ""We're on the same target, shoot a missile"" is neat, but after you've heard it thousands of times, it gets annoying. This can't be turned off. I do recommend playing this game with good bass and surround sound speakers. The battle sounds and explosions will be awesome.Nonetheless, they're still good with headsets or normal speakers.Conclusion with pros and consIf spaceships and shooters are your thing, this game is definitely worth a try. It is very grind heavy, even if you let your wallet do some speaking. Nonetheless, the grind does insure, that you don't unlock everything to fast and have nothing left to aspire to.It's not your type of game for spending the whole day on, it's rather for having a few quick rounds of pew pew and fun and then doing something else.Pros-free to play done right.-easy to get into, hard to master.-fast paced and action loaded pvp matches with lot of tactical depth.-good roster of ships and classes which all play differently and can be customized differently.-nice amount of pve content for a game that whas built on pvp.Cons-the grind, this game has 9 currencies and the tenth soon to come. Their purpose? Increase grind and keep you hooked longer. Could also be a good thing, depends on your view. -low player base. In some time zones, you'll have a hard time finding matches. EU and Russian are most populated.-veteran players seal clubbing in lower ranks. Fortunately, the devs are constantely working against this issue and improving it.-bad tutorials and explaining. The game doesn't do a good job on explaining it's mechaniks or importance of the ship roles as well as team work. As a result, some matches can become a real mess, if nobody is filling in their role or working in a team. Credit has to be given for the out of game tutorial vids and helpful community. I strongly recommend the forums and the vids linked by OmegaFighter in the comments. Tips from a player-find yourself an active corperation. The game is more enjoyable when working together.-do not rush the ranks. You won't know how to properly fly your ships and will get your behind whooped.-be thoughtful of your ship, its role and what modules you equip for filling that role.-be a teamplayer. Lone wolves don't get much accomplished in matches.Author's notesIt's my first review ever. Please be so kind and leave a comment to tell me, what was done right or what I did wrong if you don't find this review helpful. "

												This game is pretty Awesome for Free to Play,  I like the piloting and interface.  Once I reached level 4 in PVE it was impossible to win,  I'd play with a level 4 ship and felt like I was going against level 9 bad guys, or playing at level 9 and get a PuG with level 4 and all of them die and im left and ganged up on my the bots.   I don't enjoy PVP but in this game it not too bad since I feel like it alot more skill piloting pay off verses just run and gunning like in a FPS.Free Roam is end level but I would rather have the ability to free from the start or at least not having the Bots at level 15,  I understand having the Aliens end level but I feel like the Pirates nearly as impossible.I also don't like having to play hind and seek to find resoursesId rather get resources instead of credits that way I could sell resourses I don't need for creditsStar Conflict is pretty Awesome, but it very pay to win and I'd rather have time and skill rewarded then paying to have fun			"

												Thought I would try this game out despite negative reviews of others who have played forever.  As you can tell by my play time, something immediately turned me off.  Just to customize the COLOR of your ship, you have to use the RARE in game currency, which can be earned apparently, but is also the in game currency that costs money.  While it is free to play, that is still pretty lame sauce.  Other than that, the gameplay mechanics seem pretty nice.  If you don't mind a free to play experience that will likely nickel and dime you, go for it.  If you are looking for a more modern freelancer feeling space combat sim...just go back to freelancer and wait for Limit Theory.			"

However, if you are forced to play a low level ship against  3 or 4 level higher ships, you are not getting any fun from it. Because they destroy you in seconds.

												this game was is a good spaceship theme games. not just this game can play for free but the simple gameplay make it perfect without needs learn much about game system or looting.but then, i just realized if this game has a toxic system called pay to win. you never and ever can own the game in any game mission (almost) if your ship is not upgraded or has a good weaponary and the worst of all is there's a two ways to make you stronger, pay for it or loot and craft with a very awful and painful path.just a simple example is to synergy your new ship you must play in pvp matchmaking (the best mode for synergy farm) but when you entered the game you just get die over and over. you know why? because the paid player can kill you with their op ship! don't ever think to payback because you never ever can't do thatthe op ship not only has deadly weapon but has tanky hull and shield even for intercept typeso, the only thing you can enjoy this game with free is being lose or win with (maybe) the most dead player in gameeven in pve system if you not careful enough (or even you already did) the swarm of ai can kill your ship !there's a clear line between f2p player and p2w playerno matter how hard you try to become stronger without invest anything in this game, you just can't own this game and dominate in any gameplay modeand the only thing make this game better is make a fair system for all player then make player sure if they throw their money for invest, they will have something worth in this game (not a contain but the system)			"

Regarding VR supportOnce this game worked with Oculus DK2 like a charm. It was one of our favorites. Then Oculus CV1 and Vive got released! And the devs stopped supporting this!!! Why? Who knows but them only! Since then they are stalling the community and telling us occasionally they will bring VR someday. That’s it! I have waited almost for a year now, to get back something which was perfectly functional and fun with DK2. Looking every Update message if the VR support is back!! No more! Waiting time is over! Congratulations Developers – you won and I’m officially p.i.s.s.e.d! No more waiting for me. Today I will uninstall and get over with it!A very nice game, but I will give you a thumbs down, just in hope others like me, who are waiting for VR support to come back, give this review a push!Farewell beloved game!

												Once upon a time I'd happily recommend this. But last I checked the grind had almost doubled. Ignoring that, originally you only fought against ships of your own tier. Which was fine, the queues were only a minute long. Then suddenly they made it akin to WoT, where you can be paired up against ships of a higher tier.in WoT, irritating as it is as a lower tier tank you're still -somewhat- useful. Star Conflict? There's no real scouting mechanic. You are slower, weaker and significantly less durable than any ship a single tier higher than you. I distinctly recall firing everything I had at such an opponent, but his shields were able to regenerate faster than I could deal damage, even if he sat still. This is the equivalent of a tier 1 WoT tank going against a tier 5 (If it were a tier 1 and 2 ship in SC). As you might guess, this is horribly misbalanced and the T1 has no hope in hell of doing a dang thing.Again, it really pains me. The game itself was -good-, I enjoyed it. The grind increase was iffy but I could deal with it, but the botched tier matchmaking (Which evidently was an attempt to imitate other, similar, games, such as their own War Thunder, but without considering the fact that a T1 ship is utterly useless against a T2. Whereas in War Thunder a T1 plane is still capable against a T2) was what really killed Star Conflict for me.Mind you, this was ages ago, so they might have changed it back, or re-balanced each tier. In which case feel free to correct me.			"

Posted: August 14, 2014
												This game is... uneven.Don't get me wrong, you can have fun - I've had fun and still find some enjoyment in it - but its not the most user-freindly.The main reason I cannot recommend it is because its not a game everyone could get into even if you like the type of game, and it easily turns away players with some of those uneven lines that make the gameplay frustrating at best.It is not so much a MMO as its a multiplayer space shooter with a lobby and instances matches. It makes for a really isolated gameplay feel where your interactions with players are largely limited to the matches you find yourself in unless you can strike up enough of a conversation with a few of the talkative types in chat.You play matches with wait times between how the matchmaker tries to balance teams. The game is largely divided between PvE and PvP play, with an increasingly unfair feeling PvP feel as the MM attempts to balance things. You'll often find what will feel like unbalanced matches where one side will effectively steamroll the other.At the core, its a fancy space shooter and that shows inside the PvE with the AI being horribly predictable and abuseable. It does lean to making some of the game fun with an ease of use, but can have stark contrasts with horrifyingly difficult spikes when overwhelmed or facing some of the sporatic Bosses that don't play the same rules - not that you won't learn how to handle them, but their contrasts can make some teams stumble and falter under the shift. It adds to a frustrating feel as the game collapses and players under the pressure of the shifting difficulty  may not be able to handle it. For those that can - its a thing of beauty and a kind of fun enjoyment, but it can be increasingly few and far between with much frustration with poor matches inbetween.It can lead to what seems to be a few players that lean on what can seem overpowered ships carrying a random PvE team, maybe abusing some AI glitches or bending the rules in a way to complete a mission instead of working as a team to complete it.That gameplay is sub-divided between ship ""Tiers"" that holds a varrying degree of 3 ""Ranks"" within it. Ranks 1-15 is split between the 5 Tiers, making the majority of the game further split in its playerbase. Rank 1-3 is Tier 1, Rank 2-6 is Tier 2, Rank 7-9 is Tier 3, Rank 10-12 is Tier 4, Rank 13-15 is Tier 5. The major downside of this is further reducing the playerbase making some game modes unpopular and feel unplayable. Tier 1, 2 & 3 are individual dificulties in PvP with Tier 4-5 being lumped together for the endgame content. The highest Rank ships in the tiers often dominate the matches, discouraging many of the ships from playing outside certain modes such as the Sector Conquest for Corporations (like Guild/Clans) for special perks. Even then you'll find Tier 4 largely not used inside PvP for its lower ranking compared to Tier 5.PvE now splits the game into Tier 1 ""Beginner"", Tier 2 & 3 clumped into ""Easy"" and Tiers 4 & 5 into ""Hard"". The difficulties are relative where the right preperations and a good team mix can still make the most of the match. However with the Tier split and generally lower player population the PvE is largely limited to two options unless you start up a premade team to do one. PvP remains largely random, but Tier 2 and 3 are easier to start with Tier 1 and 4 & 5 much slower, expecially during Conquest fighting times. Certain missions will feel harder or easier depending on what ships are used, and an unfair edge if felt with certain classes on many of them.There are 3 ship types of Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate that are split into 3 sub-classes; Interceptors of Recon, ECM, Covert Ops - Fighters like Gunships, Tacklers or Command - Frigates are Long-Range, Guard or Engineer. The sub-classes largely determine gameplay styles and certain ones can frequently dominate particular match types. Interceptors largely dominate PvP and Frigates own PvE in most modes. Certain game types benefit from a different ship, such as Capt vs Capt PvP having Frigates is good and some Bosses are easier to handle with Fighters or Interceptors in PvE. But outside that the game largely breaks down into its grinding feel.You buy ships, grind ""Synergy"" through use to level up and get the next Rank to progress. Its alot of rinse and repeat gameplay that can drag on easily. And by far that is the worst thing going for it. The combination of generally low population, isolated instances and sporatic player involvement beyond point and shoot makes the obvious grind a bit dull despite its fabulous looks.As I said, and don't get me wrong - its a good and fun game, but its not for everyone. Free to play is good to try it out, but I'm not placing bets on player retention.			"

												Nothing new! Same scheme as World of Tanks, World of Warplanes. You have a hangar, you earn money, you can buy gold if you want to, you spend money on hardware. You progress through the tree of ships - again same scheme: light, medium, heavy. Boring. All battlefields look the same, there's no persistence as such, you need to be in a clan to play map, otherwise it's just insignificant random battle after battle. There's no crafting as advertised, it's just unlocking from the tree, once you have enough money. There's no exploration either, only random battle maps.I don't recommend it, as it's a waste of time.			"

I don't recommend this for those who are looking for anything close to Elite or other rpg style space games. This is purely PVP, the PVE portion is just for training.			"

												Now, I shouldn't need to point out how Pay to Win this game is... the reason is that the ""DLC"" gives you perm. boosts to credits and such... Paying money into this game gets you so far you could unlock every non gold ship within a few months than years on the weekends. If you don't like Pay to win I wouldn't recommend this to you.The grind for non-gold players isn't as bad as like world of tanks as getting to Rank 6+ ships isn't hard and farming PvE is easy with friends... There is no real challange here except in PvP where the mm in my eyes tries to balance teams with atleast one good player per team but this game you need to know what to do or your team loses even if that means you get less kills or less efficany which makes the goal of an objective lost... You don't really get rewarded for spoting for artillary or Long Range ships... If you don't have capturing on (if you get hit) you lose out on a lot of points for capture (which is very high for some reason)This game is addiciting but once you have other games to play than this one will be worthless... Invasion is horrible as getting around in larger ships is hard and since weapon balancing is off for this mode you will die and lose all the work you place into it except for some missions you do... In unsafe zones if you don't have someone to back you up or your not in a high tier ship you might as well forget getting anywhere profitable on it and do the normal PvE missions.The developer for this game is trying to make money ONLY and not make a fair and balanced game for all... I understand permium or items cosmetic to the game. World of Tanks does have Gold tanks but they are not very effective againist their tier except for a limited few.			"

												Pretty cool game especially one for free. I spent most of my time in PvE which was really fun. PvP does tend to be un balanced. 1. The biggest frustration i had with the game was when it kicked me out or i got disconnected from a match i could not just rejoin easily. it said my ships were still in battle and i could not launch another mission unless i changed my ship. and if i got disconnected that way i would have to wait like 30 minutes before i could play again. not to mention losing everything i gained in the match.2. I would also like to see more customization for the ships. because you really can only equip one type of gun on each ship and then upgrade it. i would like to put plasma or lasers on any ship. but thats more of a want.3. another thing that would be really cool is if there was a single player campaign mode with co op options because that is really what im looking for in this game is to just play it with my girlfriend. PvE is nice but not really meant for just local play.I am still considering purchasing packages from this game like soldier of fortune but unless the number one problem i have is fixed i do not think i will be doing that soon. Opinions 2 and 3 really are a would like to see feature with this game otherwise i think the gameplay is really fun and addictive.			"

												Glorified grinding. Except it's not very glorious.Flight and combat is brain numbingly simple; all ships have the same weapon placements. They can shoot best in front and slightly above, decently to the sides and some slightly behind (frigates, cruisers, etc) and not below or behind. Everything feels and flies like a fighter so there s no feeling of flying a big, badass cruiser armed to the teeth.Extremely limited armaments; you get a main weapon and missiles. And maybe an offensive ability. There are no broadside cannons backed up by short range lasers, with a forward facing railgun for taking out large ships. Nay, none of these ships have any sort of diversity at a given moment, and the options for weapon mounts themselves are pretty limited. Missiles come in several flavors, from ""stronger, get with paid-for (yeah, I did the match, 30 cents for a one game use set of missiles.) currency"" to ""I'm smart enough to only spend the grindable credits for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.""As a result, there's no real strategy beyond deathballing with your team and simply being more accurate with your pew pews (and having higher tier ships and equipment, of course). Positioning does not matter beyond using asteriods to block missiles (I seemed to be the only one smart enough to do this in all of my matches.. lol)I was most interested in PvP but I quickly found that you don't face any players until you get rank 5 ships... easily several hours playtime to get barely there. So starting out, you get to fight nothing but not so smart bots. And then there's PvE and Co-Op with even more bots that are still not very smart, just more plentiful and calling upon greater pools of health and shields. Simply wonderful (awful). PvP was eventually reached and the experiece was only slightly better than playing with the bots. But bots actually fought for objectives.. so it could be arguably worse?Objective based games were terribly shallow. Typical ""capture the beacon"" or ""deliver the bomb"" sort of stuff. The only mode that was genuinely fun to play was one where one player from both teams would be randomly selected to be the Captain. As long as the Captain was alive, ships respawned. To win the match the enemy Captain had to be eliminated along with all other ships. The couple of matches I got to play this game mode were a good tug of war with all ships on offense ready to scramble back to protect the Captain at a moment's notice.Unfortuneately, the entire time I was never impressed with myself after killing 9 enemies in a row within a minute because it's easy. Skill makes no difference; all you need is a good mouse and the ability to track a little circle with it. Did I have fun? Meh. Only in one mode, after hours of grinding to get to where I could actually play against PEOPLE instead of STUPID BOTS.Are the mechanics solid?  Of course, the game is well designed but far too minimalistic.. overall the simplicity makes it lackluster.Was it pretty? Hell yeah. Very nice looking game, at least. It just doesn't have the gameplay to boot.Verdict: 4/10 only because Captain assassination halfway made up for the rest of the time I wasted on this game. At least it was free.			"

												Grinding Not fun, game mechanics are interesting because there are good wariety of different classes that has distinct capabilities, pros and cons, each class has its counters and strategies, each class has its use. Simple but good moding system.Graphics are good , but the game can run on integrated graphics card, also it can run on LINUX natively. What devs should improve is resource harwesting on open space, because at this point it looks more like in game ""microsoft freelancer"" they should add smth like drones that search and mine resources, so that there will be more such element as protecting and pirateing other players.grinding 1/10gameplay 8/10Graphics 7/10dislike for p2w grind.

												Played this game for a good while and I have to say it was a game with potential having many good aspects but the game wasn’t enjoyable for a sole reason. It’s basically pay to win because no matter how many times you try to upgrade anything, anyone with premium currency can get ships and parts that outclass your free to play gear by miles. The further down the tier tree you get, the more you see how much of an advantage premium players have over you. Also when I mean premium I don’t mean those who put in a few dollars, I mean those that put hundreds in to spiff up their ships.I don’t recommend anyone playing this game unless you enjoy being destroyed by those who have way bigger bank accounts than you do			"

And now that i have gotten done with the problems that i have had, i can now tell you guy's about what i liked in this game, You guy's did a wonderful job on the ships all of them, they had wonderful details on them and  the sounds as well. and until  these changes are done i will have to not recommend it			"

												I am giving Star Conflict a thumbs down for two/3 reasons. However, those reasons might not bother you, and since its a free game, I highly encourage you to try it out for yourself, and make your own opinions.On the three main reasons I gave Star Conflict a thumbs down. The first reason, is being a new player sucks♥♥♥♥♥ Now, don't get me wrong, a brand new player shouldn't have an ""optimized"" character/ship, with all powerful stuff. I get that. But the AI is Insanely unfair. Just as an example, I was trying to fly a rank...I think it was a rank 6 ship (mid level ship). I was paired with someone who was flying a rank 12, so all the enemies were Double my level, and of course the AI has the best possible gear ""purple"". It actually was so bad I couldn't even drop an enemies shields below 80 percent, just because their ship was SO powerful compared to mine. So bad match making I guess, but in addition to that, for the most part, the ""general"" chat is ignored. Meaning, as a new player, if you have a bunch of questions, try to find a forum or clan that helps new players, because realistically, your not going to find help. Again, to use an example, I've been trying to get a single question answered for the last three days, and been completely ignored in general chat. Not exactly condusive to new players. And the final nail in the coffin for this general point, is want to be good? Better set yourself in to read about 4-5 guides, because this game does NOTHING to explain itself to the player. What's good, what's bad, and so on? Nothing. Point 2. Pay to.....suck? Now, I understand P2W games. I also understand how and why games sometimes choose to do this. And being completely honest, I usually take advantage of that. Because I have limited time I can actually sit and play games, but I like to play with friends, so typically I'll just put money into a game to ""keep up"" with them. Star Conflict? Not the case. Bought ships are actually WORSE in the end then regular ships, meaning your forced to grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind, and grind.....Point 3. Now, not everyone is like this, but there are Toxic players in the pvp section of this game, but unlike most other games, these toxic types are usually the only ones to actually respond. So to summerize, Very unfriendly for new players, really bad grinding/rng/time consuming, and Toxic/aggressive players that go out of their way to target new players. Those are the three general points that overall ruined Star Conflict for me. But hey, like I said, its a free game, give it a shot and try it for yourself.			"

												This game's graphics are making, it's very well polished and can run even on less than decent laptops. It's optimized very well, its fun and even has open space. Why am I giving this a negative review then you're asking?No one in this game talks and anyone who does is in russian. There's aspects of this game that are absolutely destroyed lke the covert ops class being unable to do anything now with the amount of guards/destroyers there are, basically anything that's tankier can make the covert ops ship class useless. That's rather specific though, what the real issue is the amoutn of grind and pay to progress this game has. I don't mind pay to progress games myself, but this game has such a wall for crafting ships later on, getting synergy to level up ships, and getting credits that it's just tedious work and not pleasent. Open space while fun, is lifeless as well. I love exploring the depths of space but I see there's not a soul out there but the alien AI floating around.The game suffers a small community and whenever I google or look up anything regarding questions for this game, there's nothing. For example, the mistranslation ont he skill ""reactor overload"" and how to use covert ops ship. Even just basic things like skills available for different ships at different ranks, it just seems like this game has no community or support to make anything knowledgable. Speaking of that, there's so many options I had to turn on since the game didn't automatically have them on for me or show me how to get better. There's a huge learning curve that players have to warn and tell you about that the game doesn't tell you.... what sucks about that is that like I said, there's hardly a community here. There's also a form of credit in the game that of course is pushed for you to use for just about everything you can obtain in the game. You ""CAN"" obtain things at progress without spending a dime or ths credit, but it'll take you ages to get anything you want or enjoy.The chat system is also very lacking. There's no /r reply button so you literally have to click the name of the person you're whispering to reply back to them. This makes having a conversation very tedious and obnoxious to do mid battle too. This game just seems to make it's best effort to be unsocial with the censor system too. For all the cool things you see in this game that you want to do, there is a giant grind/gap behind it that will make your determintion to get there very insignificant. You want those big destroyer ships that look awesome? Have fun grinding the 6mil credits and materials to farm one as well as the synergy to get to a rank that has one. Open space battles look cool? That'd be nice if there was actually anyone there. So between the endless grind, the lack of community, and feeling that nobody cares about the game(community and devs both), I rate it down in hopes this game actually does get better. I really enjoyed it at first, then it became pain and not enjoyable for how much I have to do and work for. I understand earning ships and grinds in games, but this one makes it a little rediculous. If there was a larger community, or at least more than 1k plaers online at a time, I could see this game being very addictive and fun. Otherwise it's lonesome, boring, and grind heavy.			"

												I've played this for a while now and wanted to leave my thoughts. I've only played till tier 9. If you try the game yourself you'll soon figure out the goods about this game. A bunch of different PvE maps, quite a lot actually, then the skirmish PvP and PvE has some fun maps too, the matchmaking at this point is really balanced as far as I remember it. At tier 7 you can start exploring open space, so there's a lot to see. Also imo shooting, moving and general gameplay is really fun. The core game is great but there's a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t letting it down.First of the PvE skirmish/Co-op, player matchmaking seems to be 1-5 | 6-10 but the enemy AI spawns 1-3 | 4-6 | 7-9 | 10-12. If everyone in your team is tier 6 except for 1 guy who is tier 9, every enemy AI will spawn at 10-12 with some tier 8 destroyers. Which means a tier 6 ship can meet a tier 12 which will insta kill him. Even by tier 9 command, which is semi tanky, can get killed under 2 seconds by 1 guard only shooting his lasers. If it wasn't for this, and the fact that it's so easy to change, I'd not think this game mode is bad at all because the maps and game modes are fun imo. This mode has a lot of potential too. I do play quite some missions PvE, Interesting and fun at first, but it's static without variation (no random spawn location, or variables in what spawns, when or anything at all) and there's a few locations on some maps that makes it too easy. I noticed a quite new map though, it replaces the old level 1 map and moves the old map to level 3. The new map however is way too hard for newbies and should probably be a late map. The rest of the maps I've played are too easy for most part and you can do all maps with only 2 ships. This is because you 2 shot small ships with guns like the singularity one. Every map except the new level 1 map are all exactly as easy to play. No difficulty progression. (I've not played the last maps as I only played with tier 9 as highest.)Open world: Lots of open space with some rocks, more space rock and some broken buildings, some cool alien stuff, it's alright. What bothers me is that it feels unfinished, 1 area the mobs are really easy, the next you have giant alien ships that shoots giant balls at you but so far it's actually not much harder. Then next map you have the same giant aliens but this time they also have 1 scout. The thing is, the scout has more hp, shield, does more damage, and gives less points. Why tho? I will never know. PvP + summary: I can't recommend it. It's okay, at first but the more you progress, the less you wanna continue on the same maps over and over. PvP queues are very long compared to the rest so you might not play a lot of it. When it starts a game it's usually only 1-2 players in each team and because of this the rest is filled up with bots, imo it feels way less empty obviously, but it's kinda a bot game. It's a little fun to me, like the master of puppets 1v1, but like the other things, it gets dull after a while. Also seeing how expensive the dlcs are and people complaining about their tier 15's being useless against op stuff I wouldn't recommend anyone to put their money into the game because it's simply too expensive, maybe they start releasing cheaper content making more ppl buy it. Play if you like, but I can't recommend you to try it out because there's a lot of options out there that do a similar thing.			"

												Ah what to say about Star Conflict. As you can see I have put some hours into the game. Until the most recent update that introduced Destroyers into the game it was relatively well balanced for those that took advantage of the F2P model against those that choose to pay for upgrades, various ships and what have you. Those days are over. This is now a complete P2W game (not the first and will not be the last). You have to have a lot of rare components in order to ""build"" a destroyer, let alone upgrade the modules and weaponry. If you pay you can of course do this far in advance of those who choose to stick with the F2P offering of the game.Overall I believe the game is (was) fun to play under the F2P model and still probably is if you are willing to put up the cash to keep up with the new class of ship. Otherwise, you will be fighting many losing battles against those who opened their wallets to have the better ships.			"

												If you imagine SMITE in space, you'll have a basic understanding of what the creators of Star Conflict intended.  However, Star Conflict is not a space skirmish game - it's a waiting-in-line simulator.The wait time between battles is rather long.  Even the queue to play against AI exceeds twenty minutes (I'm currently at 22:03 as I type this).  That doesn't make a lot of sense, as one isn't waiting for other players to join.Simply put, Star Conflict isn't fun because you'll spend more time in queue than actually playing.  This game isn't worth downloading.			"

												Horrible game for the solo player. Without a corporation with coordination and good teamwork, you have a 99% chance of losing every single match, whether PVP or PVE. I spent the last two days playing the game after re-installing it, and the balance hasnt changed at all. Coordinated PVP teams♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥randomly thrown together teams of solo players, PVE rounds that are nigh impossible to beat (After two days and 17 runs, I have yet to see the Special Ops mission even close to beaten), and constant encouragement to buy your way to the top of the game make this one of my least favorite space shooters out there.I only play this game when my other games are offline. An excellent game if you like staring at timers, watching other people play, and losing to superior forces repeatedly. Almost ZERO solo content, impossible to progress without team play or group work, and pointless to play if you are a solo player as even the top level ships can be easily popped by a small mob in the open world. Not a game for individual players. Barely a game for team players, as it gets harder to near impossible as you progress. Fun for the first few levels, then a waste of time.			"

												As per the course for MMOs- it's technically more of a money farming venture than a legitimate game, BUT, the gameplay is solid, the lighting and graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The hangar screens and level up options are not intuitave but not overly complicated either. Instead of playing against other players directly in PVP mode, you team up with them against AI enemies to see who can score the highest against them. There is also a story more that is not all that dissimilar. Pretty damn fun if you ignore the attempts to nickle/dime you.And as usual- to last longer than five seconds in the rank 3 PVP when it really DOES become player on player- you will definitely need the real-money vehicles to keep from being spawn-fragged.

Pretty disappointing.I'll probably check the game again in awhile, after all I was dumb enough to throw money at it.Edit: I looked at the game again and it's still a soul-crushing grind.

												I (obviously) didn't play for very long.  Why you may ask?  Because it feels like a poorly balanced version of War Thunder in space.  The UI is miserably unintuitive, and advancing even a L1 ship was brutal.  In my 0.8 hours of gameplay, I upgraded a railgun.  Once.  That was it.  The teaser video is horribly misleading.  Most battles are quick and one sided and lack any real tactics.  All the other reviews talk about pay to win- looking through ship tiers and stats, that most definitely seems to be the case.Tl;dr: If you like space pew-pew, enjoyed war thunder, and have lots of cash to pay2win, then this might be for you.  But it was not for me.			"

Star Conflict, a Free to Play Massive Online Battle Arena game (as of 0.11.0 )(side note: I've no idea what I'm doing! I'm still a newbie in reviews, so I hope this is helpful to anyone thinking about playing this game)Before I start this off, the reason I DON'T recommend the game is purely because it is STILL in open beta. And, the way things are going, it is likely to stay that way for quite a long time, unfortunately.After wasting countless hours in front of a keyboard on it, I've come to realise five things:1) That the game punishes you for doing good.2) The issues with ship balance (more specifically Premium vs. Free).3) The game is addictive as all hell.4) Leveling is a lengthy process.5) Gameplay is amazing. Physics are thrown out the window.----------------------------------------------------------So not everything is bad, but let's expand on this, shall we...1) Punishing your victories.It does. For as long as you queue solo, the game punishes you in extreme ways. If you win one battle, you get pitted against harder and harder opponents (as it should be, in any ranked game). However, the problem comes with the fact that the game punishes you by teaming you up with pilots that are... Well, let's just call them ""below standard"". For a fair match to occur, you'd need equal amount of skill level (Skill Rating in this game), which does not happen. And, in that sense, the Matchmaker needs a LOT of work and tweaking. So, as long as you're flying in a coordinated squad, nothing bad will ever happen to you.2) P2W? P2L? P2GL?The P2W discussions are getting old, FAST, so let this be here to clarify it once and for all. THERE IS NO DIRECT P2W IN THIS GAME. What makes Premium ships overpowered is a deadly combination of ship bonuses, slot layout AND, most important of all, pilot skill. If you put two pilots of different skill rating in the same ship, not only will their fits be different, but so will their aiming skills, reactions and module timing. The opposite, however (Free ships more powerful than their Premium counterparts) also exists in the game, albeit in a large minority (I daresay 1:5 ratio for Free > Premium).3) Drug addicts!IT. IS. ADDICTING. Like smoking. Or any light/heavy drug in existence. You reach a point where you NEED to play it and can't avoid NOT playing it. When you are playing it, you curse yourself for still playing it because the Matchmaker doesn't give you a breather.4) Leveling all ships is a lengthy process without a paid License for bonus Synergy (required to progress in the game) and Credits (ships get ludicrously more expensive as you progress), but not horrible. If I remember correctly, it is a 20% bonus with License and the DLCs (all of them), provide another 25% to both Credits and Synergy. They might be worth it, if you're willing to spend the money on them.5) The gameplay is solid. The Physics are not. Commands are highly responsive and nigh-instant as long as your latency is low (<180) and it all happens in low orbit. Either that or the laws of physics don't apply, here, meaning the hard-sf fans will be disappointed by this game. There is a minor attrition and if you stop your thrusters and there is no inercia.So, in short:Upsides:> Incredibly fun to play.> F2P.> P2W jokes left and right.> Solid, quick response gameplay.Downsides:> Expert pilots in overpowered ships.> Matchmaker punishment.> Lengthy progression.> Balance issues that keep getting ignored.Solid 7/10 game, all things considered. The downsides aren't enough to bring the game down and it IS still in beta. Give the game a chance, you lose nothing but some hours and disk space, all things considered.			"

												P2W 'exclusive' gaming model:- 'Unique' limited-time ships/mods with more DPS available via cash-shop RNG loot-boxes.- P2W purple ammo that amounts to premium due to limited material drop rates.- Endless grind for 'evolved' (imbalanced) Ellydium ships, which can be purchased.This all happened in 2016, bait and switch. Actually motivated me to write my first review.I spent $150 on this garbage, and I really hate being one-upped by people who spent $500.			"

												This game USED to be a lot of fun. It used to be a great place to come for some epic PvP battles and great times roaming the colorful Open Space maps.However anyone that invests more than a few days into this game will discover that this game is about like old chewing gum, no flavor left just the same old grind over and over as the devs continue find new ways to squeeze any fun out of it.take my advise, find another game to waste your time on.

												The good news is the game's introduction. You create your account with one click, you pick one of three possible starting ships, and the first view you get immediately presents you with options that look fun and interesting to explore. Front and center is a (completely optional) tutorial, that can give you the basics in a couple of minutes. Or, if you like, you can just jump in and start discovering the game on your own. Absolutely brilliant.The bad news is that the core gameplay isn't satisfying. The rocket physics are 2'000 years out of date, with ships that decelerate while not burning fuel, that have top speeds, and whose momentum turns with the nose of the ship. There are way too many design decisions made plainly on the basis of game balance, with no thought given to verisimilitude.I think a lot of people might like this game. I didn't. Uninstalled it within an hour, never played it again.			"

If you've the habbit of rushing things you'll get screwed over repeatidly. I've a lengthy conversation of them thinking such features are 'okay' stating I'm attempting to have them form game toward my personal veiws....They have at least somewhat fixed the popup so it's no longer randomly placed on your screen, so I'll go back to saying its okay, however, it's still a neusance.

												Если играть часок вечером подпивас, то как контр-страйк в космосе все норм.Если играть с претензией на ""прокачаться, построить корабли"", то тут есть серьезные трудности.Прокачка до максимального уровня корабля займет гигантское количество времени, по сравнению с какой-нибудь 'обычной' MMORPG. Я несколько лет играл в WoW, там спокойно, без zardotstva, прокачиваешься до макс. уровня за месяц.Здесь, наверное, придется потратить год, играя по часу-два каждый вечер.Когда хочется сделать перерыв от командных боев (как PVE-миссий, так и PVP-сражений) и полетать в одиночку, придется столкнуться с большой силой мобов открытого мира. Т.е. ""пофармить ресурсы, пострелять мобов"" просто так не выйдет, слишком сильны.Поэтому, спустя несколько месяцев, я столкнулся с двумя моментами:1. Полетать в одного (в открытом мире), пофармить ресурсы, пострелять мобов -- слишком сложно;2. Прокачка на PVE-миссиях и PVP-сражениях очень медленная (даже если играть по 8-10 часов в день).Плюс, последние несколько месяцев, что я играю, заметна тенденция к уничтожению режима PVP (передаю привет человеку (на самом деле, не человеку), разрабатывающему алгоритмы матчмейкера).

												Alright lets start, we have a  ´´massive multiplayer online´´ [media.tenor.co] space game where you fight and fight and fight. Ok, that is cool for those who like pvp. The things were good until Destroyers Update. All i saw in 2016 was Premium ships, premium ships, destroyers, premium ships, sector conquest, premium ships. The game now have p2w system, where you can buy ships that are better than the Secret/Special Project Ships, that was supposed to be the best ships in the game and you can only have them from the craft system, that is a sh##.Are you one of those guys that dont see the p2w? Ok, Brokk and Phoenix are Premium ships that have better support modules that the Octopus, and to get the Phoenix you need to do pvp/pve/coop missions with rank 8 ships only and then test your luck getting the loot after the battle, if you get 450 of them, you get the ship, or you can just pay. The Brokk, same thing to get the ship parts but costs 600 parts, and you can just pay again. And the octopus you ask? Well, now octopus is just another engi ship in the game.The game was good about 1 year ago, but now its only missions to get big ships that you can just pay too, then go in a battle with your big ships and destroy each other, or just go into pve mission or waste your time trying to get the minerals to build some sh## in Open Space.Im not saying the game is bad, its just worse than 1 year ago, and of course p2w.

												Quite interesting game, it takes some skill to command and manuever the ships. Despite being addicting at first, the PvE missions get a bit too repetitive afer awhile. They can be challenging too, which is very positive. However, the PvP is very unbalanced as it matches new players with high geared ones, making the matches very biased. The upgrade system is intuitive and choice-free since it allows players to choose certain ship paths. Ovearall, this is an interesting game, specially for those who love sci-fi and space games.			"

												I've played Star Conflict extensively during the Open Beta, then in Sporadic but long bouts for another two years afterwards, being active in the forum in the beginning, observing changes, giving input, being ignored-----.Now then.You can essentially tackle the entire  game in two ways:You can either get premium ships, equipment, a guild spot and a freaking battleship, spending all your lollars on the way, OR you can despair over it, grind out your sorry♥♥♥♥♥ having to make do with savagely inferior equipment most of the time, like I did....At least I became a rather decent dogifghter that way.You can either move to Russia, learn russian while you're at it -for the guild spot, I mean- and, ALLEGEDLY, get at least a handful of games with short waiting times and no disconnects.OR you can despair over it, Wondering what on earth has you getting 10+ Minute wait times, 15 disconnects and seemingly scheduled server timeouts despite your state-of-the-art fiber-wire internet connection (4k porn? puh-lease...), like I did....At least I got to see the last 30 seconds of the match, though usually my absence caused my team to lose.You can either join one of the slim handful of dev-lobbying (also Russian) guilds (Sorry, ""Corporations"".) by throwing money at them so they can enlarge their D's (I'M TALKING ABOUT DREADNOUGHTS YOU PERVERT!)OR you can go solo, despairing over it, since that way it's fun-less, grindy goodness will make itself even more apparent, like I did....At least I got to feel like one of those silent, lone-wolf-space-mercenary types. So edgy.You can either realize it for the MMO that it is, just overlooking the garishly generic lore, look, quest system, UI, music, voice acting, OR you can despair over it, offering free voiceclips, music, writing, essentially all the love the devs kinda don't have the stomach to put into their Moneycow, like I And many others did....At least I had some fun times and conversations with people all over the globe.You can either keep holding onto it because at the core, it has really good, fluent and intense gameplay, awesome ship designs and an interesting faction/Loyalty system (IF ONLY ALL THE REST WOULDN'T TARNISH IT) and there isn't all that much quite like it out thereOR you can stop despairing over it, get a better PC or something, play some old X-Wing, go out there and find a Spaceship fighter that has the same kinda touch to it's system,like I'm going to do now....At least I can say that I really tried.

												At the beginnig, it was a great game, quite balanced, depend on player's skills. I quit fot a while in the time, they add DLC imba ships (it was the origin of p2win and I was dissapointed of it). Two years later, I just felt a little nostalgy and turn it on. Destroyers, good idea but very imbalanced game. Still, gameplay against destroyers isn't too impossible to win. But now, the event with aliens ships and need to play or pay for xenocrystals, to obtain very imbalanced alien gunship plus their equpment, it is for noob children with parent's wallet. Now, it is impossible stand in battle with ordinary ship, even if your modules are maximized at lvl15. Team with more Thar'Ga gunsips will win every battle. I spent several money for this game, but no more. In a moment, the battles will be only Thar'Gas and destroyers against Thar'Gas and destroyers. Good bye Star Conflict.			"

												Hi, I came back to this game and noticed some epic new content only to see that they are practically impossible to achieve without paying real money for them (Unless you are ready to grind a month for 1 of MANY epic things), I cannot recommedn this game to anybody due it is simply.. fustruating. I thought I was finally going to get something nice as I had lots of resources from playing this game so long, only to see that I was wrong. Oh boy how wrong I was able to be.. There are tons of currency that basicly requires you to buy them (Unless you grind that one month for one item). If I had to estimate the dollar per hour (Usually on f2p games around 1$ per hour of gameplay) but in this game it is like 0.3$ per hour. I have played many f2p games with joy in my face without paying but in this game, my face is .. bored.. due the massive grind.Otherwise this game is awesome, but this aspect of the game really destroys it.

												It might be fun in the beginning, but it will all change the moment you get a Rank 6 ship, and you continue playing...- The grind is real, and has been increased with several ""updates"" over this year.- Destroyers have pretty much destroyed the game since their introduction. Missions for example were ""balanced"" towards destroyers, ignoring the fact, that many players don't have one.- While the daily tasks for Rank 14 destroyers are now PvP only, the number of destroyers per PvP battle has been limited with a recent patch.- The advertisement here on Steam is misleading, the game is clearly focused on PvP.- PvE is pretty much dead now, unless you find a Corp. that carries you through the daily grind of PvE tasks.- Updates and even events (time limited...) have the sole purposs of pressuring players into spending money on bundles.- Loot from the ""trophy search"", ""open space"" and even those lottery container bundles is random.- Reasonable critique and suggestions get ignored at best, silenced through banns at worst.- Forum Mods. on Steam and on the official forums bend the rules as they see fit.- And most positive reviews in here appear to be... odd.- It looks like there're more positive recent reviews then actual players in the game.

												This game had so much potential in it's beginning, and usually brought some pretty good updates, it's community was active and generally decent people, and developers didn't have a negative relationship with players.  Now, where we are now is where we have been for about a year now: In terms of updates, it's 1 step forward 3 steps back - we're made to believe that something cool is coming, or something good is coming, and sometimes it does, but usually updates that follow are either 1) ignoring problems with previous updates 2) fixing ""problems"" that never existed 3) Creating fixes for problems that actually then create worse problems 4) Make it more Pay-to-Win 5) add new useless, bad, or pay-to-win features/items.I can no longer say that I still play it for the game, rather I only play it because of the bonds I've forged with many of the pilots in my corporation, and I don't want to leave that.

												Okay... 130+ hours was seriously enough for me to get sick of this game.-First up, The fun ends at rank 6... after that it's just loads and LOADS of grinding.-Extremely Pay 2 Win/Pay 2 Advance... bundles are a cool feature but please let the people buy them for something else than Premium currency, or make them as daily rewards so the grind actually feels rewarding and not repetative af.-Open Space sucks, no joke... it just sucks... Credits located in asteroids? That's pure BS... or and did I mention you actually need to buy a special scanner to dishern where are the credits and where are the mats? Well I hope you have about 20$ laying around somewhere cause you can't get it anywhere else.-The new module upgrade system... Blagh! If grinding didn't seem bad enough then you haven't got the true taste of the new upgrade system... Last month it was following a pattern of to upgrade first you use normal currency, then vouchers (which you used get from repeatable assignments that respawn in 30 minutes) and then Iridium which could have been gotten from purple module kits... Now it has become like it's own exp... ohh and did I mention that you only get 1200 'module exp' per win and only 600 per loss? For beginners it would be an awesome experience but when you get to rank 9... ohh boy god bless your soul cause you will grind your butt off leveling one module out of 12!-Destroyer materials are hard to get... Okay... I can't stress myself enough how happy I felt when I found out that you could get Destroyer materials from PvE/PvP loot drops and all you need is a max leveled ship. No poblem I grinded my way to get a max lvl Crusader to start doing the Fire Support PvE mission, played 20 missions in one day... No freaking ore! Just like that! Nothing! The drop rate for it is so freaking low that in order to get a rank 8 destroyer you will need like... 3 months of non-stop playing, 24/7 without any breaks for sleep, food or toilet to get it from scratch... Ohh and you need about 320 ore pieces to get the destroyer structures... so yeah... rest in pieces your life.Suggestions; Make the game less grindy!! No seriously you turned away many people because you made it so impposibly to grind that others would rather play on some other game, Raising the drop rates for materials would be nice and get rid of credits in asteroids! This is not funny. Create a better Daily bundle system, no not the one where you come in after the reset and get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ container, I mean YOU select which bundles to grind, like for example a Xeno-specialist bundle or something else that you want and go into missions to complete the task for that said bundle, maybe even make that you can only grind three bundles per day.Return the old module upgrade system... seriously, I don't want to spend my entire day leveling one module.All in all... the game is for you if you are a fan of salt and hellish grinding but if you are looking for a good game to play that doesn't involve grinding your the skin off your fingers, then don't play it.

												Until the devs fix their servers, this game is a huge pile of crap for any North American player.  Expect massive ping on any server that isn't US, and sometimes even on US servers.  I have played for two years now, purchased all the DLC, and put a lot of time and effort, but yet their servers are still a steaming pile of dog crap.  I am near the point of just giving up (not a rage post, I've been playing for 2 years and it is still bad).  This is the only thing holding this game back from becoming a very VERY fun FTP game.Other than the absolute garbage servers, the game is amazing.  Visually awesome, good gameplay, and generally a fun experience as you level up.  If you are EU or RU player, go for it, but as for me and anyone else in North America, steer clear.			"

												Boring as hell.Basically you fly around in a space ship in arena type maps and shoot everything that moves. Then you use currencies you get from that to upgrade your ship, then you fight more. Get's kind of mindless and boring after just a few minutes. There is also a strong cash-shop incentive, so if you loose, the enemy probably just inserted more money.Unless you totally love stupid space combat, you better spent your time somewhere else.			"

												I've had some fun playing this game for a 'few' hours and have reached rank 13/15 recently.But now the grinding for new ships/parts became too annoying for me.This is partly due to some - in my opinion - bad game design decisions:-Your ships are disabled for a long duration when you leave a battle AND-Matchmaking quite often results in unbalanced teams AND-Spawn Camping is neither forbidden nor discouraged by an effective spawn protection. (There is one that is disabled as soon as you fire a shot, which will be your last one if half of the enemy team is firing at you.)Just to be clear: I rarely leave games but it is definitely NOT fun if you are killed within 1-10 seconds after waiting 30 seconds for respawn.-Since I received positive ""Karma"" by killing lots of Aliens in ""Open Space"" I've noticed a tendency to suddenly explode soon after entering ""Open Space"" because there has been a group of ""negative Karma""-guys waiting for targets to spawn. - spawn police npcs seem to be helpless A variation of this is when you finally found some useful ressources during asteroid mining. (aka. ""the galaxy wide easter egg hunt"" ;-))-Late game ships require a huge amount of work to get. (I'm not even talking about maxing everything...)-Voice chat with team mates has to be activated via the settings menu but I'm not even sure if it works because I have yet to receive an answer...I only have limitted time that I could use to play this game and I decided to do something else now.That does not mean that you won't be happy with it but you should be warned about the things I mentioned. If you are not willing to spend/""waste"" a lot of time into this game you might be disappointed.I'd like to thank the developer to include Linux support. It ran quite nicely.			"

												Star Conflict has done most things well. This game has:-A pretty good soundtrack(it's more situational than memorable, but that's not necessarily a bad thing)-Smooth, easy-to-use controls-Creative maps-Great visuals that run incredibly well even on integrated graphics-A TON of ships and upgrades(the upgrade tree is similar to ""World of Tanks"")However, one thing is preventing me from being able to enjoying this game fully, or even be able to give a proper rating. I downloaded this game with great wishes to pla pvp primarily. Little did I know that in order to decrease waiting times, players get thrown into battle against the AI(remember, this is in pvp, not pve or skirmish). This is a great idea in concept, but within the 6.6 hours I've played at the time of this review, I've only played REAL pvp in two matches. Not only have I won every battle against the AI, the fact that I'm not getting to do pvp is preventing me from completing certain achievements, which I WANT to complete so I can move on and complete more to get more in-game credits. The fact that I have started matches with 6 players against 6 bots makes this even more of a frustration since I have fought many battles with just 2 players and 2 bots. Why can't the matches just be 3v3 instead of 6 players vs. 6 bots?I give star conflict a 4/5 only because of the ""pvp issue"" and a UI that can sometimes get on my nerves due to a lack of information. If anyone has played and liked ""Metalstorm""(I know it's at least been on iOS) then I highly suggest downloading Star Conflict. It's basically a Sci-Fi metalstorm with the upgrade tree from World of Tanks.			"

												After playing for quite some time this is my reason for giving it a negative review, But unfortinately the Positives out weigh the Negatives (Reviews Wise) What the game does: On a Positive Note - Game despite being made as a space sime in 2011 - 2012 is by far the best looking game for that period of time- The Game has an Aracde feel to it. - Theres 3 factions and each faction has 3 main roles and 3 side roles, the total amount of ships is up to 163 i believe. The Federation is your Future Military Faction while the Empire retains an Old Military look, Jerhico is an Advanced Faction consisting of Multiple Royal Families Jerhico was also Exiled From earth. What the Game does: on a negative Note - To Construct say a destroyer you'll need X amount of resources, To get the reasources you need you need to go to the sector corrisponding to your ships rank, and Pray to god that you don't get attacked by Biomorph Hunters. - BIOMORPHS: Are an Alien Entity that roam in Open Space, they move in groups of 1, 2, Or 5, depending on the type, in higher tier sectors there will be lots and are very difficult to kill on your own, many have requested in the past to have the amount of Biomorphs reduced.-The Grinding factor isn't as bad from rank/Tier 1-6 anything after that starts getting quite grindy 7-10 can be pretty bad but once you hit you hit 11-15 its unbearable.  - Pay To Win? Yes and No, Premium Ships can provide personal Bonuses but you can also find parts for certain perium ships I.E.  Archelon, and you'll need 200 ship parts to get it. But its not as easy as one may think, per match you only get 1 ship part, so 1 ship part per match, you'd have to play 200 matches back to back to get said ship.  "

												The best I can say about the game...I used to love it.Combat was simple, yet fun, and it felt satisfying to activate a shield moments before getting hit with a missile that has the capacity to destroy your ship. Paying was optional. Sure, you could get some ships and skip progression of you paid, but you could do the same as a F2P player, it'd just take time. I felt like I was actually progressing as I got new ships, and getting new weapons/abilities.Then, a new ship type was introduced.""Destroyers"" (thanks to Phoenix for correcting me)In short, they were extremely powerful, but required quite a bit of work to do, OR you could fork over some cash, and get one instantly. (And, yes, they have been nerfed, but with a good engineer, the enemy is screwed)I haven't played in a while, but watched others play. Seems as though there are RNG ""crates"" to get new ships and items, but you need to pay to get them.All in all, used to be good, used to love it, then it turned into what most free to play games are...Pay to Win.Edit:Ok. I tried the game again, and, I have to say that the gameplay is still great, and I have a blast flying my little interceptor around, dodging other people's attacks. Although, I can still see the big pay to win factor, as I was being easily destroyed by people in ships that you could only obtain through real cash (I.E. ""dlc""). Try it if you want, it's like most free to play games, but I don't, personally, think it's worth the cash.			"

												If you have played Endless Sky, this game is for you, but this game does have its drawbacks too. Sure, the game has a nice PvP/PvE system, but there should really be some solo tasks as well as an expansive ability to upgrade or even build your own ships from the ground up. One of the nicer features is being able to collect loot, but what good is that loot for other than selling it or letting it collect until you get a certain rank to be able to use it, and even then not be able to use it period? The authors should really do some revisions to make this game both have a better crafting system and to allow some single player battles against ships of your own class with difficulty settings that can offer more perks for challenging levels and ranks higher than your own.

												I recomend this game, and yet there are parts I'm not thrilled with. At it's core, Star Conflict, is a really fun and exciting space combat game. It's one of those games, that you'll keep coming back to, because it's just that fun. It's well put together, engaging, and the controls are easy to learn and master. It's one of those free to play games, that makes me want to kick the dev a few bucks, so they'll keep making more games, and updates to this one. I find the open space area, to be fun to explore, and I enjoy the missions. It does a great job at player emmersion.  That being said....there are some issues. I find that the leveling system isn't fair. Instead of earning experience for completing missions and winning battles for one of the three fractions. You level up by buying ships. Said ships only become available by leveling up the previous ships on the ladder. This requires synergy, an arbitary experience point system, that is mostly allocated to a single ship. There is free synergy that isn't bound to a specfic ship, but the amount of free synergy that you earn is a pittence compared to the ship specfic synergy. As you move up the synergy scale, the amount of synergy you need to level up grows at a staggering rate. Often bumping up by 5-10 thousand synergy. Not only that, but the open space area only opens at level 6. That area offers the most opurtunites to earn synergy and gather curency. You can transfer synergy from fully leveled up ships, and from premium ships, but this costs standards. The primary curency that is mostly gathered from in game purcheses, or dlc packs. It is infrequently given out in game, so the only way to get large amounts of it, is to buy it. Also cosmetic options for your ships, are bought with standards, and can cost the equivalent of 2-3 real world dollars. They also are ship specific. Meaning for example, if I bought an American flag for one ship, it wouldn't be able to be used for another ship. Said flag cost 100 standards, about 1 US dollar. I know this is a small amount in relation, but it stacks up after awhile. The cosmetics needs to be purchasble through the regualr curency, not premuim. At the end of the day, I do recomend this game, but the negitives might be enough to keep someone from playing, which is a shame, because at it's core, Star Conflict is a blast to play. I give it a 7/10, A good game, but flawed.			"

												First, I'd like to say that I scrolled through reviews for a solid 2 minutes and out of the 50+ entries I saw only 11 of them were positive, and that that is an accurate representation of a large portion of Star Conflict's playerbase.Secondly, why the feedback is marked as ""very positive"" is beyond me, but from the experience I've had with the game, it is extremely Pay to Win. Like, if you don't pay, you will lose. And as for me, I personally despise Pay to Win with a fiery passion. Thus, I despise everything Star Conflict stands for. Actually, that's not true. I like the spaceships--They're pretty cool. But that's it. All in all, I do not recommend this game, mostly because of the fact that you need to pay through the afterburners  of your wallet-sucking starfighter in order to not die horribly in the cold vacuum of space at the hands of your enemies. But hey, if your bank account shows the little figure-8 infinity symbol every time you check your balance, by all means, download this game and enjoy.			"

												Despite the promising teasers and exciting premise of a proper space dogfighting experience, I feel Star Conflict falls short of delivering a flat out entertaining experience. There exists a double edged sword when it comes to offering a free to play title along with paid content. On one edge, you've got the semblance of a fully enjoyable well balanced title. Obversely, there is that nasty temptation of paying to bypass grinding or paying to compete with other paid players. Star Conflict is no stranger to this system, and offers the payment option quite often, as many times as it can. Whether this be through pop ups offering deals on standards, or through post match reminders along the lines of 'this is how much you COULD have earned if you were premium.' I may be biased towards the F2P format for games, but when it's that in your face, it gets quite frustrating.Admittedly, SC is not without it's fun. At it's core it's a very pretty, smooth running game. There is plenty of visual candy to keep your attention focused on combat. PvE is an excellent alternative to dodge the paid players in PvP, and is done well enough that it's not inherently obvious you're playing against bots. They mostly consist of strike type missions mixed with capturing points. This is one of the few redeeming features I see, aside from other basic, but desperately needed additions such as a daily log in bonus (after five days, a free player can get 24 hours of premium status). Honestly, PvP can be avoided altogether if one absolutely wanted to. You get a decent amount of credits in the beginning to buy a few ships, but I started to notice the ships were getting more and more expensive when climbing the level tree. The daily login bonus coupled with the PvE missions were keeping me afloat and able to pay for ammunition after every match, but any more ships, and I feel I would start getting credit starved. This is where the curve starts to kick in, and it becomes ever more tempting to buy into the game to continue your progress. Progression is choked further when attempting to sell ships and recover some credits for the next level ship; I received a quote of exactly 1 credit when attempting to sell my used gunship. Not sure if this is just because it's a low tier ship, or because you genuinely get no credits for used ships. Thus, you are forced back into the same PvE mission to grind for more credits.Due to how heavily insistent the game is on purchasing credits, I cannot recommend this game to any serious player. At most, a few hours of fun can be had from progressing a few levels and playing through several PvE matches. Heck, you may even play a few very one sided, poorly matched PvP matches against high tier players too. Play the game for a bit, get what fun you can out of it, and leave once it stops being fun. Just don't spend any money on it, and you can leave guilt free.			"

												This game is a hamster wheel. You can have fun with it and have some semblance of advancement, but eventually new content with new currencies and materials will roll out, which means either you do a very inefficient grind for a very long time, or pay up to gain superior weaponry and ships.I don't think I can recommend this game in its current form.

												Not sure why - but this title doesn't hold the same appeal or entertainment value as War Thunder. Maybe it's the space based combat - not particularly smooth or intuitive on motion or control - or maybe it's the eternal wait for a queue to free up ...but all the argument about the pay-to-win aspect of the publisher aside it's just not a fun game and I wouldn't recommend bothering with it unless you enjoy being shot to pieces in a marginally maneuverable space fighter by bots.

												Star Conflict, a game where you can fight in PvP battles in teams, play as a squad to complete missions, fly in open space and collect resources, earn various currencies to gain access to upgrades for your equipment, compete in specially formatted Dreadnought battles for sectors and build your corporation to be the best it can be.For a game that can be entirely free to play, this game is a great game. If you wish to so invest, I recommend the Elite Pilot package and the Galaxy Explorer, which will give you three top range fighter ships as a straight up bundle and 35,000 galactic standards to have fun with. The game staff also put sales on for occasions and even do weekend deals, where you can play and gain extra for your work and investment into playing; in other words, the more you play, the more the game will help you.Only thing wrong with the game is the standard of bug testing. Recently heard problems with MacBook Air running OSX El Capitan, but I have been running this game on my 4 year old MacBook Pro for 3 years now and it's working absolutely fine (also on El Capitan). Few texture bugs, but will be resolved soon.8.6/10			"

												Great game. Great graphics. Great controls. Ruined by developers. Perpetual grind. After grinding for 2 years to get destroyers. Yes, that's right, 2 years of gameplay. They introduce these stupid alien ships. This is how it works: The ships require constant upgrading, which requires a super rare thing called xenocrystals. You need these to update your Alien ship. Unfortunately the cost of upgrading the alien ship is soo high in xeno crystals that you can't buy alien weapons. You're expected to purchase crates. Or the crystals. the crystals cost 35 quid. Yes that's right, 35 quid. They give you 2 upgrades, so the ship may be upgraded 1 rank. There are 15 ranks. When they have bled your wallet dry upgrading one ship. They then will introduce another 12-15 ships using the same system of upgrades. And those ships you spent years working for, and some people spent money on? All obsolete. They get blown out the sky by new alien ships. So you can't play the old game. You don't want to play the new game. If you do play the new game, you'll be locked into endless quests to keep up the status quo you don't want to work towards. Now here's the best bit of all. When you do succeed. They developers will introduce new ships that will obsolete the old, and all the time and gaming spent is lost. It's not fun anymore. All the time now people complain about games they play. It's relentlessly stressful and irritating. Right now, there's one ship that destroys everything. No other ships can touch it other than the rank 14 destroyers, you can't build anymore. So you got all these players playing the same ship. Destroying all the starters and people who hate the new alien ships. 120 plus ships with tactical advantage right now, have no advantage of merits anymore. It's just the people with the most alien ship always winning, over and over again. So what was the point of collecting hundreds of ships? The match making system is screwed too. You need to win battles to advance your ships. But you can't win battles, because as soon as you do, the game automatically handicaps you. They put you against an entire team of alien ships. Your entire team gets utterly slammed. There's nothing you can do. You can't advance. You're locked out of progression by the game. To advance now, you have to pay to win. People are so fed up with it, they are leaving the game. But when they leave the game, the game matchmaking has to be less selective about who is matched with whom. This means you can find a rank 10 interceptor only half upgraded, against rank 15 alien ships, and rank 14 discontinued destroyers. It doesn't stand a chance. Then when you die, you realise that it was one of the stupid no respawn levels, and that you should have telepathically know this before the game randomly decided on that mission then you could have selected 4 ships to line up. Now you're locked in a game for 15 minutes watching your team get wiped out against team ridley scott and the facehugger devision. And what can you do? Nothing whatsoever, except wait. Time you don't have. Wasted. You could be playing a game making it more interesting for other players. But you can't because you're locked in a battle you hate, and the game surprised you with. Time to uninstall. I'll reinstall next year when the alien ship nonsense is over.Developer greed is criminal if they just reduced the price of things to 10% of what it is now, i am sure people would buy. But they wont, so actually they end up making much less money. It's really really stupid. Curse the developers of this game. I despise sellouts. In the past I've bought DLCs. Because in the past this was a good game. I got them on discounts because they were priced too high even for fan support. Right now, I don't want to support it. They are ripping people off. When I see my mates getting ripped off, my wallet closes. ♥♥♥♥ the developers. I've got more money than sense right now, but that's not the issue. The issue here is principles, and the developers don't have any. And that's exactly what the developers have done. They've sold out. What a shame.			"

												What it would take to really enjoy this game you could build a bad a55 gaiming rig. The game could be awesome, but because of this extreme pay to progress scheme even the rich can't afford to play this. Some say its pay to win, its not its keep paying to win. Not at a cheap proce reither. To stay on top you will need to waste about 200 to 400 usd a month, sometimes more. Even if you pay it wont be enough. There are many players who have spent thousands on this game and are still unhappy with their progress. What you get for the money spent is not fair. That seems to be the biggest issue with the pay to progress scheme. I fully accept there is not such thing as a free to play. Here there is not much bang for your buck. Most of the good ships cost $40 to $50, and you still need to grind the modules. Some of these ship are only availble by purchase of vouchers. 5x package gets 6 to 10 of these when you need 600 vouchers to unlock it for example. This all across the game. Game has an adicting nature about it, but you end not wining much and die alot because you cant upgrade your stuff to have a fair fight. "

												When I first got this game (i believe it was in the spring of 2015) it was great, if somewhat overwhelming. once you get used to it the combat is fluid and the graphics are pretty cool. However, at the time my PC was pretty crappy and couldnt run SC well, which impacted my performance - it's very hard to react in combat with massive stuttering. I took about 2 months to research some upgrades for my PC and gather the money for it.Once I upgraded my PC I could run the game like a dream - but I couldnt do anything worthwhile! The ranked match system is awful because it only allows specific ranks at certain times - and there's a 12 hour wait in between rank blocks, and in that time nobody of that rank is in unranked PvP. This wouldnt be that bad if PvE lobbies consisted of more than a handful of brain dead quarter-wits who havent learned to fire their weapons yet.I might try again in a few months, see if this is remedied. Until then Im steering clear of thisNOTE: If you like space shooters/RPGs look up Freelancer by digital Anvil. Its old (and not on steam) but its well crafted, highly moddable, and still has people regularly playing online (you will need a mod like FL Universe or Hamburg City to play online, only takes like 10 minutes to find and install)			"

												Uhhhh... Well-- I'm in an awkward possition here. I played the Open Beta for a few hours, then life got in the way and I forgot this game existed, so after I saw ""DESTROYERS"" I, of course, was interested.Well, I see it hasn't changed the core design so much. This isn't really a good thing. I was never a fan of the PvP combat before, so with destroyers in thy midst, I enjoy it a little less so. To add to that, the interceptors don't really feel like 'interceptors'. More like sleek bread-boxes with a fan on the back, slowly drifting through space.The grind isn't that enjoyable either. Matches are hard enough to get into, and I don't really like being blown out of the sky by two ""rocketeers"" and a ""turtle"", two of the most annoying ships in the PvE. I play PvE because that's the only level I can be almost effective at. In PvP, everyone has snipers.Everywhere.It just don't really... Feel it-- you know?It doesn't feel good to play.I'm sorry, but I'm just not into it anymore.Maybe it gets better?			"

												Don't bother. With the new update, you either have a destroyer or you are in for a♥♥♥♥♥♥of a time.Game got much better from time ago, but these destroyers are just:1) OP2) unfun to face3) everywhere4) never balanced between teams. You will see almost always 5-6 destroyers on a team and 1 on the other, guess who winsThey suck the fun out of the game.EDIT: and with every update things are getting worse. ""Hey, destroyers have two counters and both need to close range. Why don't we make them deny EVEN HARDER the zone around them? Just ♥♥♥♥ those pesky CovOps, let's deal HUGE RANDOM DAMAGE that bypasses shields"".If i see ONE gravitational lens deal with a ceptor i'm so done with this game.EDIT 2: Now with T4 (rank 11) destroyers. Guess what? They get in fights against rank 9 (and i only have rank 9 ships in my loadout) and obviously stomp all around having 400k EHP (for comparison, my toughest rank 9 tank frigate has around 60k EHP, MUCH less range, damage and no static barrier to soak up 30k damage basically for free)			"

												The Game is great - but i prefer to not spend any money ! Why ? Star conflict has a few unsolved bugs and the support is the worst support i've ever seen. I spent about 130,- EUR for DLCs and ingame credits. While playing the game i earned about 9 mil. credits and bought a blueprint to upgrade a weapon to MK5 level. After purchasing the blueprint, i cannot use it but the credits are gone :( This is my bad way started.... I used the ticket system of gaijin and reported my problem using screenshots. The normal way to report bugs is to use the gaijin forum, but after i've created my forum account, i didnt have the permission to create a post - this is the reason why i decided to use the ticket system. The gaijin support does not solve my problem ! First they wanted me to link my steam account to the gaijin account. Ok done...even no permissions to create a post. The next step was to contact the forum admin to report a bug in order to report a bug :( This is the way gaijin is dealing with their customers....			"

												Although it says I currently only have ~4 hours of in-game time for Star Conflict, I've actually played for 22.5 days (540 hours) as of the time of this review, and just reinstalled it using the Steam client. Star Conflict is an arcade-style MMO space shooter game, offering PvP (team deathmatches, capture the beacon, etc.) and PvE (set missions, instanced ""open space"") game modes.Overall, I have enjoyed it and would recommend as a fun game, primarily for its PvP modes, but with caveats. This game is for people who like flying around in pew pew space fighter ships; it is NOT a macro/econ type game (e.g. EVE) on a vast scale. Playable maps are bound (but rather beautiful to play in IMO), and ""open space"" feels obviously instanced, i.e. it isn't truly ""open space.""PROS:- Fun arcade-style space shooter game (primarily PvP--again, IMO)- Multiple ship classes to choose from, build customization- Pew pew lasers, missiles- PvP modes are fast-paced- Free to play (F2P), with purchasable extras (game is not Pay to Win (P2W), IMO)CONS:- Small game population (queue times, matchmaker can be annoying)- Grind becomes rather evident- Underdeveloped econ system; no player tradingIn conclusion, it's a free game, and can potentially be a lot of fun. It does take a bit of time investment, but for someone who's looking for a space fighter game, this might be a good one to take a look at. GL HF!			"

												Beautiful, Exciting, and highly addicting. Definitely one of my favourite games. Easy to get into, but with plenty of story and tactics to learn. Every ship is highly customisable: Piloting a frigate? How about a tough, durable, and very well armed ship at the cost of speed? Or maybe a lightweight Frigate capable of dishing out punishment and avoiding it from others? The game is essentially two combined, with Pilots starting off doing missions or PVP against other players in selected matches, and later advancing to be able to completely undock and explore on their own. Both give you options to fly and shoot at will.			"

												If Star Conflict would have been a pvp only game or an arena only game I never would have tried it...but...it also has pve, missions in open space and enemies that stop you from traveling too far in what you might think is a good ship. I have ships up to level 8 now, some elite, and barely can do missions 2 gates out from the base. Theres a ton to see yet, when you are ready. I really think even at level 12 there will be lots to do. The game looks decent graphically, and the ships are nice to look at too with a wide range of weapons.Really wish there was first person piloting but oh well.Like most FTP games it has a shop and without it you will grind for a long time to get good ships. The new detroyers are only available if you build one, and that takes quite a while, so grinding is standard for many things, and ships level 8 or higher can cost a million or more. So you'll need a lot of time or cash to become really sucessful here, but it is fun, so how you do it is up to you.			"

												This game has its good sides and bad sides.First of all, the handling of the ship is absolutely perfect, there are a lot of games that could learn a thing or two about fluid controls from this game. The ships handling is fast, responsive, easy to learn, and will allow you to move your ship more or less any way you would want to.Second, the quality of the graphics is very high, I would even go as far as saying they are beautiful. The last space game that I played was freelancer, and this game totally blows freelancer out of the water when it comes to the graphics.Third, the overall layout is intuitive and easy to understand. You will have no problem at all figuring out where you go to get new weapons, or what you have to click to go do missions, everything is layed out in a simple but good looking interface.However, the game suffers from that DLC nonsense we have all seen time and time again, and has other problems too.The biggest problem for me, is how generic everything is, it has a serious lack of personality. While the graphics are beautiful, they are beautiful graphics of generic looking things. Generic space stations, generic ships, generic races/factions, generic everything.The whole game, feels like it was put together by highly competent and passionate developers, who were forced into doing things the way the suited business men wanted it done. Namely, DLC and stuff.To me, it feels like a game that was made to fit a business model, instead of a business model made to fit a game. In other words, I think the idea to make money from a space game came before the idea to make a space game with this one.The second biggest problem, is that if you want to go PVP, or PVE, you have to wait to join some seperate instance thing. This procedure can take as much as a minute or two, and it causes the game to feel fragmented. Personally, I would preffer a large open space to explore, rather than lots of seperate instances to load.Overall, considering how much choice there is out there, I would not recommend this game.Having said that, it is totally free to download and play, and you don't really have anything to lose. The file is a few gig, and there will be an update after, so maybe leave it downloading and installing over night, and give it a try the next morning.5/10 that could so easy be a 10/10 with some tweeking.

												wait a moment before you ignore this to look at posetive reviews. i need to tell you somthing;this game is here for a few good years and i can tell you it was a great space shooterthat other posetive reviews would describe. but now it went down the drain thanks to devs that cant take somthing out of the game becous it would hurt threr income as it makes the game so grindy VERY GRINDY that players would pay that to avoid it but to avail(i hope i said the correctly) as the grind is endless for all and threre it is:1. destroyers: these are big and evil ships withe 6 times more firepower and 5 times more survivelabilety, the have all kinds of modoules that make them imposible to deafeat as a normal ship, sounds good?, oh you want it? no,no,no you cant only for players that payed, lets say around the 30-60 usd  on packs can get them meybe even more if you are unlucky with the packs (the are rendomised) 2.the pvp: now you would say :"" but hay i know you will say evryone are cheaters and/or p2w people but its not true evrything its fine you just need to : get good"". as i expected but NO if you get the real nice prichiumz stuff you will get 2-3 times better ans skill doesnt really matter anyway just shoot to the front and use the better weopen. oh and did i tell you that even if you gear up on 100% primium stuff a destryoer will still stomp all over you in five seconds? , no? well you know now3.open space:its simply an open worls whre if you dont have 3-5 other poeple with you (at least one destroyer) the open space NPC's will demolish you as the come in groups of 3 or 5 and even if you manege to have a fair battle withe some of them a new group will spawn not to far from you  .oh, did a tell you open space is not even profitble if your just looking fot loot?, well i did nowand for the finele:its not getting better as the devs are making it worse evey update so i do tell  you that if you want to play it wait untill the devs will fix what they did, if they will even do that.and one last thing: the other posetive reviews you will see are people that played the game untill rank 5. as you dont see destroyers and you cant go to open space at rank 5 or lower.hope this helped you understand what this it and i also hope you understanded my spaelling.

												Game wont even let me log in with new registration...They setup a non-in game registration process, email confirmation system only to find it doesnt work.  Can't log into the game please contact support.  I didn't get a chance to play a single second of the game because of log-in error so that tells me everything I need to know about the rest of the game.  No thanks, the first thing I dont want to do when testing out a new game is TO CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT....			"

												WAR THUNDER IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!A year ago, that would've been a compliment. Since then, I'm 95%  sure that Gaijin's entire development team was murdered by robots and replaced by a belligerent artificial intelligence that only cares about squeezing money from the playerbase while trying to make Gaijin's once-majestic games as anti-fun as possible. It also completely ignores any and all player requests and/or feedback. Now Star Conflict is more like a crappy pay-2-win version of Dark Souls (in space). Ranks 1-6 are still ok, if you don't mind grinding through the crummy tier 1 & 2 starter ships, but past that? Get ready to die. A lot. ...Unless you invest a crazy amount of time/money building a destroyer. BTW, Gaijin's idea of ""balance improvements"" in the last patch was giving the new Rank 11 destroyers a black-hole gun that bypasses shields and rips apart smaller ships in seconds, and giving T3 bots maxed-out T5 ships with red-quality mods and +50% to firepower, shields, and hull strength. Yeah. As of patch 1.3.3, Star Conflict is still technically free to play, so if you want to help stick it to the 'bots by using up their server bandwidth without paying, then go for it - but for the love of god DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON  THIS GAME. You WILL regret it in the long run.			"

												At this point i feel after years of playing it is safe to say most of the new content being added is just cash shop items. The constant and ever expanding list of premium materials is just what seems to be the back drop on a gold digging F2P game. its hard to even say its P2W when most of what you can get through the games cash shop is a gamble through chest.

												I played this game for nearly 1500 hours using game launcher and if don't believe me, check my achievements. There is no way you can get them in an hour or a day or even a week.Developers say it is a team game, but unfortunately it is not. In fact it punishes you for being in group with a friend, increasing your queue time dramatically. If there is no any other group to place against you, just forget about battle.Open space is very limited and boring. Randomly generated quests are basically 3 types: kill a thing or many things, protect the transport, fly to to another thing and activate/pickup it, and activating and picking it up is the same action to be honest. Some of daily quests there are too difficult for a single person, but you will never find anyone to help you because as said above, there is no reason to team up, unless you want to wait half a day to enter pvp battle.Want to give developers feedback or report a bug on their forum? Dont forget to add how great their game is, any negative feed back will be wiped out in minutes.I really want to recommend this game but i can't. "

												Star Conflict feels like the space game you always wanted to play at first. It has open space, variety of ships, some tactics, some looting, many elements of the genre are present in this game.And yet it's a bitter experience; that of an unfulfielled promise. Like an attractive looking candy that ends up tasting like♥♥♥♥♥♥Soon it won't really matter which ship you use, what matter is that you have level up your ship to its full potential. Soon tactics won't matter, what matters is that you get the lowest ping. The game physics has a terribly ping adverse behavior: ping > 380ms (not even THAT high) will send your ship wobbling uncontrollably. Soon it won't matter that you know how to pilot a ship, you'll be so over-dominated in even the most basic PvE missions, that it will require an hour of re-tries before you get your loot.The progress is so ridiculously slow past level 11, that it is not even worth attempting.Finally, the social aspect. Almost inexistant, for a multiplayer game.			"

												I started playing this game about a year ago.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would play it a few hours a day, never able to fully leave it (I'd quit and come back a half hour later wondering why I quit).I stopped for a bit and came back and it was a different game.  Not only did they nerf the game completely, they added so much more DLC cash grabbing bs.  I've tried to legitimize keeping it around, and I'm finally uninstalling it today.  Same game modes but more difficult, crappy open world, no more new game modes that subvert the original game, etc.  Such a depression outcome to such a glorious start.			"

												Star Conflict is a nearly flawless (in my opinion) space combat simulator. The complexities and the fun of this space combat build slowly through the levels, starting from a very high standard and getting better from there. There is an adequate crafting minigame and some half-baked questing. Optimizing the ship is made up of several minigames taken collectively. Optimization in its several pieces makes up a good, fun minigame.      There are areas of the game in need of improvement, yet the game as a whole is certainly in the top ten percent of space simulators. This review makes the case that Star Conflict is easily THE BEST f2p space combat simulator. We will not dwell on the shortcomings here, because the idea here is that you should just enjoy the game as it is at any given time and mostly let the devs worry about how to improve it. Overall, this is a great game.     If you are very diligent in researching the reviews, you will find many reviews that say, ""This game used to be great, but they ruined it."" These people are trying to help you, and they are giving you their honest opinion. But they are limited in focus to the particular changes that annoyed them, and in my opinion most of them would admit they are not really reviewing the game as a whole.     Here is the real reason for all the ""They ruined the game!"" reviews: When the devs make something new, they want the community to step into the new material and try it out. Therefore, as it is in almost any game that has ongoing development, NEW STUFF IS ALWAYS OVERPOWERED. Once everyone has tried it, the devs scale it back into balance with the rest of the game. Some of the 'they ruined it' reviews are due to new stuff coming in overpowered, and some of these reviews are due to previously overpowered content finally being balanced with the rest of the game.     The game is living and evolving. This is a good thing! Your investment in this game will be rewarded with all kinds of new adventures, and the fun never stops. Yes, read all the reviews. But please understand the underlying reasons for the huge variety of reviews is a very good thing: a great game that grows and evolves over time. What are you waiting for?			"

												Smooth graphic engine, precision control over your ship & weapons, all packaged up with fun skirmish mode of gameplay. Although the game modes are limited at the moment, the core game is solid with plenty of ships & items to unlock or buy. Mechanics also implemented for character/faction progression which also in-turn adds more customisation options. The netcode is really good resulting in a positive multiplayer online experience. Is it a MMO .. No, are the DLCs good value .. No, but try it for free & buy some in-game credits for boosters .. the rest you can quickly earn in battle! If you are a fan of space sims, sci-fi or competitive gameplay check this out.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												I can't personally recommend this game to play. It's not F2P as u can read in description40$ for one ship bundle (i mean Tharg'a, 15k GS price, not even fully 'perk'd') is way too much. Sure, u can play at default ships. But don't forget about 'unique' modules at premium ships :DDevs took wrong way to 'dance' with community making everything as awfull as hardkuk-grind without any donuts. This grind is even harder when u don't own special scanner to find good items in open space.Open space is dead. Until it won't be as alive as in EVE and PvP would be normal game mode (not when one 'pro' which donated over 1k$ oneshots 10 normal players; one team gets premade of 3 guys, other gets noone; 7 Tharga's cancer' in enemy team, 1 in yours and they farm your spawn).Most of reviews are with thumbs up from those 'devs-friendly' corps&pilots.I don't whine about destro's, devs must understand that chances to win for both teams must be equal. Do they even tried to make new account and try to play on lvl 1-3? When u meet lvl 6-9 ships in enemy team? The dev will say, they are nearly equal at stats&eff. And that's all. Thx god they boosted ranks of Gargoyle and other cancer ship to lvl 11.P.S And btw, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy which was working on achievements thought that adding Achievement which goal is to kill over million of AI controlled units or pirates (which will rekt u on top-tier ships faster than u) in open space to get karma lvl 5 is very fun and adds 'replay-ability'.

												Update: This is now litterally one of the WORST games I have ever played, and that's coming from someone who has played this game like a loyal dog since 2013 and has almost 4,000 hours on it. THE DEVS ARE KILLING THE GAME ONE UPDATE AT A TIME, almost EVERYTHING you can think of has a MAJOR (sometimes even game breaking) problem with it. There is no balance in this game anymore, everything is Pay 2 Win, well no. This game has something worse than Pay 2 Win, it's something far worse, it's Pay 2 Proceed With Gameplay. Not even like a subscription based thing like other MMOs, that's fine, but this? No, you've got to spend like, several hundred dollars to complete most things. Sure there's ways to do it legit, but it takes grinding worth 18 hours a day every day of your life for. Want to play this game legit without paying? Are you a guy? Yes? Well sucks for you, cause the only way to play this game without paying is to get drunk, knocked up, pregnant, and then play on maternity leave for 9 months, then rinse and repeat. This game has become a total piece of crap. Everyone (well everyone who has a recognizable name) in this game respects me because of how well I typically take  the updates and somehow continue to play loyaly throughout four years, but EVOLUTION was the LAST STRAW! THIS GAME IS GARBAGE! EVEN THE MISSIONS ARE BROKEN, AND THEY DON'T EVEN INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF BROKEN UNBALANCED GAMEPLAY!			"

												StarConflict was honest and skill-dependent 3d space arcade.With quite nice graphical part and high potential. New friends have been found, and some of best time spent playing.Due to greedy managing and questionable developers all positive sides degraded into awful matter.This is not simply a Pay2Win game. This is a Keep Paying 2 Win. (©Gizmo.mac)Greed is good. This is developer’s motto. Development process was simplified: Create new IMBA ship which will dominate the battlefield.Make it expensive and available for real money. Make grind to new ship long and painful.As soon as ordinary players get enough resources to get this dominating ship - nerf it, and roll out new IMBA.Even investing 600$ may only grant you domination for a month or two, then your precious ship will be nerfed to brick.You pay more, or die from another ""happy customer"" as everyone else.Nobody cares about player’s opinion. Player can be banned for little to no reason. But - if you invest enough money in game - your ban can be revoked, allowing you to scam, grief and cheat again.Forum ban can be gained just for having your own opinion, or not hailing developers.In-game chat ban can be gained just automatically - with no reason.Full account ban can be gained by cheating, or arguing with GM, or writing a negative Steam review.All bans can be revoked by writing a positive Steam review.Look at game time on positive reviews - how much players recently exceed game time of 100 hours? Targem just forges positive ratings by face accounts IMO.There is no control over GM's and CM's, with complete disrespect to players from their side.Example - Community manger calling me ""scum"" constantly on his stream, ended up treating to ban my whole team - because he was killed and we were clearly winning.Another example - league system discussion stream. Top corporation’s leaders present, decision was made that leagues will be in 8vs8 format.Leagues were started as 4vs4 - nobody cares about player’s opinion, even if they ask.For all years of the game existence I witnessed an ad less than five times.When the game was released on Steam - there were high online - for a month. Somehow people in charge wasn't aware that their servers already operated at peak power, and lots of new players just pushed the system to lag hell.No new servers were added, new players went elsewhere, and with maximum online of 600 I may get ""Server under heavy load"" message.Now, what will you get if you will try to play StarConflict now?Until you will reach Rank 4 ships - there will be a pale shadow of its former beauty and glory.Almost balanced, somewhat slow, with less options for modules but so nice.Progressing further will bring you into feeding frenzy of epic proportions. Unless you will invest A LOT in the game - you will be cannon fodder. Again and again, with progression slowed on purpose, hard caps on income unless by money investment and matchmaking weird enough to put you against ships 5 ranks higher than yours.Old days, when skill determined an outcome of the fight are gone. It's hard to overcome auto-aiming weapons, auto-healing enemy ships, and your team hiding under brown rocks whole match.Certain team compositions are unkillable on progression ships. Until you will farm or pay enough to get a counter-class ship yourself - you will be farmed. With little to no chance you will be stomped upon.If your stats become high - expect totally useless team as a boulder on your neck, have a happy time carrying these. And again. And again.And be prepared - some in-game activity can be accessed only through third-party site. There are no control about that site, but rewards and progression are counted on it. So pay no attention if there are shifts in final teams, or people not present in battles are rewarded.Latest addition - game items stockpile are limited now - so you can't stockpile resources now, you have no motivation to do quests, or everything you gain get burned.All my DLC are next to useless now.All my premium ships are next to useless now.All my time spent on leveling progression ships is wasted now.This is official cheating from developers.Conclusion: Targem and Gaijin combined efforts have killed StarConflict. Not worthy of your time now, not recommended anymore. R.I.P.Yes this Review is copy paste one to one from  my friend and wingmate Devouder. And he beat with then the nail on thead.I loved the game, spend a lot of hours in there and now.. i see them fall.			"

												Old review was outdated due to significant changes to the game. Many good, many bad. Pending finalization and personal experience with these changes, I will update my review then.Don't assume old reviews are still true. A lot has changed. Many of the old positives are gone, and in exchange not nearly enough of the negatives are addressed.This game had so much potential. Each of the hours I've played prior to the Destroyers release was fun in one way or another. But since then, disaster after disaster has come down the pipeline, and the devs don't seem to care. Any game that's like that, you should stay away from.Don't play it. It used to be incredible. But not anymore.If you're curious about how my opinion has changed over time, the best way would be a ratings scale with time:July 2014 (Started playing): 7/10August 2014 (1.0 Release) 8/10April 2015 (1.1.3, Dreadnoughts Release) 8.75/10May 2015 (1.1.4) 9.25/10September 2015 (1.2, Dogs of War, Ms Summer Quests) 8/10November 2015 (1.2.3, Sweeping changes to rank-based queues) 7/10December 2015 (1.3, Destroyers Release) 5.5/10March 2016 (1.3.4, T4 Destroyers) 4.5/10April 2016 (1.3.5, New ""Ship-Specific-Parts"" system) 4/10June 2016 (1.3.8, Currency counts increased again) 3/10MOST RECENT AS OF THIS REVIEW:October 2016 (1.3.12, T5 Destroyers, affirmations of all previous bad decisions) 2/10			"

The game has a lot going for it.  Smooth controls, nice visuals, but it becomes 2 dimensional really quickly and the PvP is just a camp fest.  No one actually flies or skirmishes, the paying players just hang at the back and blankly shoot.  On the whole not worth getting into.			"

												Nope -- just nope. Gainjin seems halfway decent in War Thunder, making the grind not so bad.  This game on the other hand is a damned grind-fest. We play games to wind down after work, they shoudln't feel like a second freakin' job. Also, dunno if the admins are from gaijin (I wonder) or from Star Gem, but they... are bad.  I felt like the several interactions between players and the company's lackeys was very unprofessional and felt like the admins were 12 year olds on a power trip. They're also extremely absusive towards players, and dish out lots of trash-talk but can't take a professional sounding rebuttal.  Kind amakes me sad because the engine behind the game is really good, and there is a lot of potential there for them to have an excellent game, easily outclassing many others in the genre.  But the company's incessant demand for pay2win and abusive admin/GMs ruin the game.			"

												Star Conflict survives because it is one of the few games that does what it does.Pro's:Nice, quality graphics that are at the right level of detailLarge-scale, small-ship battles. If anoyne knows another game that does that (and isn't 10 years old with a dead playerbase), let me know.Interesting world with an evolving (if very hidden storyline).Relatively decent assymetric balance outside noted below.Con's:PAY TO WIN. This game is about as pay to win as you can get. TECHNICALLY you can get everything in the game with sufficient grind. But sufficient grind for the latest and greatest items is measured in months or even a year, by which time it's been nerfed, and the cycle has started again. And the latest items ARE the greatest. If you've got a gaming wallet with thousands (Not an exaggeration, by the way), then this game might be for you.Awful developers. Extremely sensitive to feedback, any post on the official forums that is slightly critical gets deleted rapidly by moderators. If you don't have a direct line (pay to feedback maybe?) to the developers, you aren't getting heard unless it's sunshine and roses.Awful server availability. This depends a little on where you are, but over half of the games will be played on Russian servers, and ping matters for true competitiveness. If you live in Europe then this isn't as much of a consideration.The community is about average for a free, competitive game, at least the English-speaking part is. No more toxic than most, but no less.Overall, there is plenty in the game to enjoy but it's spoilt by terrible balance towards extreme wallet warriors and devs that focus on short term cash decisions.

												//This game has great graphics and free-style fighting, but there are simply a few things that I hate about this game for which I don't recommend it.1. Why can't I just leave the hangar and fly around for the feels? I dislike that you have to be level 6 in order to go roam the skies. Which leads to my next point.2. That maximum amount of wait time of 3 minutes is a lie. I've waited upwards of 5 minutes to get a match, and then I waited all the way to 8 minutes before quitting and writing this review.3. Do I really need to find other players to compete with me against the computer? It kinda defeats the whole purpose of Player vs. Al. And it doesn't help me get any closer to level 6.			"

												Played only for a whileEnjoyed the undock option and going through portals and whatnot(was well done)PVE and Co-op was alright (in terms of gameplay and such)General gameplay pretty good, what kept me playing for a while.VERY optimized game, not balanced at all though. Would not recomend it since it's big P2W game. I used to play this when it first came out and it was a lot of fun and more balanced than I thought it would be. But coming back to this a couple of years later it feels redundant and unbalanced, where as before it feelt like my skill had an impact on how well I peformed it now feels how much I've payed dictates that. The fact that PVP always teams you up with people using destroyer class ships and can annihilate your ship with only one or two shots says something about PVP. Or the fact that people in co-op or PVE also kept doing the same thing. Don't get me wrong I played tons of the matchs and I always got first, second or third, except for PVP. They all had something in common though, the top players would had max synergizied ships and annihilated everything in a couple of hits. This was either due to them having BOUGHT things to further their powers or matchmaking simply being awful and having no other choice then team you up with vetereans. Either way Would not recomend this game. For this kind of game it feels like it should be possible for players to have somewhat of an effect even if they're free to play players based on their skill, manuevring and risk assesment. But it seems the devs takes the free to play idea in a ball and give the p2w bat to the buyers and lets them hit it out the arena in a homerun.  "

												Retried Playing, seems the devs first ask ""can we make money on this update"", if yes, push it out immediately, even if incomplete. then the second question is ""how can we make this impossible for people who don't pay?"" and balance accordingly to that.PvE: get past T3 ships and want to do PvE with your new T4 ships? Tough luck, you'll die in seconds no matter which ship it is. The Teirs for PvE are so wide they become impossible without a team that has the higher teir on the spectrum.PvP: Dead. Litterally go kill yourself before playing T3+ PvP. The matchmaking places the New T4 destroyers down into T3 PvP matches. They insta kill the T3 destroyers making them worthless. along with every other ship in T3 and T4. The game basically says ""hey look at how these new destroyers totally ♥♥♥♥ you up! Even though they aren't in the same teir!"" yeah, or I can say ♥♥♥♥ the matchmaking for PvP untill it's fixed.OpenSpace: now requires Higher Rank ships to access. Works Better now. HOWEVER. it's boring as ♥♥♥♥. there is almost nothing to do. you'll get killed by the Aliens easily no matter what rank ship you have (except destroyers OR running away with tacklers.) oh, and now there is an absurd resource grind in open space. the dailies make some things not so grindy. but materials like neodium, beryllium, or anything else that can't be obtained by salvaging modules can only be obtained out here... in incredibly small amounts IF you can even find a node that has them.Oh and be ready for the Synergy Grind.

												Fun for a while, but like every freemium game, you get to a certain point of progression where it stops being fun and becomes a HUGE grindfest, requiring you to, you guessed it, give them money to advance at a decent rate.There are a number of balance issues in pvp, pve while fun gets repetitive and the free roaming feels very closed in and limited. There are some free roam NPCs in ""high-sec"" (for want of a better term, anyone that's played EVE Online knows what I mean) that annihilate rank 10 premium ships without a struggle, which further puts you off wanting to do any of the daily quests you get given.Graphically it's average, some aspects look really good but most of it is underwhelming. Aside from one patch that broke fps in the hangar for 2 days before they very quickly fixed it, it runs silky smooth. Any rig from the past 3-4 years should hit 60+fps easy.The one big problem I have with this game aside from the freemium aspect; the community. There are some very nice people that play it, but the majority just seem to be on a mission to do nothing but grief or troll 24/7, and a lot of people are just plain bad at the game. Most of these people are in clans. Any time I would play alone and do pve with randoms there would usually be one average-to-bad player and 2 clanners that don't communicate, resulting in almost certain failure.Play it with friends. If you can't convince friends to play with you, do your very best to remain patient and prepare yourself for inconsistent PvP match-making and rage-inducing PvE teammates.			"

It is not unbalanced with this, as balancing game elements is almost daily for developers.it's still in Beta,still not officially released , and gets better day by day !it is something like almost an Indie game, is beautiful, and can be, not even in maximum graphics quality , which makes it compatible with many pcs, only need to make it more public, and have more ppl, so another reason to try it!

												Star Conflict is a good MMO free-to-play, with all the problems that such a statement carries. If you don't want to pay to purchase content, is better that you schedule long days to accumulate resources playing, especially after a few levels. For the rest know that downloading it you will find yourself in front of a space shooter from well-made but decidedly anonymous in his generals and unoriginal in.			"

												If you looking for good Free2Play space game STAY AWAY!Cons:- pay2win- matchmaker- servers- cheatersPros:+ you can uninstall it without problemsThis game is NOT Free2Play it is Free2Pay. Pay2Win is everywhere and New Year update make it even worse. Devs strategy is to introduce powerful ship that you can only buy or grind for months/buy and after they earn enough they ""balance"" them to point of usefulness and introduce new one that you must have to keep up.This game is dying, dev know that for a long time and made changes to cover that. They change matchmaker many times to compensate low player base and now it is completely broken. Game gives the advantage to a lower level ships thanks to the ridiculous buffs system and veteran players abuse this system! Why they should play R15 ships when R11-12 with buffs are more tougher and stronger and you can easly win with R15 (the same applies to the lower ranks).Gaijin support is useless except cases when you ask which button press to pay.

												Seems like Gajin is on the move again.With the ""allien"" arrival of this game, the older ships and destroyers are meaningless, the engineers are useless now, the dessies had a nerf now they are paper planes. So you worked hard for that r8 or r11 dessie? Oh, you silly! You get swarmed by 1 thar ga or more, game over man.This is out of hand, now there are matches where half of the team are only allien ships. They have extreme firepower, insane amount of modules and regen capabilities. So how you counter that? You have to maufacture your own allien ship and GRIND YOUR FACE ON CONCRETE FOR MATERIALS. Also the so cool dreadnought battles are forgotten as well. I'll stop playing this for a while, I keep ranting on matches, and all my bloody progress holds no meaning now because the blessed Thar ga.

												The only reason I can't recommend this game is the Pay2Win setup. I played this game since beta, and I'm a returning player. It used to be really fun and anjoyable, and fairly balanced. But now, everything is nothing more than a microtransaction.Want to set a premade avatar? Real money. Want to build a ship? Grind forever or real money. Want to upgrade modules? Grind or real money. Want a ship that's on par with the P2W ships? Real money.Overall, the gameplay itself is excellent and the variety in ships is....average for the life of this game. Graphics are pretty good too. I like the pacing in the game when it comes to combat. Other games with a similar feel (Dreanought and Fractured Space) are too slow for my liking.The devs also are super restrictive with their forums. Need a guide? Don't bother. All the posts are a year or more old. All posts require dev approval. At the time of updating this review, I've waited almost 2 weeks for a forum post to be approved for a guide (probably why the forums are dead). Don't bother criticizing their devs on their forum though, those posts are immediately deleted from what I've been told.All-in-all, it's free. Give it a shot and see if you like it. I'm leaving my thumbs down because there are some serious progression/grind flaws, lack of dev transparency, and obvious P2W issues. But the gameplay itself is good once you spend weeks upgrading modules to be useful, lol			"

												Imagine Warthunder is space without the 1st person view. Now also imagine being combined with an actual MMO with Space free roaming feel. YOu have ship tiers just like Warthunder, Ships upgrades work a bit different. Every ship has abilities of its own and special faction abilities. 3 factions can be chocen from, contracts can be signed with different factions and upon completing their goals you will recive that special factions currency. You can allways switch factions and being in different onse will not stop you from playing with your friend in a party. If you like space, this is something you should try. You may not keep playing it, but atleast you had a good time while you played! Its free so why the hell not!			"

												I highly recommend this game. I like to play it daily, but never for more than an hour or two. Lets begin with the fact that it is free to play. In Star Conflict you pilot a space ship in approximately 10 minute matches. The matches include; Combat Recon: a deathmatch like game where two teams face off against each other and may respawn after death only as long as their captain is alive. Detonation: A capture the flag-like game where two team attempt to pick up a bomb and deliver it to enemy stations, winning when no enemy stations remain. Capture: Is a three point domination game where holding a base is worth points, so which ever team holds the most points over a duration will win. Domination: Is an elimination match, you when when you cap three enemy bases or you kill the enemy team. Hunt: Is a one moving point domination game where one of three points is active for 70 seconds during which the team who controls it earns points.Players advance through a ranking system by earning credits (money) and synergy (xp). Players quickly gain access to three different hull types; Interceptors: Small-sized, lightly armed and shielded, agile, fast ships. Fighters: Medium-sized, heavily armed and lightly shielded ships. Frigates: Large-sized, heavily armed and shielded, slow ships. For the three hulls there are three sub-classes for every hull type. For Interceptors there are Covert Ops, Recon, ECM, each specializing in defeating a particular type of ship or performing a particular task. For Fighters there are Gunship, Tackler, Command. For Frigates there are Guard, Engineer, Long Range.There are three factions, being a member of a particular faction will only determine who your opponents are. A player may purchase ships from any faction. Within each faction is a ship tree showing all the ships available and the path you must take to unlock them. Each faction will offer contracts that reward the player with special currencies that will allow for upgrades of specific weapons.The game play is highly addictive. The controls are simple and intuitive. The game is enjoyable at every tier. Game servers handle latency very well. You wont get killed by the really laggy guy you never saw or not be able to hit the guy who skips all around.For a free game that states it is a BETA, the devs keep you posted about updates and changes to the game and there are frequent updates.My only complaint is that the player base is low, so the match making system can take 5 minutes to put you into a match during off-peak playing hours. During peak hours its usually under 30 seconds. In addition, the low player base forces the match maker to create matches that are slightly imbalanced ie everyone on the other team is more skilled than everyone on yours etc. "

												Great game, more like World of Tanks than Gaijin's other game War Thunder. Star Conflict has many different weapons, modules and overall setups and types of gameplay. New players can become disoriented quickly with the X, Y, Z movement and rolling camera views. Matchmaking at this time can take a few minutes due to a small player base during Western primetime as this game is Russian. I'd give it a 8/10 mostly because it has the long wait for matches sometimes and doesn't have much easily accessible information and that can result in your grind becoming longer.			"

												A lobby based space shooter.What's good.1) Great space fighter with much more customization options than the rivals, through diverse module slot distribution and multiple types of weapons with interesting mechanics.2) Almost perfect free to play model. The grind is not too much (though it's certainly there), and the ships you can buy with money are not strictly superior (though they are better in some ways, just like every ship has their own quirks).3) Very nice gradual learning, you start with very few options, slower ships, only one game mode, and you ramp up the number of modules and modes you can use gradually through the tiers.4) Developing competitive side. Observer system already in place, tournaments are held, teams are preparing well ahead.5) Multiple game modes with their own interesting mechanics and multiple maps, some very imaginative.What's bad1) Low population, and all that comes with this. Sometimes long Q times for some modes.2) No skill based matchmaking, so everyone is thrown into the game as equals (except squads who have to be matched by an enemy squad), which sometimes lead to very unbalanced matches.3) The game is not really dynamic compared to shooters like Freelancer or even Moon Breakers, if you fly anything other than an interceptor than you usually strafe behind cover more than you dogfight, which is fine for frigates but a bit weird for a fighter.4) Somewhat lacking balance, one shiptree (graph) (Jericho) is considered strictly inferior in most areas to the others. Hopefully will be patched, and anyone can play anything anyways, it's not restricted, players don't belong to a side.All in all, a very enjoyable space shooter, even if somewhat grindy, but if you enjoy your game, you won't notice it at all.Sincerely: [NASA]fasz			"

												My last review on this game was too much one-sided. Star Conflict has its upsides, such as a a great player vs. A.I. combat system, but a defunct and thoroughly unbalanced PvP Simulated Combat type. Its Matchmaking is on vacation, its open world is unbalanced depending on where you go, or what ship type you use and by that extent, what weapons and equipment you bring with you. If you are into grinding endlessly to get new upgrades in a show of pace that would make Destiny seem like a second-rate Duck Hunt County-Fair Game, then this is for you. If you like Big open-world maps with O.P. A.I. running amuk, then this is also the game for you. Star Conflict is not a game for wimps or players who give into stress-pressure too easily, or who quit after only less than 5 hours of gameplay. You ahve been warned: THIS IS A LONG GAME. It's long and difficult to gain rank and/or experience, and even more difficult if you dont give-in and buy GC with actual $$ to spend on new fully-maxed ships and upgrades, but it is still fun to an extent. If you like fast combat, slow grind, but attentive combat, then I would highly recommend this game. If you are into fast combat and equally fast tier-based ranking, like in games along the lines of Battlefield, Eve, and BattleStar Galactica Online, This is not the game for you, please keep scrolling or you will be surely disappointed. This game is focused on a select crowd of space-based MMO gamers. If you're interests match what has been described, then by all means, play. If not, then as I have said before, you have been warned.			"

												updated again: since the alien ships have come in and the new weapons, the game is highly unbalanced. It appears that the only way to truly enjoy yourself on this game is to play pve and open space missions. PVP has been completely ruined with the new ships, and it seems like they are increasingly hard to get without paying real money for the packages. IMO only play this game if you want to roam around in space, and it really is no longer worth it during pvp. After all the hours I put into this game, I basically never play it anymore because of this.Updated Review:So this has been my favorite game on Steam for a long time, and I have the hours to show for it. I like the  great graphics, multiple styles of space combat, and interesting missions. The types of ships always provide a new challenge, and they are generally fun to play.  You can go into open space, and fly around doing missions, or compete in PVE or PVP missions.    There are tiny Interceptors, Giant Destroyers, massive Corp ships (you dont get to pilot),  and new alien ships.  The game is constantly updated, and gets plenty of money so it is likely to stay for a while.  I would recommend this game for many reasons, most importantly because it is fun to play.  So that's the good part, and why I still say it's worth playing. My biggest issue with the game is that when a new piece of content is released, they encourage paying for the parts instead of building it the slow way. They make it really hard  to earn the parts for new ships. I personally invested so many hours into this game because I enjoyed making the secret project ships, (a top tier ship you can craft with parts you collect through gameplay).  The new alien ships, and even destroyers were easy to craft immediately if you spent the money. I find this both frustrating, and pointless. The premium ships and licenses are already available to reward game donors (of which I am one).   The new ships should require effort and playing hours to unlock, instead of repeatedly making plays for quick money.  I love this game, and will keep playing, but I refuse to pay to fast track any ships.  For those who read this review, I would say it can be a lot of fun to play this game, but don't bother paying real money to build your stuff. Just do it the slow way, and i fyou want to spend money, buy the DLC packages, and wait until a 50%  sale before purchasing.  You get GS, licenses, premium ships, and permantent bonuses. It's really the only value you get by paying into the game, besides supporting a game you play.			"

												Pls read to bottom for recent changes thank you :)Recommended to anyone who likes space game though as all FTP games they want ur money, i personally see no problem spending 20-50 USD when the sales come up. After that its hard core grinding and moving along. :) Also highly recommended to join a Corporation since they will usually help u advance and lvl up. :) Ive been playing this game for a few years and enjoy playing it every time :)For corporations to join if u like nice people, respect and NO DRAMA, I recommend checking out http://JungC.ORG Other game info:Game has dramaticly improved and is way better then it was a few years ago, though i hope they dont over do it now. PVP aka SkermishPVE aka VS AISector conquest aka t4-t5 ships battle it out sectors for their faction and CorporationsOpen Space aka some places pvp some places pvp and pve and some sectors can be captured by corporationsUPDATE 27th march 2016Ok now we have pvp vs AI? and destroyers. Oh and it's definitely a PAY to WIN game. Sadly they over did it...UPDATE: 24th May 2016So the PVP vs AI thing (aka Co-Op) has its ups:- Less wait time for matches.- Can creat a wing (have 8 - 16ppls vs AI).- The Destoyers... Very nice well done. Best in open space with good team mates (Finaly can take out Predator :).- About the pay to win thing.... You can now get premium ships without paying real cash. yes its true, 3 of them to be exact and they are quit unique if i may add.- Though with all this, yes you can have nearly everything in the game for FREE, if you spend about, lets say 4hrs a day, 5 days a week, for 2 years.- Still very fun game love playing with the team. :)UPDATE: 29th July 2016- No more TEAM WORK or its been destoyed.... Groups may no longer use ships of the proper tier without being restricted to the players ship whos rank is lowest. Know the saying, "" ur only as strong as the weakest link""... well now we may only use ships (in group) of the highest rank any player has. as in T3 battle if on player has R7 ship then u may NOT use R9 nor R8 ships only R7 or lower.... So practical for team battle? NOPE! PVE? NOPE! PVP sadly not gonna help players that are ekveing up or new only good for playersr who have all the ships or most of them... - Preety colors... yah no joke SC has updated to some fancy new graphics looks real nice :)- Change in Guards who now have more Anomoly generated missles, and some other new weapons... Conclusion: Anyway because of this recent update and NO LONGER being able to help my team mates efficiently i will change the review to a NOT recommended. Untill this is fixed, that is. :)- I want to have the ease of helping my team mates and joining friends in a group. I have had loads of fun, for it now to be taken away?... Just today i tried to joina friend that i ahve not seen in a while and we had little success other then open space...  All that time... ;-; please fix this SC! :)- Penalizes new players due to the fact other players may not want to get the same rank ship as them which is lower.Update:12/13/2016Changed review to thumbs up. Just because... -_- Hopefully the devs can make better choices. im back in the game now and well... even though the game is changed alot i still have fun and im able to work it out with the team. :)Update:13/04/2017Changed review from thumbs up to DOWN! Sadly the game is lost. Open space servers arer lagging more and more. THe game is now ""destroyed""(ing) my items i get from loot saying i dont have room in hanger when i clearly do... The updates have been proven only for the sole reason to rake in as much cash as possible before swtiching to another 'event ship'. Example: R14 Vigilant was BUFFED to an extent it was supper OP 1 week befor it would no longer be availale to make and then.... just 24hrs after anyone could not make any more it was NURFed!. No joke they didint even wait a week. -_- then again they came out with the THARGA and the day after a NEW alien TAIKIN ship came out the THARGA was NURFED as befor it was OP as hell. The developers and Gajin company only care about your cash....			"

												STAR CONFLICT EVOLUTION Complet Review!After a long wait it's finaly here! i'll try to make it clear and simple for everyone (dev and player)1--> GameplayIt's a arcade fighting game based, witch mean fast and intutive controles and where skill is about everything.Each ships in the game are different and make you enjoy a different gameplay every time you get access to a new one! ever players in the game have it's own build witch mean you'll never face the same thing over again.You also have plenty of game mode:PVPPVELeagueTournamentOpen SpaceSector Conquest (for Corporation only)In Star Conflict you are able to creat or be part of a team(or corporation) like any other multiplayer game. Once part of it, you can star Building a Dreadnought! (Yes a big freakin ship) that will allow you to take part in sector conquest, a game mod that alow you to take controle of a sector of the game and get you access to some pretty nice reward.2-->Graphic and VisualStar Conflict is a beautiful looking game, effect, background, ships visual, maps, everything make you enjoy flying around.In this game you are able to customize any of you ships! (exepte some few premium ships)from the paint to sticker, you can make your ship looking mean or just having a yolo paint (pink all the way!! :D) 3-->Storythere is no story mod but there is some kind of story in the background, and new content are delivered after each major update:-messages-crypted messages4-->MM and BalanceAaaah the famous MM! in most of multiplayer game this thing is annoying ^^! well Star Conflict is sadly in the same trouble! mostly noticed in tournament you'll fall againist way more stronger player witch will leave you unable to do anything to counter them, they are faster, stronger and know everything about the everyship in the game so you wont be able to take them out alone and that why team play is REALY important in SC! But now here come another probleme with the Update 1.4.0 Evolution, the first alien based ship, the worst nightmare of every player (even veteran) THE Thar'ga.This ship introduce a whole new systeme in term of upgrade gameplay and of couse power.The ship himself(without he's weapon) is pretty nice, fun to use, not unkillable everything is nice here. But there come he's modules and weapon.Thar' kth: can 1 shoot and interceptor.Alien intuition:65% more dmg once activatedCombat Reconstructor(special module):absorb 75% of all incomming dmg and regenrate your hull+ deal dmg to ship in a 500m radiusEnergy Converter: redirect all inncoming dmg into a beam dealing dmg proportional to all incoming dmg.teleportation sphere: can warp you in any direction on 2000mYes you get it. combine all of those you are -invicible-1 Shoot everything-get away in any situationAnd now imagine this ship used by 8 veterans players at the same time in the same team.haha fun right ? yes you can leave the match, but wont be able to use the ship you where using until the battle did not ended!so yea pvp in star conflict is now a real nightmare you can't do anything.5--> Ship SelectionStar Conflict have a realy nice list of ship and lot of different ship class and type:Interceptor--> 3 class: ECM(stunter) RECON(scout) and Cover OPS(Hit and Run)Fighter--> 3class: Tackler(skeaky killer)Command(Support) and Gunship(Firepower)Frigate--> 3class: Guard(tank) Engineeer(Healer) and Long range frigate or lrf to make it short(sniper)and Destroyer--> 1 classe: suppresor. made for those who like big ships ^^! all of these leave you with more than 200 ships! :D6-->Progression Progression is pretty smooth, due to a lot of game mod you are free to choose the best way for you to get better ships and equipements-->pve: if you want money and lvl up your ship in the calm -->pvp: if you are a competitive type player, have good reflex and like to learn the hard way this is the best mod to lvl up any of your ship fast-->spec ops: best way to get blueprint for better weapon or exclusive one-->open space: This is spaaaace! best place to get ressources, master your ship, test new build...7-->Q&AYou can of course make all of this faster with a premium license:50% more money 50% more synergi(XP) 2more loot spot 50% more voucher(used to lvl up you weapon)does premium worth it ?i'll say yes for a new player it realy help and make you save time, same as for premium ships.I saw there is some dlc for the game does they worth it ?Some of them give some realy nice bonus and ships, but you have to keep in mind that those are absolutly not nessary, you can make your way to the top without getting them, buying them is more like giving lovely support to the dev's team witch i realy like cause you speak with them anytime :) --> forum: https://forum.star-conflict.com/Is this game pay2win ?NO it's not! ^^ it's all about how you are playing! there is ofc a lot of stuff you can buy but it only make thing faster! it will never make you a more powerful player!after few hours of playing i notice some bug how do it tell dev's about it ?There is a bug report section on the forum is case it happen -->:https://forum.star-conflict.com/index.php?/forum/213-bug-report-section/this game is realy nice but i think it will be even cooler if dev's implement new stuff! how can i offer new idea ?Same as hearlier there is a forum section for it ! -->https://forum.star-conflict.com/index.php?/forum/230-suggestions/8-->Game evaluation After spending hours and hours on SC i've seem a lot of new stuff getting include and getting reworked the game always evolve and that a great thing! that allow player to get a new experience often and not get bored quickly.But since the Thar'ga come out it ruined the game, at least the pvp and every pvp mode like tournament (the worst) league (you can still win by rushing becon)I used to be a pvp player and i can't enjoy playing pvp as i do before. It become frustating and make often make me quit before the end of a simgle team battle ( the whole team getting spawn camp in a space game i mean cmon...)More update are in coming (like trading, more ship and with a Open Space rework)but if the game stay that way i'm affraid not a lot of new player will stay.I STILL HAVE HOPE!Season 2 Dreadnought update:8.5/10Dog of war update:9/10 Invasion update9/10Age of Destroyer update10/10Evolution Update6/10Endeav, Vice president of Stellar Marines.disclaimer* my current note migh change depending of how the game goes in the future, i can't recomand it for new players but at the same time i do, you can still give it a try!

												Games okay till your ships reach rank 10 than that's when the grinding becomes heavy to get anywhere. It's a grinding game of coarse or you can pay for perks of different sorts but it's not cheap and the items are random in most purchase bundles. There is a high chance you will not get what you need in a purchased bundle sooooo they hope you buy another bundle""s"" (get the idea? PAY). I find most bundles not worth buying for what they ask and ONLY make purchases when on sale if you GOTTA have it.This is a PVE and PVP game but unfortunately as of now if you hate PVP like I do your out of luck. The developers decided to put important items to advance in this game as rewards for completing PVP missions. To some people thats like making the lambs go beat up the lions. I wish they would have given an option on how to complete missions for rewards (PVP or PVE) instead of ""forcing"" a player into PVP missions. Let the PVP players feed on themselves ( I'm sure it won't be as fun or easy)Weapon critical damage is questionable. A weapon that does 2200pts normal damage can crit you at 30000pts damage (give or take, I've seen higher depending on weapon). This can successfully one shot you at full health and so playability withers away. Personally I can't believe how high crit damage has been allowed to go, it's not a fight anymore.From experience by playing these types of games I would say this game is at its middle of life expectancy and on it's way down. Being that items will always be added to this game to please the hard core players (and make money), things will eventually become overwelming and balancing issues will become more and more difficult (it's not good already). The game forum will eventually drive the developers nuts from the cries of players telling them to do this and to do that. I have seen forums shut down because developers dug a hole to deep to get out of and the game was switched into basic mode, done and over with, c ya later.Final comment: I do like how the developers do try and let the average player obtain hard to get items like the ""destroyer"" after its been out for a while and the hard core players have already got one or two. It has made a few dedicated players mad who really worked or payed hard to get the materials to build a destroyer but this helps keep balance in the game so there is less have and have nots and keeps the player pool going instead of people giving up. Free to try so try it out but don't start spending your money on this game till you know where it would help the most because there is a lot of things you can get that's just a waste. I recommended this game but I'm really sitting on the fence in the middle, be careful progress can be very slow and demanding at higher lvls and I myself have been playing other games because this and the fact I hate PVP.Updated: Don't bother with this game, the developers are really screwing things up for the sake of  money. Seeing player pool slowly going down because of this. So friggen time consuming and costly to get anywhere in this game that when you think your finally getting something done (illusion), the developers do another patch to suit their wallet instead of making sure they keep a player base going. The game seems to be taking avantage of players who invested so much money that it would kill them to leave so they keep paying in desperate hope of change. SAD01			"

												Im sorry but Not Recommend for now. I love this game and i enjoyed much.Wish i could write positive review but, im dissapointed and I hate to say this But,Its getting ""P2W"" (Maybe Already) and no longer """"F2P"""". """"Insane Grind"""". And will be harsh for other pilots but elite pilots.Tired of getting Rap.e.d by ""Op Ships especially Thar'ga (except T2)"" Even if you have a better skills or Good ships but thar'ga, Gargoyle, Dart..(Maybe destroyers too) its hard to destroy them and the standard ships or destoyers are useless to against them now. Stick with full team is cant win against full thar'gas even some of them has Thar ga or Elite pilots in team or not.If you see the Full of Thar'ga on the enemy team... Abandon the battle ( its not a good method to leave the battle though) or just run. Otherwise, Will costs you a lot of repair cost and youll end up and get rap.e.d by Thar'ga at Respawn point. And will be frustrate.As you know. you can buy ""Thar'ga"" with 15000 GSAnd plz make permanent Ship Aerography and Ship color when buying another one or change another colors. Not Revoke them and its ridiculous. or turn Cost price GS Credits to In-Game Credits. So New pliots or who cant buy with GS or dont have GS will enjoy to color their own ships and make more competitive and showing to another pilots.Well, Its good game and has a beautiful graphics though.im considering to leave this game for while or never...... and forgive my english.

												Edited: 4-12-17I have been a part of the Star Conflict world for years now. I've seen it through the ups and downs etc. But now everything has changed. It has changed from a fun, interesting game about cool theatrical arcade space dogfights to a slow, repeditive, and non-rewarding daily grind. It looks amazing, but unless you throw 500$ or 25 hours per day, every day at it, you will achieve nothing. Almost everything that used to be fun about this game is gone and replaced with more and more inhibitions and limitations. I truly wish that I could still give this game a positive review, but if I did, I would be lying. To myself and to everyone else. I did love this game so much, but It has turned in to hell on wheels. It is no longer going down-hill, but has crashed and burned at the bottom of it. Fox out.			"

												Great game just needs MORE added to it, more MAPs for PvE and PvP, more enemy types and better missions for PvE. the game feels like its incomplete right now even though it has been out for years, i would be willing to pay for a DLC that would provide more depth into the game perhaps a short storyline for New players in stead of the very short tutorial that really just only shows you basic combat.

												This game somehow became pay to win (or grind for thousands of hours to win). With destroyer class and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking it is possible to end deadmatch (40vs40) with 0vs40 result.With alien ship incoming i bet this will get even worse.Sure, minimum was done to remove stereotype so its start-fight-again (only with different ships, different weapons, but against enemies who are stronger and stronger so, no progress without paying).And yes, you can get DLC ships and destroyers for free - just grind 3 hours each day to get a box, that MAY contain a component to build it. And you need like 400 components to build whole ship. Good luck F2P players :D			"

Rejoining the match, stay for another 10 to 20 seconds, get disconnected again, set back to the hangar. Give the rejoin another try, stay in the match 10 seconds longer, get completely disconnected from the servers and try to login again. When the rejoin option becomes available again, click it, join the match again and gather 200 Synergy for a loss because I have been out of match 90% of the time.			"

												I'll start by saying I love this game. I set it aside from time to time but always end up coming back. The graphics engine is beautiful, if you like sci fi ships this game has them in droves. A vast array of technological marvels to fly around and blow stuff up with.  The flight and shooting mechanics I find to be very tight and responsive. Sound effects are spot on, very satisfying and visceral.The downside is the progression system is extremely grindy if you don't spend real money. Its not so bad if you are enjoying the gameplay, but sadly despite having several pvp and even pve modes, one can get burnt out because the gameplay itself doesn't vary much. Aim your reticle at enemies, fire until they explode, rinse and repeat. There are plenty of modules to give different abilities to your ship, hull and shield repairs, additional weapons or drones, disables, and while they do add variety I find myself wishing for a broader spectrum of tools to use to liven up the gameplay after a while.I do still greatly enjoy it. Nothing around that I'm aware of that scratches the same spacey dogfighting itch while also being accessible, populated, and beautiful. But do be aware that while the game does not have a hard pay wall, it does make progress difficult past tier 2 without at least a small investment. I've spent money on this game, more than I'd like to admit. But I do it because the core game is fantastic, space battle goodness that deserves to be paid for.			"

												I used to really, really love this game. It was practically the definition of a good space-dogfighting game, blending the simple fun of an arcade title with the variety of a futuristic space-combat ""simulator"" in a way that captured the best elements of both. Unfortunately, development has taken a turn for the worse and I've recently joined the roughly 40% of the registered playerbase that's quit within the past year.This game has become a classic example of a great idea with a poor execution. Players new to this title can expect some fun gameplay at first, marred by some big problems. More time is spent queueing for matches than actually in them. It takes forever to unlock new levels and upgrades. The game is almost entirely server-side and Russian-based, so EU and US players can expect input lag. The monetization scheme is overpriced and somewhat pay-to-win. The developers will try to deny or cover up the existence of bugs rather than fix them. There is no actual anti-cheat software of any sort (although admittedly the game's server-side nature somewhat limits cheating). The developers have a very limited and somewhat antagonistic relationship with the community. The game's glaring problems are common, known to the playerbase, and rarely fixed.A year ago I still recommended this game, but now this free title isn't even worth the download time. Check out the variety of other space-combat games Steam has to offer; give this one a pass.			"

												From the moment I started to play Star Conflict I fell in love with the game. It was full of potential and possibilities. Different classes of ships, great PvP and awesome massive space battles. Unfortunately all those possibilities went down the drain.Now, Star Conflict is unbalanced, boring , tedious , pay to win PvP with shallow story and grind mode. PVE is repititive, PvP matchmaking is horrible and open space (Invasion,) well, bland boring. Dreadnoughts are just another game mode made without imagination and creativity.If you like space game you should definitely try this game, you will either love it or hate it. If you wanna save your nerves avoid this game, comepletly.My score of this game in it's current state  is 45/100.			"

												Rewrote the review.I only played this game for a few hours so these are just my impressions.GFX is pretty nice but the UI is poorly done and often I can't see the point where my guns are firing at.Sound is OK.Gameplay is very twitch-based shooter type and you select a handful of different classes and then you queue for instances to upgrade your ship or get a new ship. The instances I found quite bland and repetitive and got bored quite fast. I prefer more tactical games rather than shooter and even the biggest ship class in this game was more like playing a shooter.There is supposedly an open world in the game, or upcoming, but I could not play long enough to unluck it. Which means you cannot enter anything but instances for the first hours of game play.Bored me so I quit.			"

												The only thing worse than how terrible this game is, is that EA/Bioware literally stole it and put it in Star Wars The Old Republic.  Seriously, who thought a 3d space combat game WITHOUT joystick/gamepad support and a flexible targeting reticle was a good idea?Notwithstanding the amount of in-game corruption by cheaters and bots, the tiered-matchmaking system is flawed, creating an abysmal experience for new players routinetely pitted against vets with maxed-out ships.  This is essentially a pay-to-win microtransation game, with horrible physics and a horrible community.  As much as I loathe Galactic Starfighter in SWTOR, I would reccomend that pile of garbage over this game upon which it is based.			"

												Only recommend because I feel bad about not recommending a game that a lot of people enjoy. Not for me. I dont feel developers should be allowed to accept money for in-game items that are subject to change at any point because the game is still technically in BETA. Figure out what you want to do then start charging. The game feels like its always wanting real money for something. Ammo, paint jobs, rolling on good items (with a very low chance of aquisition), ships, pilot license that expires and has to be renewed (gives XP boost that is almost necessary for any casual gamer). The list goes on. No one wants to buy a Corvette on Monday just to walk out to a Pinto on Tuesday, because your dealership is in BETA. This is a horrible way to run a game. PROS: Fast and smooth gameplay. Really is a good engine in my opinion. You dont HAVE to pay anything. CONS: Money Pit - Forever in BETA - P2W (Worst parts of F2P - You FEEL like you need to pay to compete)			"

												While this game is free to play, it is certainly NOT pay to win. I have roughly seven hours logged, and I'm able to dominate pvp matches. This game is about nothing more than skill. Even if you encounter somebody with a better ship than you, if you play smart you can will beat them. There is also an open world, or universe I guess, feauture where you can fly around visiting other stations and locations. The only downside to this game that I have found so far is the long wait times for finding a game. Sometime you will wait as many as four to five minutes to find a lobby for a seven minute battle. tl;dr: 9.2/10 Would reccomend.			"

												Star Conflict is a 3D PvP arcade space shooter made by Russian devs, with plenty of progression to go through, and a typically smooth difiiculty curve. It's been an excellent time sink for me, with a great concept with wonderful graphics (that still runs pretty nicely - with the exception of one map - on integrated graphics if turned down a tad) and a neat community that has its own quirks. As it's free, if anyone asked me whether or not to give it a go, I'd say absolutely. That's not that it doesn't have its problems, though.Perhaps the worst of these is the blatant monetization. It was less apparent when I started, probably a combination both of more monetization as you progress and more monetization as time went on, but at this point, it's practically screaming for money. There's myriad kinds of in game currency, eight of which are free, and one of which is premium. The primary currency, credits, is earned by simply playing - neat enough. But six of the remaining require you to do certain tasks while playing, many of which are extremely difficult. Even if you do complete some, these tasks are then put on cooldown for some value of time between nothing - for the lowest paying ones - or 17 hours - for the highest. Complicating matters further, one can only earn two of these six at a time, and must pay roughly 20 minutes worth of credits to change which two - or skimp out and pay with premium. These six currencies are used to pay for certain equipment upgrades, which can also be skimped out on and paid with premium. The other free currency not yet talked about is perhaps the only one in abundance that doesn't really encourage anyone to skip out and pay with premium for. The premium problem does go a bit further, yes, but not that much. There exist premium ships in the game, and while they typically have a slight advantage - easier progression, no upkeep fees, the tiniest of extra customization, get in the same queue as a slightly lower ranked free ship - they're not honestly that great. I've used one myself, and heard from several veteran players that they're not that much better, and in some cases, are even slightly worse than their free counterparts. Premium currency can be used for the things mentioned in the paragraph above, but those are mostly convenience fees, albeit ""convenience"" in the sense of ""how it should have been done in the first place because the system is a tad bit too grindy for most people"". But perhaps the biggest travesty is that customization of ships - and I'm not talking about buying passive modules and such - is so ridiculous. To buy a colour, one must pay roughly a dollar's worth of real world money. Each ship has three colours, even, so to fully customize a ship, that's three dollars. Now, that might not sound ridiculous, but these colours do not transfer to any other ship, and if you wish to change the colour once and then back again, you'll have to pay to change it twice. Same deal for stickers. You can't simply ""unlock"" a colour or a sticker, neither for your fleet nor for you ship, but must instead buy them on a per-instance basis. Now, all that said, would I still recommend this game? Hell yes. Even if monetization is being pushed ridiculously hard, it's still a /good game/ at its core. There's no other game out there that makes use of the third dimension like this one. The mechanics are still wonderful as ever. My favourite part is that skill is valued over hardware, 90% of the time. There's both a casual base and a competitive base, so there's neither a push nor a restraint on getting better at the game. There's an official forum where the active community gets together and talks about the game, as well as whatever else. And asking for help gets you help, almost always. tl;dr : The game is great on graphics, sound, mechanics, community, and originality. It's got huge problems on the monetization front, as well as some others not mentioned in the review (lack of tutorials, bad playerbase/dev communication, lag, newbie hunters, and community drama), but it's still a great game.

												While this game is free to play, it is certainly NOT pay to win. I have roughly seven hours logged, and I'm able to dominate pvp matches. This game is about nothing more than skill. Even if you encounter somebody with a better ship than you, if you play smart you can will beat them. There is also an open world, or universe I guess, feauture where you can fly around visiting other stations and locations. The only downside to this game that I have found so far is the long wait times for finding a game. Sometime you will wait as many as four to five minutes to find a lobby for a seven minute battle. tl;dr: 9.2/10 Would reccomend.			"

												Star conflict is a very good space combat simulator, However a lack of options in pvp matches and a lackluster overworld with no real objectives or ways to refuel so you can only go so far. this game has much polish much work put into the textures and shaders an absolutly gourgeous game with very good controls and fairly good battle mechanics. i felt its capture the flag gameplay was intreaging survival was ok but the micro transactins that alow people to upgrade there ship to a high level and compete in the same league as a lower level player was a nuisance.The customizations are very minimal unless you wish to spend a huge amout of money.

When mass effect come out I will ditch this in no time.Two recommandation for further though, cause I am a nice guy:1. Improve your graphics, it is 2017 now.2.

Devs are shady, and the game has become unbalanced. Its definately pay to win now in the since of destroyers.Destroyers are a new ship class they added to the game that completely annihilates everything, They are very unbalanced in the since of their tanking and fire power and often; but not always the team with the most destoryers wins.  Its not impossible to get everything in the game legitly, Its just it takes so long its not worth it. I spent 355 hours grinding for my Destroyer in this game, where as if i spent 20 dollars give or take I could have shaved off 200 easy.  This game did not start out as a pay to win craper, It kind of just decayed over time. So my recommendation is Its worth playing for a bit, but not worth putting money into it. It still gives a unique experience that I think is worth exploring. Beyond that though don't waste your time!			"

												 Pros: 1. Visceral and intense space combat. 2. Graphics are stunning and don't cause too much strain on my system. 3. Large 15 ship Tri-Tier for each of the 3 factions available.Cons: 1. Not very easy to find out what each piece does. Nor a in-depth explanation in how to use the pieces.  2. Be advised that buying a Tier 6 ship with paid for in-game currency, while having lower Tier ships. Will result in you being placed into higher tier matches. So if you're looking for a challenge, where you are limited to high enough Tier ships, go for it. Otherwise, I would suggest waiting until you're a higher Tier. ( Tier 2 ships unavailable for use with a bought and paid for Tier 6 ship. ) Suggestion only: Instead of just having Holiday sales. Maybe add some Holiday type weather? Or Spacial anomalies?			"

That's all Star Conflict appears to be.I can't say I've stuck with it for a long time, since I was expecting it to have anything other than this one hyper-specialized single thing (maybe some exploration? a campaign mode? challenges? anything at all?!).If you like the sound of this then give it a shot, but don't be like me and install it with the wrong expectations.

												It is a free online game that is fun to play with friends. Its a Dogfighting space sim that runs smoothly and has simple controls.Before buying a DLC, I advise you to play the free game first, as the DLC only gives you some extra equipment and ships. After a while I find the game to get a bit repetative.I give it 8/10 as it did keep me entertained for 200+ hours and I still like to come back to it from time to time.Its one of the best free games I ever played.

												used to play this game for a long while, until I got bored of this game. The space combat is cool and all but building ships takes a long to do, unless you pay for the bundle packs in the game in which your chances of getting the item or rare part you trying to get will random and pay again and again... you can go mining in open space but that will take too long, sense it's random what you find from astroids and ships that got destroyed and drop random stuff too. Tho you can do matches with some random players in co-op modes, pvp, or special opperation, you get a high chance for rare Random loot pick ups just by clicking on what you clicked on you only get a few chances tho like 4 or 3 I think? Only at the end of the match win or lose I think? been too long since I played StarConflict. Good luck to anyone wanting to build a destroyer, good luck... That's one issue I have for building ships I wanted to build, takes a llllooooonnnnggggg time. Unless you pay for the bundles then you saved your time. And then the gameplay... The matches feel too much of the same to once you play them. Over and Over again. This game has the phone game app feeling in it, I mean jsu t play it for a good few hours and then you know that feelong too the maps get boring after a while. You play the same maps many times, Yeah I know the game random picks the maps for you so that you don't have to vote for which map you wanted to play. Makes it little better from the repeditive gameplay you'll experience in this game. You won't get easily killed as a level 1 in co-op, until like level 6 then yeah you'll get killed easily, If your not reckless. PvP is alright, you can go and test your skills that you learned from playing and go against other players that may have stronger weapons and a better ship then you. The controls aren't much of a problem its quite simple in my opinion don't know about you. Weapons can be upgraded on the ship you selected, and other upgrades can be put on the ship for better performance of that ship, The AI decent and they are easy, hard or annoying to kill in co-op, if your not reckless that is... yeah you might get ganged up by a huge group of them and die. But the AI is easy, hard or annoying to take on. If you want to play this game, play if you want to experience a repeditive gameplay. Nobody wants that type of game downloaded right? Last but not least, the Factions. You can choose one the 3 or 4..? factions you wanted to join in and work them. But honestly, there is little to no diffence to whatever side you. They alll feel the same to each other, except for the missions they give to do. So it doesn't matter what side you choose. there is nothing that special that you do in any of those factions you join. There is nothing else left for any of them.. I give this game a 5/10 just a straight up 5/10 from little fun to boring. "

												Two hours in and I can't see any Pay2win. There are people who are piloting better ships for sure, but even with the starter ship I was still getting a few kills on more expirienced players.Not to mention this game has PvE for people who don't like the PvP and want to play a bit more casual, and a free roam mode (Albiet with limited fuel (that you can just refill by visiting another station)).I'm having fun with it so far, it's a good F2P space shooter and we all know those don't grow on trees. Even though most of the reviews say neigh, I encourage people to at least download it and play for a while, you've got nothing to lose!			"

												Edit: I'm rewritting this review, since there has been some changes after I wrote the original one.I've been playing this game for more than one year and I think I can give you a balanced review. First of all: This game is not Star Citizen, or Eve Online or Elite Dangerous. It doesn't want to be either. This game is a lobby based, free to play fighting arena game, settled in space. You have several ships at your disposal, with different classes and a lot of modules and modifiers to customize their performance. Then you go into battle in teams against other people in several game modes like the usual team battle, king of the hill, capture points etc... So far really standard. We can say that it is very similar to Warthunder of World of tanks, but with spaceships regarding the pvp skirmish matches. Then you have also High end content for clans with rewards if you conquer some of the sectors, which is nice for hardcore players, since you can even win a few premium currency here and there.NEW!: High end content has been reworked and now you can battle other corporations with your own corporate dreadnought. The attacks and defences are all happening in the open world map, so it is all integrated in the same place, instead of random sectors as it was before. So far it looks nice and helps with immersion. Dread battles feel like a mashup of all modes, since you have beacons (dread tactical devices) bombs, and a lot of tactical choices. The battle feels gorgeous and I remember in the first 2 or 3 games I was just watching the new graphics instead of playing.The only problem so far is that most of the corporations just fight over the small sectors, and the tier 4 were contested in the first week and since they they haven't changed. I suppose with time more and more people will join the fray. But the tier 3 sectors are really, really contested.And finally, what makes this game very balanced is that you can also play missions or scenarios in a Co-op fashion with friends, or straight open world and do PvP (pilot killing) or PvE vs AI. The open world is not like Eve online, is more like a huge sandbox map, with some RPG like missions (go there, kill 4 wolfs, come back, go there, pick some asteroids and return) and people to interact with. But you have respawns and you don't lose your stuff if you are killed, so it is more arcadish.Good thing is that the open world comes with a simple manufacturing tab which allows you to manufacture special ammo, weapons and consumables with the resources collected in there, and also 3 top tier ships which can be configured as you want when you are building them. The business model is akin to said games (warthunder, world of tanks) so you have to play and unlock ships with experience, credits and several special currency to get better and better modules. Investing money in the game gives you economical advance, as it is usual in this games, but so far there is nothing you can get with gold that you can't get for free. You will just have it later. Concerning most of the complains about the pay to win in premium ships, premium ships are not better than standard ships. They have the same slots than their credit counterparts, and the bonus are different, but not better. Modules can be shared between ships so there is no difference either. The problem is that in the tech tree, the credit ships appear with their level 1 stats, and premiums always appear with full level, because they are sold that way. But after you level your credit ships you will see that the premium ships are not better. So my final verdict is still a 9, because the Dreadnoughts are still in developing (not tier 5 Dreads yet) but we are almost there. All other balance issues with the new consumables had been fixed, and currently only the Destructor weapon is a pain in high tier beacon games. But I hope they will fix it as well.PROS: - Good art and graphics. - Runs well in mid and low end computers. - Free to play, it won't hurt your wallet if you try it. - Fast paced action and a good number of game modes. - PvP, PvE, and a sandbox with both, all in the same game. - SPACE DUDE!! SPACE!!! CONS: - A good chunk of the population is russian, so expect longer than average waiting times out of russian or european prime time. - Servers are a bit unstable sometimes, but this is something I'm finding in almost any late game. - Population is not as high as in mainstream games like world of tanks or warthunder. You won't notice it in low - mid tiers, but top end content lacks a bit of players.			"

												The game has real potential but quickly loses its shine when you realize you have to spend real money to get coins to upgrade your ship. You cant PVE unless you have 3 other players, but if you PVP you can play with bots. Not sure why i cant PVE with bots. Over the game is lacking some serious polish.			"

												While I do enjoy this game, it's grind is far too tedius. The events aren't fun and the one event I did complete I later learned ment nothing.-THE GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN-If you see people whining about that, it's because there are ships you can buy using in game currency.BUTYou can earn the ingame cash via tourneys, answers questions (When they roll around) and completing a few other tasks. On top of that, any ship you can buy in game is only as good as a max level version of the same ship type. The difference is what Rank they are, that's it. Don't get me wrong, the balance of the game is shot, it's not that fun, certain weapons need to be removed (Like a gun that locks you pulls you to a point, damages you and makes it so you can't see) or reworked (An ability that locks you down for 6+ seconds or the ability to turn so tightly you literally can't hit them.) and certain classes in the game (Engineering Frigates, Command Fighter and Gunship) can't preform because of the games meta, but down downvote the game for the wrong reason.

												It's a nice game overall. Perhaps the best space fight simulation game I've ever seen. I especially like the combination of sandbox flavor and ""WoT"" flavor: You can immediately jump into a PVP or PVE fight from the hanger, and you could also choose to loot resources by traveling through systems. Good news: your ship won't be lost if destroyed during a loot. Unlike EVE. That's good to know.   As most people have pointed out, like World of Tanks, this is a ""pay to advance"" game instead of a ""pay to win"" game. What you can really do is use dollars to: 1. buy premium ships and jump directly to the corresponding tier; 2. buy premium license to accelerate synapse and credit gain. Neither will help you win in the game. It might actually hinder winning, since jumping to high tiers means you lack the experience to fight those veterans.  Honestly, I might be one of the ""wallet warriors"" some people refer to. I'm willing to spend a considerable amount of dollars into a game that I really like. And Star Conflict is one of them.			"

												This game deserves more attention than it has gotten. The flight system is a modified version of the one used in Warthunder and expirienced players will have no trouble. It can take a few minutes to get used to flying with no down or up (because in space down is where ever the floor is and up is where ever your head is pointing, not because this is one of those crappy 2d space games), but it can by fun to disorient players by coming at them along an odd attack angle. The game forces players to think in 3d, going under and over to flank instead of around, because there is no down in space. The crafting system works well and forces you to carefuly consider your play style. Best of all the dreaded ""Pay to Win"" system is mor limited than most. Synergy (exp) transpher, DLC, and Premium ships are the only noticable advantages. Premium ships are usually much weaker than their Synergy required counterparts and are so over priced only the desprat and the rich bother to get them outside of a very generous sale every year or so. Over all the game is well ballanced (except for the occasional max level russian), and easy to play. There is controler support and Occulus use is avalable. The graphics are exelent if you can run at max level, and are better than many paid games.The only real drawbacks are the dwindling player base because the developers put all of the advertising budget into their flagship game Warthunder and allowd Star Conflict to fade into relative obscurity. It has a server infrastructure to match and it is not uncommon for the NA players to end up in Russian, Europian, and even South Asian servers with clear favoratim for Russian players as they are the majority of the population. However this advantage is waining as more and more internet lines are replaced with fiber optic cables.If youre a fan of arcade space flight and combat sims, this game is for you.			"

My only complaints are the long wait times to play the short skirmishes, and the unfairness experienced occassionaly upon encountering others who have elected to pay to win.  I'm surprised that during the long waits we are not bombed by advertisements yet, as there must be an established captive audience.  I would give this a solid 3 out of 5 stars.			"

												Star Conflict is a free to play space combat arena shooter.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, was understandable.  The artwork was pretty good. You fly and fight in a space ship as part of a group on PVP, PVE, and CoOp maps.  The controls allow you to pitch, yaw, spin, roll, rise and lower.   Has tutorial and videos.  CONS:- This game has PAY to Win PVP.- PVP matchmaking might match you against overpowered players.Try it, if you like space combat games.  Great Free game for playing Casually in PVE Only.For more info:

												This game used to be absolutely stellar and what I'd have considered to be one of the best F2P games on the market, as it was extremely fun and avoided the typical pay to win pitfalls.Recent updates however have taken much of what made it fun before (namely, ship flexibility) and restricted the living hell out of every ship type and role. You used to be able to equip the modules you wanted on the ship of your choosing, whether they fit the ship role or not... that isn't the case anymore.Avoid unless you can go back a couple years in a time machine somehow.

												I play the game for many years (3?). It's very nice and fun - until you get to rank 6. Then you either go farm open space or you may continue with arenas which turn into horrible pop-fest where you are the one being popped non-stop - and I'm talking about experience of above-average player. Still the game is free and initially it's fun so you should definitely try it.Pros:nicely designed arena instances (both art and tactical layout);good looking ships;different play style for different classes of ships;quick initial progression;nicely designed combat;interesting open space sectors / treasure hunt / crafting concept;game run well on old PCs;a lot of different weapon types;decent horizontal equipment progression;decent AI.Cons:""PvE"" and ""vs AI"" modes are badly balanced after rank 6 - as rank 6 you'll face L9 NPCs with epic-grade equipment;as often happen in PvP arena games - pre-mades roflstomp casual players, you tend to lose matches much more often than win them;heavily P2W mid/end-game: most powerful ships (destroyers, crafted L15) must be purchased or require months of focused farm (for example after *2+ years* I'm not even close to get any of those - it will take at least +1 more year);mid/end-game progression is too slow unless you purchase premium status, combined with NPCs and premades killing you non-stop it feels like a visit to a dentist without painkillers;badly designed mid-end-game may turn your progression into vertical wall;open space / treasure hunt / crafting are underdeveloped and could take a lot of polish and improvements;scarce resources for equipment progression, no point to waste them until you get to rank 14-15 ships.Conclusion:game is very fun in the beginning, has awful mid/end-game and has very interesting (but underdeveloped) open space, treasure hunting and crafting concepts. Despite flawed end-game I like it more than all other spaceship MMO games as a casual player.			"

AbstractI have been playing Star Conflict for so long...like, before Open Space was actually useful. I decided that it was probably time to finally write a review...especially since there is a bunch of reviews on here with people that are either grinding out hours on there to make a review look worthy, or have literally played the game for so long and then write a crap review about it. Star Conflict I would have to say is mixed up hard. In my honest opinion on the game, it has ups and downs. Some of the reviews are legit on here, others make no sense to me. Lets see what makes up the integrity of Star Conflict and then rate it.GameplayStar Conflict in a nutshell is a pew-pew-pew competitive space shooter with both massively multiplayer elements that rush stuff and a slower more singleplayer side. I remember a time when the game was in it's early stages and the dreadnaughts had no even come out. I can't tell if the game has gotten better or worse since then. There are multiple modes in Star Conflict; PvP, PvE, Co-op v AI, and Open Space; on the higher tiers you have Tournament level stuff where high level players can team up against each other or against a huge enemy. PvP is what you expect, You vs. the other team. In PvP, there can be different objectives, my favorite personally being Combat Recon; one ship on each team is randomly chosen to be the commander for their respective teams. Your goal is to destroy the enemy commander and wipe out the rest of the team. After the commander is destroyed, no more respawns are allowed for that team. This diversity in gameplay allows for a lot of different playstyles, which brings me to my next topic.The vessels and factions in Star Conflict are incredible. From what I've gathered, Empire ships are high fire rate, (relatively) low damage and fast. However, they also have really powerful and really slow sniper ships equipped with a thermal cannon weapon known as a ""Disentigrator"". Federation ships are basically support type ships that use drones and stuff. Their fighters tend to be really good with escaping enemy grasps and showing up from behind and taking out enemies. Jericho ships are basically go big or go home. Shield tanky vessels that are slow and deliver a punch of built correctly. Their fighters love to just tank damage. Each faction has their own ships and each ship can be of a different class and type. This variety just lets the player play like they want to. I like the giant tanky sniper/full frontal force vessels of Jericho origin (more on that later).The only problem I have with SC in the gameplay category is how certain things are done. You can manufacture ships (more on that in a moment), but the resources required for some vessels can take months to collect if done correctly and without buy stuff. I will say that SC is really good about not pushing pay-to-play stuff in your face, there is a screen that pops up about it when you launch the game, and if you close it, bam that's all you see. Open space was also a joke until Dreadnaughts came along that required Iridium to manufacture. There was no point to OS until then. Gaijin has gotten really good about it now and added a lot of features.Also since it's a match based (apart from Open Space) you have to enter a queue (like in war thunder) to get into a match, occasionally, it can be really bad, but on average it's fine and easily overlooked timewise.Downfalls and DestroyersMatchmaking can be a jerk sometimes. I'm a rank 9 or 10 (kind of in the middle) mercenary, and I'm continuously paried with rank 15 players if I throw my rank 10 ship into my ship pool. I hate the way that's done but anywhere before rank 10, matchmaking is fine. That's the biggest downfall I think.Another would be the resourcing you do to manufacture ships. I didn't make this pain in the neck process number one, because it's totally optional. :)Luckily, the best loot used for ships like Destroyers and Dreadnaughts are obtained through the loot drops at the end of battles. Like I said earlier, resourcing and matchmaking can be bad, but since they finally made OS useful with Destroyers and Dreadnaughts, it's not so bad. The turn out on this one however is that most people don't like the new Destroyers update. I don't know why, I think it's becuase they think it's unbalanced; but here's the thing. if you start out as a new player or stopped playing for a while, all the rank ups you get in a faction literally just hand you the components needed for the destroyer. BOOM. Easy as pie. And all the while you're accrewing the materials, you are earning money, making up for the 3 million credits you need to manufacture one. Dreadnaughts on the other hand require some more explanation.Dreadnaughts are about 10 fold or more, powerful than a destroyer. These massive battlecruisers are constructed by corporations (mainly corporations that house a group of 10 players, rank 10 or more). Corporations are like factions in the game. These dreadnaughts however take a lot of time to make, but once you do, your corporation can engage in sector combat...another gameplay mode. You can take control of sectors in open space. I think that's insanely cool, but thats just me.RatingsGraphics: 8/10 (Really nice, some textures can be made better, but the attention to detail on the guns (how they move with the cursor and whatnot, is really well done)Gameplay and mechanics:  6/10 (Can be improved apon still. Grinding out resources isn't my favorite thing to do, but the payout is about 80% worth it after you rank the ship up some.)Lore/History: 9/10 (Well done, each faction has leaders and each leader has their own biography. The stations themselves have lore and pretty much every sector has lore behind it as well. Very well done.)Downfalls/Repetitiveness: 5/10 (Very grindy, leveling up can be a pain in the neck after like rank 4 or 5, fixed by maxing out the synergy on your owned ships to increasy your fleet strength synergy gain percentage)Overall Rating: 7.5/10 (Best competivive F2P game I've ever played)			"

												I play this game for fun, the experience is pretty good. I haven't spent asy real cash in-game and still feel I can play fairly in PVP. It is a bit of a grind earning in-game currency for upgrades, ships and weapons, but isn't it always.Overall, I would recommend this game for anyone who likes semi-simm space shooters.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game for the current 260 hours i have been playing it thus far. If you are a bit confused with how matchmaking works as I was when I first started, it is separated into tiers. For PVP, ship levels are separated by 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-15(give or take one rank here and there). For PVE its separated 1-5, 6-10, 11-15. Now, though I do love the game, the people complaining about the low drop rates on items have a point, and it is a little frustrating to obtain manufactured ships. All in all however, the game itself is great			"

												Only been playing a couple hours. Great so far, mechanics are pretty solid, gameplay is fun and engageing. Have seen prettier but given it's minimum requirements and the specs of my computer I'm by no means saying it's ugly graphically. All around solid 3D space combat shooter. From what little interaction I've had, community seems fairly nice and not full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you're not sure what a douchbag is, you're probably one of them lol. Gonna keep playing probably until I hit that wall every free-to-play game has, where it turns in to pay-to-get-any-♥♥♥♥ing-further lol. But all around it's one of the funner flight/space combat style games I've played in a long time. I'd give a solid 4/5 starts.			"

												It's an action packed, team based, arcadey spaceship game.It has real money transactions, but most of the time the ships you buy with real money aren't as good as the ones you can earn with ingame resources.The game plays well and has decent balancing for a game that has 9 ship types.Grinding can be an issue later on, but you can opt to stay in lower tiers to remedy that.5/5 bretty good			"

 Star Conflict Review I bought this game when it was not very popular, and with recent updates, it is getting more popular. I admit, I have not played this game in a while, but when I did, it was a pretty good game. It has a decent idea of spaceship weapons and other stuff like that, and some awesome looking graphics for a free to play game. Overall, I would not recommend it to people who don't like vehicle-based shooters, though it is a pretty fun game. Star Conflict gets a 7/10.			"

Everyone will kick your♥♥♥♥♥because they have a better ship that will take you forever to get because grind, grind, grind.You could fork out money to get extra experience every pvp and pve match but even then it's grind, and grind. I personally don't spend any money, I did once but I rather grind than fork out cash every two days and play like I have no life.The new invasion mode seems to be pretty fun, an attempt at an open world sandbox with pve mission objectives.

												I have heard quite a bit of negativity regarding this game but I downloaded as I heard about the native Oculus Rift Suport. I really like the look of this game though some of the options are a bit confusing and I could not find native support for my flight stick (SPEEDLINK BLACK WIDOW.) so manual configuring and working out the options did take some time. I also could not locate the first person view option on ly a third view perspective after scouring the menu options as well as looking at key bind optionsI think that this is really good considering you can play for free. I heard that the moderators are strict so I will not be getting into disputes to find out if this is true or not.Made by the same team as WARTHUNDER so if you enjoy that then you should give it a try. First Impression verdict.If you own an Oculus Rift then yeah you should definatly check it out but if you own ELITE DANGEROUS then there is no real reason to stay too long. I would love to see the game grow and be able to compete with its WW2 counterpart			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a good game to get into. But there is a major problem with the game which I experiance, it takes way to long for matchmaking to make a match. If it's just your ships it takes around 5-10 minutes to find a match, if you are in a squadon add around 2 minutes per person to the wait time. This is insane, to wait on average 8 min for a >10min game and then repeat. But when you get into a game they are very enjoyable and I overall enjoy the game for its content, not so much its matchmaking.			"

												Great game for those who love Space games, those out there who really like Sci-Fi! However, if you like EVE online, this is NOTHING like EVE, for this is more a TPS then a space tactics game. In this game you will have a lot of fun blowing up and blowing the others up. In the lower tier, like Tier 1 and 2 ships, you can have a lot of fun, however, as you advance in Tiers, it gets much harder to kill and be killed, so watch out for that. A final thought, if you are not russian, and will play the game with 100-300ms of latency, it can be a little annoying getting killed by russians with 10-20ms latency, since the Shooting and Moving of the ships are all influenced by LAG.That's all, hope you like my review.

												I downloaded this game a few weeks ago, and finally got around to playing it a couple of days ago. I've only spent a few hours on it so far, but from what I can see it's based quite heavily on in-game purchases and DLC... I'm anything but good at these sort of games however, and I very much doubt that I'll be able to progress to a point where moving forwards is only possible through buying licenses and currency.In the early stages of the game- it's fun and enjoyable. I haven't gotten into it seriously at all, but it's still good for just messing about and having battles. If you're interested in the space battle genre but aren't planning to make this game a lifestyle, I strongly recommend it solely for the fact that it's free, and the early levels don't require any additional purchases. I'm not planning to dedicate myself to this game fully, and as a result I can enjoy fighting in a few battles in the evenings and exploring. If you're hoping to become more absorbed into Star Conflict and dedicate more time to it- then I do warn you that you will need to be willing to spend a fair bit of money to progress.			"

												To quicky describe this game, I use, ""It's like World of Tanks, but with starfighters instead of tanks."" Now, for a longer description, this game is actually pretty damn good. It's got solid gameplay, nice visuals, and I really like it. There are three classes of ships, and three sub classes for each. The three classes are 1: interceptors, which are fast moving lightly armored ships, 2: fighters, which are medium armed and armored and overall versatile ships, and 3: frigates, which are big, heavy, and slow moving ships. I won't go in depth with the sub classes, but for interceptor they are recon, covert ops, and ECM; fighters get gunship, command, and tackler; and frigates get long range, engineering, and guard. Each sub class has there own special main ability, or 'module' and a selection of other modules which are unique to that sub class, and there is also a selection of other multi-purpose modules that are avialible to all ships, no matter the class or sub class. Now, I think I've gone on ranting enough for this game, and if you've read this far, you've probably got the general idea of the game. I hope to see you up in the battle feild!			"

												I strongly recommend this game. While it is indeed, as they say, *grindy*, it is very fun to play.My hope is that they will decrease the grind later on overall, but if you focus on maxing outthe synergy of T1/2 you'll have a faster time synergizing the ship types you like to use in T3+. I suggest finding a good class after you finish T2, and grind it straight to T5. You'll be able to get the ships you want faster by using this method. Once in T5, you can even gain huge amounts of extra synergy.Of course, currently, if you want to transfer extra synergy to other ships that you just don't want to grind, you can simply pay a small fee to transfer the synergy from your T5 ship to your T3+ ships when you wish to skip a few ships to the one you like.Again, I really enjoy this game and will start playing it again as soon as I gain a computer that won't fry on me like the last one. :D                                 That is all                                                                           - WolfKhan			"

												A well done space sim, If you are just getting into MMO type game I reccomend this one. It is not only entertaining but it isnt as bad of a grind to the next ship as it is in other games.			"

												This game is like World of tanks just in space, you have to grind spaces ships to get higher ranks while upgradeing your weapons and other cool gizmos. It has good graphics, the controls are abit confusing at first but you get used to them; their are loads of differnt types of space ships from Command ships to recon to guards all have differnt tactics of use. The are differnt game modes from the standard Team battle (Team deathmatch) to Protect the Juggernaut and Capture the beacons to PVE missions to capturing territory. The grinds can be quite long but worth it.			"

												For starters this game is still in its beta stage (I believe) however they are making great improvements every month. The combat is extremely well thought out and functions just right for a game that's all about avoiding aponents and shoting them down wile keeping yourself alive. On high end PC's this game preforms flawlessly, but on lower end PC's you may get a lot of lag or very low res textures, but the game should still be playable.Soon enough open world exploarion wil be released out of its closed beta stage, and I believe that is when this game will really take off.Should you be considering this game, you should know that the leveling and equipment selections are somewhat ok. Those who pay will have a clear advantage over those who don't, but its not as though its impossible to do well without paying, it just requires a heaping load more of skill to succeed.I would seggest getting your friends involved too and communicating thourgh voice chat through steam. Being able to verbally communicate like you're the cast of some star fighting movie-spaceship-enterprise makes the combat and strategy tactics much better.			"

												This game totally took me by surprise, alot of the reviews make it sound like anyone with money will obliterate you in every scenario when this is clearly not the case.First of all anything you can spend money on only gives you a SLIGHT advantage ( 7% more sheild and hull strength, 7%!) as far as i can tell this game isnt pay to win, its pay to get past the grind because your lazy and have money laying around.As for the gameplay itself- Pve  gets boring but seems to remain challenging PvP is heavilly skill based ( you'll hear alot of talk about how frigates are OP, but any Veteran player will tell you how silly they are to bring down) They just implimented a new game mode ""invasion"" wich is basically just an open space survival mode kind of like Eve and Warthunder mixed together ( Totally amazing )			"

												Ok, for all the people who are rating bad about this game. This is not a pay to win game. You can pay for the best ships and still be bad at the game, I feel like that the people who rate bad, just don't have the patiance to get the skill. You dont First start with PvP, You start with PvE, and that is what i did. I took the time to develop my skill to be better, and i havnt payed a cent for this game. This is one of the best hardcore space game i have ever seen. i still dont get how many people can rate this game so bad. I have never experienced admin abuse, the Mods have actually been nice to me, they taught me the basics when i started playing. I would recommend this game to everyone if they have the patiance to play and get better, and not be a ♥♥♥♥♥y brat about how that other people are better than you.			"

												So far, So good.Star Conflict is  a mix of player vs Player and Player vs. Environment( CPU controlled opponents) giving it both a healthy and inviting mix for bot online and solo players alike.There is easy money to be had all around and no real need to spend real world dollars to have a good time.It has Dogfighting, Mining, Scavenging and other aspects that make it a fun package to play.I recommend it fully to anyone who likes flight/space sims.

Really good graphics, and super fun games. Totally reccomend it if you like flight simulation games, or fighter-pilot games. There are a lot of in-game purchases you can make, but they are optional.			"

												1.250 hours on the clock. What more is to say?++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Update on April 2nd; 2015:Maybe it is time to add something in response to some other so called reviews around here:There seem to be some players, who are talking about abusive admins etc. Since more than 1250 hours active game time I have seen not a single use of admin powers in terms of banning, let alone abuse.If you carefully read through those comments, they later all have to admit, that they were swearing, talking about drugs, using political names etc. For that, they got warnings and chat-mutes of a few hours.And now, we have some bad mooded kiddies who seek their revenge in negative comments.I suggest: if you ARE interested in this kind of game, try it for free. If you later decide to spend money on a DLC or Premium, you can do so by a personal opinion. Until then, you can enjoy the game for free.++++++++++++++++++++++++++Well, apperantly a lot. First - like a lot of those games (War Thunder etc.) you need to invest some hours to learn the game mechanics and what ship is doing what. Second, you need some patience, as this game is more or less in constant development. Sometimes they make it better, sometimes they make it worse. But, after all, it is free, and it generates a lot of fun. Especially, if you do it with a buddy or join one of the (better) corps (like clans) to play this together. There is PvP, PvE and an Open World Mode called Invasion (involves some Aliens).There are Premium ships, but they have not more killing potential than other, normal ships - they just don't need repairs and generates some % more free synergy (to level your other ships).Hint: don't spend your real money for transferring this synergy, but if you want, invest it in a licence to get more loot. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or go to the official forum pages @ forum.star-conflict.com "

												I'll Admit not the Best Flight Sim in the world but it definitely fills the gap between great games like TIE Fighter and Star Citizen (assuming it turns out to be what the hype says it will be). Anyway there are many differen Ships, modules and  play styles that keep the game interesting. The devs are always adding new things and are expanding the game at a nice pace. The new open World mode seems interesting but I will hold judgement on that for now it's still new and there are things to e worked out on it. BTW - for New Players here is a Pro-Tip there is a steep learning curve when you first start out. Prepare to die alot and not get many kills, but if you stick with it things will get a lot eaisy and you will have more fun in the game.Good Luck and BTW the Emperor's Hammer is always recuriting new Pilots... http://tc.emperorshammer.org/index.php "

												8.5/10People complain about the p2w things in game but really, the only thing I'm bothered is about how the first frigate long range missile can only be gotten by grinding quite a while.The reason why this game isn't p2w is because differences between ships are minimal. Sure, the next ship always costs a ton of money, devs really want you to buy it, but the next ship has like 500 more hull & 1000 more shield and like 30 more energy, which is pretty minimal in terms of difference. The game is actually quite fun. Just try it, it won't hurt.			"

												A simple review:  For a more oldschool gamer such as myself, Star Conflict brings to mind such classic space sims as X-wing series, Starlancer, and Freelancer - games I still enjoy to this day.  The atmosphere is impressive, both on the scale of the playing areas, and the soundtrack.  however, some of the sound effects have more business being in games that invovle an actual atmostphere and not the vacuum of space. Even one of my projectile weapons (one designed to be something like a shotgun for starfighters) sounds like an old shotgun sound effect.Graphically speaking, the game is simply beautiful, although the scenery outside the actual playing fields don't change much - you only notice this when flying in the new open space ""invasion"" mode.  In the PvE and PvP modes, which are much more faster paced and hectic, it won't be an issue.  Game play is relatively balanced, and constantly being tweaked, controls are fine tuned and adjustable, and the game can be effectively played with keyboard and mouse, gamepad, or joystick.If your pace is more MMO style, you can explore the relatively vast reaches of invasion space - the open world portion of the game.  For me, a guy who's perfectly content to explore this space in search of loot and crafting material, it stops just a little short of being fullfilling.  The mining opportunities are small, and the risks far outweigh the rewards, though considering the company seems to be pushing for more players to join the Invasion part of the game, as well as the crafting set up, this may change in the future.For clans, or ""corporations"" there is the conflict area of the game, where you and your corp fight for territory between the three main factions.  Can't say I've played this one yet, because a certain rank of ship is required, which is a shame...because it's the part of the game I was most excited for.overall, the game is much more than satisfying and enjoyable, constantly evolving - for better or worse, with an active support team involved in the game community, can't ask for much more than that.

Not really ""User Friendly"" at the beginning, but it's ton of fun when you find your kind of spaceship and get how to be a powerful ""Behemoth"" or a ""sneaky lil' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" to get the objectives. Style of play like ""Robocraft"" but without the construction of your vehicule but compensated by a gampplay ""à la"" Star wars...			"

												This game is very fast paced and enjoyable. Its like the things you see in the movies, explosions everywhere gunfire and a bunch of baddass looking ships you will see. Gaijin did a great job at this, i have played some other games such as war thunder that they made and i have not been disapointed.If you like fast paced action then this is your game.Pros:-Very fun-Good fast paced action-No P2W-Good developers-Pretty good graphicsCons:- I was expecting a game with lots od roles in each ship such as gunners radio operators etc, a bit like in war thunder.Rating:9.5/10			"

												Game is grindy, but it has a great potential and awsome fights. Best I've seen. I'd describe it as Team-Fortress Classic in space.Starting out all you want to do is get in fights and get kills, but that proves to not be the point. When you join with some better players you see that the ship's role (much like in team fortress) plays a major part in what you shold be doing.Since the devs do look for money and use a pay-to-advance-faster system it is a bit frustrating to see people move forward if they pay money, but the game is free to play and with the price that it's worth (in my opinion in the few tens of dollars) you can advance to a top T1 **easily**. When you're a top T1 you can play T1 and no one has an advance over you other than implants.Open space is nice but you really need a corporation (clan) for that, as well as dreadnaughts. You can use scanners to mine resources and advance a lot faster than you would otherwise. The community discovery is BAD and this is what really kills the game since you don't get a feeling of multiplayer when playing (no chat, no one uses voice in-game, no forums...).All in all the game has great potential, very very fun and addictive, needs more players.

												Star Conflict is a pretty solid arcade space 3rd person shooter with 3D movement. Sadly, the content becomes rather dull, and there is a considerable amount of grind. For new players, the lower levels can be painful, when higher players, tired of not finding games, come into their tiers with matched, but maxed ships and ruin their progress by sealclubbing. Overall, if played for free, a decent game.			"

												This game is a ton of fun. It may not be for everyone, but I like it.I will admit that this game is a bit tough to get through the bot filled tier 1 phase, and then the early under equipped phases when you finally make it to a new tier. However, with some planning on what to buy and when, this can be mitigated somewhat. I think it does a really good job of converting some of the familiar traditional flight combat sim mechanics into a more twitch based space theme. It forgoes a good bit of realism, but allows for more interesting matchmaking game modes, and an arcadey shooter feel.I definitely suggest checking it out, especially since it requires no real investment to get started and look around.

												Pros:+Great gameplay+Tons of ships to choose from+Customisable ships, allowing for different playstyles for each ship+Amazing graphics and level design+At Rank6, you get to explore open world maps+Later in the game, you can completely build ships with specs that fit your playstyleCons:-Pay 2 Win (but I guess that's what happens when you make a f2p game)-Confusing hub interface for new players-Controls take some getting used to-Requires plenty of strategy-You aren't exactly told that you can build ships or that an open world exists until you get that far in the game, so there's hardly any way for you to find it out.-Building ships takes a long time, and is confusing for newbiesThis game is everything you could want in a spaceship mmo. Short of building your own ship model or altering its shape, you have plenty of freedom and a large range of ships, weapons, and modules to edit your ships. You can leave your station and become a pvp bounty hunter if you so wish, or you can fight for the side of the humans and go to battle against aliens. It's all very expansive, but a lot of it you end up being blind to until you can get there. Trust me, the game's worth playing, and it's worth playing a lot.			"

												Pros:-easy to play and simple-decent graphics -space is actually space-NOT WG-grind is ok -PVE is pretty decent and pays well-premium account doesnt make a HUGE difference (see H&G and runescape for serious bonuses)-combat is mostly balanced-PREM ships mean didly squat if you have no or little skill, even your MAX MM opposition can be massacred as they really arnt OP compared to u-id have a few more pros but the text walls is getting realCONS:-no translation software -lagg battles-P2P content IS EXPENSIVE -long queue times unless your in the USA/EU/RU (AUS gets 10 mins at times during our prime time)-general language barrier between engrish players and devs (not mod team)			"

												As everyone can see i have alot of hours on this game. I have also played since the open beta so i have a good idea of how the game has changed over 3 odd years its been out. Take into acount when reading ANY REVIEW on this game that it is FREE TO PLAY and nearly all content bar premium ships can be obtained without spending money.i personally enjoy this game and its great to play with friends. The random people you will play with sometimes dont understand there role or teamwork like in most games.Pros-Due to the current changes you can get previously paid for ships without paying real money-Nice controls that are very easy to understand-Varied ship roles and classes-New destroyers and secret project ships are highly customizable-Free roam is really fun especially in squads (is limited to zones though) Cons-premium money system (payed for with real money)-There is ships that you can only get with money -The grind at later levels can be rather long just to upgrade weapons or single modules-The time and resources it takes to make a destroyer can take a long time to gatherThe tutorials are not very good so i would recomend trying all the ships as most fly differently.All the people who say its pay to win do not realise that the premium ships are maxed out versions of non premium ships. Also there are no weapons that are premium only.			"

												I like the game, but was irritated when the destroyers were introduced.  Players that have been playing for a long time have had a much harder time earming the required items for building a destroyer than new players do.Aside from that, the game has many different ways and levels to play.  It is fun to play, as long as you don't allow yourself to become frunsterated with your growth when it stalls for a while.			"

Apparently going through a bad periode for nowPlease read full review, I often vote ""meh"" or neutral, since it doesn't exist I vote either up or down but its quite meaninglessIl be be more specefic of the cons, because the downside is what matter the most after your interested in the game--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Returning player, used to play before in 2014-ish, returned due to destroyer update (as I liked frigate gameplay, sadly now impossible to play)Is the game still enjoyable ? YesAs enjoyable as before ? NoBasically this game is a arena based gamePVP sets you in a arena with different objectives ranging for plantings bombs to team death matchs and capture points, you get unlimited respawn but in recon where the designed commander has to be alive to allow respawnPVE sets you in a different arena, sometime with 3 different section (allowing you to respawn after each section) or a 1 block mission like fire support (no respawn), objectifs are usually destroy designed targets/capture points/kill bossOpen space is explained in the rest of the reviewPros-Looks good-Ship handling is decent-3 faction to choose from with the only big game changer being the Long Range Frigate (LRF) for the Empire and Jericho as the ship capability are quite the same otherise for the same ship classes-Open space mod (more like linked arena maps, because its litteraly the PVP maps with bots & loot linked via portals most of the time)-Ship design is very caracteristic of a faction-Can run on potato PC-The game lore evolves with updates (some old map station in open space are now turned into wreck field)-Other stuff I didn't mentioned because I'm too lazy to remember themCons-New tiering / unlock system (January 2016) : For War Thunder players, its the same here minus the BR thingFor non War Thunder players : you have 5 tiers, to go the next tier you need to unlock every ship of the previous tier, so if your like 1 gameplay style your forced to play all the other one too if you want to unlock the next ship of your favourite class^This is one of the things that legit scares me, that system can as well act a scarecrow for new players driving them away and some already playing with itLRF rant mode on-Remember what I said about the LRF?Forget Jericho for 90% of the timeReview of Jericho LRF-Fire a manually guided torpedo travelling at ~500m per sec-AOE effect-Possible to detonate it at any moment-Create a radiation cloud dealing medium amount of damage for 6 second-Don't require a direct line of sight-Reload every 15 sec-Easy to dodgeCountersGuardian frigtate : module destroying any type of guided missileFlares : all ships can carry it and it reload rather fast, disable torpedo steering controlsSmall ships : outrun your torpedo speedReview of Empire LRF-Enter a sniper mod when activated, fire a projectile travelling at ~3km per sec-Weapon can't be fired directly after activation-Reload in 2.5 sec-Has +2km more range than a Jericho torpedo-Afterburn damage dealing 25% of you shot damage 0.5 sec later-Require a direct line of sight-Deal more damage than a Jericho torpedo-Hard to dodgeCounters-Solid cover-Small ships : hard to aim-Engineer shield wall wich nearly no one ever useDue to the huge firerate / projectile speed and countermeasure gap, torpedoes falls flat into the utteraly useless sectionLRF rant mode off-With the destroyer update frigate gameplay pretty much died outGuardian basically play the same role as their name, they guard allies with powerfull defensives modules, and act as meat shield so they got one of the best HP & shield stats, its good defence is countered by bad offensive capacity (mind that a figher is outgunning you)Destroyers get 3x their HP & shields stats, they are more bullet spongy (is that even a word?) than the ship with this specefic role in mind with the icing on top being actually able to kick asses and move fasterThe only viable firgate are engineers because you will always need a healer and the Empire LRF because of reasons stated earlier-Open space is generic, nothing special happen, bots go in, fight each other, rince & repeat, no event ever happen (not even sure if the alien invasion event still occure since open space was launched)There is really no point playing this mod aside from destroyer part grinding (wich will take weeks to months at least or half the component) and some blueprint for some modules / guns--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Speaking of destroyers, after reading negatives reviews (yes I read the negative one before the positive ones)  Il give you a tipOnce you can make one (assuming you didn't died of old age grinding the parts for it), take a screenshot where it says you have the ressources to do so, because from what I read of some negative reviews is that the support might give the ""no proof no refund"" excuse, if your game crash / get logged off when building one and it waste your ressouces for nothing in return, you have a proof to back you up			"

												grinding is really boring.but the pvp aspect is fine and it is free.its good to try until the grind.PVE. well same as counter strike with botthere is some kind of free roam. but if you try to roam at low rank you will just be killed by aliens unless you use npc as meat shield or use a fast ship.there is however bunch of modes or content locked by rank.to tired to grind for it.i wish they put a bait for us f2p players to get going other than relying on pay 2 play to cut the time.i do wish developers learn for warframe and put bunch of depth for f2p players until they got caught and cant get out because of the time commitment they put in. either buy or play more or have a choice to wait until your stuff got made which make players go back to play more.with that said it is satisfying to play free for couple of days.

												I'll break my review into two parts; the pro and cons.Pro:1) Addictive game. Very fun to play and never gets boring2) Great customization. Shields, speed, attack damage, attack speed, critical damage, etc. Almost everything on your ship is customizable. If you lose, it's your own fault. Not the game's.Cons1) Community and GMs. You can chat about anything you want on SC...if the right GM is online. You will be banned from chatting (for 1 hour) if you write things the GMs disagree about. For example, A) On the US server you can only type in English. Typing in Spanish or any other language will get you banned for an hour. B) Be very careful of your political comments. I have seen people get banned for mentioning ""Obama"" or ""Obamacare"". You are free to say anything about Romney though. C) If you want to kick back and chat instead of dog fighting all day, you can get banned for chatting too much. D) if you chat about how much the exchanges in the game cost (cash for standards) you will get banned.E) Complaining about the launch time for pve or pvp will get you banned.Btw, the term ""Ban"" in the above comments mean you won't be able to type in the chat for one hour. You can still play but you can't talk.Summary, great game but horrible GMs.			"

												Star Confict Game star conflict ini adalah game yang bergenre DMMO dan action game , yang dimana kita sebagai pengemudi kapal perang luar angkasa untuk betarung melawan musuh .berawal dari galaksi yang dibagi antara kerajaan bintang militan dsn kelompok tentara bayaran independen , dimana banyak galksi - galaksi yang sudah di tinggalkan dan di pakai sebagai base dari tentara bayaran independen , perebutan galaksi pun terjadi dimana terbagi dalam 3 koloni yaitu empire , federation dan jericho .penilaian :gameplay :menurut saya gameplaynya menarik , luamayan seru juga , gak ada storyline game ini soalnya ini game onlinegame ini bisa di maintain dengan 2 mode view yaitu “TPS” dan “FPS” , banyak fitur” menarik di game ini karena ini game perang kapal luar angkasa jadi banyak sekali pilihan kapal - kapal perang yang dapat di beli. kita    harus mengikuti prosedur - prosedur jika ingin membeli kapal , (seperti jika membeli kapal ini , kapal sebelumya    yang kita pakai harus menvcapai level 5) , tidak semua kapal bisa di beli dalam game , ada beberapa kapal yang   bebentuk DLC berbayar yang harus di beli jika mau membeli kapal tersebut , jika berminat bisa membelinya di   steam store . dalam pemilihan kapal juga ada yang namanya ""DIVISI"" , jadi kapal - kapal tersebut memiliki jenismasing - masing serti kapal tipe ""fighter"" ,""interceptor"",""guarded"", dll . setiap kapal pun memiliki rank - rank jadi   berurut secara bertingkat. setiap kapal memiliki senjata dan skil - skill yang berbeda - beda dan juga  bisa upgradeagar lebih baik dalam bertempur . Game ini di bagi menjadi 2 mode  play yaitu ""PvP"" dan ""PvE"" atau bisa di   bilang ""PvAI"" , maksimal dalam pertempurang adalah 24 prang (12 v 12 ) dan minimumnya ( 2 v 2 ) . tempat yang di   pakai dalam pertempuran sudah pasti luar angkasa , tetapi ada banyak tempat yang dapat kita tempati secara  random atau acak , dalam pemilihan tempat juga harus memperhitungkan  level , semakin tinggi level kita kita akan   dapat mengunlock tempat - tempat . yang terakhir adalah ""level"" level dalam game ini berbentuk dalam ""rank"" dan   dilihat bukan dari exp tapi dari rank saat membeli kapal tempur  luar angkasa , jadi semakin kita membeli kapal   dengan rank tertinggi , semakin tinggi rank kita dan bisa meng unlock tempat - tempat dan fitur - fitur lainnya .grafik 	:grafik game ini menurut saya luamayan bagus dan bisa dimainkan dengan pc atau laptop yg ber-kartu grafis rendahkriteria minimum dan rekomendasi bisa di lihat langsung di steamstorenya efek - efek dalam pertempuran juga sangat keren pastinya dengan fitur - fitur ledakan , laser - laser , dll kelebihan : - fitur - fitur dalam game yang menarik - tidak terlalu sering update - dapat dimainkan oleh pengguna pc atau laptop berkartu grafis rendah *tidak di bawah 512mb- memiliki banyak jenis kapas - DLC nya juga menarik - Kapal - kapal luar angkasanya keren - keren bentuknya - bisa memodifikasi warna kapal - tidak terlalu sulit dalam ""PvE"" kekurangan : - bukan game steam jadi harus membuat account di tempat lain yang memakan waktu - pemainnya tidak terlalu banyak - dalam searching game kadang bisa diatas 2 menit - banyak kapal - kapal yang dalam bentuk DLC berbayar - memakai mode ""TOP UP""- dapat membosankankesimpulan : jika kalian pecinta game perang kapal luar angkasa , game ini sangat cocok untuk dimainkan , game ini gratis di steam store jadi dapat di jangkau oleh semua pengguna steam , atau dapat download di http://star-conflict.com/en/		    game/aboutsharkql			"

And as far as I am aware the only ships that you can pay for arn't that much better than the regular ones.As for the the balancing issues which people keep complaining about just choose a different ship mid fight that will beat the other ship, simple.The graphics are good (IMO)Most importantly I am having fun playing it and when it realy comes down to it that is the only thing that matters.I hope you find this helpfull :) "

												I remember playing this game almost one year ago. Back then, it was very intense! Tons of flight controls, but suprisingly easy to learn, and although it looked cpu heavy, it was rather nice to the lower end computers. I can't tell you the number of times i was riding just 2 feet away from a structure, riding so close to it in order to make my chaser trip up or when you narrowly avoid everyone riding your behind with one well timed defensive active ability and some creative manuver. However, it clearly has degraded into a truely pittiful game. It use to be a very actiony game, where your skills, guts, timing, and location mattered more then any gun or ship you accually used. Bahh, now it has degraded into such a pay to play pithole, where the opposite is true. Dam, I don't know what all went wrong over that one year, but i can smell that something has, be it different (and incompetent) management, or this was there original plan from the begining. Use to be one of the most fun games ever, now it's borderline trash.			"

												Use to play this game a lot, I getting into a matchmaking with high ping and never get to win the battle. Even playing PvE or PvP, just keep losing and losing. Not sure what to do and waste a lot of time keeping up then turn up a looser. No matter where I play with the team, the AI were too strong to defeated and just keep losing the match, wasting 20 minutes or 15 minutes to play get not enough credits and not enough to upgrade ship. I don't mind the Pay To Win, I only enjoy the game though it would better then War Thunder after the update just make the game worse. Not a really good chance to waste time for losing in this game again.			"

												Used to be a fun space shooter. Until it slowly descended to 'Pay or grind as full time job' game.TL;DR:*While you can acquire (some) premium ships without paying, some of them need optimisticly 150 hours or so to get them.*A lot of new additions like weapons and special modules are premium ship exclusive*Entire ship class is inaccessible without farming random grindimonium ore drops, to craft grindimonium plates, then grindimonium parts to get the ship in the end. Plus a good amount of other stuff is needed too.However the battles are fun in early game and it's free(mium), so no harm in trying out yourself			"

												Its fun for a few minutes, then it gets frustratingly hard to progress, and even when you do, its not rewarding.It takes forever to get paired up in a matchIf you play PvP, you die a lot and don't get xpIf you play PvE, some opped-out Russian steals all your kills and you don't get xpIf you play exploration/out-of-match questing, you don't get xp, money or any satisfaction whatsoeverThe only way to get xp/money is to buy membership to double the miniscule ammount of xp/money you do get.Don't spend money to buy ships; they're no better than any others. Gold-class ships only have to perk of generating extra synergy which (yes you guessed it) you have to pay more money to transfer to your other ships because they start off maxxed (which also does nothing).No matter how much time and energy you put into upgrading your ships, there will always be at least 10 other people in your match who paid real money to get overpowered weapons, ships, and modules to be a million times better than you.Community sucks.Customer support sucks unless you're Russian.Guard ships and Long-Range ships are rediculously OP, especially in PvPThe only way you progress is being really good or paying money; there's no graduation of difficulty, or benefits for new players; its hard right away, and stays hard.Perks:-the combat is cool when you're not dying constantly-3D movement is cool as well, but would be cooler if the scenery didn't force you to think in a 2D manner.-stars-yelling at your teammates for wiping the group1/10 you could easily skip this one			"

												I like this game. I hope one day to own each and every piece of DLC for this game. I love the starship designs, Flight controls are pretty basic and awesome compared to most starship flight games. I love the PVE and the PVP is one of the best parts of this game in general. I wish this game was in my steam liberary completely. Also I would love if there was a complete wiki of all the Starships and how to get them in English so that someone who collects pixal starships can know at what cost and how they are achiable within the game and within the DLC. more people need to play this game and more people need to play this game with me. someday this might actually be worth a gold subscription as well. so there is that. /B-Money			"

												It isn't open world. Just individual small maps. There is nothing but combat, no exploration or trading etc. You just spawn again when you die and you play in short ""Red Vs Blue"" matches where you could end up on either team. Not a lot to this game to be honest i was expecting more. Also the flight controls are very arcadey even when set to ""EXPERT"".  If you are looking for a Space combat game with simulation type controls this is not for you. Also there are nearly a dozen types of currency which is about ten too many.If you are looking for Call of Duty style deathmacthes in Space then this is it. It's very similar to Mech Warrior Online in many aspects (except for the respawning), but in a space game i dont like being boxed into a tiny map. Personally not what i want in a space game.  "

												Unless you want an exercise in frustration with Pay2Win tactics, patching that changes the entire premise of the game and generally frustrating gameplay and teammates, stay away from this absolute pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are NO MMO attributes in it, it's basically a FPS in space with traditional pay2win characteristics. Unless you want to drop $100, stay away. NOT A FREE GAME.To make matters worse, getting items (a.k.a. loot) is now a pay-to-win system too. Here's how you get items: Win, firstly. Then you have 3 'chances' to uncover items, usually finding 'debris' which is just vendor trash that sells for 10% of market value. THEN you have to 'recover' any items you actually found, which is a 10% chance to do so. 30% if you want to pay real money. So you have a 50% chance, then a 30% chance and a 10% chance on top of that. Do the math friends, stay away from this Russian piece of crap.			"

												I don't find this fun at all. It seems like at every corner the game pokes you and says:"" Hey you can pay real money for this to be easier,faster or more FUN"" every mechanic has some waiting to it even tho it is a lobby style pvp battle game.You have to pay for ammo,repairs,respawning or WAIT quite a long time it is really stupid in this kind of game. The whole time i played this game i kept thinking that i would have more fun if i paid for the ""better"" stuff, but i don't like this kind of forcing me to pay. And everything end up taking so long to achieve or the prices quickly become unrealistic if you want to be on par with anyone unfortunately.And since there is not many new players it seems like everytime i played anything i was poorly matched and it ended in a disaster where i had no chance to do anything at all with the gear i was able to buy, and everytime i keep dying it just makes everything slower and boring because you are so punished for doing so in this game, to try and push you to pay for faster timers or more ammo or better♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												NIce idea, bad approach.Game play has a steep learning curve, if you can get past the curve it can be fun.  The tiers for PVE are too large, after tier 4 there is 5 ranks of ships to top of tier and all PVE encouters are based on rank 9. This mean you'll have to level most of your 4-8 ships with bonus experience.  I presume from 10-15 will be much the same.  Open world is extremely difficult under rank 6-7 and the difficulty scales up rapidly.Modules require multiple faction credit and it costs to change factions.Leveling without cash shop is near impossible past rank 6, and the caash shop prices are too expensive.  No micro purchases, everything is in the 5-50 dollar range.Terrible group ques for PVP. Want to play with a group of friends, more than one will see regular 5+ minute wait times.			"

												This is one of those games that I love the idea for, but it is sadly ruined for the use of Pay 2 Win.I was in the middle of a round, when I died. I was like ""Okay, I guess I'll try again."" But nope, I immediately see a message saying something like ""You can ressurrect your ship with a duplicator, or you can wait till the next round."" I'm sorry, but that is a terrible Pay-2-Win method. You can't learn from your mistakes if you have to pay money to get back into the action. And I'm not waiting 15 minutes to get to the next round while I sit back and watch my other team mates with way better items than me having a good time. I actually wouldn't mind spending a few $ on this game. But that message alone ticked me off to the point of uninstalling it.			"

												I started Playing this game about 2 months ago. In the beginning it was pretty easy to play it, but then in time i was hitting aginst a wall with my progress. The graphics are nice but the gameplay...The first moment i realized since the update with the alien fraction was that the game started to change. My rewards got less and less and the time I used in every playmode has gotten much more, sometimes i thought my gaming skills were lacking. After the news caught my attention, I knew: dis♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is PAY TO WIN!! Star onflict has gotten more and more boring and the devs focused on making players pay money for everything that gave a good progress.The ressources needed to manufacture for example a Destroyer were too hard to get, and the biggest problem of all, the clan NASA (server: EU) has kind of taken over the gameplay.I despise this game and abandon it forever, because it reminds me of Daybreak. Daybreak is likely focusing only on gaining money, so is Gaijin.My advice: don't waste your time on this game,it's the worst you will ever find.			"

												A great game with a decent concept that's plagued by a horrible progression system that encourages you to trend towards microtransactions. Add in to the fact you have to spend real-world money just to part up with anymore than two people, and you have a recipe for your standard greedy microtransaction based game.the gameplay itself is fairly solid, ship-to-ship combat is interesting and the game looks and plays great. Its just a shame that its burdened by such terrible design decisions. I would've gladly paid 50+ dollars for a game like this, but the constant need to spend reworld money (or spend an absurd amount of time grinding) keeps me from spending any sort of cash on games like this.

												This game certainly isn't the best Space-sim.Although the graphics are fairly good, the game does not give you any information as to what you are supossed to do after that: It gives no tips or guides in knowing what currencies do what, what upgrades are preffered, etc. Quests are also in a disarray. The game also seems to be leaning towards money tranactions.The matchmaking takes several minutes; and the gameplay, within itself, is not very good. PvP is all too easy/impossible, the only thing that matters is who is on the tale of the other: If you are being pursued, you are a dead pilot flying. If you are chasing... the person who you are chasing is gonna get it. That is really all there is too it, sadly. This game is free, and thank goodness for that. I got it to test out an old-gen Oculus Rift, and I can't say I've gotten around to it.			"

												Star Conflict is a third person space combat game. The game currently features some PvP, PvE and PvAI scenarios. You get to pick one of three factions, Jericho, Federation and Empire, each with unique stats on their ships. The combat in Star Conflict feels solid, there's always bullets, plasma, lasers and rockets flying in all directions, and it's ships do not fly like Star Wars, as they fly like planes in space, here ships can remain still, move in all directions without limitations. You get to pick one of three ship types at first, Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate, from smallest to biggest.The game itself puts heavy focus on team work. PvE Missions and PvP requires some co-ordination with your team. Truth be told, when a team works together they are unstoppable. My favorite type of ships are the Fighters, and it's role Tacklers, focusing mostly on throwing de-buffs and cloacking behind enemy lines. This game is to be experienced with friends and comrades, and if you need someone to guide you, let me know, In-game my nick is Richyda. PS: If you wish, use this code to be my refferal, you instantly get me into your friend list, so would be easier to contact one another.D42BF26E5AFF755DBE6571472126F2A7 Use it just when you are about to select your starting faction, thanks!

												I used to like playing this game, because it was an action arcade 3rd person space shooter. Ticking all the right boxes of my predilections. However, after a few updates, the game became grindy very quickly. You now have to use ships incessantly to get “synergy” which upgrades them, unless you buy a premium ship. Repairs cost money unless you buy premium. I stopped playing for a few months and then went back with the new update. Wow was I surprised, they have now made the game 1000% more grind orientated. You used to upgrade ships based on usage, it was free. Now you need to grind for it, not just for synergy but faction synergy, or you can use universal synergy with cost money. You also have to grind to upgrade ship components, oh and with multiple requirements, or you can pay.Instead of working on ship balancing or gameplay fun or even matchmaking queues (as the wait times for a match are ridiculous), all attention is focused on money and how to squeeze more from you. Oh and forget about the free roam stuff, that has a limit installed, you can only do a few missions per day, and then you have to wait for it to reset. Yep, loads of fun right?!Honestly I'm surprised they haven't monetised the log in.Stay away from this rubbish.			"

												Used to be addicting grind until an update where income and experience gains were nerfed for free players. You don't get to make squads bigger than two players even though patch notes say you do (unless you pay real money). Tiers are shuffled to total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Tier ones against tier threes, two's against fours, average lifetime counted in seconds for new players. Clan gameplay seems to have a trend where people have secondary computers or their friends mixing into matchmaking and if they are shuffled on the opposing side of their clan, they just park their ships effectively giving the other team an advantage, especially in kill the captain matches.Entire gameplay seems to change in every major patch. Cannot in good conscience recommend spending any money on this.			"

												Update 6/20/16Lol holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The grinding is actuallythe worst setup I've ever seen in a game. Either spend hours, literally consecutively for months all day every day, playing the game to make slow progress, or make none at all and try to play it casually. Teamwork is non existant, if you're a frigate in PvP glhf. Even if you use a good PvP ship for your level with maxed equipment, the ranking system is absolutely horrible. I queued with all rank 7 ships and was thrown in a game where the vast majority had rank 10+ ships, and I know it's not based on survivability because theirs was obviously signifigantly higher than mine was. Open world is still unbalanced as all Hell, lower level players can't leave the station without getting destroyed. Leveling up makes absolutely no sense. I take that back, I'm sure you can figure it out after hours of messing around in the game, but they really never explain the leveling system at all other than what synergy is and how to buy new ships. I logged on to get my reward and had no new guns or equipment from the last time had logged on, then logged off. I logged on 30 minutes later only to have randomly unlocked a slew of new equipment and alien weapons that was apparently supposed to be automatically given to me once I got a rank 7 ship, which I have several of. The new support ships are really cool, the only downside is that the grind for them takes so damn long. They came out late last year and I just talked to a casual player, someone who doesn't waste their time playing this game nonstop, and he told me he started manufacturing his support ship the day he could and he was just recently able to finish it last week. They're cool and all but for the grind it couldn't be any less worth it. The transfer rate for GS to credits is still a huge slap in the face, there's honeslty no need to explain just check for yourself or take my word. It seems like the devs did a great job improving the handling of the ships and hit registration, however with every update they seem to find a way to make the grind even harder if you don't supply them with a constant flow of cash.I'd also like to add that they still haven't made the game any more enjoyable for new players. I stopped playing this game for months and when I came back I was able to get back into it pretty easily. My friend however had only played enough to get a rank 2 ship and getting into the game was just impossible. I queued with him usuing a rank 2 ship and we were against players that were in rank 4-5 ships PvP and with rank 4-5 ships in PvE which made the difficulty harder. Tiers 1 and 2 are still as awful as they always have been since they made it pay to win and it doesn't look like they're planning on changing that, making it offputting to new players. Tier 3 is better but there is a noticable difference between rank 7 and rank 8 ships that can make some battles very unbalanced. A new weapon added during my hiatus, the Flux Phaser, makes playing certain fighters a whole lot easier. I for example love using it on my Commander ships because it allows me to keep good distance and deal signifgant damage. A lot of people seem to think the weapon is overpowered, mainly because they've been hit by more than one ship using a Phaser at once, but this brings up the teamwork aspect of this game. There is a video on YouTube of a coordinated team all using Phasers and they were melting ships in seconds, but that would happen with pretty much every weapon because they were focusing their fire on one or two ships at a time. The weapon itself is pretty balanced, the only real edge it has is that it's extremely easy to master using because of it fires homing shots. If you think that's OP then you have to think the beam cannon is OP because its a ♥♥♥♥ing 100% accurate laser that travels at the speed of light that progressively gets stronger over time. My only complaint about the Flux Phaser is that I don't like how wierd it can be to shoot. Sometimes when I'm in a fight and spamming it I'll run into issues like the shot popping too early or the shot being fired when I let go of LBM then instantly popping. Other than that it's fun. I have't gotten to really look at the Mass Driver yet, the new weapon for frigates (at least I think it is, I never saw when I used to play), but I can't say it's something I think will be usefull on all frigates. For example I'm not sure I'd put it on my Guard ship because of the low rate of fire and weaker damage. Its better on LRF's which can shoot faster and need a good close range weapon other than the Beam Cannon to deal with Interceptors and Fighters that get too close.Pros:Great flight mechanicsGreat fighting mechanicsGreat graphics, especially for a F2PA cool ranking system with the potential to be funNice communityA good amount of eventsFun missionsCons:Hardcore pay to winUnbalanced matchmakingExtremely tedious grindNew ships are always high rank shipsVeteran friendly, very hard for new players to get into and enjoyEvents usually require a specific weapon or skill level that only higher level players would haveThe occasional♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥All that aside I'll still play it casually, I just can't recommend anyone get into the game unless they're willing to dish out some dough and put a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of hours into the game.------------------------------------------{Old review}I can no longer suggest this game to new players after the last few updates.You can no longer pick your teammates up in PvE mode unless you have a one time use duplicator, which is a waste of time and money to get just to revive one person. (A lot of people at higher ranks have hundreds, but it's still an uneccessary addition to the game that only serves the purpose of adding a little extra difficulty to the grind.)Missile launchers in PvE respawn almost instantly making it ridiculously hard. (fixed to a degree)The open world idea is good, but it has no balance. If you go in with an Interceptor, you have the speed to get out of fights, but not enough defense/power to survive. If you use a Fighter, you have decent power and defense, but you're still too slow to escape the sometimes brutal skirmishes with NPC's. If you go in with a Frigate, you have the power and defense to fight, but you're far too slow you run away if you have to. (♥♥♥♥ you)This may just be me, but since the last time I got on, I've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of synergy and credits I get after a fight. I got a premium license to see if I could get more syn/creds and it just ended up giving me the normal amount from before. (♥♥♥♥. you.)I want to like this game, I really do, but the developers have finally set it up where it is completely pay to win. To survive PvE, you need a premium ship and duplicators. To survive skirmishes, you need a premium ship with a ton of active module spots. To survive open world, you once again need a premium ship with extra module spots. If you want any synergy or creds, you need to buy a premium license. This game was really fun when it first came out, now it's no different than the other F2P games on Steam. Get out your credit card or go home.			"

												Really was fun game, unlike other Space Shooters it's more active,, had really nice Hardcore PvE and Fun PvP modes, now they add Open Areas (opens after Rank 6, so then you will find how games shouldn't be balanced, you on R6 ship go to the space to do mission and there camping a player on R 12+ ship... Boom and you die before game loads, NPC defenders who are near didn't even care that enemy is in the space), with low rank ships is really hard to find PvP match, so you must stuck in PvE for quite long period, also you need Currency (Contracts) that can be obtained just from PvP and this currency is important to get somehow normal equipement (even for PvE, in PvP without that equip you will be easy farm for enemies), but as I say it's really hard to find PvP match, yesterday, just for an experiment tried to start match, but was waiting more than 3 hours and match didn't start... Also match making is way unbalanced (if you will find any), you easily will meet enemies that are 4 Rank higher than you (shortly, they will kill you in one shot, you will kill them Never, so even in PvP you have no chance to make contracts). Still are many cheaters and bug users, that totally kills fun in PvP, especially in US and Russia regions (will be nice if they add VAC protect, In open world things are much worst. Shortly you should spend a lot of money to play normally this game and as minimum have fun, other way you can just grind PvE or wait 3+ hours to start PvP and meet enemies that have 4-6 Rank higher ships than you, + cheaters.Was really fun and balanced game, but now this is♥♥♥♥♥♥and not the game for P2W lowers. Only one thing why you can love this game - Cheating is allowed if you spend money here.			"

												The core part of this game is fun and I'll continue to pick and poke at it despite not recommending it, to anyone, ever.For whatever reason, it is not possible to play on a server that offers a lag free gaming environment.  The dev's have decided that they want shorter queing times, even if this means that the matches you are given are routinely unplayable due to terrible server destinations.  I've checked this out on the game's forums, and many people complain about it.  The devs claim everything is ""working as intended"".The really annoying thing about this is that players are heavily penalized by server side lag.  If you tough it out and stay in a laggy match, your personal stats suffer, and your progression is slowed.   If you leave a laggy match, you're locked out of looking for a new one until the old match expires.  Though it hasn't happened to me, I've heard a lot of talk about people facing temperary bans for leaving matches that are simply unplayable.This issue could be cleared up with a larger player base, maybe...  I can't imagine the path Star Conflict would take to get those players.  Since the game is free to play, new players have no vested interesting in completely what could be a 1000+ hours of grind on servers that seem to be positioned somewhere between where you want to play from, and the moon.War Thunder, also from Giajin, is an all around better game for those looking for something fun and free to play.

												This game has low tolerance for server stress and so expect frequent glitches, crashes, and your ship will start having very little control and shaking sizures making you exoplode. Darn that sniper! I do not recomend this game to anyone like me who hates glitches and crashes or any shennanagans like that. So this will make there be so much salt and rage people will toss you into the Dead Sea because there are so many glitches you can't help being very mad and salty (like Rhabby_V fom Mr. Fruit).			"

												Game seems super fun but it plaged by some pretty obvious problems.Around the middle of the tiers you get wrecked by extremely firece grind. Like world of tanks once you get to around tier 5/rank 5 you hit a massive grind wall that is quite daunting.The ques take forever as well, you will wait 20 minutes to get into a co-op vs. AI despite it being the best game mode for exp and money. Dead game.			"

												Its a cash cow game. I played up until the open world part of it, and it was boring, empty, and disappointing. The devs apparently are shady as hell, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money supporting them. If you are looking for your space flight sim fix, hopefully an honest dev will develop it soon, I'm looking forward to No Man's Sky. Pros:-Actually works, a decent skin level space flight sim-Good graphics (In my opinion)-Had fun for 12 hours. It was an enjoyable experience that diminished the farther along I got.Cons:-Shady devs-You need some cash to have fun after a certain point-If others have money to throw around in this game, enjoy the animation of you getting destroyed. Its not that I'm upset that I lost, I'm just upset at not having a chance. Even in Dark Souls there are ways to grind and, as the youth says, ""Git gud"".-So many other good space games coming out. They aren't arcadey like this. Look up Star Citizen or No Man's Sky, if you haven't already. Angel's Fall First is another game to take a quick look at.-RepetitiveHope this helped some of y'all. If you really want to take a look at Star Conflict, go ahead! Its free to play, and you might enjoy yourself for a little bit, so no harm done. This is just my honest review. Thanks, have a great one			"

												One heck of a fun space battle, including PvP and PvE capabilities, modding of ships, and dog-fights that feel they will never end. The controls for the mouse can be a little bit of a learning curve, the expansive universe of options can feel a little overwhelming, and there is a ""premium content"" fee, however, if you just wanna dart around blowing ships up - this is a go.

												Prepare to spend 20 Minutes in que  to die in 2 minutes of game play.  Only  well organized ""coporations"" play this game actively, they are mostly russian and if you aren't in one of those corporations you will  Lose every pvp match you pug your way into.  20 minutes is not an exadgeration..  For pvpa nd PVE match maker times are  LONG... some times as quick a 1-2 minutes but often as long as 10-15 minutes  you will spend  just  waiting.  ""4 min max""  is meaningless... you pass 4 minutes and still wait. Open world mode is lame.  PVE is repetive and  PVP is a Waste of time...   The game is just terrible,  but not because it's a terrible game.  I really liked playing it  when I could get a game and I liked the variety of ship times.. but Cons  far outweigh the fun game play though. I don't recomend wasting your time here.			"

												Can't see the attraction of this game...  Maybe I need more time in the game, The intro is very poor, or felt limited. Mostly it seemed to revolve around completion \ progress quests and gave little to no feel about how the game will progress. Maybe this is all there is to this game... certainly did not pique my interest to continue much further.The hanger controls\UI feels like it was designed for a web platform, although right cick options seemed useful.Early gameplay seems to revolve around online instance battles, but you can be left waiting several minutes for match ups (at least that happened to me before I gave up).|I also didn't know how to quit battles after my one or two ships were destroyed (yes, I probably suck at this game...) but then I was left hanging around until the battle finishes.I mistakenly tried some misions with a controller as there is partial support for this, but mouse and keyboard are probably the way to go.Combat UI seems better designed, than the hanger UI, which is probably more important.

												The game has an interesting concept and potential but is far away from being finished (still in beta) and playable.At first it is fun to play this space action game as it has depth and takes some strategy to win.But soon you'll realize that this game is unbalanced, matchmaking is awful and servers are terrible.The lack of players especially in non-Russian territories makes this game even more difficult to play with long wait times for matches.The open beta is going on for a year or longer and the game still doesn't have a release date yet. They plan to implement more features and game modes this year and supposed to officially release the game but that all seems far away with the baby steps in development (even though they release a patch every week now but only with minor adjustments).If you still want to play this game I recommend not spending much if any money. Don't get fooled by the progression (ship ranks) take your time to get to higher ranks and fully level/synergize all your ships. "

												The game when starting was AWESOME, basically the same stuff than War Thunder but with space-ships.The controls are kinda hard when beggining but when you get used to them they are really funny and entretaining.A lot of ships, meaning a lot of game time to get used to each one of them and learning their strong points and flaws, also very entretaining.A some-what great community (at least on global chat).Thats the pretty part of the game... only when you start.After unlocking the third or fourth ship... everything went into the grindfest:1.PvE restricts you to 1 or 2 missions with different difficulty (easier and you dont earn nothing OR impossible and still dont earn a lot), thats why you can do party with low leveled people and take your Tier 5 ship into the first mission on easy.2.PvP is extremely unbalanced, since you can get more than half of new players with Tier 1 ships against a team with Tier 5-6 ships.3.The grind after a while becomes ridiculous, you go from a kinda affordable ship to one that takes WEEKS or even MONTHS to unlock, of course... you have to LV UP the ship that was BEFORE the one that you want to unlock if you want to do so.4.Upgrades follow the same path, since this game was made for people buying memberships that gives boosts (and lets not mention the premium ships which gives an even more insane boost) so you basically have to spend real money constantly to keep the ingame currency on a stable flow, since not only upgrades becomes insanely expensive but the price of the REPAIRS that you must carry to make your ships ""usable"" again takes at least 60% (If not more) of the battle rewards.5.Lag, yeah, lag, even if this game its not that demanding, there are many situations (and with many means ALL the time) which the screen gets so heavily loaded with effects, explosions and stuff, that either, you end up blind until everything goes away OR you get hard lagged and crash against a random rock floating in the scene.6.Either or you get a incredible win streak (which means the PvP matchmaking working properly, which it never happens.) PLUS membership PLUS premium ships to keep a somewhat ""stable"" currency flow, or you have to go back to previous Tiers, meaning more and more grinding.7.Faction system is worthless, since you can pay a sum of game currency and simply switch to another faction, same goes for clan wars, there is not a ""real"" reason of being in one.This game is fun up to a point, after that, it just gets annoying, unless you have fun with hours and hours of grinding, rogue-like teammates that basically are kill-hoggers, which means that if the whole team gets crushed they wont care, they got their kill, DLCS and ""I got the most OP premium ship in the game"" players, then this is your game.(By the way: this goes for War Thunder too, but with planes.)

												With the start of Season 2 and the exciting arrival of dreadnoughts for inter-corporation battles, I decided I would finally write a review for this awesome game, to which I have devoted a large part of my life for the past year (you decide if that is a good thing or a bad thing ;) ).First of all, why is it a good game? Beautiful graphics: ships maps and backgrounds (tip: press Alt+H in-battle to remove the HUD) PVP, PVE and Invasion (open world) game modes Large variety of maps in all game modes Hundreds of fully customisable ships, with many different types of modules Corperations - the game's clans system It's FREE TO PLAY!!! and definitely not pay to win - all premium ships only offer small advantages over their non-premium counterparts, if any at allWhat is wrong with the game? (it has to be mentioned, despite my love for the game...) Fairly small matches in higher tiers Low population on anything other than EU/RU prime time High ping for US pilots on RU servers and vice versa High grind, but hey? who want a game you can complete in two days?  Also there are plenty of ways to reduce grind by using real money, if that is what you are looking for. Previously I would have said lack of communication on the dev's behalf, but this seems to have changed recently Difficulty to get matches in squads, since with the current system, a squad of the same size as yours has to queue up also, before you can get into a match.Some tips for someone trying the game for the first time: Please try the game until tier 3 (ranks 7-9) at least.  This will give you the best overall view of the game, as t3 is where you get the largest PVP matches, and where most of the intercorporate tournaments happen. Join a corp as soon as you reach t2/t3, and ask around for a corp that uses voice comms.  You can easily find one on the forum.  Joining a corp will help you make friends, and make the most out of the game.  They can give you advice, ship builds, squad with you, and just generally have a good laugh together! The forum has a lot of information. Get involved! Ask questions and the game's veterans will be glad to help you! (maybe your thread will turn into a huge off-topic debate, but that's another matter...) Try all ship types from all factions, before you choose your favourites.  They all have very different playing styles! PVE can be very useful to gain credits rapidly, while PVP is better for synergising (levelling-up) your ships. Watch out in Invasion, there are pilots like mysself lurking around ;) If you just want to farm bots, don't forget to put your station protection on before undocking.  Also don't forget that certain zones have no station protection.I look forward to meeting you on the battlefield! GL and may the biomorphs leave you unmolested!			"

												After 4000 hours on the game, it's time for a review !I saw a lot of changes in StarConflict in 2 Years. (And looking back, they were all good)There are a lot of people giving ""bad review"" without understanding completly the game or having see all the content that the game can offer.To prevent the wall of text ! Gameplay : The game propose various ships (3 Classes each divided in 3 differents roles for a total of 9 roles) offering tons of diversity fitting to what you want to do or how you want to play. Secondly, at the difference of most of the other games, you are not limited to 1 ship per battle, you can bring 3 (then 4) differents ships in battle adding much more possibilities and gameplay than any other games.Star Conflict also have various gamemodes :_PvP : 6 differents gamemode (From Team Battle to Capture mode ectect) with 15 different maps (each map have its particularities and design)_PvE : Multiple scenarized missions in group for all levels granting you an easy way to get money and loots (1 garanted loot per day) _Raid : End Game content, there is only 1 available but fighting a big Alien have no price (I don't want to spoil :D)_Open Space (aslo called Invasion) : It's an open world mode where you can fly throught differents sectors, doing missions, collecting ressources, killing others players or NPC (Killing Players is better !) and Aliens ! (Aliens hurt hard)_Tournament : Every Sunday we have multiple tournament that you can join in group or as a Solo Players granting you free Gold Standard (a little amount but its always nice to have them ;) )_Dreadnought : Soon :DFor the Ships:It's extremly easy : Standard Ships or Premium, they all have the same power so there is no problem with them. Each Ship is unique with its own stats and bonuses, you will see each new ship like a new adventure.To detail a bit more, the Ships are divided in 5 Tiers, each tier have 3 Ranks. All ships in ONE tiers can beat each others.And each have its own gameplay, you just need to find the ships corresponding to you :)To answer to some complains about P2W :No, the game isn't P2W. Premium Ships will never garantee you victory, as well they will never grant you better stats.They are interesting if you don't have a lot of time to play to progress a bit faster or support the game. (Note there are tons of sold) Graphism : The Design and the Graphism are really good for a F2P game. It's fast and smooth and pretty cool :DThe game does not require a big computer to be played, it's an enourmous point, even small config can enjoy the game.In more general terms, the game is really well done and ""EXPLOOOOOOOOOOOSIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN"" !I'm really enjoying the game and it's evolution. The grind is proportionnal to the time you can invest in the game. The more you play, the faster you progress but I prefer to recommand to take your time will progressing. StarConflict is a complete game with a lot of mechanics that you will have to use/understand at a certains points and the community is always here to answer your questions (Chat or on the forums).There are too many things I like in this game and not enough time :D The last thing I can do is this : I can't give you  a better advice than ""Test the game by Yourself and make your own opinion, take your time to see everything"".It's a F2P game, it will cost you nothing !...Okay, if it's doing the same thing to you than what happened to me, your life and your soul will be captured by the game.

												Solid gameplay. The PvP matches in the early game are almost too short but they do get longer as the game introduces more complicated ships. The way the game is set up means that the playerbase is divided in several ways so queue times may vary depending on at which point in progression You\'re looking for a match. A matter of seconds or several minutes. WORD TO THE WISE: The game is smart enough to start flashing once a match has been found if minimized so feel free to multitask while waiting.			"

												I'm giving this game the thumbs up purely because I feel that the flight and combat style was the best i've played in quite some time. With the game seamingly more geared towards PvP (like most games nowadays) I felt like the PvE side lacked just a little. PvE had some great missions to play and with each new tier you jumped to in lvl's, you got new and harder missions. I would suggest going with a group of friends as per my experience, the random pugs sat and did nothing half the time just soaking up free XP.. unfortunate.. My biggest gripe with the game was how ""grindy"" it felt to get anywhere, even with the release of Free Roam (their open world concept) the missions for it felt very ""go here, fetch this, drop it here"".. Outside of PvE and to the PVP, I don't have any real words other then Carnage and Chaos. Pick something that moves and kill it, before it kills you.			"

												It is not eve online or star citizen, but it sure as hell comes damn well close.I heard it's from the same publishers as War Thunder and honestly I don't really care. This was a well made game through and through. Flight controls are slick and sharp. The extreme detail that goes into the modeling of the ships is astounding. And your guns even swivel when you move your cursor. They SWIVEL to aim where you are aiming at. Dat SWIVEL.And profesionalism aside, the grinding in this game is acceptable to say the least. Almost four hours into the game and I'm comfortable enough to handle a one on one dogfight with another player. Though I can see myself burning out after my fifth hour after i get the T5. Every ship that I unlock feels the same as the one before, only a tad bit stronger.I will still recommend the game though for people who wish for a free to play version of star citzens dogfight mode.

												Pure PVP spaceship dogfighting goodness.This is a game for the dedicated PVPer.Star Conflict almost directly takes the model of World of Tanks, with tiered ship progression and team deathmatch style gameplay and builds upon it magnificently. Unlike so many free-to-play games, Star Conflict bends over backwards to avoid pay-to-win issues. You can buy premium ships, but they simply fill slightly different battlefield roles or suit different builds. The meta is constantly evolving as pilots discover new builds and develop new tactics. Daily inter-corporation battles and weekly tournaments ensure that there is plenty of opportunity to sharpen your teeth.The learning curve is steep at times, but perseverance is rewarded!It takes real skill to excel in battle across 3 dimensions. It takes dedication to understand the finer points of equipment configuration. Oh, and it's visually beautiful. I haven't hopped in a tank since I installed Star Conflict.			"

												Lots of negative reviews from people , who dont understand core mechanics of the game or simply liked the previous versions of it (which were much less playable), for example a guy calls it unfair for lower tiers of gameplay , when people with unlocked implants (talents) from upper tiers come to lower tiers and ""ruin the fun for newbies"". The guy obviously doesn't know , that implants are also devided in to levels that corelate with ships' levels , and implants only work for similar and further (upper) levels of ships , but for example level 15 implant simply doesn't affect any ship , that is lower then level 15 => level 3 ship only gets the benefits of level 1 , 2 and 3 implants , etc.While there are a decent amount of perium ships , that are often really good at what they are built for the difference in player skill has MUCH more impact on your results in battle , then a premium\regular ship , which are mostly sidegrades that promote slight differences in playstyle.The game is very dynamic and is seriously based on players' skill at aiming , dodgin , understanding and tracking their surroundings in 3d space , etc , but for lots of players its much easier to blame other players for buying a premium ship , then to blame themselves for not being good enough with their aiming.There are also lots of people who say that the game is less fun after the changes it undergone lately.to make my story short - after trying the game for a few days slightly over a year before this review i didn't bother playing it any longer because of serious balance problems and low amount of content other then standart WoT-like short pvp battles. After trying the game after those recent changes have been made - i can't stop playing it every evening with my friends.Give this game a try!			"

If you like LAZORS, PEW PEW, ROCKETS, SPACE Combat/Sim AND being the captain of your own 3rd person combat ship, luk no further Download it and play for free. Tons of customization option and Pay2Fashion things. You have PvP and PvE game modes, so its ur choice. For me its ""OK"" coz im bored of Star Citizen not coming out yet, ELite Dangerous, War Thunder, World of PLanes, and other combat sims.			"

Posted: June 10, 2015
												This is a surprisingly fair F2P game.  I personally have a lot of fun with it (even when I get my teeth kicked in during a PvP Domination match).  I'll try to break it down, Pros and Cons.Cons:-Upgrades can be bought through GS (Galatic Standards, the in-game currency bought with actual money).-Some ships can only be bought with GS.-No safety net with items (currently).  If you accidentally sell something you didn't mean to, you're out of luck.-Matchmaking doesn't seem to have a balance to it (yet).-Open Space (the Eve/Star Trek: Online-style connected sectors map) is unforgiving.  When Cybers and Biomorphs start showing up, and if you're a new player, you're screwed.Pros:-Galactic Standards can be earned.  It's small, but you get 10 or so for every one or two victories in PvP.  That's a pretty fair shake, considering it's bought with real-world cash.-GS can only be used to upgrade ships by converting Synergy (experience) from an elite ship (max level) into Free Synergy, which is also earned during matches.-Dogfights are fun!  Seriously, there's nothing quite like circling one another in three dimensions, each trying to get behind the other while taking shots or firing missles.  It can be nerve-wracking if you're hull is damaged or your shields are out, and there's a certain thrill to pulling an enemy off one of your teammates mid-fight.  Or, you can sit back in a Harpy, or other long-ranged frigate and take pot shots with your Disintegrator.  Just watch those Command fighters, or Covert Ops.-No ship is the strongest.  Each ship has a role, each role has a purpose, every ship has its strength and weakness.  The combat is more based on skill with your ships than anything.  Upgrades help to increase hull strength and shield capacity, or cooldown time on modules and weapons damage, and later variants of ships in the same role will often have better stats, but no class is omnipotent and even lower-ranked ships can be threats with skill.-The grind for Credits (the techniqually buyable in-game currency, as GS can be exchanged for Credits with an admittedly good rate) is miniscule.  Just a few games and you're raking in hundreds of thousands of Credits for new ships, MK II weapon and module upgrades, and other things.-You don't have to sell ships.  In fact, you can eventually get every ship, all maxed in level with MK IV modules.  You start with three ship slots (these are the ships you can choose during matches or for Open space), and can unlock a fourth with either level or Galactic Standards.-The devs are very active.On a more personal note, the game seems best enjoyed with a friend.  You don't even have to be a super serious player.  It's easy to pick up and put down.  If you have an interest in space dogfights and don't mind luck-based grind for upgrade materials or MILD pay-advantage systems, I would definitely recommend you grab a friend (or a few) and try it out.Until next time, Mercenarcies.

												Looks great, runs great, has plenty of content to offer, but much of it (especially the open-world part) is locked behind a ridiculous grind/pay wall. After 250+ hours, I'm still very 50/50 about this game. The devs recently added a new ship class which basically makes the other 3 classes obsolete, and of course you need to grind a lot to even get your hands on any of these new ships. You can't simply buy them for cash, which is also a 50/50 thing. It's not P2W, but the grind is painful.It would be great if the developers focused on adding new content like maps and game modes, instead of new ships. But there's still plenty of PvP, PvE co-op and open-world fun to be had here.  "

												This game was fun, addictive, and... well... like almost every other game thats out there. This games, back when it was good, brought an old concept into new light. When people fought in teams, they fought together as a team. Everyone knew what to do and they would do it in the smartest and, mostly, risk free fashion. People would group together and use each other's abilities to overcome the other team. When someone was in danger of being overtaken 2v1, others would help that person out and push the other team back. Victory felt well desurved and defeat kept you pushing for more. I admit there were problems with the game before, but it was still fun despite. Teamwork was what made the game fun. The game has been change almost completely since then. ""change is good,"" some might say, but with change comes new problems. The game gives people too much power. Strategy isn't what it is anymore. People lack weakness and planning is almost out of the picture. For example: when there was a ""tank"" that was much more powerful than the rest, the smaller ships would either distract or damage ""the tank"" so the other ships could destroy ""the tank"" while its weak. That ""tank would deploy counter-measures or bring a few friends along with him to stop these attacks. Most matches now, people will go off on their own or in small squads, and ignore the rest of the team. Now, the problem everyone is talking about: real world cash for ingame money. This game was heading into this direction from the start, but its hit the point of utter annoyance. From over-powered moduals and weapons, to even just wanting to change you name. Sure, if you cram you can get anything without paying for it, but for somethings that would take years. This game was great before, but, like everything I've explained, this has changed. The developers have spent so much time trying to add to the game that they forgot to fix the problems. I wish I could say something good about the game, but with every groundbreaking improvement is an equaly annoying and ruinous problem.			"

You can unlock new ships, new battlefields, buy stuff with god knows how many different ingame currencies (""yellow money"", ""blue money"", ""red money"", XP).

												Welp this game looks, and plays AWESOME in the tutorial (the game moves a lil slower then I'd have liked, but I'm presuming the better ships later in the game go faster then the starter ones)... then you get to wait forever for it to never find a game opened to level 1 players... then you try to host a game suitable for level 1s, and it makes you wait forever+ a day because there HAS to be at least 3, or 4 players in your' custom game before it'll even LET you launch it...SO if you've got at least 3 friends online who'd like to play an awesome looking/running fully 3D space fighter game with LOTS of modes, maps, & MMO type leveling up etc. this might be something you all will like... loners may have luck finding games durring peak playtimes IDK, I'll check back on weekends.

												The Game is intense.The Game is free.Ever have like 15 minutes before you have to go somewhere and you really can't load anything up, well, in Star conflict you can play two matches in that time.You choose one of the three factions, who all have their own faction bonuses then you duke it out in a wide variety of gameplay modes. The customization is great- though you won't truly appreciate all the customization until you level up- as you unlock more modules and larger ships as you progress. (But its okay, because it only pits you against players you're same level, so you will never get owned by people who play this game all the time!!)			"

The Graffics for an online game are excellent, and the playability is awesome. I will reconmend this for anyone that loves space shooters.			"

 Average F2P-Space arcarde space shooter from Gajin.  Unfortunately, without any depth. The first hours you spend leveling your ships up are very easy and calm. After that, you get into bigger and more interesting fights with more players. Because of the F2P model and the pegi 12 rating this game also attracts lots of kids (The amount of autism in the chat is too damn high) and imbecils, players don't cap empty nodes (like flags in a CTF-game mode) because they don't even care about them or are busy doing whatever they are doing somewhere else which makes a dedicated player rage from time to time.Already mentioned, the game is missing depth. You can upgrade your ships weapons and systems and get new ships through grinding. That's it. There are not even more than 1 main-weapon systems (rockets/torpedos, railguns/lasers) per ship that you can use, at least not from the ships I tested. It contains a PVE mode through that you also can level and grind your ship up which I find very good. There are basically 3 different ship sizes. Big slow ones, medium ones and small agile ones.  My conclusion: Try it out, there's nothing world-changing in this game but it's not bad. I decided not to play it over long terms because I find the stuff the game has offer to me simply boring. The only difference in the higher tier ships and the lower tier ships is that the higher ones have more ""grinding levels"" (called synergy). They basically look all the same and are the same size while using the same weapons. Why should I bother reaching those ships then?			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game, and the only reason I'm giving it thumbs down is that it seriously lacks consistency.It has a lot of potential and I hope they'll introduce some interesting goals and more variety to it, becayse in current state it's simply too grindy and outright boring.After couple hours I feel burned out. All the ships seem like differently colored rehashes of same thing we flew before, just with boosted stats. At first, when you play tutorial and quite fun promissing PvE option, you get the general idea of how Star Conflict is supposed to look. Interceptors are fast and hard to hit, but fragile, gunships are your heavy punchers, and frigates are designed to bring some serious firepower to the frontline being able to withstand some punishment......but the moment we get into PvP this notion goes to absolute ruin. That is because higher ranked players overall have access to equipment with vastly superior stats, meaning you'll spend long minutes sitting on their tail scraping Hit Points with your puny gun, but it often takes three shots to turn your frigate into a flaming husk within a second or two.Unlike with War Thunder, where vehicle and equipment stats are just an cherry on a cake (of your presonal skill) here it's complete oposite. It's all about upgrades, more dps, more energy, more stats, stats, stats and unfortunately it feels more like two metal boxes exchanging stats between eachother.As I wrote there is plenty of ships, sadly most of them are slightly altered models (or not altered at all) of ships we've seen before already, thanks god they have different paintjobs! Upgrade costs are simply horrendous and tier progress it tiring, with a complete lack of interresting content. Game looks AMAZING, the graphic engine is top notch, ship design is perfect, they do look like warmachines and not flying dildoes, like in so many Space-Sims. I love the physics which deals with innertial and thus flight model doesnt feel like planes in Space, but actual spaceships.If only INTERFACE was up to par. The main problem is that in game, where you get into the thick of battle, when all the flashes, explosions, muzzleblasts, thrusters, laser-beams and shiny pulse projectile go across your screen you have NO WAY of telling where the heck is your crossair! It's a tiny cross, two bars, each about half a milimiter thick just vanish in the chaos before your eyes. You can't tell what you're shooting at...I love the immersion factor for what little we've seen so far. The factions are fun, ships have unique feel and style, spacestations are a neat idea, it's just... there's not enough 'fun' to keep me playing. PvE Co-Op was great Idea, doing missions with my friends, flying in organized wings and such, but the moment I went into PvP it sadly turned into a typical World of Stats(tanks)/(in SPACE), an extremely repetitive grindfest, where lower rank players are pretty much free frags, with little to do. And when you get to higher ranks you pretty much wipe everything on the map with little effort. What's then? Grind for a box with better stats? Till you can beat other boxes with higher stats? Grinding for sake of getting a better vehicle to do more grinding and yet better vehicle, and so on, and so on... We are given three factions to choose from, but what's their purpose other than different starting ships? You can fly any faction ship you want anyway, there is no real conflict between them and for most those factions are used to paint the galaxy map somehow in clan-wars, because no other idea seemed valid, I guess. We don't get to explore the factions, they are just there, a symbol that literary means nothing. It is a false pretense we deal with fleshed out setting, in fact factions are nothing more then another grind table masked as a reputation system to unlock 'bigger' stats technology.... You know, so we can get exactly same gun we used to shoot for last week, just with little more damage per second. It feels like in current state, this game is just a load of mechanics that seem interesting at first, but boil down to even more grind, and more, and more, and more grind.Don't get me wrong, this game has GREAT potential, it simply feels like it lacks direction and variety. At current shape and form it get's boring fast, extremely fast! It's hard find reason to support microtransaction system where there's little purpose to keep on playing. Thus, for now, it's Thumbs Down, but I do hope devs (who proved that are capable) can one day introduce new ideas and make the gameplay more interesting.			"

												I like the ship combat gameplay really. It has the potential to be decent without being expensive but the gameplay gets in the way of the fun. It becomes rapidly frustrating when dying, and you die incessently at low level apparently, you lose everything you've gained in that excursion. There doesn't appear to be many players on or nobody at the lower tiers so it took most of a day before I could even get in a PVP game and even then all but 4 players of the 16 were bots. Frankly the most damning thing I could say about this game is that it disrespects my time.			"

Stopped playing months ago but recently installed it again expecting improvement but it's the same♥♥♥♥♥♥it was months ago: unbalanced gameplay, tedious grinding, very bad matchmaking (there's always at least 2 bots on every damn game), biased towards premium members, pointless ranking system, etc.The game lacks a solid system, there's 10 tiers of ships, TEN!! So you get matched with players of your rank or a rank higher, thus unbalancing the game, basically the team with better ships pretty much always wins; but that's not the worst about it, the worst part is that this game follows a system of ship classes, and the outcome of a match highly depends on players choosing a proper class according to the rest of the team, but that NEVER HAPPENS because everyone is focused on leveling up their ships, ignoring any competitiveness the game might have.Conclusion: There's a great idea behind this game, but it has been awfully developed and it's not worth anyone's time.

												Ok, the game looks great and the tutorial was interesting to try out.But this game is a frustrating mess.I tried to play full-screen, but it seems that your mouse isn't recognized if you do.  Gotta play in windowed mode for that one (I wondered why they default you to window mode, now it's obvious that there's a bug).Got that fixed... now on to play.  Kinda...  As a new player it took me almost 4 minutes of starting at a timer countdown to get into a multiplayer match.  *yawn* *yawn* *yawn* ... ZZZZzzzZZZZzzzzThen when I finally did, whatever controls I had in the tutorial were not nearly as good as in game (latency perhaps?).Therefore, my ship was almost completely uncontrollable.There might be a good game here, but honestly, I'm not going to waste my time on a game if I can't even start it up and use a mouse, it takes 4-5 minutes just to connect to a match and then the controls are a$$.I've got better games to play.

												A couple of days ago I was told about StarConflict by my friend jonathanwasnthere, after I got used to the controls and gameplay, I really enjoyed the game. It seems like the main objective of the game is to get the next better ship you can get and by doing pvp and pve mission help you get closer to being able to do that. As a begginer, pvp isn't the best gamemode to go into when you just star because there are many other skilled players in better ships who will just blow you up multiple times. pve is alot better to do to get started because you work with others to get though a mission that doesn't involve fighting other people who are most likely more skilled than you, also pve mission normally give off better rewards than pvp.I would definitley recommend this game to other people, it is very good quality for a free game (though there are aspects of the game that you would need to pay for if you want it) and I thing anyone could play this game and enjoy it. The only weakness I have found in this game is pvp miss-matches.Rating: 8.5/10			"

												An arcade-esque take on the classic space dogfighting, with a mix of resource management and exploration mixed in. A full 3 axis movement schema allows for some very dynamic, close quarters fighting.  Personally I feel the game is highly undersold, and overshadowed by the breadwinner of the family (war thunder). It's a shame, because it really is an interesting dynamic...and let's face it, space >>>> WW2.* This is not a P2W game, dispite those who claim it is. If anything, it's a ""Pay 2 gind...less"". The progression in rank can be spead up by spending coin on it, but its not in any way required. In fact, accellerating yourself into a higher tier play may be more detramental than anything -- seat time >> ship type. * It's very casual. Jump in, blow some stuff up for a bit, and log out. No politics, no metagame to really worry about. "

												Well i've played Star Conflict  for a while and my verdict is... A GOOD game but want you to BLEED your money hard. I played for FIVE hours straight with prem (+50%) and barely made over 2 000 000 credits and only 15 000 faction rep. (you need 75 k for ONE upgrade of 15 little things you MUST use in battle on ONE of your FOUR ships, and it's only a 3-d lvl tech) You'll need to spend about  30-45 $ monthly to play comfortably or sell your soul to a clan for five hours daily online for a year. Otherwise only grinding for tech four will take more then a two years (If you're normal person who doesn't play more then a two hours and not DAILY). It's game that flyes on a noutbook with 512 mb card on ULTRA HIGH graphics with 30 FPS, because optimization of engine and server is THAT GOOD (Robocraft I look at you) while looking like a YOBA project, but for all nine hells it's want your money bad... I'll give it positive review neverless, because it's a good game, but BE PREPARED!			"

PvE means: #a collect stuff from others and get destroyed (cause you are too weak to destroy pve enemies 1 zone beyond base or #b enter a different zone and get destroyed after 2hits by the cpu enemy.

												Unfortunately I haven't got the chance to continue playing Star Conflict as I uninstalled this game. But this game lacks something. And because Star Conflict Team said on my previous review about World of Tanks clone that ""not very reasonable comparison"" then...Rewrite!Pros:I can't remember.Cons:- Interface is unclear. Instructions please!- Games are...mainly based on ""Kill more than enemy"" rather than strategy.- Some areas of game (mainly types and tiers) are ripoff of World of Tanks.- Some aspects of game are Mission Impossible. Some in terms of playability, some are so advanced I couldn't figure out how to do it, i.e. Faction control, Undock, etd.Conclusion is, no strategy games and interface/game aspects are for professionals only.

												After briefly playing this horrendous F2P game on Steam; I would easily call this a hot contender for the worse F2P game on Steam.While the graphics are the only thing going for this, everything else is shallow and without depth. The ships themselves are lifeless boring designs with no real impact to them other than mindless stats. There is no history to them. There is no feeling of fondness to any of them.You can't customise your ships without resorting to paying gold, the games in-game currency that can be aquired only via special events or buying using real cash. Unlike Warthunder, in which you can customise your ships to some degree without the need to resort to using real cash, in this there is no leeway. Shame because it seems nobody is bothering to customise their ships unless its a high level one and it indiciates a serious flaw with the mechanic.The ships themselves fly like tanks in space; slow and cumbersome. The flight system is nothing to be gawked at and the general feel about this game is that while its F2P, confusing mechanics and layout indicate they really want to pressure you into spending money.The xp system is rather confusing. A mechanic called Synergy that I had trouble understanding. Seems the devs wanted to go with something 'fancy' but ending up with a horrible useless system that makes no sense.While others are saying a recent patch broke this game, I can't see this game improving at all.

												Ignore the fact that I only have 0.8 hours of playtime.  My account has over 1000 PVP matches prior to the Steam launch.  I  stopped playing over a year ago due to the terrible queue times for matches especially when trying to play in North America (hi, I would like lower than 180-250ms latency in a twitch-based game where reaction time is a big deal).I installed the game again yesterday, tried to get a match on Friday night in USA with Tier 2 (of 5) PVP.  After 10 minutes of no match, I quit the game in disgust.  Tried the same thing today, on a Saturday, could not get a match in over 8 minutes of waiting.  Chat response?  Reset the queue every 2 minutes, repeat until the Gods favor you with a 1v1 match.I loved this game back in the day when I could play it.  Sadly, their terrible match-making system, lack of marketing, and prioritization compared to their other products (hi War Thunder) has crippled what could have been a terrific game.

												If you're wondering why the game's store page is rather empty on real information about the game, it's because the game is a pay-to-win grind. The ""season two"" is nothing but a marketing ploy with no new content from when I last played two years ago. A new map type has been added where you now do your brawling in the midst of two large npc ships which are mirror images of each other instead of the old asteroid field map(s?).This game has three classes of ships: paper, rock, and scissors. There are some instances where your class ship can beat its rival in 1v1 combat, but its either due to the loser being out-leveled, lagged, or a patch over-powered a skill/weapon and will be changed soon.Leveling up your ship until the next tier unlocks for you is a grind in which you will be hopelessly outclassed by people who are twinked and refuse to move on.

												I love this game so much. But it does have a down side. The grinding on this game is so bad, you have to work super hard to get the ships you want but the game does help oult like every 5 days you get a Premiom License for 24 hours which helps bring in cash, and the open world missions are fun too. If you really wanted to get any where in this game I would spend the money on a license. The game also is about teamwork. If you dont work together there is little chance that you can win a battle. But the game is very fun!			"

												Super fun game! I don't understand how it's an MMO though. All I do is get experience in one ship, level it up, upgrade to a new ship. You can level up certain aspects of your ship such as weapons or ""modules"". It is pretty easy to get the hang of. The matchmaking system is good too! Just hit launch wait about 60 seconds and BAM your in a game. SIDE NOTEAbout all this ""pay to win"" and ""pay to advance"" sillyness it isn't even noticable!

												Now, it's certainly no replacement for greats like FreeSpace 2, but as one of a rare genre, it's a very solid space shooter.Everything just feels good. Ships are different enough that it's fun to use different ones. Graphics are surprisingly good for a free game.There's really no feeling of needing to pay for anything. Paid items and ships let you replace some time spent earning credits, but they aren't necessary to win by any means. Most of the negative reviews say there's too much grinding... But what they call grinding = playing the game. That's it. It's not like you need to quickly ""finish grinding"" to get to something else. So far, I'm quite enjoying leveling up every different ship, seeing how they handle differently, rather than rushing to the highest rank right away.			"

												This game is free to play on Steam and it is really awesome to say the least. I've only been playing it for a short time but the game play screams polished and definitely worth downloading into your Steam library. The action is fast paced and there are a multitude of variables that are available for customization within the game such as customizing your ship and using special abilities during gameplay such as cloaking devices and stuff like that. I will be adding to this review more as a play the game more. But i'm pretty sure it will stay at a ten like Tribes Ascend because the game is free.			"

												Star Conflict. A game I noticed over one year ago because of the gameplay. While most games that let you fly let you know if you're upside down, Star Conflict uses the benefit of no gravity to remove these boundries. The missions are (usually) fast, there is not much chatting and there are no cinematic clips for each mission. While the game is simple to understand and to play, it still holds many challenges for advanced players. There are countless ships to choose from (if you have unlocked them) and there is at least one ship for every type of playstyle. Allthough repeating the same missions over and over to unlock new ships gets boring, you can always grab a friend and kick it up a notch. The fact that the game is free to play only enforces it's awesomeness. The game is at number three of my most played steam games with 66 hours at the moment (2. is GTA V with 230 hours and 1. is Skyrim with 315 hours) and I enjoyed every moment of it. The fact that there are in-game-purchases (aka DLC) is acceptable and you can really live without the purchases if you want to. So to conclude this review, Star Conflict is an awesome game which should not be underestimated. I definetly recommend the game and since it's free, you should really at least give it a try.			"

												This is basically a space shooter. They are trying to make it more of an mmo with open space and missions. There are 3 types of ships, with each type having 3 classes. I prefer to play matchmaking in pvp. The combat is very skill based. Sometimes you might get killed by someone with a higher tier ship, but its not that hard to unlock the next ship.

												Super fun game! I don't understand how it's an MMO though. All I do is get experience in one ship, level it up, upgrade to a new ship. You can level up certain aspects of your ship such as weapons or ""modules"". It is pretty easy to get the hang of. The matchmaking system is good too! Just hit launch wait about 60 seconds and BAM your in a game. SIDE NOTEAbout all this ""pay to win"" and ""pay to advance"" sillyness it isn't even noticable! GREAT GRAPHICSSMOOTH GAMEPLAYFUN WITH FRIENDS10/10 This is Red X standing by.			"

												A very fun, clean, well made, and execllent game. Star Conflict is a space shooter, filled with action packed games with simple yet challenging objectives. Star Conflict will alsways keep you entertained and engaged. Star Conflict offers different types of combat space ships, from Long Range Frigates to Recon Interceptors for the close up type. Tired of fighting players in PvP? Star  Conflict offers PvE, where a squad of 4 people are pitted against bots while they complete objectives.Smooth, clean, and engaging.Star Conflict has something for everyone to enjoy.			"

												Since getting this, i've been quite hooked on it. It's great fun to fly in space with different ""modules"" on your ships and the game modes are diverse enough to keep someone playing for a long while. I'm only second tier i think in terms of ship and the first tier is practiaclly the same game type played on about 2 or 3 maps it was so much fun and satisfying manuvring your ship and trying to outflank your enemy although not easy to do with lagg of my caliber.Even as just a beginner i would reccomend this game as it's great fun and quite satisfying if your looking for a ""freelander-esqu"" game in control with a variety of special modules and different weapon damages to give a good dynamic to the battlefield in which you fly.

												Star Conflict is great, but this is where you might question me. Tell me that I'am wrong. Partially, only a few hours ago of gameplay, I would have told you that this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game has a terribly slow and boring at the first hour or 2. Starting ships are dreadfully slow. Frigates are basically floating cans in space (Do they even have any thrusters on them?). Speed is a very important part of the game in terms of balancing the homing missle, which are far too effective early game. Basically. The first 2 hours or so of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Until you get to tier 4, you will have no fun, or somewhat sometimes glimpses of fun.After the 2 hours I have noticed the sudden boost of variaty of weapons (It seemed like from the usual 3, it boosted to 12 or so, don't take my word for it) The ships, especially the medium fighter ships started to get speed, actual mobility, strafing was alright. In fact, the speed of the tiny ships was crazy, which was lovely. Even earning money was not a grind anymore.Basically, the very start of the game is a slow grind. Get to tier 4 and WOO FUN TIMES. "

												Been playing Star Conflict for quite a long time.The basis of the game comes down to grinding. This game is not pay 2 win, but pay for shortcuts. Paid ships even are weaker than ships at the same level.Once you have gotten past the first hours of getting a decent arsenal of ships, the game becomes very fun- as each different class of ships has a flexible role.You want to play CoD and snipe?Sure- you can even use a guided missile if you suck at leading your shotsYou want to heal all 15 of your teammates while lasering your enemy to death?Sure- you even get little drones to heal even moreYou want to♥♥♥♥♥♥off snipers and melt them to nothing within 3 seconds?Sure- you also get to pick up kills if you want with a 10 second burn for those who chase you.You want to take the heat and hold up against 10 ships worth of artillery?Sure- you even get to zap anything within 3K meters range of you for those who get close.You want to zoom around the map and give away the positions of the enemy team?Sure- you could even steal that engi's shields to kill the tank while you're at it.With a huge variety of ships the game almost fills up the grindfest with content you can have fun with.To a lesser extent of what Dota2 and League have, you get matched with different people so no two matches will play out the same.With also the faction system, you can band together (once you get a high enough ranked ship) for more structured games.This game is also getting a lot of attention by the team, so expect frequent updates and fixes.

												If you ever heard of Freelancer, then this game is its spiritual successor. Spaceships, adrenalinic battles, dogfighting with bullets and plasma and explosions everywhere. It's fun, and actually free (played the first 150 hours without spending a dime and actually enjoying the game, never felt pressed to pay for something). Good balance in PvP, customization and -some rpg-like elements give a nice set of choices, which suits every playstyle in meaningful and different ways. You can play at your own pace, it's easy to learn, the community is friendly and willing to help new players to learn their basics.Sometimes it feels grindy, but shiny things will eventually come with just playing.Maybe it loses some of its scope when reaching endgame, which actually consists just in acquiring the best ships, but it's still a beta! I see new content periodically, not That Much often, but it comes out with a really good quality.This year was rich of surprises, most notably the addition of free sectors exploration (which has still a lot of potential to develop further) and enrichment of pve.

												After reading many negative post, i want to start with this:* i do not have any contact with the admins. Never seen one of them.I'm not a hardcore gamer with so much free time, so i just want to blow things up once a week... Because of that, i stayed in T2 (rank 5..7) ships. With ~35-45 hours of game, you can get 3 different, well equiped T2 ships. T2 ships are good enough for having fun.Why i gave positive for the game:+ looks awsome, and we got Linux port+ truly 3D flight mechanics. You can go up and down and roll and... So it's not restricted in movement at all. (not like STO)+ the ship classes are really different, with different play style requirement.+ ship equipment from weapons to utily systems are fully custsomizable+ needs some brain to know how to shoot dow different ships and how to stay alive+ also needs some brain to know how to use your ship+ easy to learn and get new things (at least in T1, T2). I had great fun with this game.Cons:-minimap are a bit useless, especialy in beacon hunt maps.-Linux port are still needs some performance tuning, but it's getting better than the initial release. A Radeon R7 260x was not enough to get smooth framerate at medium settings in 1920*1080 with latest Catalyst driver. (I know about issues with the old X11 drm, it can hit performance hard)			"

												I have played this game before on a different steam account. So, I decided to play it again. There are a few points I would like to address.1). If you played Warthunder and enjoyed it, and you also like Sci-Fi games, this is for you. It was made by the same developers that made Warthunder, World of Tanks etc.2). This game features, PvP, PvE and Free roaming in the galaxy. Now, I have not explored the galaxy, I just went around for like 5-10 minutes, so I cannot tell you how big it is or what exactly you can do in it. You will have to go explore it.3). PvP is like Warthunder, but with spaceships, PvE is a co-operative mission with 3 other pilots, it's like Warframe, but with spaceships.4). The graphics of this game are pretty good. I have my settings all on the highest possibly, with the highest AA, everything turned on, and I am getting a solid 60fps no matter what is going on. I am running a GTX 660 oc and an i7-3770. 5). The controls are hard to get used to, and because it is 0 gravity, the space ship will behave eratically if you do sudden movements and turn suddenly, it makes me dizzy sometimes. So if you are the one that gets sick easily, stay away.All in all, I would rate this game 8/10.			"

												Hey!I got to admit that this game is a lot of grind, some admins might be abusing, the game is full of idiots who don't know how to play, premium ships seem to be overpowered at first, ... (If you want a list of all the bad things about this game, look some ""not recommended""-rewievs)BUT:This game is so much fun to me! To be honest, sometimes all those bad players drive me crazy (especially in PvE) and premiumship users got me mad in PvP.But as soon as you find one of the bad players flying around with a Premium ship and you just own them like any other player, you realize that the premiumships are the same like ""normal"" ships (some stats are better, some are worse) and the only advantage you have is that the ship comes with maxed level.What makes sense, since you don't pay to get an overpowered ship (that would be boring for most people), but to just skip the grinding-process!So basicly it's not pay-to-win... it's more like pay-to-avoid-the-grind-but-actually-miss-a-lot-of-the-games-charm  (woaaah that escaleted quickly...)If you pay you just lose the feeling you really progressed, 'cause you just bought and not ""earned"" it :)About abusive Admins and foreign laguages in the english chat:Most of these admins kinda got kicked in their♥♥♥♥♥(I am not hearing much of abuse lately), and about 3 or 4 sentences in the englishchat in foreign language and you get muted, that's my experience so far.Oh not to forget the Noo... Noooot so skilled players ;Dyou have them in every game with a multiplayer that just randomly matches you with idio... , foo... , ... ... other players.Just shake it of and try to carry the game, due to the matchmaking there are as much <insert an nice word for noob here> on the other team, so it's basically fair.Like I said at the beginning, this game is pretty fun to me and i highly recommend that to anyone who's is interested in ""space-simulators"" (I don't know what to call it >.>)!Two more things i got to admit, that are ""bad"" in this game:Well the matchmaking is not ""bad"" it's just unoptimized... yeah unoptimized sounds good so far (you may experience long waiting times to find a game and the way the teams are balanced is kinda crap - look it up in the forum for more info)Second thing: You don't have ""realistic momentum"" in this game. To be honest, implementing that would be to challenging for most casual players. But I am kind of a freak when it comes to flying, so it's just my personal wish ^^.--------------------Well then thank you for reading and have a nice day! (/night for all the nightowls ;D )			"

												Star Conflict is a third-person space ship combat game with upgradeable ships and weapons. This game is quite the thrill ride, with its increadably smooth controls and fast-paced combat system. First, the ships. You can choose from three basic classes: Scout, Fighter, and I believe Freighter. I'm probably wrong on the third one, just know that they are massive ships. These classes are the usual fast but weak, medium sheilding and average, and slow as hell but tough as nails. They are mostly well ballanced. The weapons boil down to three different types of gun: plasma, laser, and regular. Again, probably wrong on the third one. They all handle differently, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Plasma is for removing sheilds, laser is direct damage, and regular is... I don't remember. Sorry. But this relatively simple system is perfect because it emphasizes the beauty of this game: the skill of the pilots. Dodging missiles and running down scouts is a feeling that I have never felt before in a game. It gives you an amazing feeling of success as you bob and weave through enemy lines with your fellow pilots, and when you pull off a maneuver, you feel like a badass. But the learning curve is certainly there, as most of your enjoyment will focus on how well you can pilot your craft. There are threemodes (that come to mind), the standard death match, team death match, and commander. Deathmatch, it's just your regular deathmatch, nothing special. Same for team, no real innovation (again, focus on combat) Commander is where the real fun begins. This mode is based on destroying the enemies commander while protecting yours, as when the commander is gone, you no longer can respawn. This creates some real tension as, even if your commander is gone, because of the enormous focus on combat, it is possible to turn the battle around. Overall, this is a very fun game with beautiful aesthetics and a solid combat system. And it's free, so, try it out when you have the time.			"

												Alright, where do I start with this game? Well I personally think its an awesome game and if your into those space battle type games then this is a game for you.PROS- The ship movement in this game is very nicely done and its easy to fly- The graphics are quite nice and it just feels like your in space :P- The combat is very nicely done. You use weapons like rockets and lasers, hahaCONS- Still cant figure out how to play with friends XD- The waiting time is a bit annoying but you get use to itThis game is one of my favourite games because it has alot of things I like in it like Space Ships, lasers, space, and ships :PIf your looking for a fun game to play thats a little different then this is the game for you! If you found this review useful then give it a thumbs up!			"

												Great game if you miss things like Freelancer, Darkstar One or the Space Combat in Star Wars Galaxies (So much Win!)I nice Free To Play with great graphics, solid sound and arcade-style Gameplay. Skirmishes give you a good 10 minute Dogfight or so to get some quick $$$ / Ship XP. Ship levelling allows you to progress into the ships / styles that you wish. Free days as a ""Premium"" member give you XP and Credit boosts and if you enjoy the game, $10 for a month worth of premium membership plus some leftovers to trick out your favorite ship are a small price to pay for a game that will give you a good Flight-Sim Style PVP fix that leaves you wanting more.Add on to this a PVE option to farm materials, credits and simply change up the pace and explore the ""World"" makes this a great little game for anyone who loves a good spaceflight sim.Give it a whirl!3354472FB65C99E6611FFFABC49649C1Here's my invite code. Come Fly a Few skirmishes. :)			"

												This game has a lot of potential.  The combat is incredibly fun and addictive, and the selection of ships makes team play a lot more fun.  This game has all the mechanics to be the best space combat game ever.My only complaints are the long wait times before getting into a PvP or PvE battle, and the utter lack of balance in the resulting PvP battles.  Kills are Pareto-distributed, indicating that the most utter n00b gets paired up against complete aces.  It might be more fun and interesting to balance the teams.Having a more concrete story/objective for single-player mode would also make the game more fun.  As it is, it's just scavenging.And for G*d's sake, fix the battle finder so I don't have to wait a whole freaking 2 minutes before I start a battle!			"

												Star Conflict is a great game for the players of the sci-fi genre such as I. It offers a beautiful third-person view of the one of many ships you could fly. The PVP and PVE system is great for gamers of the familiar instance. Overall I rate this game a 9/10 for great style, battle system, design and gameplay.			"

All in all, If you like games that make you work for enjoyment go ahead grab this game.

												This is basically a space shooter. They are trying to make it more of an mmo with open space and missions. There are 3 types of ships, with each type having 3 classes. I prefer to play matchmaking in pvp. The combat is very skill based. Sometimes you might get killed by someone with a higher tier ship, but its not that hard to unlock the next ship. Highly recommended. This game needs more players.			"

												Star Conflict. A game I noticed over one year ago because of the gameplay. While most games that let you fly let you know if you're upside down, Star Conflict uses the benefit of no gravity to remove these boundries. The missions are (usually) fast, there is not much chatting and there are no cinematic clips for each mission. While the game is simple to understand and to play, it still holds many challenges for advanced players. There are countless ships to choose from (if you have unlocked them) and there is at least one ship for every type of playstyle. Allthough repeating the same missions over and over to unlock new ships gets boring, you can always grab a friend and kick it up a notch. The fact that the game is free to play only enforces it's awesomeness. The game is at number three of my most played steam games with 66 hours at the moment (2. is GTA V with 230 hours and 1. is Skyrim with 315 hours) and I enjoyed every moment of it. The fact that there are in-game-purchases (aka DLC) is acceptable and you can really live without the purchases if you want to. So to conclude this review, Star Conflict is an awesome game which should not be underestimated. I definetly recommend the game and since it's free, you should really at least give it a try.			"

												Yeah ok. So I only have about 13 hours in this game at the time of this review. Either way, its enough to give me a relitive idea about this game.Pros:+ Relitivly easy to pick up if you have played war thunder+ Map design is top notch+ Some maps contain easter eggs (A few maps have souyze capsules floating around. Also a possible reference to gailin being a russian company)+ Combat is nicely paced, with a ship type for everyone+ Each faction feels sort of unique, especially in terms of ship design+ No ship feels pointless (So far for me)+ PVE integration is rather impressive+ Feels fun when in a balanced match+ Huge amount of content means that gameplay itself is rarelly ever boringCons:- Gameplay is tedious at times- The grind at times can be painfull, especially the synergy grind- Some weapons feel a little bit unbalanced, namely coil mortars- PVE tends to suffer from a serious lack of corrdinated teams, in the one game type that demands corrdination.- Match search times tend to be very slow.- Small team sizes plus team balance based on ship tier means that PVP can end up being rather unbalancedSummary: The second you get into a balanced match in game, there is no other game I would rather play. There is no such thing as an average match. There are only painful matches, and awsome matches. Unfortunatly, the second you get into a badly balanced match, all the fun seams to leave this game. Although there is this problem, open space is always open and suprisingly fun. The real danger to this game is the boredom of looking for matches. Still, the cross game bonus features do make it worth trying out to at least get something out of this game.8/10 Overall			"

												An extremely entertaining space fighting game. Work good under linux.The game is more pay to advance but also is a little pay to win because you can buy upgrade for weapons/module with premium money etc. But is most playable(with a fair chance to win a match and have fun) pay to win games i ever play for free players. And that is verry cool for a free to play game which must get some money from somewhere.Tips: Try to win at least 1 PvP and 1 PvE match per day.			"

												got this game played get invited to one of best corps (BORG) 10/10.now for the real reviewPros:the gameplay is great, there is a pretty big difference from classes and ship roles no one ship is flat out OP, they all have a weakness.the search times are fast. The PVE game mode is actually hard to do without teamwork and you can't really solo it so you have to communicate. PVP is fun and no one side has a advantage.Cons:the amount of US servers. for me this is a problem cause playing on Russia or EU servers with 400-500 ping sucks a lot. Devs please for the god add more USA servers.The events. now most events need you to have a certain  rank ship  that is maxed out please cahnge it to almost maxed out. and then getting ship parts it sucks, you have to grind like there's no tomorrow, but over time if you save them up your pretty good since there are a lot of ways to get ship parts			"

All in all, If you like games that make you work for enjoyment go ahead grab this game. But if you're more into the action packed massive free rome and wont settle for anything else, this may not be for you, if you like what you see howeveryou can take the risk.

												Fun space shooter game if you like a more arcade-ish experience.* It's not a space simulator akin to Elite: Dangerous.* It's not as big and complex as something like EVE.* It's more of a dog fighting game.Pros* Attractive.  Graphics are really nice, and it runs good on modest hardware.* Fun.  The game play is pretty fast paced and it can really be a hoot (most of the time).* Easy to play, difficult to master.  It's quick to get into a game and start playing.  There's a lot of depth in the ship bonuses and modules, so although it's simple to pick up and play, it would take quite some time, effort, and research to really raise the bar on your play through your ship configurations and item acquisitions.  This is a pro though, because skill and wisdom really does shine in this title.* Real time action.  A lot of MMO-type games use auto attack and auto-aiming abilities to overcome network delay (Star Trek Online, I'm looking at you), but this one requires you to actually be a good aim with a majority of the weapons -- they fire where you point, not what you are locked onto (missiles do auto target though). * High quality.  It doesn't feel cheap or play cheap.  The artwork and coding in this game is superior to many other F2P titles.  Though it's produced in Russia, which might be a warning flag to some, it's on par with AAA titles and is definitely legit.Cons* Lag.  I get a moderate amount of server lag in NA (rubber banding specifically; so packet loss and ping spikes).  I have insanely fast internet, and I ping major urban areas sub 30.  Granted it's very brief, but it happens fairly frequently.  Open space seems the worst for this.* Grindy.  Let me repeat.  GRINDY.  If you hate games that take a large investment of time, you probably won't care for trying to get to the higher tiers in this game; it grows exponentially harder than the lower tiers.  That said, there are often bonus weekends of +50% for everyone, and you can buy in-game subscriptions with GS (paid currency) that is strictly earned in game.  But it's not often nor easy (you gotta be an achievement hound and can really only swing the 3-day sub, so do it on the bonus weekends!).* Lower tiers need more content.  Literally, I played the same 3-4 maps for days until I ranked up to the next tier.  Bleh.  Why not scale all the maps and enemies to be based on team rank??  I couldn't do open space until rank 6 or so.  This could cause a new player to burn out very quickly.* Pay4Convenience, aka pay2getahead.  Let me be clear: it's not pay to win.  But since everything requires grinding (and quite a lot of it), you can bypass a majority of the grinding by simply opening the wallet.  The advantages of some of the paid ships are a little staggering in terms of the time it would take to do it in game, particularly for higher tier ships.  For low tier game play, it's really not bad at all.  That said, most things can be obtained in game if you are careful with currency and diligent in your efforts (read: not most people, since there's a lot of guesswork involved).  Some things are pay only (special ship skins, basically).* Item gap and/or Skill Curve.  Maybe it's people leveraging their paid currency and synergy bonuses, but the game seems to go from stupid easy to WTF hard.  By rank 3-4 you end up being one shotted by players in PvP and even a lot of ships in PvE.  So you'd do good to save up and focus on your modules and weapons, because the scaling is a little brutal when the training wheels come off.Overall, for the price (free!), it's good times.  It's worth an install and a try, you have nothing to lose afterall.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys space and sci-fi shooter games.  It plays a bit like FPS games as well because of the twitch game play style, so it should appeal to people of other genres as well.It's just a solid, well polished, shooting game.  If that appeals to you in any fashion, definitely give it a try.			"

												One major problem with this game is that it gets more frustrating as you(and by extention, your enemies too) unlock additional devices for your ship.As you and the enemy unlock new ways to overpower your enemy, outmanouvering them in a dogfight becomes increasingly less relevant, being replaced by a much less satisfying check of who had more/longer disables off cooldown and more teammates within effective range.

												Don't let the trailer fool you about exploration, there's only instanced pve missions and arena pvp. From what other players told me there's no actual exploration of any kind, so I guess you can say it's a soft lie from the development team. To me, Star Conflict is more akin to a watered down version of X-Wing vs TIE fighter with nice graphics and MMO-style ship abilities. I spent my teenage years playing Space Combat & Exploration games like Freelancer and X3TC so I'd rather play an older, more proven space combat-sim over this particular piece. I have played a ton of war thunder and a little bit of star conflict in the past. This game was fun for a few hours but quickly got old as I began to see many parallels between both games. Many players on the NA servers complain about not getting a voiced opinion about ways to fix or make the game better to the development team and there is a constant stigma about Gaijin not caring about their community at all. Furthermore, the grind from ship to new ship or weapons is pretty condemning as far as time consumption goes, and I can't speak on gameplay balance. As far as being free-to-play games go the monetization is about average: Stuff is cheap enough that people feel constant pressure or incentive to buy, and pricy enough that Gaijin sees lucrative profit for even the smallest purchases.All in all I will say this though: If you're looking for a game to tide you over until a new space-sim/etc. comes out, star conflict might be an okay choice, but I don't recommend it.

												If this game cost $20, $30, or even $40 I would likely buy it as the beginning tutorial shows some create promise as far as what to expect in an overall game play value. However.. this is a F2P type of game and in every essence this is what is currently the biggest downfall in the gaming community as you cannot progress in the game without spending way more than what a full feature game would cost you.  Stay away from this, stop spending money on F2P type games and maybe they will make this a full feature game that I would gladly pay a flat one time amount for.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, because I love space games. And when I saw the control scheme, I really found myself wanting to love it even more, because I was a Freelancer junkie for a long time. But sadly, it's just a grind designed to wring money out of your pockets. There's a long grind between the part where you start playing, and the part where you get access to the interesting parts of the game. If you don't want to do a LOT of PvP, then just get out the wallet.Single player tasks become available fairly shortly, but it will be a long time before they don't just grind you up.The game often tells you it will take you a maximum of four minutes to get into a multiplayer game with an average of one minute, but that is a lot of nonsense. A small percentage of a time, you will be matched into a game immediately. Most of the time it will take well over a minute, and sometimes it will take six, eight, or even give up and go play something else minutes.			"

												Player beware.  This is an online PvP based game with some PvE.  As all online games you have to deal with the constant cowardly acts of exploiters and hackers, and as usual the delusional developer.   The PvE mission are good, but repetitive.  The open world PvE is lacking a way to progress to next ship, no constant way to get synergy to lvl.   If you have no honor and use exploits/hacks this is right up your alley.  If you like space combat in PvE settings and can stand repeating missions to level and some open world gathering of mats for crafting.  Keep in mind if you die you lose those mats in your really small cargo hold,  fyi the aliens that invade 2 shot you.			"

												This game has run in the background without me wanting it to, and I've somehow logged 50 hours.  The main content seems to be space shoot-em-up stuff, with lousy controls and ridiculously short effective ranges on the weapons.  Like -- putting  any range limit on weapons in a space game is already absurd, but the weapons I started with have way shorter ranges than you even see in other space games.  The only good thing about this game is that it reminds me of Freelancer, which is good because it helps me realize there are better things to do than play this game.But seriously, what was the game doing after I closed it, for 48 of those 50 hours?  Pointlessly using up my system resources keeping the game assets up in case I want to play again?  Recording and sending my passwords to hackers in some foreign country?  Nothing, because it's a dumb glitch?  I  can't tell.			"

												This game could be fun. It was fun. But if you want to play as a healer, i can't recommend this game. I played this game over 500 hours (seperate installation from the homepage), spent some money on it and enjoyed it pretty much but the devs take out the fun of playing a healer. In a game where everyone plays alone and noone looks after his mates (unless you play in a premade team but then you also have to play against a premade team and that's not always fun), you're pretty dead as a healer because you're prime-target. And the devs have nothing better to do than nerfing the healer class/abilities since 2013.Other classes might still be fun, but if you, like me, prefer playing a healer in such games, you should look for another game.

												Fun space shooter game if you like a more arcade-ish experience.* It's not a space simulator akin to Elite: Dangerous.* It's not as big and complex as something like EVE.* It's more of a dog fighting game.Pros* Attractive.  Graphics are really nice, and it runs good on modest hardware.* Fun.  The game play is pretty fast paced and it can really be a hoot (most of the time).* Easy to play, difficult to master.  It's quick to get into a game and start playing.  There's a lot of depth in the ship bonuses and modules, so although it's simple to pick up and play, it would take quite some time, effort, and research to really raise the bar on your play through your ship configurations and item acquisitions.  This is a pro though, because skill and wisdom really does shine in this title.* Real time action.  A lot of MMO-type games use auto attack and auto-aiming abilities to overcome network delay (Star Trek Online, I'm looking at you), but this one requires you to actually be a good aim with a majority of the weapons -- they fire where you point, not what you are locked onto (missiles do auto target though). * High quality.  It doesn't feel cheap or play cheap.  The artwork and coding in this game is superior to many other F2P titles.  Though it's produced in Russia, which might be a warning flag to some, it's on par with AAA titles and is definitely legit.Cons* Lag.  I get a moderate amount of server lag in NA (rubber banding specifically; so packet loss and ping spikes).  I have insanely fast internet, and I ping major urban areas sub 30.  Granted it's very brief, but it happens fairly frequently.  Open space seems the worst for this.* Grindy.  Let me repeat.  GRINDY.  If you hate games that take a large investment of time, you probably won't care for trying to get to the higher tiers in this game; it grows exponentially harder than the lower tiers.  That said, there are often bonus weekends of +50% for everyone, and you can buy in-game subscriptions with GS (paid currency) that is strictly earned in game.  But it's not often nor easy (you gotta be an achievement hound and can really only swing the 3-day sub, so do it on the bonus weekends!).* Lower tiers need more content.  Literally, I played the same 3-4 maps for days until I ranked up to the next tier.  Bleh.  Why not scale all the maps and enemies to be based on team rank??  I couldn't do open space until rank 6 or so.  This could cause a new player to burn out very quickly.* Pay4Convenience, aka pay2getahead.  Let me be clear: it's not pay to win.  But since everything requires grinding (and quite a lot of it), you can bypass a majority of the grinding by simply opening the wallet.  The advantages of some of the paid ships are a little staggering in terms of the time it would take to do it in game, particularly for higher tier ships.  For low tier game play, it's really not bad at all.  That said, most things can be obtained in game if you are careful with currency and diligent in your efforts (read: not most people, since there's a lot of guesswork involved).  Some things are pay only (special ship skins, basically).* Item gap and/or Skill Curve.  Maybe it's people leveraging their paid currency and synergy bonuses, but the game seems to go from stupid easy to WTF hard.  By rank 3-4 you end up being one shotted by players in PvP and even a lot of ships in PvE.  So you'd do good to save up and focus on your modules and weapons, because the scaling is a little brutal when the training wheels come off.Overall, for the price (free!), it's good times.  It's worth an install and a try, you have nothing to lose afterall.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys space and sci-fi shooter games.  It plays a bit like FPS games as well because of the twitch game play style, so it should appeal to people of other genres as well.It's just a solid, well polished, shooting game.  If that appeals to you in any fashion, definitely give it a try.			"

												An absolute must for Space Sim enthusiasts who also enjoys competitive multiplayer. The game isn't an MMO in the traditional sense but a matchmaking engine for up to 10 on 10 team based multiplayer action. There is also a PVE portion which is also multiplayer based. The game is gorgeous and has surprising deep gameplay as combat gets increasingly complex as you go up the ranks. The game is very well balanced with different ships providing different combat roles and nothing feels overpowered. Ship customization options are diverse and enjoyable. I've been playing for almost 100 hours and still find myself drawn to the awesome gameplay and graphics. An incredible value for the Free price tag. Just Wow!			"

												Star conflict is a MMO, action and is also a free to play, which is always a good thing. The game is base in the near future, in which there are three factions; Empire, Federation and Jericho, which all have Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate classed ships.The game is fun, but for those seeking a realist space simulator, don't bother with this game. It isn't anything close to simulator. But for those looking for a game, which is fun and easy to play, then look no further.Since the game is Free to Play, it is to be expected that this game would have mini-transactions and DLC, which in this case, it does. The DLC ships and the in-game ""licences"" doesn't make much a difference, but I just helps you get more in-game-credits. Also, the Dev's inplemented a Achievement-ish bonuses which allow you to get the premium credits, but it is rare.In conclusion, I find this game highly enteraining and easy to play. Also, the game isn't strictly a ""Pay-to-Win"" which is always good, in which the game gives you, occasionally, premium credits. I would highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a simple, easy, fun and free game to waste your time in.			"

												Excellent game for being free-to-play. Difficult to learn, fun to master.I know one of the complaints is that this game has long load times, indeed this does occur half of the time, no more than Call of Duty and besides... being that it is a free-to-play game, don't complain about that! The development team keeps up with this game quite a bit, they release new updates and address bug/issues on a regular basis and they constanly are improving the game, with new features and options (this week alone they came out with a new money gain system and a VOIP feature).Overall, great and addictive.

Sure there's still the whole thing where you need to spend money to succeed but i certainly could care less with this open world stuff! i totally reccomend this game, you won't regret it!			"

												This game will hook you and bring you in with the very balanced starter tiers but as the game progresses more it becomes a huge grind fest as most gajiin games do. And the internet connection makes the game that much more un-playable. if you have an internet connection less than around 30 ping you should just uninstall because its not worth stressing yourself over. the 1 time a year the game does have a decent internet connection its pretty awesome though. 3/9 internets.

												Unfortunately, being a new player, I can't say much about progression, (I have about 4 hours on record) but as far as the early stages of the game go, it looks very good, especially for a space dogfighting sim. Wait times can be long, granted, but the wait is worth it. With great graphics, a good fighting engine and (in the early stages at least) reasonable progression, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good taste of ship to ship dogfighting action!8.5/10			"

												first off i would like to point out that the game isnt MMO it is lobby based and the game was made by the same people who made War Thunder but dont give your hopes up. If you were expecting some MMO action you have to ""earn"" it through rank progression. once you reach rank 6 you unlock the tab ""undock"" wich allows you to roam freely into open space. i would deffinately recommend having equally strong firepower and a buff shield that way you can stand a chance against space pirates, cybers, and marauders. aliens on the other hand are going to overpower you big time.Now when i mentioned MMO it isnt entirely mmo. In my experience with open space i hardly came across other players. ive yet to join a corporation (clan) so i havnt quite got the feel of all the action yet.Now before you get to undock you have to progress through the different tiers of ships. you have Frigates, Interceptors, Tacklers, and commanders. some of those ships will share some abailities with each of them, but not all. when you first start off playing in tier 1 it will be relatively easy. once you reach the next tier things will toughen up a bit. modules, better upgrades, and buffs show up into play. alongside that not many main weapon choices are available until rank 3 or 4. making tier 2(+) allot harder until you make some fine adjusments to your starships. This can be a realy fun game or one of the worst games you ever played. just dont go in expecting much, dont pay for things given the fact that it is free to play, and have a good attitude overall. allot of things have changed since the launch of star conflict. im pretty darn proud to have this game in my library.

												Considering the fact that this game is free, I am absolutey blown away by how amazing it is! It is very easy to customize controls, allows FULL controller support (so far I have been able to do 99.99% of things using an XB1 controller), as well as Oculus support and pretty smooth gameplay. Although initially learning about all the details (kinetic energy, synergy) was pretty confusing, it all starts to make sense after awhile. I still have quite a bit to learn in order to conquer the game. I play on an HP Beats Edition laptop, and I maintain usually 45 fps in game.One of the only cons I can think of is that the tutorial does not show you how to play with the controller, BUT, it is pretty easy to guess AND you can look at your key bind options in the main menu and customize them the way you want (the only controller key I had to set that it needed was lock-on, which I set to left D-pad).Overall, this is an amazing game that feels easy to get in to, but hard to master. I would definitely suggest this game to everyone, especially those looking for games like Star Citizen.			"

												Star conflict is a MMO, action and is also a free to play, which is always a good thing. The game is base in the near future, in which there are three factions; Empire, Federation and Jericho, which all have Interceptor, Fighter and Frigate classed ships.The game is fun, but for those seeking a realist space simulator, don't bother with this game. It isn't anything close to simulator. But for those looking for a game, which is fun and easy to play, then look no further.Since the game is Free to Play, it is to be expected that this game would have mini-transactions and DLC, which in this case, it does. The DLC ships and the in-game ""licences"" doesn't make much a difference, but I just helps you get more in-game-credits. Also, the Dev's inplemented a Achievement-ish bonuses which allow you to get the premium credits, but it is rare.In conclusion, I find this game highly enteraining and easy to play. Also, the game isn't strictly a ""Pay-to-Win"" which is always good, in which the game gives you, occasionally, premium credits. I would highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a simple, easy, fun and free game to waste your time in.			"

												Very suprised with how well this game turned out, did not expect to like it as much as I do. If you are a fan of world of tanks, but like the sci-fi, space worlds this may be a game for you. PvE, is a good aspect, open world is, well there, but thats about it, but the PvP is where this game shines for me. The battles can be pretty spectacular, and can get you on the edge of your seat.PvE, is pretty good, and can be very fun, but if your expecting a solo experience, its not in this game. Everything you do is party based, even the open world flying. In that I mean the npc's you face in open world are very OP, if you are not in a rank 6 ship at the very least you will not survive an incounter with multiple npc's.Open world flight pretty much is there just for the purpose of having some daily missions for people to do. Its all pretty much fly here, get this thing, or kill that person, type thing. So its there, but not something this game is for. This game is in its core meant for the pvp, in my opinion.			"

												This game will hook you and bring you in with the very balanced starter tiers but as the game progresses more it becomes a huge grind fest as most gajiin games do. And the internet connection makes the game that much more un-playable. if you have an internet connection less than around 30 ping you should just uninstall because its not worth stressing yourself over. the 1 time a year the game does have a decent internet connection its pretty awesome though. 3/9 internets.

												I feel as if I've played this game enough to finally write a review. I downloaded this game back in it's beta, and I was really impressed by it. Not only was the game fun, but the aspects of the game as a whole were a new thing entirely. This was the first game in which I've experience true 3-D. What I mean by this is that there is no up and down on the map. Sure you may start faceing a certain way, but unlike games such as Battlefront 2 (first space battle game that I thought of), you can face your ship any which way. The controls are easy to use and understand. The maps big, detailed, and contain various interesting environments. Their a plenty of ships to chose from from three different factions. Different classes of ships have different special abilities. And you can customize your ship's loadout, getting more options as the game progresses. A couple of negatives to the game follow:In the free roam aspect, the goals and objectives are sometimes unclear as to where to go and the map is very big and easy to get lost in.The customization of your ship is limited to it's modules and weapons, with the option to use ""standards"" for paint schemes and emblems.It seems to me that despite your amount of kills, deaths, captures, whatever, the game will give you more xp if you are on the winning team.Sometimes the matchmaking will put you into games in which the other team has  better ships by a few ranks, this is because the tiers for matchmaking contain multiple levels of ships. For instance, tier two contains ranks 4-9. Despite all of this, the game is very fun and addicting. At one point I had stopped playing back in the beta, but I got back into it due to the enjoyment of grinding even if only for that one double xp game per day. This game has a similar appeal as War Thunder which is made by the same company who made this game. The game is overall very fun and has the grind appeal as well as the enjoyment I find in every game, even if we lose. I definately recommend this game. I can't wait to see what more will be added. Oh, and did I mention it's free to play! Don't worry, paying doesn't seem to help players too much, except for the increased xp gain. 8.75/10			"

												TLDR: I recommend this one as a short term title. Install it and play if for a week or two when everything else you've got feels like the same 'ole. Great fun. But don't plan to stay for the long run unless you're into grinding or willing to cough up some real life cash.First of all, this is not a Space Sim as the description says. It's a session based action shooter, in line with World of Tanks or War Thunder with a control scheme from Freelancer. It also features cooperative scenarios and a open world sandbox mode.It's initially a fun and great looking game. It feels polished and bug free which is great. But the fun will not last.The game has you flying many ships in tiers of level 1-15, and level 1-3 is awesome. You'll get plenty of rewards, can easliy upgrade and can find fun matches both in PvP and PvE scenarios. But as soon as you equip a level 4+ ship it's like hitting a wall.You see, the scenarios are hosted in different difficulties as lvl 1-3, or 4-9 and later on 10-15. That means that if you equip a lv 4 ship you'll enter everything in the 2nd difficulty bracket. Unforutnally, that bracket seem balanced for lvl 9 ships. You will get your behind handed to you, over and over again, unless you're joined by some lvl 9 veterans to help you out. This is also an issue in PvP becaue of the major difference in ships between level 4 to 9, while there was very little between 1-3.Open world opens up at lvl 6 and it took me 5 days of playing to get there, This something that should be mentioned on the store page, that you have to unlock the sandbox mode. This was the gamemode I was mostly looking for.After the initial tutorial missions (which may send you into a open PvP zone where high end players may wait for new noob pray) the difficuly ramps up fast here too. In my lvl 6 I'm just a tad stronger than the avarage NPC's. The problem is that they roam in packs of 3-5. You can kill one, but that's when you have to break off (which only a few ships can with their abilities) or you're toast. I had big hopes for this mode, but sadly it's dull and boring.So the only thing to do is grind ... grind money to buy new ships, grind xp (synergy as they call it) to unlock new ships, grind vouchers (other types of currencies to upgrade weapons and modules), and the grind is a tedious one. The scenarios and maps are few both in PvE and PvP adding futher to the chore. Vouchers are the worst. You can of course get all of these things in a jiffy, as long as you're willing to open your wallet. So what about just staying in lvl 1-3? The fun part? Well, you're kicked out of the kindergarden after 150 matches and forced inte 4+ world. If you're still stuck with 1-3 ships by then, well, you're not going to have fun.As of this moment the game is a great title for a week or so, but expect it to become repetative and grindy real soon. I'll still recommend it since it's free after all , and because I had a blast the first days of playing. Enjoy it untill you reach the difficulty/grind/paywall.			"

												   Overall, I find Star Conflict a very enjoyable game. The ability to fly through the stars killing things and making money is something I really like. However, the matchmaker has been very slow recently. I'm not sure if it's due to maintenance, an error, or something else, but it's been slow. On PvP mode I can't even get into a match, but strangely I can get into PvE matches, albeit slowly.    In summary, Star Conflict is a fun game, but the fact that the matchmaker has been incredibly slow for me and the fact that I can't play PvP currently certainly sours my experience, so it definitely needs to be fixed.  I do recommend the game though because it is quite fun, but remember that the matchmaker is kind of a crap-shoot currently, so you may want to look elsewhere for the time being.			"

Beleive it or not, this game is still on beta, as well. To the creators of the game: The only problems are that it could have a Campaign and could have more gamemodes (a good gamemode could be not a destroying, or conquering, but racing, if you think it's a good idea). Another idea is that there could be some kind of ""Offline Mode"", where you could play normal game modes but with bot players, and also you could select there difficulty, ship rank, and more, if you like.And for the players: If you are thinking about getting the game, go ahead. You have my blessing.			"

												If you have played mech warrior online and want the same level of realism in this type of format then you will almost definitely enjoy the game. The physics seem solid, the gameplay is great, and customization is phenominal.			"

												I feel as if I've played this game enough to finally write a review. I downloaded this game back in it's beta, and I was really impressed by it. Not only was the game fun, but the aspects of the game as a whole were a new thing entirely. This was the first game in which I've experience true 3-D. What I mean by this is that there is no up and down on the map. Sure you may start faceing a certain way, but unlike games such as Battlefront 2 (first space battle game that I thought of), you can face your ship any which way. The controls are easy to use and understand. The maps big, detailed, and contain various interesting environments. Their a plenty of ships to chose from from three different factions. Different classes of ships have different special abilities. And you can customize your ship's loadout, getting more options as the game progresses. A couple of negatives to the game follow:In the free roam aspect, the goals and objectives are sometimes unclear as to where to go and the map is very big and easy to get lost in.The customization of your ship is limited to it's modules and weapons, with the option to use ""standards"" for paint schemes and emblems.It seems to me that despite your amount of kills, deaths, captures, whatever, the game will give you more xp if you are on the winning team.Sometimes the matchmaking will put you into games in which the other team has  better ships by a few ranks, this is because the tiers for matchmaking contain multiple levels of ships. For instance, tier two contains ranks 4-9. Despite all of this, the game is very fun and addicting. At one point I had stopped playing back in the beta, but I got back into it due to the enjoyment of grinding even if only for that one double xp game per day. This game has a similar appeal as War Thunder which is made by the same company who made this game. The game is overall very fun and has the grind appeal as well as the enjoyment I find in every game, even if we lose. I definately recommend this game. I can't wait to see what more will be added. Oh, and did I mention it's free to play! Don't worry, paying doesn't seem to help players too much, except for the increased xp gain. 8.75/10			"

												   Overall, I find Star Conflict a very enjoyable game. The ability to fly through the stars killing things and making money is something I really like. However, the matchmaker has been very slow recently. I'm not sure if it's due to maintenance, an error, or something else, but it's been slow. On PvP mode I can't even get into a match, but strangely I can get into PvE matches, albeit slowly.    In summary, Star Conflict is a fun game, but the fact that the matchmaker has been incredibly slow for me and the fact that I can't play PvP currently certainly sours my experience, so it definitely needs to be fixed.  I do recommend the game though because it is quite fun, but remember that the matchmaker is kind of a crap-shoot currently, so you may want to look elsewhere for the time being.			"

												Exciting and fast-paced space game. I've just got to tier 3 without paying a penny - don't see what everybody is complaining about. Weapon balancing has been much better recently - I left for a while because I was getting destroyed by disintegrators and coil mortars all the time, but lots of balancing happened, and it has worked out well.The graphics are excellent, but on very low settings, it can look bad, as you would expect. Most gamers out there won't have any trouble being able to run this game.Never noticed the voiceovers being bad or anything. Come to think about it, they do sound a little lifeless - I thought it was for effect.Loving the corporation and faction system, but I'm a little confused when enemies from a previous match are now on my team. I don't know why that happens, but it doesn't matter much.This game is about playing a role in the team. The points and synergy system are about how effective you are in the team. As a frigate, you can get more points by not firing a single shot than by killing everything in sight.Generally, a pretty good game.			"

												TLDR: I recommend this one as a short term title. Install it and play if for a week or two when everything else you've got feels like the same 'ole. Great fun. But don't plan to stay for the long run unless you're into grinding or willing to cough up some real life cash.First of all, this is not a Space Sim as the description says. It's a session based action shooter, in line with World of Tanks or War Thunder with a control scheme from Freelancer. It also features cooperative scenarios and a open world sandbox mode.It's initially a fun and great looking game. It feels polished and bug free which is great. But the fun will not last.The game has you flying many ships in tiers of level 1-15, and level 1-3 is awesome. You'll get plenty of rewards, can easliy upgrade and can find fun matches both in PvP and PvE scenarios. But as soon as you equip a level 4+ ship it's like hitting a wall.You see, the scenarios are hosted in different difficulties as lvl 1-3, or 4-9 and later on 10-15. That means that if you equip a lv 4 ship you'll enter everything in the 2nd difficulty bracket. Unforutnally, that bracket seem balanced for lvl 9 ships. You will get your behind handed to you, over and over again, unless you're joined by some lvl 9 veterans to help you out. This is also an issue in PvP becaue of the major difference in ships between level 4 to 9, while there was very little between 1-3.Open world opens up at lvl 6 and it took me 5 days of playing to get there, This something that should be mentioned on the store page, that you have to unlock the sandbox mode. This was the gamemode I was mostly looking for.After the initial tutorial missions (which may send you into a open PvP zone where high end players may wait for new noob pray) the difficuly ramps up fast here too. In my lvl 6 I'm just a tad stronger than the avarage NPC's. The problem is that they roam in packs of 3-5. You can kill one, but that's when you have to break off (which only a few ships can with their abilities) or you're toast. I had big hopes for this mode, but sadly it's dull and boring.So the only thing to do is grind ... grind money to buy new ships, grind xp (synergy as they call it) to unlock new ships, grind vouchers (other types of currencies to upgrade weapons and modules), and the grind is a tedious one. The scenarios and maps are few both in PvE and PvP adding futher to the chore. Vouchers are the worst. You can of course get all of these things in a jiffy, as long as you're willing to open your wallet. So what about just staying in lvl 1-3? The fun part? Well, you're kicked out of the kindergarden after 150 matches and forced inte 4+ world. If you're still stuck with 1-3 ships by then, well, you're not going to have fun.As of this moment the game is a great title for a week or so, but expect it to become repetative and grindy real soon. I'll still recommend it since it's free after all , and because I had a blast the first days of playing. Enjoy it untill you reach the difficulty/grind/paywall.			"

												What makes this game unique also makes it hard to master, the game is free 2 play, but as with most games, if you like it and find it fun, you can enhance the amount of xp and credits earned by paying for a monthly license. The game has several playstyles where if you want fastphased combat, an interceptor provides that, a frigate is slow but can take a beating, or lightly armored but does a lot of damage. You also have fighters that are a mix of both.You get to explore the open world in a freelancer-like fasion, where you can run into pirates or aliens.The game is fun, however the first few rounds in pvp where you have to learn the game can be a challange.If you join and want to play with others hit me up at ingame name: storwin			"

												I have to say, this is one of the best fast pased ship combat simulator next to freelancer.  The only problems I see are when you alt tab, you can't chat, if you try you seem to have a interface glitch, and the monotization scheme is a bit annoying. You shouldn't have to replenish ammo using Real Life Money. Out side of those major glitches there is one more that plagues this game, its that it crashes on windows when you alt tab after each battle. It seems to freeze the script when you do that and breaks some sort of loop or something and then skips over certian blocks of code that is necessary to run the controlls. It runs great on linux though, no interface glitches or anything. It must have been made for that platform and ported over to windows. Glitches aside, it does have territory controll that you can join corperations to take over places on a large map, but the bad thing is that you have to grind levels to get too it. Its a good way to controll trolls to a point. I'm just glad its not a time grind game like some other game that I won't mention due to respect of this one, Aside from all those problems, the price tag of the game which is free is seriously something to consider if you need a break from your regular point A to point B shoot and kill kind of thing. Out side of that I would give this game a 7.0 out of 10.			"

												Almost everything can be buffed up with money. but you dont have to use money i guess you could play it totally free. i feel its a tad expensive. when you are even paying for paint jobs. and say you buy a flag. you dont get to take that flag with you to the next ship. you have to buy again for each ship. if you want a profile picture you have to spend money to get gold to get a profile pic. i really hate stuff like this. you really need a package to begin star conflict. and i got the mercenary pack. which in a way is like your buying the game. the game is going to be very dull if you never buy anything and its a slow process to build up your ship[s weapons systems etc. but spending cash gives you instant access to alot of stuff. its truly a great game its really well made. but also. so is the pay system to get stuff  they rreally thought about how to implement this payment system to maximize profits. every ship every paint job. and guns and so many things. i love the game but i hate the pay system in any games. i wish you got more for your money when you spend real cash on gold but to be honest you dont get enough for your money. and they must be making alot. its a shame the system is in there becasue it would be an amazing game if the pay for items and better guns system wasnt in there i expect it would be extreamly popular. i think thats what kills it stops it being too popular. i wish they would set a price. or charge each month like eve. i hate the pay system in this game. it entices you to spend lots of money.

												Good if you like War Thunder and Space games, as it has the plane aspect of War Thunder with the flying around and shooting and the Space aspect as it is set in space. The things that make Star Conflict different from War Thunder is the different classes and abilities and factions. I will give a brief run down on the classes and factions. The classes fall into 3 major catagories and alot of sub-classes. The 3 main classes that you will encounter is the Interceptor class; which is designed for speed and maneuvelbility, the Fighter class; which is a class that is a good alrounder, and the Frigates; which is designed for Powerful cannons and strong armour. There are also 3 factions that holds all 3 main classes of ships. The 3 factions are: Empire, Federation and Jericho and if you want to go to the back stories, follow this link --> https://star-conflict.com/en/game/storyline <--. There are 15 ranks not including ships that need to be Manufactured. Each rank has differnet ships per rank and the Crew and Workshop options only occur for when you get a rank 4 and rank 6 ship for any factions. There are 2 gamemodes in Star Conflict that are PvP and PvE. PvP is a head to head combat style gamemode for where the pplayer will be given certain tasks, depending on the mission, to either capture beacons, kill the enemy etc. Then there is PvE, which is where the player fights bots throughout missions to receive points. Then there is Syntax Points wihch is what the player needs to upgrade their ships to go to the next rank. And that is a brief run-down on Star Conflict			"

												A lot of PvP and the PvE is not solo. You have to team up in order to complete the PvE missions. I have nothing against teaming and though yes, you can just undock and leave the station its a bit pointless. I like solo to actualy be worthwhile.That said the game itself is very good, great graphics, plays well and the 'grind' doesn't seem to bad.			"

												The game is fun however all you can do really is PVP/PVE which isnt really fun... If this game was combined with something like, Eve online then, Great combat + open world = Awesome, Also maybe instead of search for a battle you could maybe have players spread through the factions and have wars when they try and expand their border, Just a suggestion tho, 10/10 would write review again			"

												I have to say, this is one of the best fast pased ship combat simulator next to freelancer.  The only problems I see are when you alt tab, you can't chat, if you try you seem to have a interface glitch, and the monotization scheme is a bit annoying. You shouldn't have to replenish ammo using Real Life Money. Out side of those major glitches there is one more that plagues this game, its that it crashes on windows when you alt tab after each battle. It seems to freeze the script when you do that and breaks some sort of loop or something and then skips over certian blocks of code that is necessary to run the controlls. It runs great on linux though, no interface glitches or anything. It must have been made for that platform and ported over to windows. Glitches aside, it does have territory controll that you can join corperations to take over places on a large map, but the bad thing is that you have to grind levels to get too it. Its a good way to controll trolls to a point. I'm just glad its not a time grind game like some other game that I won't mention due to respect of this one, Aside from all those problems, the price tag of the game which is free is seriously something to consider if you need a break from your regular point A to point B shoot and kill kind of thing.

												Looking for naval space combat? This is the game for you!.Star conflict is about ships, upgrades, gathering resources, crafting (On later levels), missions, PvE and PvP and a kind of hybrid version of both of those depending on the matchmaking system.If you are looking for lore, there is virtually none in this game. Battle in space and make your own adventure.The controls are intuitive. There are 3 factions with their own ships; from a sniper to medic, ships that give various buffs, or the tank, the fast and agile ones, there is a ship for every playstyle with their pro and cons.This game is free to play, as long as you are willing to grind, and with some luck you will be able to get virtually everything. Stuff for real money does not give a player any advantage on other players but it helps speeding things up and it supports the game. There are also plenty of aestethic items, colors & more.Worth trying out.			"

												Now to start of this review i'd like to say, i really like this game, and i find it really fun but there are some flaws in this game i would like to adress:First of all, this game is a pay to win game. And i know that there are many games out there like this, but the fact that you have to pay to get the good things in this game, it pisses me off. People with membership or premium or people which actually spend money on this game get all the good stuff, while the free to play have to earn their coins etc.This is not the main point, the main point is that since i have played this game i have experienced so many bugs. The major bug i would like to adress is that when i want to play a good game, i cant becuase im often waiting 5 minutes, whith just one other person! And to fix this problem i have to leave the squad (and my friend too) then re-invite him, then engage, and maybe then we might get a game and this will not always work. There are plenty of other bugs but this is my main bug and it really, really, really, pisses me off.Unfortunately i will have to not recommend this game, so that i get the attention  of the developers so they can fix this damn bug. Like i said i love this game and the gameplay, and the graphics are beautiful, but unless they fix this bug, i wont be happy.			"

												A fun space battling explorer type game, has large sections of map systems.Battle NPC pirates and aliens + PvE or PvP battles or both all mixed in huge galaxy map of large map sections. I rate it a 6/10 Updated 4/6/17It is better balanced now after final release.I will get back to playing more to update a full review.The graphics are a bit nicer too, looking forward to more action this game is fun.I noticed there is lag still for me hopefully not too bad when on a server doing PvP battles.

I can tell that time has been taken into making this game as good as it is, both graphicly, and gameplaywise.Speaking of gameplay, it definitely doesn't work like other dogfighting games. Trust me it took like an hour until I could fly without crashing into something every 20 seconds. Once you get use to the control scheme though it feels nice and solid.I'd say this game is worth checking out if you want to blow stuff up in space.			"

												World of Tanks in space. Generally it plays brilliantly and the rounds are punchy but grossly unvaried, the longevity of this game comes from unlocking better ships and weapons through ongoing play. However, the game title should be Star ConArtist as unless you are a loner that likes to salivate over different types and sizes of spaceship this 'Free to Play' game isn't for you. The developers have fallen into the same trap as WoT and restricted the teamsize to 2 players unless you fork out REAL LIFE MONEY which is a massive shortcoming. Microtransactions I can live with, pay to win I can live with. Restricting who you can play with - No thanks and goodnight! "

												I see that a lot of people are rating the game badly, I have played a lot at Star conflict and I still love it, the gameplay is really good, the graphism are good for a F2P, the game has many game mode (chosen randomly, depend if you want a PVE or PVP battle, they did that to reduce queue time). Then the game is quite extreme on the type of ship, you have a tank ship? they'll need 2 people to take you down! You play as an interceptor? you'll die very quicly but you'll go so fast they won't touch you, it may sound bad, but this make each person and ship important in a battle: try to win a battle if the ennemy team has an enginner and you don't. I don't play often, but I truly enjoy it. There is also an open world mode! This hyped the whole community but in lv1 one zone they though that puting some ennemies that can't be killed by a T7 ship was a good idea. The game won't let you buy your ship and weapon easly, but they made some dayly mission for the open world gamemode so you can get money a bit faster. Most of people don't stay on this game so long, you must know that if you are bad at this game, you'll probably uninstall and leave a bad review, but to become good you need to take the ship type that you like, I personaly was bad at this game at start and then I started playing as an special operation interceptor and now I can do some PVP battle without dying once.I saw many people talking about the synergie stuff, it's globaly the XP of your ship, when you reach a certain level you can buy the next one, but if you reach the max level, you'll get 1% of XP boost forever. Sound ridiculous no? but you must know that the first ships don't take that much synergy to lv up the ship, so you can do that with the free synergy (a pourcent of the total synergy winned in a battle can be used on all ship for free). You'll quickly get a 10% boost if you do that, it help thrust me. So before you play, give a fair test to the game, don't play like 20 minute like those idiots at least make sure you tryed all class ship (until T3 ship are really cheap so you can test them without wasting too much money).

												I'm not certain why so many people are complaining so vehemently against the grinding system in place with Star Conflict. As expected with any F2P, yes, there is a grind involved to unlocking new equipment and ships. But to suggest it's so outlandish that it's ""ONE HUGE GRIND,"" I couldn't disagree more. In my experience, gaining reputation / ships / equipment works well, so long as you play smart. A fantastic game with NO LOAD TIMES, despite the region you're queued in.Pros-Dogfighting is engaging and rewarding-Game SHINES when you begin to play with friends / coordinate attacks-Despite the grind, it's not as egregious as several reviews claim-Excellent visuals with very little demand on graphics cards-Several well-designed ship classes-Several fun game modes with a Free Roaming mode in the works-Achievements for killing / helping Devs, who play fairly often-Not P2WCons-Rough learning curve as you progress through each tier-Gear is often not interchangable between ships that you'd assumed would-Unless in groups, relying on pugs to play objectives in very wishful thinking-Coolest ships are only accessible with actual cash. More of an aesthetic complaint than anything else.			"

												This game is what i have been looking fof for a while. I remember the old days with space flight games like Wing commander 3. There have been some of these games around but this one is the best and it is free. I just started and considering the structure i think it might be repetetive in the long run. For now it is good fun and really love the game.			"

												This game has been around for quite some time now. It has seen it's ups and downs and I have returned to it after a long time away from it due to some recent changes. The game is barely alive but it is still very enjoyable and if ou are a space game fan I recommend at least taking a couple of days of your time to try it out.It is developed by the same company as War Thunder but it doesn't get similar attention to gamplay due to the smaller player base, but it should be around for a few more years and if you are a casual player this might help fill the void until the big space titles come out in the future.

												Despite the issues it has with balance, since it's still in beta, it's a solid ship combat space game that has a style mixed of Flight sim and arcade shooter, making it fairly fun.You're not going to get anywhere at any speed with a basic liscense, however, and this could be considered a major drawback, unless you really could care less about the outcome of the game.

												To start from scratch, Star Conflict is a multiplayer game in which you get the chance to pilot a space ship, flying through the beautiful maps in high definition to fight against various warring groups, with your many options of lasers, blasters and more. To me, it’s more like a simulation than a game, with it’s realistic and futuristic feel. You can install a lot of different tools to your ship, included in these options, is the gun jammer, cloaking, shrapnel mines, shields and many others.ships_systems_pic_a_engThink StarWars, remember all those space hosted star fighter battles? “Raise the shields Artoo!” Well that’s similar to what you’ll experience in this game.scrn_may25_01The basic goal is to not blow up, but you already knew that. It’s how not to be blown up you need to know. Simple. Depending on the ship you’ve acquired, the shields will differ in strength, as well as the guns. Two bars populate the space around you ship (the game is not in the first person yet), one will be the shields, the other… well… i’m not sure what to call it, but when receiving damage from either collision or being shot, you will notice the shield bar drain slightly (unless you get hit with a “one shot kill” blaster, in which case you wouldn’t really see anything accept the re-spawning screen). When that bar is diminished to the max (rendered empty), then the second bar will begin to diminish. The second bar is basically your ships damage status, although, it drains much faster than the shield. After this bar is gone, you’ve blown up.scrn_may25_05This scenario would seem pretty lame… if it wasn’t for the awesome graphics! explosionIn Game Look at all the colors! The graphics are another reason that this game is realistic. I’ve found myself ducking out of the way of a well aimed gun bolt a few times, or flinching when a ship fly’s too close. 1 (22)_1Okay, i’m going to lay off on the screenshots, but iv’e made my point.There are three types of battles, beacon capture (dubbed “Bacon Capture” by many pilots), combat reconnaissance and EMP bomb. Chief among these is beacon capture. In this game, your goal is to capture the beacon (DUH!), and the longer a beacon is captured, the more points the team gets. If a team is being completely dominated, with no beacons in possession, then their points will lower. the first team to hit zero losses. Also, if a beacon is occupied for a certain amount of time, drones start to spawn around it, shooting at any opposing ship within 2000 meters.scrn_may25_03Which begins another point i’d like to make, depending on the gun capability of a ship, there is a certain range at which a weapon can reach. Most beginning guns will hit anything within about 3000 meters. An HUD display will surround all opposing and friendly ships whether to far to see or close enough to crash into, giving stats of distance, direction and other useful information. The direction display will show a circle that moves away from the ship in order for you to have an easier ability to track it’s movements, it helps when your firing at a moving target. All you have to do is point your cursor (also a circle, with a limited amount of movement depending on the ship. It allows the user to steer and target.) into the tracker and shoot. As for range, if the distance between you and your opponent is adequately matched to your gun , then the HUD will change color. This display is especially useful if your hunting the captain in combat recon, or trying to intercept a ship from acquiring a beacon or bomb.All this sounds really fun, and it is. But to play any of these games, you must join them first.The story line of Star Conflict is based off of a battle between three different groups, Jericho, Federation and Empire. When creating an account, or starting the game, you must first choose which group to follow and fight for. Each has it’s own selection of gear, abilities and ships. You will go through a sort of tutorial, with missions. To keep the game interesting, missions continue to be available even after the tutorial ends, and you can get new ones from signing contracts. You can also buy different ships and guns, to help in your battles.To enter a battle, you must press a button at the bottom of your screen, labeled “Launch”. This will give you the option of, PvP or PvE. There are two ways to join a PvP.A map showing a hexagon shaped territory, in which you can choose a specific game.A button that automatically finds a game.To join a specific game using the map function, you have to be with a corporation, costing real money. So normally, i’d choose the second option. This puts you into a small tab that counts how long you’ve been waiting, and gives an estimate on when the next match will begin. PvE also does this, because in both games, you must have a minimum amount of ships to join you. The longest wait time will be five minutes, which is a huge damper when your ready for action and have to just sit there and stare at a clock. The average time you’ll have to wait depends on the amount players that are active. I’ve only seen up to about three minutes of waiting, but even for such a short time it can get pretty mind numbing.Once the game find a spot for you, it will show a “Triangular” text on the wait tab and lock all hanger options. Then it starts the game, showing you a player list of both teams, and the rank that the match is set to. The rank is determined by your type of ship and it’s capability. The same display shows up when your respawning, backed by a background of the map with small icons that represent the positions of all the ships. Sometimes, it will even show the shooting lanes.The average game will last will last a pretty long time, making up for the grueling wait.Another issue that keeps recurring in both my mind and the Star Conflict community is the view point. Currently, when flying a ship, you will see from a third person view. Many players (including me) would really like to see this game from the first person, but the response looks something like this:“the suggestion for a cockpit view has already been forwarded, but at the moment a cockpit view would not be very effective.Due to the limited view you would have a disadvantage compared to 3rd person pilots./closed.”and: “It is planned, but the priority for this is very low at the moment because the cockpit view would be less efficient in battle.“So I guess it’s in progress.In conclusion, Star Conflict is a great game, with fantastic graphics, realistic piloting scenarios, fun and competitive games and a good story line (my friends and I often argue about which group is dominant). Although, there are a couple problems I have with it, like the wait time, 3rd person view, foul language in the intercom (can easily be shut off in the options) and lack of variety which causes the game to get dull after a while. There are many disadvantages and advantages, but the problems fall far short of making Star Conflict unplayable, and the good parts dominate intensely.http://jumocreations.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/star-conflict/ "
