												I bought this because it's a classic that I spent a lot of time on when I was younger. It's a fun flight sim with a lot of missions to do. - Some people might not be able to run this game properly on modern machines, but that's fixable with a little bit of registry editing, setting the correct settings (Like choosing Hardware TnL in options app), and downloading some extra missing files (link in comments).- I highly recommend setting the control method to ""E-mouse"", with inverted Y-axis (Makes it behave like an FPS).If anybody has any questions about how to get this game running, comment on my review your questions, and I might be able to help you with it. I'm running this on Windows 8.1, with x8 Anti aliasing at 1280x720@60 FPS and all settings maxed (Trying to figure out how to get 1080p, at the moment).TL;DR If you ignore the outdated visuals and the hassle to get it properly set up the first time, this would be a fun flight sim for you.

												There I want to tell a lot about this great game.Basically this is standalone addon for original Echelon game a futurstic action/VTOL-simulation set in same universe and period but from another character perspective. The game features decent flight model which makes you feel of flight and inertion, advanced damage model, a lot of detailed ground, naval and air units and buildings with their own damage models. There many types of aicrafts and weapons to choose. The game is unique by being realistic at some point Sci-Fi vtol sim. The game locations is large, the whole continent is featured here.The story/campaign is good, long and even non linear at some places, the fully and nicely voiced dialogues (yeah with yelling commander etc.) also.The graphics of original Echelon (2001) was next gen for it's time, but in WindWarriors not really much changes.Game mechanics have a lot similarities to MechWarrior series just you control the aircraft there.Sadly this game didn't got any sequels (forget about operation matriarchy) so the story is incomplete due publishers counted this type of games as not profitable.There is campaign coop and nice multiplayer with gamemodes involving teamwork and just fun deathmach, the bad thing it was using Gamespy. (the russian comminity still run server, but it reqiure custom patches) Unlike most of harcore sim games this is easy to learn but hard to master, in multiplayer (really!). There more action than fight with controls of your machine.I would recommend this game if you like open locations, Sci-Fi VTOL, atmoshpere (in both meanings, game take place only on planet) some hard missions to challenge your skills, epic and dynamic battles and unexpected turns of a plot.

												It is as old as great. I enjoyed the gameplay many years ago, I enjoy it now. One of the most interesting features - the dialogs.By the way, it launched on Windows 7 64x without any problems			"

												I bought this game, and have spent the most 'gameplay' hours trying to get it to work. Finally the COMMUNITY helped me out guiding me through REGEDIT.No thanks to MADia Entertainment, who should be banned from STEAM for not living up to the expected CUSTOMER SUPPORT.So I would check the NOT INTERESTED BOX, and go find other nice games with the same theme.

												A very good game and have a real nice feel to the flight and combat, better than I seen in many spacecombat games like Starconflict and Elite dangerous.EXCEPT one thing:  It won´t start, I bought it on steam and installed it, I strongly recommend you get a "" FREE "" version of this game to see if it´s possible to run.Update: There are tips in the steam forum how to get it to work.It works then, but pain in the butt to configure.

												Took me about 20 minutes to get the game working  after trying the same fixes I did for the first game. The game takes a long time to open everytime you want to play... Screenshots doesn't work and the Steam Community doesn't work in game.Pretty sure this is a very old game, I don't really understand what i'm looking at and i'm pretty sure only people that have played the game before will enjoy it.I strongly do not recommend to buy this game if you haven't played it previously and even if you did, keep in mind you will spend a good amount of time fixing the game. Don't even ask me how I did it, I don't remember, I've tried many fixes and reinstalled the game twice, there's tips in both of the games discussions forums but most of them doesn't work.			"
