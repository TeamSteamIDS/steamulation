												This game is honestly soo different then anything you will ever play. At first everything is hard the controls are really weird and it's just you talking to your spaceship. After about 30 minutes of walking around you kind of get a feel for the game and everything begins to make since......The game: You are a robot named Ludwig where you crash land on planet earth, you are a simple robot with a very intelligent spaceship ( that helps you every step of the game). Your goal is to explore and find and discover every element we know......for example we know how to make a fire but Ludwig does not. So you have to go and find parts to make a decoder to read a manual for a BBQ and this allows you to make a fire....but before you get hurt, your spaceship makes a combustion lab which allows you to test all combustibles  ( you get to see when they burn, when there is nothing left and the molecules left behind) The good: The game is its weird kind of fun. If interested in science you get to learn a lot of interesting things about our elements. The world is beautiful, mini games are fun.............a little addictingThe bad: The controls basically suck, The music is repetitive and just sucks ( I had to mute it and play my own music)a lot of talking between you and your spaceship before you can get going, have to read a lot to fully understand every option in the workshop.Buy it: If you like science and want a game where you can relax use your intelligence go for it. I know I'll be playing it some moreRating: 7.5/10  "

												pros:+ great story+ great characters+ worth a few laughs+ it should be able to teach your kids something+ even though the puzzle's, trivia and adventure elements are aimed at children, going through the game stil took me 9 hours. lots to collect and explore, 1 of the few games that got me to read each dialog. (i might have left the game on while doing something else occasionally)cons:- not challenging if you have had your first physics/chemistry classes (aimed at children)- game play can feel a bit slow at times, althoug its not bad compared to other point&click adventure style gamesoverall i really enjoyed this game even though i was a bit dissapointed about the lack of challenge.the dialogs are funny and the story is thought out very well, and suprisingly deep.at the end it was a very entertaining casual experience.i experienced no crashes, although there often where lagspikes when picking up stuff, nothing to interuptive though. initial loading time when starting up can be quite long, but thats the only time i was bothered by long loading times. even though others have said something else, i would like to say that this game does present fun for all ages, it however, is not fun if you do not take the time to read the dialogs and get into the story.but thats true for all games. rpg's are always, get x of this, kill x of that, escort john to his market stall. in fps games you are always running around shooting things. in racing games you always drive laps. even the best puzzle games with the funnest gameplay mechanics will still get repetitive without story and arbitrairy goals and rewards.to have fun you WILL have to take the time to read a lot of dialogs :)			"

												A possibily fun little puzzle game that is hurt by its aggressive hand-holding and cuts to mini cutscenes every minute of gameplay. This may in fact be a child's game, and it really does treat the user like an idiot.			"

												Finished (almost 100%) in 7 hours.  Enjoyable, but I probably won't play it twice, since I didn't see much replay value in it for me.  Relatively stable with only one crash to desktop, and it would have been nice if the game could be played in a window instead of full screen.  Loading screens are longer than I would have liked.  Played one level via Steam Streaming on my Mac without trouble.Game itself was a fun adventure.  Graphics were nice and controls were fine.  It appeared to be educational, but I certainly didn't learn anything I hadn't already learned in highschool.[Edit: Registration no longer required with latest update.]			"

												Despite bad first impressions when I started playing this game, it has been improved. Especially now that they have listened to the customers and have removed the login page.This game is really good. Here are my thoughts so far:PROS- It is very easy to learn. The controls are weird but easy to understand and get used to. The tutorial helps a lot.- The gameplay is fun. The puzzles are interesting and fun.- The graphics are good and the artwork is pretty.- The game is very educational. While most of it is learnt it high school, I managed to learn something from this game.CONS- No option for windowed mode or ability to change resolution.- The game has crashed once, even though it was on medium quality for graphics on a very high performance PC. Maybe this issue has already been fixed.- There is no option to save in the menu. You have to find the save points in the game in order to save, which there are lots of them around. However, in a rush, it might be hard to find one and walk to it in order to save the game.After a lot of consideration and thought I have decided to recommend this game.			"

												EDIT 5.8.You don´t need an account anymore, thanks to the Developers!So I can finally tell you that this is definitely a little gem under all this mud that is released on Steamrecently and it deserves more attention.Graphics, landscape and atmosphere are very nice.The science-oriented puzzles makes much more sense than these random puzzles from other adventure games.Very good edutainment for the whole family.The only downside for me are the keyboard and mouse controls, which took me a while to get used to. Sadly a controller is not supported, altthough the game would be perfect for a controller.Old Review, no more valid:Maybe the game is good. I don´t know that because I am not willing to support account making and always online DRM for a single player adventure game.Yes, always online DRM, be aware of this before you buy!Edit 3.7.After the Announcement that they want to remove the login:""We just wanted to let you know, that we are aware of this problem and try to implement a better solution (no login + steam cloud savegames) as soon as possible. ""I am looking forward to play the game when this is done. And hopefully I can change my review after I try out the gameplay.			"

												It's a great game for little kids. If you are older than 12 years old you probably wont find this fun unless its like one of your first video games.I played for about 30 minutes and the whole game is just go here click on this, go over here and click on this. There's no voice acting, just text reading. There aren't really puzzels so much as just looking for things and then finding them and then clicking a few menus to use them.Just a heads up I didn't buy this game I got it in some 2 dollar bundle on indiegala or something. Anyway its NOT a bad game its just not fun if you are of a certain age. "

												I can say that this game is pretty amazing.Although it is targeted for kids, I had a lot of fun finishing the 1st stage.This game teach a lot of things like what material burn easily?, what is the residue if you burn a piece of wood?, etc.Science & Nature lesson are cool!The main character is a funny robot and the conversation are full of jokes.All the puzzles are challenging, it's fun to solve it.There is Main Quest & Side Quest for more challenging gaming experience.Buy this for your younger brother/sister or maybe your kids.

												Personal Rating: I liked this game quite a lot.Classic Rating: ★★★★☆Graphics and Artworks/Cutscenes are pretty good, storyline is deeply and well scripted, characters are original and funny; there are some links to famous games/movies too, like Half Life and Star Trek. Music is good too, even if it's the same track for several locations - as it was for characters, there is at least one link to a famous TV Show also for the soundtrack: A-Team.Gameplay has some issues, nothing really bad though: controlling LUDWIG can get a bit boring because of the camera and environment which covers your visual at some points; in the last chapters i experienced several jerks while grabbing stuff and while moving myself around: i did even set graphic settings to ""performace"" but it didn't change a bit.. the game takes some time to load and quit too.So, in the end LUDWIG is a game about exploration, reading, learning stuff and solving puzzles (nice ones if i have to say, some are easy enough, others are a bit more challenging but never too difficult): probably best suited for kids, i enjoyed it anyway :-)			"

												I'm really sorry to downvote this game, it's clear that the developers put a lot of efforts and care in it. But there's something inherently wrong in the game concept itself. Basically Ludwig is a sort of ""educational"" game aimed to young players but the problem is that it's far too complex for the target! Boring for adults and extremely convoluted for kids. It's a pity because the potential is there, the problem is all in the design, probably created by people who don't play or know games very much...			"

												The English translation is abyssmal, and the game has a lot of text. Some very annoying design decisions evident right from the start help this conform to the stereotype about educational games. Maybe if they had focused less on the minigames and promoted the core experience, which is sort of a free-roaming adventure game?			"

												Interesting idea, but poorly executed. The hydroelectric power mini-game is a good example of some of the problems with this game. If you lose the mini-game the first time the 'reset' button doesn't actually reset the game. It will take you back to the beginning, but whatever the status of the basins and generators were at the end of the last game will be your new starting point. It is also unrealistic as the upsteam and downstream basins will completely run dry within a couple of hours. The translation is also not great; in the mini-game I'm using as an example you are told 'You loose' if you lose.			"

												I tried to give this game an honest go, spent 2 hours playing trying to push through the 'tutorial' until I realized that's what the game is like all the way through.The game non-stop bugs you with walls of text every 30 seconds, it seems not quite properly translated to English, the missions are very dull, and both tutorial messages and the characters are incredibly patronizing to the player.I got fed up of it and uninstalled.

												I think I'm about twice the recommended age for this game.That said, Ludwig isn't really fun enough to be a game game and doesn't incoperate knowledge properly to make it a reasonable learning game. There is some good information in the Knowledge Bank as you unlock everything (with amazingly simple multiple choice questions) but you never need to open the Knowledge Bank to reference what you've ""learned"" to progress. The one time it would have been useful to check (for the burning point of combustables), that information was annoyingly absent.I also found the few pop culture references strange and out of place.Having said all that, the game is competently built if a bit clunky. Not recommended except for extra-credit.			"

												Simple, endearing and educational. Perfect for children and still a good game for others. Might lack a bit of polishing, but the universe is really well crafted and teaches about the current human technologies for gathering energy. If you like platform and puzzles, this is a good game to get for less than 10 euros.			"
