Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and I can honestly say it is one of the most enjoyable casual games I have ever played. It has a perfect balance between city building, RPG elements and crafting, and gives you a rewarding feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills that can be improved and you get a real sense of a village community developing. I'll just summerise the rest into simple pros and cons:PRO- Fantastic mix of city-building/RPG- Simple yet very pretty graphics- frequent updates and very good developer communication- A slow yet steady rate of progressionCON- villager professions not yet finished so feel abit lacking in variety- a few bugs here and there- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a whileI would strongly recommend giving this game a go and looking at the future plans for this game on the developers website, exciting things planned!

								To me, the 25$ was a bit steep for something that you could technically ""accomplish"" within 2 hours. I mean if you're into expanding and creating towns and furnishing the houses with the prettiest of flowers, you'll love it, but if you're like me with just striving to hit the top of the research chain/skill tree, it's a bit easy. I'd say you could compare this a little bit to Banished in some several yet different ways.Pros:-Easy to learn-Visually nice-Can design your own buildings-Nice mix of city builder/management-Some slightly unique concepts-Is playable in it's current state-Slow progression, but actually being updatedCons:-Bugs, lots of 'em.-Crashing is frequent (Until you update your drivers)-Occasionally slightly broken UI (F5 to fix)-Not fully complete job tree (yet)-Weird inventory viewing systemAll in all, I would reccomend this game. I did find it enjoyable for the 2 hours I played, but until more is added, I'll just wait patiently. Maybe a price drop would be nice as well.			"

								A note on the negative comments: I've read through the negs on the reviews and in 99% of cases, the problem is easily resolved if you check the forums on the stonehearth webpage. Usually the problems are solved with a reboot of the game due to errors while the game engine is still in developement. I have almost 900 hours on this game. Already for more fun than most AAA titles with far better replayability. Obviously it's an alpha so there are bugs but I've never seen a company so dedicated to getting the bugs squished as quickly as possible. I really can't give this game a high enough rating and it just continues to get better with every release. It is already well worth the money and it's a game that every member of the family can play.Edit: apparently my review was suspiciously positive and didn't contain enough...something. So, for the people who are suspicious of positive reviews (seriously?) Here's your version:""Ths gam r grate. I ply this game lots and lots. Yay! It's the mostest fun you can hav when not eeting crayons and likking windows"" Yes...I'm looking at you in the comments.....better?			"

Early Access Review
								I have played Stonehearth for 341 hours and have enjoyed playing through the developing stages. The game is becoming more polished and seems to be headed in a positive direction. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a sandbox building and crafting games where they can design towns and villages with a little bit of hostile goblins thrown in to the mix.I do not recommend this yet for someone that is expecting a finished polished product or get upset when an error message pops up.The Good- I find the game extremely fun to play with the ability to design your own houses and structures.  - The pace of the game is relaxing and the music is very soothing. - The Heathing are amusing as they try to carry out your commands- There are more creatures to worry about now as Giant Zombie, Stone Golems, Eants, and what looks like a mutant alligator roam the land. Undead Villages complete with crazed necromancers pop up and flood the night with undead critters.- The ability to create Mods will mean continued content. I hope that this also continues to develop end game content.- Weekly twitch feed keep you updated on developments and lets you give feed back to the developers.The Bad- There are still errors when trying to build structures, and it takes a while to learn what works and what does not. It seems the building logic really wants you to lay down your design in a certain way. I watched a twitch feed were the designer was working on this to allow the engine to be more flexible.- The Hearthling become idler as your town, village, Kingdom expands. I am unsure if this is caused by distance, memory issues or pathing (although sometime it’s because I ran out of wood). The developers have work hard and these issues have improved greatly since I started playing it. (I still have to chop my own wood of course)- The end game is not there yet.  There is a basic scenario evolving Blood thirsty goblins which ends after 4 or 5 encounters.  Following that you only have to fend off random creatures once or twice a day.    I will continue to play and follow this game as it develops. "

Early Access Review
								In its current state, I have to recommend this game!Couple of points at the end explain the overall rating.Pros: - Cute Artstyle - AI 90% of the time is perfect - Can build almost anything you want to - Hard mode actually adds survival challenge to this otherwise peaceful town builder - Constantly being developed/improved - Indepth profession system with RPG style progression - Happy to just watch my villagers do their thing!Cons: - AI doesn't work 10% of the time - Buildings you designate to build sometime never get finished (Look at bottom of post) - Combat AI is dodgey. I have to tell them to Defend a location, to get them to attack monstersNotes:The reason it is a yes is solely based upon the ability to use the Command Console (CTRL + SHIFT + C).This allows you to Instantly Build buildings your villagers refuse to build, and you can destroy buildings already created.Without these two commands (IB & Destroy), I would have raged quit this game years ago.I'd say 50% of custom buildings never get finished if they are semi-complicated. Sometimes the villagers, when you tell them to place items, never actually place it and you're stuck with the ghost icon.But with 'Destroy', you get rid of it, and with 'IB' you can sort the building issues out!You even have a Teleport command if your villagers get stuck!Hopefully they will remove the need for the console, but until then I have to give this a 8/10 IF you use the Console.Without the Console, it'd only be a 5/10.

								This is my very first review for any game, I just feel compelled to do it! My first impression of Stonehearth after watching their video wasn't good. This is my very first uh I don't know what to call it, 2D-pixel voxel game? Anyway, I was a bit turned off by it. I've always avoided minecraft for that reason. Also, the price of $24.99 for this type of game seemed a bit too much for me. Anyway, I spent a couple of weeks thinking about it, watched their intro video at least 4 times and finally caved and bought the game the other night. Stonehearth has been such a delight to play. I thoroughly enjoy the job/class and advancement systems. I love the cuteness that is the game, even the boxy critters and animals are adorable. Building your own homes can be quite a challenge, which adds to the fun for me. I also love being able to use a building template the game provides and customize it to my own preference if I'm too lazy to create my own. I love renaming my citizens! I love that I can assign them to their own beds! I love that the cook helps my farmer harvest the fields :D As you can see, I enjoy a lot of the little features in Stonehearth which is why I felt compelled to make this review and share my experience with others. If you enjoy survival/strategy city-builders with cute pets and citizens + job/class advancements, then I highly suggest this game to you. Imo, this is one of those games that's worth the price tag. I love what the developers have done with the game so far and I'm happy to support this early access title.			"

								Dude. DUDE. Look at this.It's an Early Access game... and they're WORKING ON IT.I've been playing Stonehearth on and off for a while, the interest spikes obviously coinciding with updates, and I am glad to say this game does not have potential. It has promise. Because a promise is something you actually follow through on.Like everyone else is saying, it is by no means complete. Think about it: it's a sandbox game and they only just put the zombies and water in. How complete is that to you?But it all works, more or less. More THAN less. There are peculiarities, certainly - when I tell you tiny voxel people to pick berries, I mean I want you to TAKE those berries back to town - but it doesn't hiccup too often. And there have been some interesting hiccups. The biggest one, which involved two separate timers ingame and their misbehavior, the devs actually detailed in a blog post.Which brings me to the dev team, Radiant. These people talk with their community, and their community talks back. And they communicate often. Weekly - or so,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens - posts keep everyone appraised of what's going on with/in to the game, which is always nice to see. And I've seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥ man... I purchased Cube World.Now, I want to draw attention to something that I think is important. Stonehearth is currently in Alpha 10 - every time there's a large content update, they bump that number up by one. And it's only just now on Early Access, despite it going up on Steam early so Kickstarter patrons would have an easier time of it.That means they waited until they had a significant amount of content in the game before going Early Access.Seriously, Radiant. Y'all're beautiful.If you like boxy sandboxes and RTS-type games, give this one a whirl. I think you'll like it.			"

Early Access Review
Welcome, to the Hearth!Heya guys, and gals, and welcome to my little review on Stonehearth, a lovable Early-Access title brought to you from the developers at Radient Entertainment, an indie-game studio based in Los Altos, California.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initially when I first stumbled upon Stonehearth, it was after the dark ages seen from similar titles, notebly the game Castle Story from Sauropod Studios. An early access game as well, and with a similar feel initially, the game suffered quickly due to lack of development and the $30.00 price tag on a -usually- broken and unsatisfying experience. Coming to Stonehearth, I was a bit relictant to try a new title under the Early Access title and with the same feel.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So let's get into it, what is Stonehearth all about?Stonehearth is a meshed combination of a City Builder but with a mix of RPG and Adventure elements. Your journey begins as one of the two (current) races available to play (four are planned so far in total). Starting out, you and your handful of citizens (Hearthlings) are tasked with constructing your very own ""city on a hill"", a home in the wilderness of one of two (current) biomes.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Races and FactionsThere, at this time, is only a single race playable in the game which of course, are the humans. However, the humans are split into two factions (currently) with a third planned in the future. The human factions that are known about now are:The AscendencyOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Earnest and hardworking, loyal and well-rounded. Citizens of the Ascendency chop, build, and farm, confident that the known world is theirs to inhabit.""The Ascendency are the basic human faction, based off of Eastern European countries they are home to the temperate biome and start their crafting tree around the Carpenter, a specialist who uses wood resources to create works from tools and weapons, to building components and decorations. They don't do well in the desert however, due to their heavy dependance on wood resources.Raya's ChildrenOriginally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""The scattered people of the mountains learned early that to survive, they needed each other - and preferable as many others as they could reach. Now, though the members of their trading cities and traveling caravans pride themselves on ascetic disciplin, visitors find them generous hosts with access to goods from all over the world.""The second released human faction, named the Raya's Children, are designed from a more Middle Eastern resemblance. Living a life in the vast deserts in the world, they have learned to cope with the lack of wood and traditional building materials found elsewhere. Instead of a Carpenter, they begin with a Potter, an artisan skilled in crafting bricks of clay and stone to form efficient housing solutions.Th Northmen's Alliance (NOT RELEASED)Originally posted by Stonehearth Official Wiki: ""Brave and handy, the men and women of the north live for the sight of a new dawn over unexplored territory. Armed with compass and hatchet, they form strings of small, defensible settlements and pride themselves in their tenacious adaptability.""The third faction planned for the human race are the Northmen's Alliance. Based on the Vikings from northern Europe and the surrounding tundras, they are a hardworking collection of natural-born explorers and fighters. They are home to the tundra biome, and additional details for them have yet to be released.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GameplayThe game begins with the main menu, as every game should. Upon stating up a new game you are presented with the choices you shall make, the biome you choose to inhabit, people you choose to play as, and the difficulty to which you would like to play as. It is a simple process, freshened up from a traditional selection screen by being presented to you in the form of a story book, with the choices you make appearing to fill the blanks of the story.Once past, you are sent into the Expedition Roster, a list of several Hearthlings which you will start with. Each Hearthling comes with a randomly rolled attribute set spread across three categories.Mind - Useful for those who will become your fine artisans and crafters, Mind stats help these Hearthlings advance in their career as well as gives a boost to their ability to craft Fine items, creations which are adorned with supreme craftsmanship.Body - Granting bonus stats to boost Hearthling health and movement speed, a high Body stat is excellent for Footmen and combat specialists, but also those who will greatly benefit from the passive speed boost, ie. Farmers and Trappers.Spirit - A key for those going into combat, Spirit attribute points grant a boost to Hearthling courage and morale. High Spirited combat specialists will stand firm in combat, even after sustaining injuries.If you happen to have unfavorable traits, you can try again for as many times as you like with the 'Roll new citizens' button, regenerating all seven Hearthlings. Once finished, on the right side you are greeted by a list of various items for purchase, and a small budget of initial gold for you to purchase things or take along with you on your journey.With your citizens ready to depart and your expedition supplies tied down and stowed for your adventure, it finally comes time to select your site to begin! With reach game of Stonehearth, the maps are randomly generated using seeds, viewable at the bottom of the screen. You can reroll maps for as many times as you wish, alike the Expedtion Roster. To note with your location as you move your cursor over the map, the highlighted box around your cursor represents the actual in-game map, which although seems small compared to the world map, offers plenty of space for your city's development and then some. On the right side, you will also see three major variables which change on the area you select.Trees and Plants - This is pretty self-explanetory on the fact that this value shows how many plants and trees are located in the settlement region you have highlighted.Wildlife - This factor represents the amount of creatures found in the highlighted region, useful for your trappers who will need animals in order to efficiently trap and harvest them.Minerals - This final factor represents the amount of ores, stone deposits, and the etc. which are readily located in the highlighted region. You can always however, mine for ore in a region with little to no Mineral rating, it just takes some time.Once you have your region selected and good to go, you can embark on your journey!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review PartA simple, yet equally complex game, Stonehearth is a game easily loveable by Adventure, RPG, City-builder, and Strategy fans. Built in a voxel art style with a friendly and cute feel to it, it is aesthetically pleasing and especially for those who run the game on higher graphics settings. Keep in mind that there are faults of course, various quirks and bugs are present as you can expect with an Early-Access title, however the weekly Development Team reports and progressing updates are great! There are currently a collection of simple quests and side-missions to keep you interested along with a developing story in the works. Overall I again, highly recommend this title, and encourage you to try it out!Thanks for reading, happy building!- Kyoko			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a great game. It's a merge of Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft; The former for it's 'base-building' and management aspects, the latter for it's voxel graphics. TL;DR Pros/Cons list: + Good replay value + Looks great + Large amount of craftable items and professions + Building Designer + Villagers level up and unlock skills + Frequently updated - Rather buggy, villagers tend to get confused very often and so on - Combat is slow and iffy at times - Game will often break if you don't save often to avoid doing things that break it - Some 'texture' issues - Few pre-built structures - Lack of game customisation (monster spawn rates, villagers, etc)In Stonehearth, your goal (if any) is rather simple: to build a thriving medieval village/city, and take care of the various needs of your villagers (known has hearthlings) along the way.You don't have direct control over your villagers like an RTS; you give them orders to perform and they'll find a way to do it (most of the time) themselves.As you progress in-game, and your villagers level up, you'll slowly unlock more proffessions for them to practice, and thus more furniture, decoration, tools and weapons for them to use.You will not, however, unlock new buildings, as the game only has 5 (I believe) pre-built ones. The rest is up to you to build, using the game's Building Designer feature, which works more or less the same as 'The Sims' Build Mode, with a tab bit less freedom.Hearthlings tend to have issues when building; I have had to help them off of roofs, demolish a building because they couldn't build scaffolding or because they just go on strike and won't build anything at all.Be sure to leave at least a block of space around a building when planning it out; your hearthlings won't be able to build the scaffolding if not.Decoration-wise, there are tons to choose from, ranging from beds, to flower pots or braziers. Each crafting profession has some form of decoration. My villages have gotten prettier and prettier over time as I've discovered new crafts.The game's replay value is rather high, as attempting to create a functional village in different environments can be a challenge at times (on top of a mountain, for example ^^).The game is also rather buggy in it's current state; several times I have had to start a new game because I placed a path over another and the villagers refused to build anything else, or because I was planning a custom building and none of my orders would work anymore.Many blocks/items sometimes overlay eachother as well, causing flickering textures which can get rather irritating at times.I've also had issues where my one fighter hearthling has gotten themselves stuck in an infinite loop of 'Attack Golbing Chieftan > Run away from Goblin Chieftan'. Seeing as there is no direct control over the villagers, I can't do anything to get them to stop, and just have to wait for something to hopefully kill them.All in all, Stonehearth is a great game to own if you're into the genre and I highly recommend it.The frequent updates make it a great game to come back to from time to time.If I were to rate it out of 10 like everyone else seems to, I'd have to give it the following: 7/10.For an Early Acces game, it has a good amount of content, looks good, is fun to play, but the bugs it has in it's current state sometimes ruin the experience.

								I have followed and been trying this game out since the beginning. I first got hooked when it was a concept from someone that seemed to have a passion for what he wanted to do and what he wanted to make.This game is the type of early Access that steam needs. More developers should actually follow this style. Here we have a guy that had his game available while in developement with it hardly being playable. We had the chance to see the game receive slow but steady streams of content flowing in and bug squashing. I used to not be able to get 5 minutes before everyone decided they wanted to sit around and do nothing. But unlike other developers, This guy actually kept at it. and unlike other developers. When the cash flowed in... they slowed down, He sped up. The closest relation i can give this developer style is like Dwarf Fortress. Not in terms of gameplay, but how he steadily adds content while fixing issues with the game. and any dwarf loving fan will know that it takes a while for each of the updates to come out.TL:DR - Developer set realistic goals to meet with limited resources. And keeps meeting them.			"

								Well, it's finally here... Steam Early Access! I couldn't be happier for Team Radiant! :)Disclaimer: I am an official fanboy, and hold this development studio in the highest esteem. But in my defense, I think this is perfectly justified given how open and transparent this team is with their fans and supporters.All that aside, what do I actually think about Stonehearth? I think it has the potential to be one of the most entertaining games we've seen in these combined genres in ages. There's a wealth of things that the team has already implemented (building!, classes, crafting, mining, combat) and a whole host of others in the works.With each new update the team trickles out improvements to the game's foundation (better performance, more stability) and introduces new mechanics and content as well for the community to test drive. You will be hard pressed to find another team that is as open with their backers as these folks, and its always rewarding to see topics discussed with the team in their bi-weekly stream actually implemented in the game.I think I'll leave this review for now, and revisit as each new major release is dropped (roughly every month to month and a half). If you are at all interested in the title, I highly encourage to drop by the Discourse and mingle with some other fans and backers. Watch a few LP series and see just what Stonehearth has to offer at this stage of development.I have a feeling you'll be glad you did! :)p.s. if you are interested in watching a town be rebuilt ... *several* times, look no further! :p

								It's an ant farm that you control. Virtual Villagers but infinitely better. Simply the best town sim I've played.Pros- Combat is fun to watch.- Art direction is beautiful.- You can design the buildings.- Skill/design curve is huge so it's always interesting to do something new.- Actually, everything is fun to watch.Cons- Sometimes workers task weird.- Very CPU(?) intensive. - A strong push by goblin armies can wipe you if you're new.- Haven't seen any water yet. Would like water.- Engineer takes way too much to level. Mason -> Blacksmith -> Engineer, way too much of an EXP grind.Protips- Build a wall early on- Always have a standing army.- I figured out the holy trinity of MMORPGS work with 1 knight, 3 footmen, and 1 cleric. I was able to take on anything with this.- Design your own buildings! Increase efficiency by putting ten beds in one house! Your Hearthlings will love you! ( Love not guaranteed. )- When starting, most people overdo the farm plots. Anything over 15x15 would be overkill until later on.- Use the 'maintain' option if you're building multiple buildings.- You can build walls via pasture enclosements or design building.Suggestions- Let us place objects from storage units into the world. I can't access my piles of stone / clay.- Make the market stalls have different merchants.Overall : 9.5/10. A little buggy, but one of the best games that you could buy for 25$. I'd value it at 35$ at most. Make sure you don't run this on an old computer or you could start freezing or crashing. I've had no problems with the game, great direction.SpecsWin 1016 GB DDR4 RAMIntel i5 6600Radeon RX 480			"

								(I have been following stonehearth since fall 2013, so I will admit that I am (more then) a little bit biased.)   Pros   The devlopers (I've found) are actualy involved in their community. Such as asking for feedback, also taking ideas from other people to help build the hints and tips section on their website.    Music is somthing which can make or break a game for me, and I have found that Raj Mann has created some very amaizing music for this game.    The graphics in this game are very light and happy, (This is the only game that I've found that makes goblins look cute while they steal your stuff.) Though at times I wish the hardened look of suriving on nothing but berries for days. But In the end I find it enjoyable  Cons  This is an early access game so their is lots of bugs and so the game is known to crash, but the devolpers are continually working on the bugs.   If you are still undicided look up their twich streams on tues and thus at 6:00 p.m pacific time.    sorry If I happen to have bad grammer			"

								I have been following the game since the kickstarter and it has gone from strength to strength. After a long process of developing the core systems and streamlining the game engine the game has come on quite rapidly. Appreciate at this stage that the game IS an alpha but also know that new content is being made rapidly at this stage. They have a team of full time staff working hard away 5 days a week to make sure this game reaches its fans so dont think that buying at this stage is a ""gamble"". You WILL get the finished product. The game its self is soo fun to play. A perfect blend of city management with sim life without a crazy amount of micro-management. The game also features very easy mod integration and is built using easy to understand languages. The team have published full documentation on getting started on modding too so if you want to get started, you can do so at any time. It's my recommendation that you buy this game now and try it for yourself. At this stage you will get a good feeling for the final product. For the price you will rarley find something that you will get the same amount of gameplay out of.			"

Afraid of all the freaking crap that you have to learn to play Dwarf Fortress?  Want to support a developer who is upfront about the struggle, needs the communities help, and is rewarding that community with continued work?  Well, this is the game.  This gives me hope that Steam Greenlight, Kickstarter, and indie gaming can make truly wonderful games that would of never seen the light a decade ago.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, let me say this:  I understand Stonehearth is in Early Access.  I don't expect everything to work flawlessly. That having been said, the game needs a lot of work.I picked up Stonehearth based on a lot of Steam user reviews comparing it to Dwarf Fortress.  I like Dwarf Fortress, even though the game is notorious for its extremely obfuscated interface.  Stonehearth sacrifices a lot of DF's detailed simulation for a more accessible experience, which is fine with me.  However, as of March 2016, the current build is badly broken.  A few of the weird AI glitches I've seen include Hearthlings that join the settlement, but idle in one place permanently.  After accepting a new Hearthling (hereafter referred to as ""plebs""), I watched her stand on a hill for a week, regardless of any orders I issued.  She was eventually eaten by wolves.  Footmen, Stonehearth's 'soldier' class, will charge after enemies they have no chance of defeating, regardless of their current orders.  When they're reduced to 1/4 health, they flee for a few moments, then turn back and resume fighting.  I've lost at least four Footmen because of this behavior.  Mobs also have a tendency to spawn in weird locations, like at the end of a long tunnel with only one entrance.  I got a notification informing me that one of my plebs was mauled to death by wolves, at the end of a mining tunnel with a closed door at the entrance.  Either something's up with the spawning algorithm, or all dogs don't go to heaven.  I'm saying they're ghost dogs.  Way of the samurai.The building system is suprisingly robust.  The interface makes it easy to plot foundations, walls, upper floors, and roofs.  I actually designed some pretty handsome structures, and the process was fairly intuitive and straightforward.  However, once I actually placed my blueprint and ordered my plebs to build the structure, I ran into more AI issues.  On two separate occasions, my plebs stopped building before the structure was complete.  They'd build to around 3/4 completion, then idle, as though they had nothing to do.  Reloading the game did nothing.  Suspending all jobs, then re-assigning them did nothing.  I simply had a partially-finished shell of a building in the middle of my settlement.  I tried to remove it, but my plebs demolished about half of the building, then idled again.  My town looks like Detroit in 1996.  Shameful display.Despite all the AI issues, I still like the game.  The art style is charming, and the UI makes it easy to place buildings and command your plebs.  Once they iron out the issues with plebs abandoning construction halfway through, I think it's going to be a joy to play.  The interface handles walls and roofs very gracefully, and building blueprints for structures is a breeze.  I remember placing roofs in ""Towns,"" a similar town-building game, was a living nightmare.  Most importantly, while scanning the forums for solutions to my AI issues, I saw that the devs were very active, involved with, and respectful to their players.  That's a very good sign.  For the time being, I'm going to recommend this game.  I was excited enough about the premise that I didn't mind the $25 price tag, but if cost is an issue for you, I'd recommend holding off until they get a beta build up and running.  Bottom line:  despite some pretty rampant AI issues, the game shows a lot of promise.  As long as the devs stay active and listen to their player base, I think this is going to mature into a very enjoyable experience.[UPDATE 3/13/16]  All of my footmen got thwomped by a one-two combo of ghost dogs and giant zombies, so I decided to start a new settlement in sandbox mode.  So far, I've experienced none of the AI glitches I saw in 'normal' mode.  It seems that something about combat, or placing my settlement on defense mode, breaks the AI.  I'm hoping the devs fix this, because I enjoyed the challenge of defending against sporadic attacks from invaders and thieves.  For the time being, however, I'd recommend you play in sandbox mode.

								In StoneHearth, you begin the game on a randomly generated map similar to a Minecraft map. The gameplay is similar to a strategy game, as you do not control directly any character. You just give orders and expect them to be followed. You start with 7 Settlers, each having their own sets of strenghts & weaknesses. One may be thriving in handcrafting while another is suited for military missions. With these settlers, you'll build and develop a camp thanks to all the resources available. These resources are various, and it can be compared here with Terraria for instance.To grow, you'll focus on developing the skills of your settlers, assigning them jobs, and gathering as much resources as possible. But these objectives can be endangered by the presence of enemies at night: zombies, skeletons, goblins. You'll have to manage a small military force to protect yourself.The final objective of the game in its current state is more or less to build your 'perfect base', and survive long enough to do so.Similar games:- Stronghold- The SettlersCool features:- Daily events and Trade, to earn gold and buy resources you lack of- The Building design system, which is quite good and allow you to design your dream city/base- Progression system for settlersIn its current state, the game is good, and the potential is interesting. I recommand it if you enjoy this kind of game (Check the Settlers especially). "

As Daft Punk once said, ""buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail - upgrade it"".Or at least, something like that. You get my point.So, Stonehearth (gosh, that's one unfortunate title *cough*Hearthstone*cough*) is a very promising *deep breath* early access city building, minecraftesque, RPG, strategy, survival, crafting game. Whew, that was long.You start by choosing the background of your hearthlings, their place to settle and the difficulty. Then, you take the role of the taskmaster as you have to guide your people. Craft, build, assign jobs, harvest, defend against hunger, goblins, golems etc. NOTE: As nightfalls come and go, be advised that mobs will become slowly, but surely, more difficult to face. The gameplay is all about choosing the best decision about your everyday actions and proper resource management (whether that's your hearthlings or your food). You have to direct your workers to crafting or collecting what you think you need mostly and prepare for the dangers that descend upon you every night. But what if you make the wrong choice? You don't have to worry about that, since the game has a perfect pace to give you the time to think carefully about your choices and correct those that turned up to be a disaster. One very unique aspect, which I enjoyed very much (I got up from my chair and clapped my hands when I saw it), is the ability to design unique houses for your hearthlings. True, you got the default building templates, but you can also choose the size, materials, style, decoration of each construction you plan to make and model it to your heart's desire. Kudos for that, it was an excellent idea from the developers and I don't think any other city building game has ever done that.On the downside, the game is still in Alpha. Be prepared for game-breaking bugs and it's a good idea to report them in order to help the devs improve the game as fast as possible.The hearthlings' AI is a bit clumsy at times too, so don't be surprised if your people simply ignore the goblins stealing their precious resources or taking years to clear a specific side of the forest you ordered them to cut down. Hopefully, it will be improved in future patches and builds.Personal suggestions towards the developers: I look forward to the addition of multiplayer, new biomes, new nations and better AI.Overall, if you are into this genre, give it a shot when you can afford it and you won't regret it. *wink*RATING:Gameplay: 7.5/10 (due to several bugs that can create a big mess)Presentation: 8/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Entertainment: 8.5/10OVERALL: 8.1/10 "

								I've been following this game for a long time, I actually missed the kickstarter by a few days.. and it is unfortunate because I really wanted to support them in a bigger way. This game means quite a bit to me it really got me back into gaming which I was very apathetic about all newer game titles. I've been in the testing phases of this game for a long time pretty much as soon as they allowed you to buy in from their website and I honestly have never regretted it. The game itself is quirky. There is a lot of stuff going on and bugs happen, but I can absolutely assure anyone who is put off by this that it will be fixed. In the older builds there were major funny, and breaking bugs.. which messed up the gameplay but the devise are always diligent to squash anything they can as promptly as possible. I can't recommend this game enough simply because it has such an amazing community. It already has modders, the devs are very active and as transparent as possible, biweekly dev streams where people in chat can actually influence the shape of the game, devs are very appreciative of their community and open to suggestions, and much more. The team definitely has a vision of where this game is going, and they are honestly working their asses off to achieve it.. And so far they are hitting the nail on the head every time. Their over all may not be exactly what I was wanting... But the modding scene well have us covered on that front. New builds come out every few weeks.. Sometimes they are buggy sometimes they are not. It all depends on what what changed or how much new content is thrown it. Fixes usually come within a few days but sometimes require a larger update to fix. I pretty much play this game for 5 or 10 hours every other weekend testing the new content, trying out new ideas, etc.. The content is steadily growing at decent rate. Overall for me this game scratches an itch I've had since finally abandoning dwarf fortress. I look forward to participating in this community for years to come.			"

								When I took a screenshot of Stonehearth, and shared it with my friend, the first thing he asked was ""Is that a Minecraft clone?"" Seriously, no. If you think a complex city building and management game is a clone of Minecraft, you need to really get a reality check, bud. Anyway, moving on to the actual review. First, you should know that I've been playing Stonehearth since the pre-alpha days, and that this review is for Alpha 10.5. I'm also basing this only on the content that is currently available, and not promised stuff due out later in development. Though, I'm personally looking forward to PvP combat, which is going to be a feature later on. SOUNDSound design is average, and everything you'd expect to be there, is there. You've got grunts, a catchy (if not a tad repetitive) soundtrack, and all the other standard musical cues you'd expect from a video game. -7/10GAMEPLAYYou've got the foundations of a pretty awesome city building game, though there's a clear lack of content as of this writing. The core city building aspect is most definitely there, and you're able to build custom structures, mine for resources, and even fight invading monsters. I've yet to actually figure out what happens if you lose all of your guys to a city invasion, and the enemies don't seem to do much other than invade, and rush you with numbers. But at the very least, it's the start of something major. You're also able to create squads to better fend off enemy invasion, and the city building animations are fascinating. I found myself building random structures just to see how my little minions (yes, that's what I call them) would construct it. -9/10FEATURESUnfortunately, the game is currently lacking in the feature department. While the actual gameplay is polished beyond what you'd expect for an Early Access game, it isn't without its faults. For starters, there is very little in the way of configuration. There's no graphic slider, or volume control. This is really just a core experience right now, and you know what? I'm oddly okay with that. This is just an alpha after all. Things will improve. -8/10CONCLUSION All in all, Stonehearth offers a very solid city building experience. Considering as how this is only just in alpha, Stonehearth feels like a finished product. It has polish, it has style. It's just an all around fun experience. Sure, there's a fair number of bugs, though none of them are game breaking, at least in my testing. This is an alpha, so a bug or two is expected. But the fact that Stonehearth plays and feels like a finished product? Well, that's just darn amazing. So yes, I recommend Stonehearth. Final rating? 8.5/10. (note: this review was for alpha version 10.5)			"

								This is the video game equivalent of a handful of vicodin and a glass of white wine.  It's very simple, calming and satisfying.  You just sit around in your little hot air balloon and yell at these little kids playing minecraft to destroy the earth and remake it in your image, and they just snap to it.  Just ""You, your job is crops.  You, you're in charge of all wood.  You, you make fox jerky,"" and away they go, farming, carving and toturing cute animals to death.  There's combat in this game, but it requires no thought.  Life in sedated management is good.			"

								tl;dr, add this to your watch list and wait for more content.One of few early access game that really 'done right' (Looking at you killing floor 2)Devs pushes content update the game frequently, roughly in 6 week cycle. Many numberous patch/'quick peek' are also updated in weekly basis. The devs publish news update instead of empty words (looking at you Tripwire Interactive).The thing is, right now the game lacks content, once you pass initial stage there's really little you can do. Besides the game is buggy, too. You will be met with some gamebreaking bug in hourly basis.At current state I can't really recommend it. But this game is really shaping up. Looking forward to it.

You Choose, your there, you quickly start building up your materials, then build some tools for your Hearthlings to use to craft many different items and entities.  i must say, this game fills smooth simplistic graphics, giving the game a relaxing and casual feel while still throwing in some combat to liven things up a bit.  Then and AMAZING sound track to really top it off.  at the time of this review i have about 150 hours on the game, and they are all well spent.  i would give this game 9/10   "

								Let's start with the bad points: - Bugs- Bugs- Bugs- Bugs - ∞ Endless bugs - Workers are too dumb to even build a wall or stairs - Menu sometimes just disappears; pro: funny to see your villagers getting slaughtered because you can't command your Warriors without it- You sit there, Pause the game and try to come up with an epic Building for about 1-2 hours. When you're done and proud of what you have done with 2 hours of your life and tell them nice workers to build it, they go there, look at it, set the first block and never ever ever ever ever ever touch it again. So there you're sitting and trying to get them to build it. But NOPE. They won't do it. Nice... I even played with the thought to report some bugs but... do the guys and girls who make this game, ever play it? - More BUGSSo why did I give a ""Thumbs Up""? - I got the game a long time ago, so when I played it the first time, it was not really buggy and fun to play- I like the idea of the game, to manage a little village with a little minecraft in it- Even if I know that nothing really changes in the game and it gets even more bugs every time I play it, I still play it once in a while for abt 1-2 hours just to rage quit- I don't believe in god, but I still believe that a day will come when this game will have lesser bugs - I like the design, artwork and the style of the game- They said there will be a Multiplayer some day, building epic villages with epic buildings with your epic friends with hopefully no epic bugsSOOOOOOOOO if this game has a -80% off, buy it. If not and you're not a sadist, don't buy it.  "

								I have played this game off and on for about 6 months and can honestly recommend the game. It is still in development, but the developers are extremely engaged and regularly release updates with bug fixes, new content, etc. The core of the game is solid and offers significant room for customization of the buildings within your town. At present, there are bugs, but this is expected. What is promising is that many of the bugs I have observed over the course of the past 6 months, have been taken care of. Do new bugs pop up when new content is released? Of course. However, they are typically resolved within a month, at most, of the new content's release.The game itself is primarily a city builder with random raids of goblins, undead, etc thrown in to keep the game play interesting and varied. The combat system is a bit wonky at present, but has been steadily improving over time which is a good indication of future improvements to come.Resource gathering has become rather staightforward and it is relatively easy to keep your villagers gathering what you want them to. It does require a bit of micromanagement as there is not a way to automate their gathering behavior at present (e.g. mine when copper is below 20 in storage, gather wood when inventory is below 15, etc). Once the resources are gathered, though, the tradesmen can be completely automated to maintain inventory levels of the items you wish to produce (e.g. set the Blacksmith to maintain 5 swords in inventory, etc)In sum, despite the bugs that I have experienced and room for future improvement, I would highly recommend this game. It has vast potential, a very active development team that is engaged with the community, and is generally enjoyable to play.			"

								I've been following this game since it's Kickstarter days and am very pleased with the progress it has made thusfar. Stonehearth is a sandboxish city builder, simulation game with added rpg like elements. Whether you just want to build your dream village, fight off incoming invaders, or dig the deepest mine, this game has it all. Designing buildings has never been easier and allows for many possibilties and custimizations and your hearthlings will automatically build what you design for them. The profession system gives you various choices to decide which directions you want your little town.Radiant Entertainment are some of the most community driven developers I have ever come across. They are constantly livestreaming the game development and intereacting with the community on the forums. As this game  has a tendency of having some (often hilarious) bugs here and there as any Alpha game does, the team is very quick at releasing patch versions to adress these kind of errors.Modding is another core component in this game. Being new to moding myself, it is amazing to see how easy it is to mod the game, even in this early state, and should get much easier as the game develops. There is already a nice variety of community made mods available on the stonehearth forums.All in all I definitly recomend this to anyone who loves city builders, rpgs and sandbox games.  If you are a hardcore Dwarf Fortress gamer, I suggest you give Stonehearth a try. With the progress Radiant has made so far, I am definitly excited to see what they have in store for multiplayer and the other features they want to add to this wonderful game!~Avairian			"

								Early Access Review: (Review might change over updates so be wary)When I first saw this game it's concepts and looks instantly reminded me of the game called Trove (no advertisment induced). The charming graphics and animations alone make this game so good but the real deal comes with building.The start:- You start the game by picking 2 races: The Raya and the Ascendancy. Both races differ a lot.- The Ascendancy starts off with the initial job Carpenter: The man who does miracles with wood. They are also the better farmers to play with.- The Raya start with the initial job potter: the mastermind of clay. But here's the catch. The carpenter can craft the wooden sword right away to promote a settler to a footman so you can fend off enemies early on while the potter cannot. So starting with the raya first is harder for newbies.After you picked your race you have to set the biome. There's one homeland for each race. Choosing the opposite homeland makes no real difference whatsoever. Both have wood and stone to start with. Only the wood/stone/clay ratio is different. Note that you can farm on both grassland and plains.After choosing the biome you get the chance to edit your starting people. You can rename them and reroll the entirety for random stats. Also you can but some starting items from you 150g pool.At the end but not least you only have to set your difficulty: Peaceful, Normal and Hard mode. I think I don't have to explain the differences here do I? ;DFinally you set your starting point on a RGN map you can (gladly) re-roll to get better chances of the ideal settling spot.The gameplay:The gameplay might seem a bit too much at first (and even I did not know anything at the start... like jon snow) and I was confused by a lot but after I experimented a bit around I got the grip of it.NOTE TO RADIANT: We need a tutorial asap! (Now bacvk to the review)The starting goal is simple: Harvest some ressources to build workstations for your carpenter/potter. After that get some crates/boxes/stockpiles to gather the harvested ressources. And now you got everything you need to build your own buildings.The graphics:- Trove and Minecraft had a baby and this is the result: 3D-blockapolypse and I love it.>> I am currently still testing things and such and I am pretty fatigued atm. I gonna update this review over the next days <<My verdict (for now): 7/10 Good game to pass time and cool off from stress.The game is early access but it's worth the money trust me. More worth than No man's sky :'DThe content is small but the creativity is endles (see screenshots and artwork).If you like to play block-games and minecraft and love the trove-artstyle than this game is your game.Sincerely, Khillian R.

								What it has so far is good. Solid core game aspects, and random generated Quests and Map. It still is missing quite a lot of the bulk stuff.What in my opinion they need to do is:Add more jobs.* (like 5-6 more) *note: I did read the roadmap content.Fix the combat system.* UI restrictions - Orders to Guard(and eat while guarding), Patrol routes, Sentry zones.Fix the lighting.* Make it so spans farther on fire braziers and other forms of light.Fix some of the sound skips.*More building material/items to craft.*More drops from mobs.* Also more rare items.Adding a more permanent way to buy/sell goods* Like sending caravans and stuff. Being able to use the gold for something.* Right now I have like 12k gold and nothing to spend it on.I recommend this game to anyone who likes building towns but not for those who build in like Minecraft. I like the sitting back and managing it waiting for the next attack or something to make me hop up from my chair, then overpowering them. I will not rate this game because it is still small compaired to other games. Also I don't very much like Early Access Games, but I still support them because I know how hard it is to build something... Hah, see what I did there?			"

								This game is very addictive. It has the micro-management of a city building sim, but it's not on such a grand scale. However, it's kind of better, you get to know your village/town pretty well and you start to remember the names of who does what job and what they look like. It's great to just expand and grow out and you have the incentive of gaining new villagers through daily reports as you increase your net worth. Increasing the size of your population provokes attacks by increasingly difficult enemies, so you have to manage forces in to bands and promote footmen to knights or bowmen etc. The military system is enjoyable in that it allows the game to merge in to a military sim/strategy genre as well. I'm glad to see this game is doing well and that the developer is supporting it.Note, one warning: Bugs... Although this game is in early access, so I'll cut it some slack. I'm having a few bugs, e.g. soldiers not listening to commands, multiple glitches in custom building system, hearthlings not collecting loot and the inability to remove certain structures half way through building them.

								I cant really recommend this game since its so far from finished. But i've had so much fun with it i cant give it a ""thumbs down"" either.Its a colony building game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. You designate the little people to be farmers or blacksmiths or whatever, designate a building here and a building there and, whenever they get around to it, they'll build it & live in it. Some of the fun details are that while the game has prefab buildings, you dont have to use them, you can opt to design your own instead. And if you come up with a good design you can save it to use again later. Eventually you'll be able to share your designs & others can use them in their colonies, which will be cool, but its not in yet.Theres a lot thats not in yet, if you read the design goals, the devs have a LOT in mind for this game. I'll be amazed if they can do half of it. But they keep working on it very steadily. Ive been following it for a long while now & updates & new features have always come in on a regular basis. The devs are very connected to the player community & it shows. Its certainly not another one of those ""grab the money & run"" fly-by-nights we've seen so many times on early access. These guys are serious about wanting to make a good game.If you like to use early access games to observe the game development process, this is a great game for that right now.  If you want it to, the game is happy to show you the nuts & bolts of exactly whats going wrong inside the AI's little brain when it gets stuck on a lamp post or whatever. And if you post a bug report, the devs will almost certainly have a fix in the next patch.However if youre the type who gets upset when you find yourself beta testing a game you paid for, perhaps skip this one for now... but keep an eye open for it, if/when it goes gold its gonna be really good!

Yes it has bugs, (some quiet funny/EA) but it is very playable and will drain your hours away. The dev's are very communicative. Tom even streams every Tues and Thrusday with the community and listen to your input. Well all of Team Radiant listen to the community.  They have well rounded road map too.PRO- Great city-building/RPG- Fun world- 10x better then most building games (and its EA)- Frequent updates, good developer communication- Easy going graphics (especially on low end machines)- Steady progressionCON- Villager professions not alot of them yet (part of the progress)- A.I. frustrations- Bugs here and there- Playing on story mode (no real story yet) can be difficult- Drains Time :) Little about how the game worksYou start off picking your location. Get a handful of villager (random gen - could get all females/males) with campfire and banner.  Beginning by getting mats (wood and stone) placing your stockpile for them to place. You promote for a Carpentar and hunter to get food going. Need to keep those villagers fed. Then to the Farmer to mass the food production. As your handling this you have your workers building houses, from scatch (or blueprint), placing beds (for them to sleep) and other items of decor. If in story mode, the goblins with attempt to bribe you or get you raided. Here comes your first footman. As time goes and and your life has drained away you will have walls up with footman patrolling keeping those pesky goblins and undead in check. Your village will be growing, your workers mining and working, your craftman crafting and your village having life. Quite a site to see.If your not into building villages, You can always go to peacful mode and build what you want. (I got a mages tower built floating in the air) But you can build almost what you want. As long as the villagers can reach it and build it. Still must keep them fed and have a place to sleep. But not much there but imagination.			"

								An awesome game.  Too bad they've had an unfixed construction bug for over a year that makes it unplayable.  A big part of the game is building structures.  There is a bug in the game that causes your workers to abandon construction if certain events happen - such as an attack on your town that causes you to recall them to safe points.  Afterwards, there is no way to get them to resume construction - and also no way to remove the unfinished structure.  I really like this game, but it just doesn't work.  Searching on the web, I see that this bug has been present for over a year. Alpha or not, it should be fixed by now.			"

								I know there are some negative reviews about this game, but I feel people aren't giving this game its due. Please remember it's in Alpaha still. Considering that, it is still amazing. Much of the work has gone into The Ascendancy(SP?). You start with 7 hearthlings in your group to found your new home. To gain more you must meet set amounts in food, morale, and net worth. Each of these can be done easily enough. You generaly meet morale unless you just don't do anythng for your hearthlings, like building beds to sleep in or chairs and tables for them to eat at or growing them at food. Food can be attained right away from berry bushes until you can make a farmer's hoe to promote a hearthling to farmer to grow food yourself. And net worth comes from building things like a shared sleeping quarters, dining hall, roads, or designing your own buildings. On day ten you'll be approached by a royal herald who will give you a quest to become a township. If you complete this quest you get tier 2 building materials.This game has entertained me for almost 200 hours already. My friends and I have to take turns using my PC just to play Stonehearth. At this time No Man's Sky is coming in second place to this game. We enjoy this so much.Many of the featurs of this game are unique. I have never played a game that allows me to manage, but not micro-manage. I give general commanda and the hearthlings live them out. It's a simulation game for a village. You build the village/town, but the hearthlings do it in their own way. You also have footmen/knights/archers/clerics to defend you town. Their are craftsmen of all sorts. It's an intricate system.Please get in on the ground floor and watch this game grow. This game will be huge, and it will be such an amazing release one of these days. Trust me.			"

CURRENTLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GENERAL GAMING. If you wish to help beta test this game, then I HIGHLY recommend it, because it has an incredible amount of potential and I want it to succeed and prosper. We need to help these devs do this by giving feedback and support.Completed my beta testing sessions on this game. Patience ran out (nothing personal...full time worker here lol). Here is the list of current bugs and frustrations I have run across.1. Excessive random encounters that make everything extremely difficult after around the 10th - 15th day. I just finished a session where, between game day 7 and 14, I was encountered by:-12 wolves-4 thieves-a goblin raiding party-4 zombies/skeletons (While I had 4 goblins raiding, thus citizens started dying left and right)-2 varnus things-a shiteload of those wood/stone gremlin thingsThis was on ""Normal"" mode, and in my opinion, this difficulty curve/cliff is a gamebreaker. It reduces the game from enjoyable cute fun, to frustration where I'm yelling at my screen ""Give me a god damned CHANCE!"" If the game is going to be enjoyable, I suggest deep, dynamic difficulty so players can modify the game to suit how they play. I'm a slow, meticulous gamer when it comes to games like these. I don't have time to ultra-micromanage everything, especially with very clunky unit management and controls. It's too difficult!2. Building anything is a hit-or-miss kind of experience. There are MANY bugs you'll encounter when trying to build anything larger than a small shack. Citizens giving up on buildings at random Not being able to delete walls at will. Only way to do this is the undo button, and that randomly stops working. So, essentially, if you build a wall that you don't like, or it's interfering with something, tough luck if it wasn't the most recent action you did. Frustrating. Not being able to build building parts in any order. Example: If you try to build too much of the interior before building the roof, you basically can't build a roof and your building is screwed. (See the above point) Custom walls seem to have a limited length. Doesn't make sense.3. Clunkiness of UI, and general controls.  A lot of menus, especially crafting menus, pull up tediously, and are delayed.  Moving troops around requires too many actions, which are also clunky. UI randomly disappears and even F5 doesn't bring it back up Too much clicking around!Everything else other than the above listed is going great. This game is one of my favourites ever, despite being incomplete, and I seriously hope the devs don't get lazy with it. That doesn't seem to be the case right now, because I'm constantly seeing bugfixes and updates. Support these guys! And one last request, when the game is released: Full mod support and API, so the community can grow the game, as well.Keep up the good work; I want to see this game surpass Minecraft in playability some day. I mean, imagine that...Going first-person and playing this game like you would minecraft, but you also have a dynamic town that NPCs build. You can go from first-person, to town management mode (Current setup). Isn't that something everyone has always wanted? Keep that one in mind. I'll return to testing at the Alpha 18 opt-in.			"

								One word: WOW! I love these types of games where you can manage a town/city and watch it grow it from the ground up. This game has limitless posibilities and it is a real time passer. My first two hours of game play was amazing and I was on the edge of my seat. There are a lot of issues that I have run into that I have posting about. One thing I would change about this game is the world size. I think it is too small and would really like to see an option to re-size worlds. I cant wait to see what this game has in store in the future.			"

								Years ago, I had an enjoyable but brief relationship with Dwarf Fortress.  I really appreciated the randomly generated world, scenarios, and the continuously evolving gameplay, but my small lizard brain couldn't accept the ascii graphics.  I tried some graphical mods, but ultimately, Dwarf Fortress and I went our separate ways.  (I'm sorry Dwarf Fortress, it wasn't the size of your plump helmet that was the problem, it was me.)You're probably like, ""Dude, stop talking about Dwarf Fortress. This is Stonehearth"", and you're right, I shouldn't bring up past relationships, but Stonehearth scratches the same itch that kept me interested in playing Dwarf Fortress, and it looks perfectly adorable on top of it all.  Stonehearth isn't as in depth as Dwarf Fortress, but it is most definitely a Dwarf Fortress-like.  If you're like me, and you enjoyed Dwarf Fortress, but maybe the graphics bothered you or maybe you're looking for Dwarf Fortress Lite, Stonehearth may be worth buying.Keep in mind that this is an early access game, gameplay mechanics could change, things will break, and are broken in the game.  Consider your purchase as an investment in an evolving product, and the dev team! "

								I was a little weary at first buying this game awhile back. While it took be awhile to learn to customize my own building. One of the best little village games I have! I love everything about this game, customizing the parts of your building, and building little workshops for my villagers. The Rayya's Children I played on the latest setting, its really cool with the potter and clay buildings. There are a few bugs in the game, like villagers getting stuck but they eventually get out and are fine. I used to have a bug with the UI disappearing, but it was fixed, so I'm happy about that.I hope they can add more decorations and random AI generated towns you can visit as well as enemy villages, I think that would be cool! Also have more animals, it'd be nice to make stables, pastures and a farm for different farm related animals! :) Other than that, its a great game you will most likely keep coming back to play!!			"

								Stonehearth is an amazing city-builder, simulation game. It mixes styles of god games, directing your hearthlings with building commands and designs, with RPG, leveling your hearthlings up as you go and even real-time fighting with attacks and defenses based on their weapons.It certainly has a long way to go; bugs abound, and feature-wise the game only lasts for around 30 game days before it's repetitive, but it has tons of potential from here, and based on how far it's come and the staff behind the game, I can say that the game will only be getting better from here.

								Stonehearth is one of those little games that make you feel like you're playing a SNES style RPG but in fact you're building the towns in said RPG and you get to see how the beginning was in said town. The goblin raids that went through your little village when you were nothing but a small team of builders trying to build up their first mess hall and houses for your people. How you were so helpless then and then near you complete your village and are happy with it you are very proud of it. The amount of time you spend and how much love and care you spent with each little villager with the classes and how you can see them work hard on any new structure you build from scratch. The game is beautiful for a voxel game with the cell shading and voxel enviroment. Now the game takes every block from the world. Terraforming is actually pretty pleasing in this game, instead of games in which terraforming is make or break, this game makes it realatively pleasing in which i never saw any ugly in doing so. If you have the money and are interested in buying this game, do so, you'll love it if you're into the micromanaging/ builder genre. I personally bought the game when it was $30 and was on a kickstarter. This was in Alpha 7, it was still buggy but they ironed it out and added much more content in the span of 3 months. Now, the game is still in Alpha, but neither the less I would buy it. It'll easily make you go a good 15 or so hours on your first town. Even if it's in Alpha, you still have a lot to do.			"

								In simple terms, the game is fun and worth it.All things considered, its an early access game, and we all know how those things can go. A quick pros vs. cons:PROS:- Good sound track- Challenging enemies- Easy to learn- Explorable land (treasures, enemy camps and farm animals can be found)- Many cool professions available for the citizens (each is unique and realistic)EXTRA (minor) PROS:- easy to loot- convenient tracker for citizens- fighters can be in their own seperate units (easy to navigate them)- can save and re-use building models (developer made buildings already available)- LADDERS* Can be extremely useful in debugging some builds and getting hearthlings unstuckCONS:- Lack of fighter categories (only 3 kinds + 1 kind of healer)- Several major bugs (Cizitens get stuck, buildings dont finish being built, scaffolding doesnt go away, CPU heavy when in windowed mode - Thankfully, they are not too frequent and are usually fixable with a quick restart)- Story is weak- No sign of actual friendly life visiting towns (besides dialogues)- Little motive to explore (if a friendly town was nearby to set up trade routes, id consider going FAR)With the cons, the game is still a solid 9/10 for how fun it is and for the price its offered at.As for the game itself, it is still being worked on and improved. As for now, the price point makes sense as there is still plenty of material to enjoy. I've played just over 30 hours and can definitely enjoy some more.			"

A Sandbox Strategy That DeliversStonehearth is a sandbox strategy game, set in a (light) fantasy setting, with town building, crafting, and a military campaign.What Is It Like?Take Dwarf Fortress. Tone down some of the rogue-like elements. Replace the esoteric production chains and mood  simulations with more accessible and managable alternatives. Add a charming 3D voxel art style with tons of character. Introduce some truly innovative mechanics, including the way hearthlings simulate building. Voila.Or, for readers that haven't had the privilege of learning how ""losing is fun"", we'll try a more popular game for comparison. Take Minecraft, pull it back to  a strategic level, give yourself hearthlings to manage, add in a bunch of depth with jobs and production chains, and smother it in buckets of charm. Welcome to Stonehearth.What Sets It Apart From Other Sandbox Strategies?Charming and effective 3D voxel art style.Deep production chains that don't dive off the deep end (ie: stocking a hospital in Dwarf Fortress).Promotes mixing form with function through a powerful and versatile building creator/editor.Engaging, visually appealing, and immersive construction simulation.Deep, yet accessible, statistics and job system with fun role-playing elements.Interactive military campaign that allows the player to engage in diplomacy or war.Intelligent user-interface design maintains accessibility even in areas of the game with more complex mechanics.The Bottom LineI am recommending Stonehearth not only because it is already a successful sandbox strategy game in its own right, with truly innovative mechanics and an on-point blend of strategic depth and accessible fun, but because the small team at Radiant Entertainment have proven their exceptionalism. Since backing Stonehearth on Kickstarter I have enjoyed weekly updates, steady content addition that is continuously polished, and interactivity with multiple team members on their community forums. These guys care about making a great game, and it truly shows.Stonehearth is a game that is worth your money and time right now, as of Update 10.x, and one that will only improve in value as those updates continue rolling in.

								This game sorely lacks key features like demolishing buildings which is very frustrating in a game where the genre is ""City building"" granted its more like town building but that is besides the point.I find that, whenever i build something in this game i got to be very careful in what i do, for as i mentioned before i can not demolish. the building or designing process itself is very finnicky, i have encountered times when it would make the blueprint of the building, but the settler or ""Hearthlings"" wont build it at all, sometimes they build everything but the roof, i also cannot build 2 things at the same time, they will abandon the one i started building first and work on the one i just made, never to return to the previous.There was some work around i found on their forum to fix some of this, but it's so stupid that i would even have to resolve to doing 10 things, step by step so i can remove a house, which by the way did not even work.I also frequently get error windows or command windows whichever it is, telling me of errors, duh, this game needs alot of attention to bugs but most of all the building aspect as of right now, cause building things is why i got this.Other things are, that it has a very... cute style, it's very appealing to the eye, eye would say, anda very relaxing soundtrack.I want to love this game, and i do, but not as much as i believe it deserves right now, i recommend this game, but i also recommend you wait with buying it, atleast untill they fix the buildings, unless you are impatient like me.Im gonna keep watching for progress and i believe, that when this game is more developed, it's going to be amazing.Also right quick, i know this is early access, but these are ""KEY"" features, something that needs to be there from the start, preferably. also i do not care to debate on these matters, either you keep it extremely civil, which is a very hard thing for the general internet to do, or swallow your words, use your bile somewhere else.

								After watching the development of this game for some time before it came to steam I decided to splash out and buy it. I love building and simulation games theres just something that appeal to me about creating my own little world and watching it grow.  I love The Settlers, Banished, The Sims and other games like that. This game ticks the boxes for me.Its a great game with lots of potential and while it may look like a minecraft clone it most certainly isn't.  Whilst it still has a lot of bugs, which is to be expected in Alpha, it is still quite playable.  I found the worst bug was when i had too many hearthlings and they all started to just stand there and do nothing although if I shut the game down and restarted it, it fixed it for a while.  A great Dev team is what makes it a gem too. They actually listen to their community and implement updates and bug fixes on a regular basis.I hope that they continue to update and finish the game as so many early access games seem to get abandoned and it would be a shame if that happened to this game.If you want to support a game in early access then I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

								The one thing I must stress for those of you who are interested in this game is this: it is for all intents and purposes in early access. I know many of you have played early access games, and some of which were fully fleshed out games with minor bug fixes needed. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES. As well as the numerous ui, ai and graphical errors there seems to be about 10 hours of expansive entertaining gameplay, after which you are left with a feeling of ""what else can I really do"". Now thats not to say that the devs have abandoned this game, in fact the situation is quite the opposite; there exists online a roadmap layed out of all the updates and new features they wish to add on. However as it currently stands I cannot recommend this game AS A STANDALONE TITLE. It doesn't have enough content to merit the $25 price tag, that doesn't mean you shouldn't purchase it: it means you shouldn't purchase it for what it currently is. If you buy this game it will be a game you have to revist it again and again in hopes that the devs actually deliver. So for right now I say wait, follow this title, add it to your wishlist etc. but don't purchase it yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Very fun to play, almost zen-like.  The hearthlings are entertaining to watch as they go about doing their jobs.  A large part of the game play revolves around constructing facilities for your hearthlings to use, whether it be fields of carrot farms, large apartment complexes, intricate tunnel mines, imposing castle walls or simple homes for a peaceful village.   There are numerous jobs your hearthlings can learn, a basic research-tree allows players to explore new promotions each time you play the game.  It's currently not possible, or at least not easy, to have every job unlocked the first time you play it, so you will inevitably be tempted to start new towns to get the other jobs and try out new urban planning ideas.  It's very easy to get incredibly absorbed into the minutia, and obsess over the aethetics of your town.  Part of the fun is looking at what other people have built and getting inspired to construct your own version of real-world cities and towns.  Anyone who has an interest in architecture and interior design will easily become transfixed as this game has nearly an infinite possibilities that's only limited by your imagination.While your doing all this, the game does follow a very basic script of events that you'll need to prepare yourself for.  Mostly being attacked by goblin raiders and stray wolves that are mostly random, but builds up to a massive and inevitable showdown with Oggo's army of Orcs.  My largest complaint is that the Normal mode doesn't feel balanced because of this inevitable fight with Oggo's Army.The first time it happens, it can be quite a shock, as you've spent 10+ hours being completely consumed by the cute visuals and light-hearted game play, only to see your entire village basically swarmed by a massive army of Orcs who then ruthlessly slaughter all of your hearthlings (beating them to death with clubs).  The game does feature a ""Peaceful"" mode, ensuring a completely violence-free experience, but which also then negates the need to promote hearthings for combat-related jobs (Footman, Archer, Knight, Herbalist, Cleric).  However, it is a nice option to have.I don't just ""like"" this game... I love it.  I find the whole thing very endearing to play and would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

After a while all my citizens stop doing anything.I realize 4 of my people are stuck in the top floor of my new mansion.Realize I didn't add stairs or a way to get down.4 of my people starve to death.Rest of town gets depressed and stop working all togetherGoblin king asks for stuff. I decline.Goblin army attacks, my people start to defend then fall asleep on the ground.Entire town gets ransacked and people starve and die as I watch helplessly.10/10 would build mansion beast again.

								I want to review StoneHearth not Hearthstone StoneHearth now StoneHearth is a game that looks like Minecraft but plays completely different and is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played, let's start with the pros and move to the cons.Pro'sSo first off one of the best things about this game is the fact that you can sculpt and design your own civilization making this one of the best for role playing games yet one of the best Sim games.One of the coolest features of this game is that you can go ahead and build your own buildings from scratch and you can make your own Warriors and upgrade them using the crafting equipment you use you can fend off goblins and Invaders with your warriors and you can also trade with Traders and buy from Merchants that come to your town day and night.One of my favorite things to watch happen is my town progress and my citizens gain level's. You can even have people come to your town and reward you for killing off goblinsCon'sOne of the major issues with this game is the UI user interface it's extremely hard to work with, sometimes it glitches out and other times just completely shut's down and even makes you force shutdown the game.One of the things that also really irritates me is the constant lag that occurs that is unpreventable no matter how much you Tinker with the options internally and (externally, outside the game) you cannot fix the lag issues I personally have constant issues with completing buildings and helping my citizens survive from goblins invaders, because the lag is so horrendously bad.Now keep in mind this lag is so extremely hard to work around and it only starts when you progress into the game far enough. Errors will occur almost every single play-through and it really makes you wish that they had some sort of patch for people to work with instead they're going update by update.Thing's I want to see happenI wish that they would fix all performance issues and make it so your PC recognizes it as a game instead of a program.I want them to make an online multiplayer addition so you can play with AI or other players.I want them to make a campaign for story. Also add more action to the game so you can be full out assaulted and have to defend for like 5 minutes or longer.I want them to FIX something I did not mention above, which is when you ask a group of people to work on something new you can choose which citizens you wantr to work there so you have a spreadsheet. For example okay I want 3 citizens harvesting wood 7 citizens building a mansion and your guards to patrol in a certain pattern you choose.Also larger worlds, larger threats as you progress so it won't be a breeze to clear out 6 invaders with 1 guard(with a wooden sword)Other than that this game is FREAKING AWESOME. At it's current stage it's fantastic minus all the performance issues. 8.3/10			"

As a citybuilder/manegment game Stonehearth shows great promise and while it's a bit thin in its currect state (Alpha, so missing a lot of features/content) it's still pretty competent overall. Oddly, my favorite feature isn't the game itself, but the team behind it; Radiant. Those dudes have some of the best community outreach in the business and they are always putting out dev blog updates, keeping the content comming at a pretty good clip and letting you know what's on the horizon when they can't do that. It's cute, it's chirpy, it's got the foundation for a truly great town manager. I particularly love the ability to build custom buildings with relative ease, though style options are slightly limited, what with still being in development.There are a few Cons though; one, it's a slow game. Incredibly slow. Pace is apparently something on their list to work on, but as it is, I can only bear to play on fast and even then I feel like there should be a faster setting. There also aren't really any options for stockpile flow--the ability to have a particular stockpile pull from others, and it's one of the major things that's keeping Stonehearth from being truly great. This is also impacted by the speed (since your hearthlings have to walk AAAAALLL THE WAY to the stockpile, then ALLLL THE WAY back) which becomes more problematic as your town gets bigger. I imagine some of the problems I have will get resolved as the game works its way through Alpha, and I'll update this review as new things get added, problems arise, and good stuff crops up. If you're hard up for a city builder, I only see this one getting better over time. If you're a bit more skittish, that's fair; but keep at eye on this and I encourage you to give it a shot when it's more complete.			"

Early Access Review
								**As a forewarning, there are minor spoilers. There really isn't much of a storyline, but I go in depth as far as gameplay goes.**So I spent a good few hours on the game, getting a feel and really seeing what it has to offer. The fact that it is in alpha was a little worrysome, given how many games are labeled with early access and seem to die without much improvement or support. This game, so it seems, is different. It's a refreshing change, it's truly quite unique in multiple aspects ranging from gameplay to art and design. This game is most certainly sandbox in nature, but it actually carries a very strong similarity to Dwarf Fortress, and almost seems like a branched-off, reskinned version of it. I can only imagine the vast amount of direction and improvement this game has in store if only the developers remain diligent and active.To start.. As of the current build -524, you have the option of choosing a biome, starting location, and race. I haven't experimented heavily with these options; I've only had the pleasure of one play in which I haven't come all that far. That being said, once you choose your world, you then choose where in said world you will build your camp. Naturally, you'll want to choose an area with plenty of trees, wildlife, and minerals. Upon choosing, you're dumped off without much of a tutorial, which usually seems like an overwhelming experience, however.. This game is fairly straight foreward. After a few minutes, I quickly learned my way around the UI, the different tools, navigation, and issueing commands to my Hearthlings. Before long, the first raid on my settlement had taken progress. I immediately knew the general idea of what to do, click the large, red sword icon, right? It was as simple as that; my Hearthlings ran to a safe position as my assigned soldiers made short work of the beast. As of right now, the game doesn't seem to be too unforgiving. I am expecting that to change as I come further along and mine deeper into the ground.Graphically speaking, this game is very crisp and clean. There are a few annoyances which are more gameplay issues than graphics, but I'll get to those in a bit. The game has a bit of a minecraft appearance, but one with customer shaders and higher quality picture. Textures are almost non existant, but I can do without those, it simply works for this game. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of clutter, which can really turn into a big problem for games like this.In terms of bugs, this game definitely has its share, but it's to be expected. I feel confident that more and more bugs will be fixed as time continues, the support website seems very much alive with devs attempting to help those who experience issues. A few bugs I've personally come across include goblins exploding into sunlight instead of fighting my soldiers, a Hearthling that never wakes up from his sleep, and not being to change to a specific class despite having met all requirements. Obviously two of these can be considered game breaking, however I'm not letting it kill my opinion of this game. Save often is the best fix for most problems.As for one final in-depth review, this game is, as I mentioned, like a replica of Dward Fortress, though with FAR less features. I suspect this game is very heavily influenced by Dwarf Fortress. You have the ability to custom-build structures, or choose from a preset list. You can place said structures where ever they fit. You can alter the environment by taking down trees, creating mines, etc. As you create mines, it really opens up many different possibilities for construction ideas. Perhaps an underground fortress? All in all, in the short amount of time that I've played this game, I'm enjoying it a lot. If they can implement some more features or similarities from DF such as complex contraptions, many more monsters and biomes, etc, I'll be thrilled. Perhaps even a mode to take complete control of a single, hero-like individual to explore the lands, loot, plunder dungeons, and seek bounties, much like DF. I might be going a little far comparing the two, but regardless, the game can (hopefully) only improve from here.			"

								I enjoyed this game because of the peaceful gameplay and relaxation as well as the skeleton and orc attacks. The only problem or dislike I had about the game was the weird bugs that crashed the game and I lost so much progress. But finally it has gotten out of steamgreenlight so I have faith that it will become something much greater, and the bugs will disappear. But for now just remember to turn that auto save on and save every 5 minutes.			"

								One of the most committed teams to devlopment and interaction with the community, radiant have really lived up to their kickstarter pledges and have been making great progress, the potential of this game is tremendous, if you got some spare cash lying about, choose to invest in this team, its going to be a blast!  Alpha development doesnt have a huge amount of playability but each new release gives you an extra couple of hours of testing new additions to the engine, its a cute art style and feels quite rewarding when you accomplish something.

								I really want to like this game.  It's a lot of fun until you reach the point where your hearthlings will not finish building your buildings.  After an exhaustive search of the internet it seems to be a repetitive, long standing issue. It seems to be something that has been unaddressed for about a year.  It is very frustrating.Buy the game on sale or wait until full release.			"

								I have a lot of games in my steam library but this is the one I keep coming back to. This is the kind of game I can lose myself in, starting a play session, getting really focused on building and defending my town, and then I look at my clock and 6 hours have somehow gone by. The latest focus on combat and hardmode have brought a much more intense feeling to the game. Enemies can catch you offguard if you don't think about all angles you need to defend, and the new RPG classes have added a lot of depth to the combat side of the game. As far as developing your town/fort/city-whatever goes I becom a kid again, playing with lego.This is in alpha, so there are still a lot of glitches, missing features, and polish that is getting fixed/added. Building elaborate structures is usually very difficult especially getting the hearthlings to construct them. You can cheat structures in with console commands, but hopefully some day you won't ever need to use commands again and the little guys will be able to make anything you want.One of the best things about this game is it's devs. They are very community focused and they actually stream on twitch coding and art sessions three times a week. They aren't very active on the steam community hub, but on their own website's discourse they are very active.I really recommend this game even in it's current alpha state. Very enjoyable building game with some decent RTS RPG style gameplay.			"

								UPDATE AS OF 4/30/2016- This game has progressed quite a bit in the months since I purchased it. I find it easier to play with less bugs. I have looked forward to getting into it. Still see my recommendations below however I have been able to play well past 30 minutes with no bugs or crashes and reasons to restart. Follow this one for sure. This game is going to be awesome. I mean it is awesome now. I enjoyed playing it. I bought this because of reviews and a few videos I watched featuring gameplay and just maybe I received a lil christmas bonus work threw my way so why not I said. All the reviews and videos said that this is an alpha game, expect bugs, blah blah blah. I knew this going in but they talked it up so much I couldn't resist. That being said....This is an Alpha game and I have not been able to play past 30 minutes, so far, without a bug popping up to make me start over. LOL.Nothing that crashes the game but one of my little people with glitch, I placed a building too close to another and they just stop building, etc....All in all I like it, I'll play it some more, even with the bugs but if you didn't get a little holiday bonus money or it's not on sale, or you're just short on cash, I suggest waiting for a sale and whenver you find yourself with some extra $ you want to throw at something you've been following.Follow this game though. I just can't bring myself to thumb down although this is one of those occasions to which I wish they had a neutral thumb, if that's a thing, where I can infer that this game is fun, will be good, but just not developed enough where I'd recommend another buying it....unless you fall in the same category I did...steam sell, christmas bonus, just enough feedback I thought I'd give it a try.Have Fun			"

								First real review I've ever given on Steam so here goes.I've followed this game for more than 2 years now and would definitely recommend buying it if you are considering to do so.The game itself is not yet finished but has a quite a lot of content. The main reason I would recommend it however are the devs behind the game. They do weekly development streams and are very active on their forums. Its fantastic to see the game take shape and even have some ideas you had implemented in the game. Updates on this game are very frequent and I have no doubt that this game will become something great. You can't compare it to the game I first bought 2 years ago.But if you have a problem that it is not a fully finished game yet you might not want to buy it as it is somewhat buggy at times and not all custom made buildings will be build, aswell as some performance issues that arise at 25+ hearthlings.

								Stonehearth is a brilliant game considering that it is an early alpha. If you've ever play'd a game called 'RimWorld' It's much like that. Stonehearth is like a village management game, you gain a new civ every night [If you reach the days goal E.g. Enough wealth, Happiness & Food] This goal is meant to get harder as the game goes on, but it isn't really that hard to reach.Con's-The building in Stonehearth could use some improvements and I'm sure the developers will make this mechanic better. Once you place a building it cannot be removed.-You are not able to build easily inside E.g. In a cave/ Mountain.-When the goblins start to raid, it seems like they never stop coming night after night. They could use tuning down [Spawning less]Pro's-So far I have experienced very little lag, to fix this all I did was re-load the game.-There're soo many options for the civ's. For example you can appoint them different jobs such as Warrior, Cook, Farmer, Trapper... Each with a new set of uniform & tools.-Very attractive game. Although the graphics are not Arma 3 standard, it doesn't need to be - the games graphics suit the game, the blocks have near enough a plain texture and puts less strain on your PC. -When your village does get attacked, It's not like a few games out there, where you're entire village would get destroyed Age Of Empires, I'm looking at you here.I've stopped playing StoneHearth for now, not because It's a bad game but because I'm waiting for more items to be implemented into the game.

								This is a review for Alpha 16 This game is  REALLY GOOD Pros1- Addictive. This game if you can run it (i have an asus M32bf with a gtx 770 and i can run this at 80/130 frames) is really addictive since you can make a large sprawling city after about 2-3 hours of gameplay OR you can make like a mining civilization that lives in caves.2- Engaging. If you like micromanaging, if you like Donald Trump wall building, This game is for you3- Refreshing. Stonehearth is a game like no other, it combines City-building/Sandbox/Survival genres into this perfect storm of New-game feel.4- A E S T H E T I C, This game has GOOD pixel graphics, and because of this, it makes it very simple to pick up if you are used to Medium-Long learning curves to games.""Cons""Ok this game is in alpha, so what, if you are anything like me, a simple bug or two is not gonna bother me, but if you are annoyed by a villager not doing what you want, then buy this game later when it's a bit more stable.2- Pricey, if you don't have disposable income like me, don't bother yet, try and wait for a steam sale.Guys and Gals, this is who inspired me to buy this. (NOTE) This is hardmode gameplay but there is a normal mode and a peacefull sandbox mode.

Early Access Review
								First Steam review here, so go easy on me please!I had been following Stonehearth since its Kickstarter campaign back in 2013, and I finally bit the bullet back in August.  Since then I have enjoyed (almost) every minute of gameplay.  As many reviewers have noted, this is really a niche game, and if you are into a slow-paced city building sim with some RPG and RTS stuff mixed in, this is the game for you.  For me, I love setting up my little town so that it is self-sustaining, and then sitting back and watching.  Seeing the little Hearthlings running around, farming, shepherding, and cooking, all the while getting hungry and eating, and eventually relaxing by the fire and sleeping, it is really quite pretty to see.  Let me detail some pros and cons as I see it:Pros:+Voxel Based graphical style+Custom Buidling Designer+City Building and strategy combined+Playable! (can't say this for all EA games)+Crafting system+Frequent Updates+Easy to learn+Game CommunityTo explain some of those, lets start with ""playable.""  You can install the game, launch it, and play away.  It works, and you can easily lose a couple of hours right off the bat.  Next, the custom building designer.  Is it perfect: no.  Can you make any building you can imagine: not yet.  But unless you are really trying to build an abstract, strange angled, multi-story building, chances are you can build it.  The crafting system is very nice, particularly the interaction between the crafters.  You start the game with a carpenter.  He/she can make basic furniture, building elements (like doors and windows), and a few other things.  He/she also makes some tools, like a farmers hoe to allow a farmer to be promoted, a mason's chisel for a stoneworker, a weaver's spindle, etc.  Once you promote another Hearthling to a new position, more crafting elements are unlocked.  For example, by him/herself, a carpenter can make a basic bed.  Promote a weaver, spin some thread, and a high leveled carpenter can make a fancy bed, with bonuses for the Hearthlings who sleep in it.The final pro I listed which I want to detail is the game community.  Stonehearth has a fairly active community over on their forums, and everyone there is kind and helpful.  Members on the forum do their best to help each other out, and support is quick.  When I first joined the forum, I was greeted by a moderator after my first post, and recived quick help when I had an issue.  That made me want to spend time there, and as I became more familiar in the game, I started to help people out myself.  The developers are very active on the forums too!  They will help with game issues like crashes, keep you updated on bug fixes, and join in the many discussions about the game and where it should go.  They also stream development sessions 3 times a week, where you get to see work on the game live!Cons:-Bugs, you will encounter bugs!-Crashing can happen-Saves are not always compatible between versions-Game is not feature complete-Can't build everything-Hardware intensiveTo explain the cons: the game has bugs.  If you were not expecting that, I suggest you review what Early Access is.  That being said, the developers are amazingly responsive to fixing them, especially if they are game breaking.  Patches are frequent (sometimes too frequent), and they can break save compatibility.  Fortunately, they have 2 branches of updates on Steam, so if you do not like frequent updates, you can stick to a ""stable"" branch, and not deal with the frequent develop releases.  Crashing can (and likely will at one point) happen.  Many times it is due to driver issues, but also due to anti-virus programs.  As the games AI is based in an embedded chrome browser, programs that add extensions to chrome can cause havoc.Final con, the game is not feature complete.  You cannot build every possible structure, there are many classes/professions that are not availible, and the game is not fully optimized.  I have played games where Stonehearth has used as much as 9 GB of RAM!  While the usage has dropped significantly in the latest patches, it is still not perfect, and honestly higher than I feel it should be.So, should you buy this game?  I will answer with a qualified Maybe.  If citybuilding, simulation, strategy games are your thing, then this is an awesome game.  If you want a say in how the game is developed, than take the plunge.  If you like being a part of an active community that is passionate about the game, then hop aboard.  However, if you want a bug-free, fully optimized, feature complete game, then this is not for you (yet).  The game is in alpha, features are in active development, but it isn't quite there yet.			"

								This has been one of the best games I've seen considering it's early access AND alpha. I play this all the time, and I really look forward to the updates. I highly suggest it to anybody who is bored, semi-bored, or not bored. Anybody. It entertains me from it's awesome combat sytem all the way to it's often hilarious item captions. You can fight goblins, zombies, stone golems, entlings, and more! Also, Stonehearth is heavily moddable. I specifically include that there are so many interesting mods out there to use. And although I've never made a Stonehearth mod, I'm sure with a little bit of understanding that its much easier than making mods for most other games. I recieved this game as a Chistmas gift in 2015 and I was so incredibly excited. I had every right to be. So to anyone reading reviews to determine if they want a cool, epic new game, Stonehearth is perfect.			"

								This is a very cute, carefree and soothing building/managing a town kinda game. Think about it as Banished in casual mode, your whole town won't be wiped out by a deadly plague or cruel nature, just simple attacks from goblins, so if you enjoy more building than surviving through series of rage, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game a lot more. You get to control these villagers called Heathlings, assign them classes, see them working it through and even advancing to other classes. (which are not complete yet since it's still an early access, many classes are still ???) You get to craft many furnitures, design your buildings, decorate it as well. (To add to this, the furnitures are also very cute♥) If you can look over the early access and horrid perfomance issue that they're continuously fixing, (I have to use the word horrid, I have to restart my PC everytime I'm done with this game and it lags like crazy after a few days ingame which is still a common issue atm.) it's a relaxing fun game nontheless.

								Wow! what can i say about this game, or more like what can't I say. I jumped into this game at alpha 2. Not as far back as others, but right around the begining and man have I loved the ride. This game is not a minecraft clone nor is it ""stealing"" hearthstones name. It is a wonderful sandbox city builder with rpg elements to it. The devs are amazing and stream every week allowing the community to be involved and have input into the game. Yes there are lot of bugs right now and yes its fustrating at times, but this is an early access game, this is still in development and its still amazing. My only regret is not finding about it sooner and because of that I didnt get to back the kickstarter, but i have been with the game since. The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down, it lets you be as creative as you can get and challenges you at times. The devs allow mods to be made so if there isn't something in the game you want, you can add it! Over all the game art is cute, the music is beautiful and the game has so much more to give!  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE: bugs, works in progress, unfinished games, more content to be added THEN DON'T GET IT AT THIS TIME!! no one is forcing you to buy it now, wait if you want until more things are in the game. DON'T buy it and then complaine about the bugs and problems... Its EARLY ACCESS for a reason. I love this game and I recomend it to anyone. I also recomend taking a look at the discorse. The community is wonderful, you can get the answers and news you want to know and you can give suggestions that the devs will see and could add into the game.			"

First and foremost you need to understand that Stonehearth is currently in ALPHA. This means there will be bugs, unoptimized code, and a range of other things that appear in alpha level content.Although Stonehearth isn't a revolutionary game, it is still very enjoyable. Even though I’ve only owned the game since Alpha 9, I have spent enough time in the game to get a good feel for the gameplay, features, and overall value of the game. At this point in development I can recommend the game for those looking for a fun game, but aren’t afraid to test out builds, and find bugs. In the games current state your goal is to not kill all your hearthlings. When starting the game you are given virtually nothing to survive other than a tool to make a carpenter and a trapper. From there your job is to craft tools, give hearthlings jobs, and start to grow a tiny civilization. If you are playing on the Peaceful game mode then you really don’t have anything to worry about beyond keeping your hearthlings well fed. The other game mode at this time is Normal, and includes some nice goblins for you to fight with. The goblins don’t make the game overly difficult at this time and really just add another degree of play. Personally I enjoy playing Normal since it can be somewhat boring playing on peaceful mode. As of Alpha 10 the goblins haven’t been in the game very long. They do a nice job of adding more gameplay options though. With the inclusion of goblins you will need to take defense into consideration while building. They will not attack you immediately upon starting a game, but they do increase in difficulty as you grow stronger. One of the strongest points this game has is the robust building mechanic. You can build whatever structures you can imagine, as long as it’s within the boundaries of tiny blocks. The build mode is very simple to use and really help you personalize it to your taste. When you get a structure created you can even save it to use at any time after that. It’s a really nice feature since you don’t have to worry about designing each building every time you need it. The game also allows you to edit the building before placing it, giving you a chance to personalize each one without the need to recreate it from scratch. The only issue I have found when designing the buildings you can’t add in items like desks, beds, chairs, or other things of that nature without having them created and sitting in your stockpile. Luckily you just need 1 on hand to add them into the building blueprint. At this time the hearthlings don’t really have traits, but they do have stats. The stats are things like speed, courage, diligence, etc. and can affect how well a hearthling does his/her given job. As development continues I am sure we will see more stats, traits, and other features added to the individual hearthlings. That is really just a rundown of the main features the game has at this time. If you are interested in learning more about the game feel free to join us over at the Stonehearth.net forums. We always have some discussion going about the game, and keep up with all the little bugs in need of squashing. You can also find my pros/cons breakdown below.   PROS- Music- Art style- Crafting system- Builing/Blueprint system is awesome- Fun factor-Replayability-Great development teamCONS- Occasional building issues- LUA issues(LUA hits 100% causing game to lag and freeze)- Ocassional errors while playing- Lighting/Shadow issues The only con that I’ve found to really be a hindrance is the LUA problem the game runs into. You can see the game resources in real time while playing via a small bar on the bottom right of the game client. Once the LUA usage hits 100% the game will lag completely out. This is a known issue and will hopefully be addressed soon.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a game about building a small town, with the help of a group of 'hearthlings' who build, mine, farm and craft their way to victory (sometimes) over ever-stronger groups of enemies. You have an amazing amount of control over the appearance of your town, and you can custom build every house, road and wall. There are a variety of decorations and tools to place around your village, and there are two main storylines to follow (if you aren't playing on peaceful) - fighting the enemies, and becoming a township. You also get to pick one of two types of hearthling: The Ascendancy, who live in the forest, or Rayya's Children, who live in the desert. They have slightly different skill trees, so the gameplay is a little different. The hearthlings in the game have basic personalities, and the newest update (Alpha 21) brings likes and dislikes. They have attributes too, which make them more or less suited to certain jobs. It's easy to pick up which attributes make a good soldier, for example, but some of the other classes are more complicated. This makes for an immersive town, where new arrivals' talents can mean the difference between life and death for your people. Crafting in the game is simple, and you have the (amazing!) ability to easily queue multiple items, and even request that you always have four beds in storage, for example, so you don't have to intimately micromanage every item crafted. Items placed in houses you design will also automatically queue to be produced by your crafters and placed, which enables the game to run smoothly. Even if you don't have the ingredients to make the chair you want, if you place one when you design a house it will be built and placed as soon as the ingredients are ready. There are a variety of crafters, from the carpenter to the herbalist, and every town will require a different approach (as each map and every hearthling is random). You can farm a variety of foods, including animals, and mine the hills around your town for ore. Traders will visit, and you can sell them products or buy goods. The only downside I can think of to this game is that it is not complete yet. However, I've loved watching it develop over the last 565 hours that I have played, and I can't wait to see the finished game in the future. I am excited for the new types of hearthlings planned for the future, in particular. (And if anyone on the development team ever sees this: I'd love to have some of those pet fighting wolves for my hearthlings, please!) I really feel like the development team listen to their audience, and I have been very impressed with the quantity and quality of the work they are putting into this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys minecraft, terraria, the sims, simcity, cities skylines, stardew valley or animal crossing. It has beautiful scenery, and great animations. You do not need a powerful setup: the game runs smoothly on my ACER Aspire F 15, which does have a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce) but which is not a gaming laptop. I have minor lag when my town reaches 25+ hearthlings, as the candles flickering at night make my computer slower. I find that toggling the walls down on my buildings at night solves this entirely, and it's really not an issue.			"

tl;dr Alpha 10 review:Cons:Lot's of bugs, minimal content.  Basically, it's a work in progress alpha game.Pros:Excellent dev team, great mod support, fun game with lots of potential.If you want a polished, feature filled, bug free game then stick StoneHearth in your watch list and wait a bit. If this looks like your kind of game, you want to have input into the development, you don't mind playing a game that will crash on you or just break because you clicked a button that causes an error, and you want to support Team Radiant.  Then buy it now.Full Alpha 10 ReviewIntroWhen you buy an early access game you are not just buying the game, because that isn't ready yet.  You are buying a look into the development of the game and the team behind it, and you get to play along as it's made, and then get the finished product at the end of it.  In my opinion the team at Radiant Entertainment are an amazing developer and I would happily buy into another early access game from them in the future based on my experience with them so far.What started out as a 2 man team when they launched their kickstarter has grown steadily over the past couple of years.  They have always interacted with the community with regular updates on their Dev Blog[stonehearth.net], answering questions, and helping on their Forum[discourse.stonehearth.net], and regular (currently multiple times per week) streaming through Twitch[www.twitch.tv] where they listen to and make changes from live feedback in the chat stream, explain the processes they are going through to help modding, and answer any questions people have for them about the game and it's development.I have total faith that this game will see it's completion and continued support afterwards.The Game (so far)You start with a small band of settlers with limited supplies and tools with the aim of building up a small town.  This is acheived harvesting materials, creating jobs, building items and tools, creating buildings (pre made and custom), and defending yourself from enemies.Controlling your town is a a bit of mix at the moment between telling your Hearthlings (the citizens) to go do something and then being able to forget about it (such as farming), and having to heavily micro manage other aspects (such as controlling production of individual items).  The initial concept from the kickstarter was that you wouldn't have to micro manage things in the town, so I would hope that this will be the case as the game matures.The building aspect of the game is developing well, and has had new features added with each new alpha.  You can choose to use a selection of pre-designed houses/buildings from Radiant or go all out and custom design your own.  The custom buildings part of the game is where I personally have experienced the most game breaking bugs, but it is certainaly getting better all the time.  If this is the part you are most looking at this game for I would hold off for a bit.Each Hearthling can be assigned a job/role within the community and will improve as they perform their tasks.  These include farmers, trappers, craftsmen, and guards.  These all work pretty well, although are all work in progress with the higher end skills still to be implemented.  And there are also new professions being added with each update.  Aplha 11 will be bringing us a cook, no more raw food!Enemies currently come in two varieties; undead, which will spawn on random nights and head to your town; and the goblins which are currently being worked on as part of the campaign that runs in game.  You do have the option to play on peacful mode if you want to build in peace and quite without having to worry about defending yourself.ModdingStoneHearth has been built from the ground up to support modding, and already has several great mods available, adding extra content into the game, changing the themes of the game and more projects in the works.  Because the game supports mods at it's core it is as simple as downloading a mod from the forum and dropping into the games mod folder.Final ThoughtsStoneHearth has a great team behind it, and is showing great potential for being an amazing game.  In it's current state you can definitly get several hours of enjoyment from the game, and get a taster of what is to come.  If you decide to purchase now expect to see bugs every game, from the amusing floating helmets, to annoying error messages, and I would recommend using the pre-made building templates until you are familiar with the rest of the game before venturing into more complex custom buildings.

			Views: 9,641		

			Chris continues to hammer on building bugs and improvements! Presenting: a bunch of community uploaded templates that didn't use to build, but that now do, and major interaction improvements related...		

First off, it is an early release, so bugs will happen, hoewever, I have never seen a team that is so responsive to the community. They can respond with a fix in less than a week!!1!!one!!1! Original Post: [/b]This is my favorite game, hands down, no doubt. Not only is it a great concept, but the execution is spot on. The combination of citizens you care about, and customization are huge selling points for me.Fantasy, city builders, resrouce managers, RPGs, and god sims in one without one over powering the others.Ok, so maybe you're worried about it being an alpha.THIS IS ALPHA DONE RIGHT!!!!The devs are very active, communicate and listen to the community and have fun with it!Every release feels like a leap forward with test builds available too.Honestly, at Alpha 14, this is more playable than a lot of finished games I have seen.Please feel free to contact me with any questions. In a library of over 1000 games, this one stands out in a great way. This is one purchase I've never regretted. "

								It's still in Alpha, so it does have its bugs and kinks. However, the developers are honest, communicate well, and work at an amazing speed. In the time I've had this game, it's improved tremendously, and I expect this to continue now that it's on public Early Access. The building tools already allow you to design almost anything, and Hearthlings are getting much smarter at building anything you can imagine. The leveling, RPGesque profession mechanics are truly fun instead of being a gating system. The RTSesque combat is fun to play albeit simplistic, and I think it will only continue to get more fun and complex.			"

								It's a fun little game but over the last week or two I keep finding myself being frustrated and I stop playing. Not because it's not fun but because it doesn't work, all the time. The building process is a mess, often times villagers ignore buildings halfway complete or dont even begin, sometimes the editing feature doesn't work so you cant even put wall on a building you're trying to make, any big projects like mining a large area or placing a big fence stop midway or cant be completed or cancelled. It's ""fun"" doesn't overshadow the bugs and frustration especially when you invest 20 minutes into something and have to start all over again more than once.			"

								I kickstarted Stonehearth and have been playing it since it was very, very simple in nature.  The graphics have remained beautiful (if you like voxels) throughout, each iteration has led to massive improvements in gameplay, and a number of bugs have been fixed - and the game is still in alpha.One of the ""big deals"" about this game is that it takes the dwarf fortress approach to items in the world and materials.  It then layers LUA scripting and html (no joke) for the interface.  Its modding system isn't a modding system so much a content-delivery system.  You want a new race? Describe some things in JSON and boom.This leads to some very, very awesome potential for BETA once all the systems are fleshed out.  The latest update added the second Kingdom, and playing as it evolves into a completely different playstyle.. and as near as I can tell it wasn't much of a code update, just a ""mod"" from the dev's standpoint.This is working out to be the ultimate kingdom builder / simulator.  Like Dwarf Fortress? You're gonna love this.  Like Minecraft but don't like doing all the digging yourself? You'll love it.  Do you like casual games? Yep.			"

								I'm writing my review pretty early despite not having much play time so far. I bought this game during the Seam Summer sale at 20% off after having put it on my wishlist a while back. So far, the game is definitely worth the buy- and has shown itself already to be highly replayable even at its current state. I'm writing my review with the understanding that there will be a few bugs, some improvement suggestions, and in mind that more content will be released. Honestly, with where it's at now, I would love for a Workshop to be added for the community. Alas, it's still in alpha...Graphics: 9/10 being pixel themed. Very cute chibi like, so it appealed to me immediately. They glitch out sometimes for me, but I don't find it too annoying to not play. Gameplay Mechanics: 6/10 (this is definitely subject to change) With the fact that as others have stated there is much need for improvement for AI to properly work. I wish that the tasks they did were in order of your selection on what to build- meaning if you choose to build a cottage and you're currently building one- they will flock to the cottage you just qued instead of continuing to build the current one first. A way better tutorial on how to use the game mechanics at this point is highly needed. I had to google with no help to find out how to place a objects, such as my crafting bench, and had to press ""P"" to finally be able to go to a screen to place objects. After pressing P, I have not needed to do so, and placing objects started working for me. I would have also liked to understand how to use certain classes like the trapper early on. For the first part of your gameplay, you'll probably find yourself very slowly starting to understand how the game works because there is a lack of even a brief tutorial. The only tutorial you get is understanding how the camera options work, which if you play games regularly especially of this type, is pretty self explanotory before you even open the game. Content: 6.5/10* (subject to change) so far there are two playable races and two types of biomes to play in. The races pretty much work best only in their biomes- so if you're wanting to switch it up game play will definitely be harder. Not a bad thing, but I hope to see more races and biomes added for sure in the future which they've shown to be highly likely in the start screen. You are also able to select to be in Sandbox mode, normal, and hard, of course. I hope to definitely see a wider selection of crafting, building types, tasks, enemies, classes, etc. in the future. Once again, it's still in early acess- but even with its options now it's not bad. One complaint I have is that at the beginning of the game, you choose a selection of the map- make sure that the box you pick is not cut off in anyway because that section of the map is the only available area for you to build your village in at least in what I've seen so far. I hope that they change it to where that's just the area of the map that you choose to reside, and still can explore out further. Otherwise, it cuts a huge chunk of game time to me. You can't explore much out of your settlement, and it makes resources limited.Replay Value: 9/10 With the options so far that are available, you still have different scenarios and ways that you can play out in your game. And it's pretty addicting... Reccommend: 10/10 Would reccommend anyone this game at its current state even in early access. Stonehearth has already shown itself to have an extremely promising future. Hope to play with this game as it grows and expands itself. Hope to see DLC and a workshop in the future. :) "

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game!!It's cute little city-builder with some strategy and RPG elementsYou establish your own little town, in a randomly generated world Assign classes you your Hearthlings/Villagers. Like footmen, carpender, weaver, farmer. etcDesign your own buildings, draw out the walls and place furniture. Build bridges, statues, stairs and everything you can think of voxel-by-voxel with the slab tool(But don't go to crazy, the automatic scaffolding system can't handle too complex structures yet)Mine out the mountains for ore, and make your blacksmith create weapons & armor out of them.And you need to protect yourself from Goblins, zombies and wolfs (And there is more to come).Different races are planned, like Three different human clans, Rabbit people, Dwarfs and Orcs (some will be playable and some will not) It's already a fun game and the developer has such plans for this game. This game has so much potensial, and i love it so much. The developers are really connected with the players, both trough the forums and the multiple streams they have weekly. And they are sure to take your thoughts to account.The game is already fun, it just needs more contentI've had a lot of fun with this game and i would absolutely recommend it to everyone. Yes it's buggy but it is an alpha			"

 >>ALPHA 1.7 REVIEW<< This game has been very buggy at the beggining (which ofc makes sense this is an alpha) so at that time it would probably be a bad time to buy the game. But now this game has enough content and works well enough that I believe its worth buying it now.Now for the reasons: Worth it?/Not Worth it?Worth it!:1.)The managment aspect of the game is realy nice.{you can control what your little guys do to quite the detailed aspect including great buildings great combat detail}2.)Little details.{There is a TON of little details [Events,Merchants,Attacks,Thiefs,]}3.)Great development speed {This game gets updated quite fast with a lot of details added every time and buggs fixed all the time.}4.)Relaxing game{Nothing to say here.}5.)sense of progression{You got plenty of ways to progress It feels good and meaningfull}Not worth it:1.)Still lacking content.{This game doesnt have much for it but a lot is planned for it, and there was even less content when I bought it.{Disclaimer: Remmber point 3 on why is it worth it}}2.)Slightly buggy{allthough the game lost a lot of its buggs It still has some}3.)Mining system is really bad{The mining system is kinda bad if only because most of the buggs I know are there and the game can be quite broken on that aspect.}4.)Frames for second?{after getting deep enough into the game the high amount of details and things being done at the same time could the games FPS could drop duo to the high amount of lets say ""traffic"" going on in the game.Finale though:When considering if to buy a game or not you should think of the genere your looking at first and then at its weaks and strongs.I just want to remind you all this review was done when the game was on alpha 1.7,I'm sure it will get way better allthough its good enough right now as is.7/10or 8/10Hard for me to decide.~~Sorry for any grammar mistakes I have made and failed to notice~~ "

								I have waited above a year after initially purchasing this game for some simple but vital improvements to the game's building designer / editor, a key part of the game since it feels quite dead ended otherwise. Apart from the addition of a poor staircase generator, there have been no improvements that I can see. The game is still incapable of handling even slightly complex designs. Only a basic square room with a roof seems to work properly. Due to the very, very slow resolution to this issue I think it's only fair I write this one down as a no go. Which is a shame, because it seems to have had a lot of work put into it so far.			"

I think it's a fair price overall.. There is great support and if you have a great idea you can always submit it on the forum, maybe your idea will be added into the game!

								Stonehearth has the positives of Dwarf Fortress (DF): a simcity style game that focuses on individual citizens, their lives, attributes, and abilities without the difficult learning curve that makes DF so in-accessible for people. It has beautiful graphics, and has the option for a peaceful setup (for those not interested in fighting).It is by no means complete - but the team has been steadily working on the core functionality - and the improvement shows with each new alpha version. Update:Alpha 17 is quite playable - once you decide to focus on what works rather than what does not  -Lots of content. High quality UI. They have chosen well when they copied Dwarf Fortress (attributes, farming, combat, 3D) and chosen well even, or particularly, when they diverged from it (RPG-type-classes, experience, levels).The game creates interesting decisions - Embark - Race, difficulty level, choice of locationStart - Which classes to focus on, etcWorth buying not just to support but also to play.

								Not worth 25. You will get a few hours of play out of this game, but then errors become more and more common. The game is still just TOO damn basic. Crafters quickly run out of use, some are just better then others (Oh boy.... pottery..... Only useful on the sand map, and even then ONLY so you can rush Mason.) Game world is tiny, feeling less like a world and more like and island. Wait until 10-15, or until the game comes further along.			"

								Even with the extra help in the newer updates, I still feel like this game needs some extra work to carry though.  Similar to Minecraft but relying on the villagers to do everything for you, you’d think the ai would work more effectively, but they still struggle from time to time.  Even trying to help prompt them so any ways, they still fail to complete tasks or build buildings.  So buy this game only when it’s on sale, since it is a fun game but not a completed game, so don’t pay full price.			"

								I've had the game for a while now. It's great, fun, more responsive now given the updates, but the one thing they have yet to fix is the amount the game stutters (even with normal-high FPS (I run the game at an even 55FPS and my Hearthlings stutter like crazy)) at a certain point. You cannot really build too much or queue too much or else your Hearthlings will look like they're making a stop-go walk to their destination (even during work animations). The game isn't bad by any means and a lot of the construction bugs (I.E: not working anymore even when you have all required materials for a building) are squashed. Despite the cuteness and the fact I am recommending this game, I am not currently recommending it until some more optimization is brought into the mix. However, I don't expect my review to cause anyone to wane in their decision (for better or worse) so if you decide to buy it, then by all means you won't regret it if you can get past my aforementioned gripe.

								I enjoy this game very much, the bugs can be a bit annoying at times but it is Early Access game so what ya to do? :3anyways beside that you can find many bugs in the game to either be Funny or just jaw droping or facepalming (had many of those) And i Hope to soon they make it Muilplayer! I were really like to see how they do that, cause you don't see many games like this becoming muilplayer (I haven't) SO check it out! Buy it Or watch it on YT it great for both adults and kids! Also this was my Very First Review. I tired! ;P			"

								42hrs now, FOURTY TWO!I recommand it because it's fun and it's a lovely game.The gameplay is cool and similar to the Settler and it's a bit buggy...very buggy actually. But the devs are actually pusing updates so it's fine for me.But before you buy, you should check the official site for Q/A and bug reports to make sure you can tolerate those bugs...Here's one bug or two I've encountered:Tried to build a three-decker, then all my workers(not all villagers) stopped building after completing the first floor and just idling around. Okay...fine, let's build something else, how about...a round barn! The workers again, left this one unfinished and the game started to crash ( probably because of the barn, I had to load the previous save to avoid it otherwise the game crashes).So I tried a less complicated building, a beautiful and decent modern dinner ofc, It's finished this time, very happy about it. Oh wait...the windows are missing and my workers refuse to install them, Naughty workers!			"

								I recommend the Davs make this game cheaper to reach a larger player base. This game has some of the best potential i've ever seen, if only it could be finished! You guys have a perfect basically 3D dwarf fortress here and the opportunity to make  game that touches millions if only you properly incentivize people to play. 25$ is just too much for this game in it's unfininished stage as you lose your save EVERY TIME there is an update. I really do love playing this game though. I rage quit after I lost my save though. Anyway, this game has potential, please keep developing and hopefully finish it!			"

								TL;DR - Enjoyable and relaxing sandbox game that has graphics similar to minecraft. 8/10 (as of 12/28/16), great game to relax and spend some time on.It's clear that this game has similarities to Banished with it's own graphic style. I am aware this game is still early access and is still changing so I can't review it like a full polished game yet.Some pros:RelaxingVery nice soundtrackCute art styleNice progressionActually tries to have a storyCombat/defense systemNo tiny BS micromanagementCons: After unlocking and building everything, the game feels empty - still early accessSometimes feels unbalanced with enemiesAI is sometimes buggyLack of important notifications - like a hearthling is starving.Slight lack of content, yet again early access "

								I was lucky enough to be a kickstarter backer of this game and I've been impressed by the sheer competency of the devs. They are brothers, each with 10 years experience in the software industry and it shows. They've taken the time to perfect the underlying tech of the game and to ensure the AI works better than any sandbox-type game I've seen (with graphics that is, Dwarf Fortress is in a class of it's own). The game is fun to play in it's current state and more content is coming with regular updates.Currently, I'd recommend getting this game if you enjoy DF, Gnomoria, or city-building games.Keep your eye on this one, it's going to set the standard a new for sandboxes.

								I'm going to keep it short and express my quick thoughts about the game above.Firstly, I've got to give a shout out to Radiant Entertainment who, in my eyes, portraits as an extremely commited and trustworthy bunch, who you can tell are giving their all for this title, and who are often seen in dialog with its community.Stonehearth itself, I do believe got the potential to become somewhat of a rare gem, especially when they implement multiplayer. But even in its current stage of development it still offers great gameplay. I'm confident that this game, that just dropped as EA on Steam but that has been in development for quite a while now, will continue to update and one day become something fantastic.			"

								TL;DR - Buy it now, You most likely won't be disappointed!A truly excellent game, well worth the money. I've followed the game and development team for 1 1/2 years and they put other Early Access developers to shame. They always keep in contact with us players, and are very transparent (hosting livestreams twice a week - where they show content being developed, and answer questions, and take suggestions/ideas, weekly development blog posts, responding to PMs and threads on the official forums, etc.). When you buy this game expect monthly-ish updates and alongside that pre-release versions to test out. (Very few Early Access games, update this often at all.)The community is also awesome. Check out the official forums where you'll find lots of mods, artwork, animations, Let's Plays,  interesting discussions and very mature and respectable people. I really love this game, and its admirable and impressionable devs. I can tell you right now this is not your typical let-down Early Access game! I can say full-heart'dly to buy this game. It's 100% worth it.Please note though, if you buy this game right now. It's still EARLY ACCESS, and things such as optimization or promised features are not all completed yet. The devs have worked really hard, and I hate seeing people flame the game, while blindly ignoring the fact that it still has a while to go in development. As of now there is plenty of content, and it's fairly replayable. It runs quite smoothly for an Early Access game, too. I say go for it, but if you're picky maybe wait a while! :)[ P.S. - If you buy the game, please watch the weekly livesteams almost every Tuesday and Thursday - and also join the official forums, again really awesome community! :)! ]			"

								Have been playing this game off and on since the first Alpha. I've been through a lot of failed Kickstarter games, Castle Story, StarForge, a lot of disappointments like Planetary Annihilation, War for the Overworld, Shroud of the Avatar.This game I still believe in. They've been making steady progress, they've stuck to what they said they were going to do on the kickstarter and the game has come from a single block with one towns person that picked berries to a playable town management game.If you're looking for a finished product, this isn't it. Add it to your wishlist, come back around Christmas and see where it is. But if you're looking for a game that brings the feeling of Banished, Myth and Minecraft and mixes them all together then I suggest you take a closer look and consider supporting the game early.			"

								Great strategy/city builder. A lot like minecraft except you control the villagers and organize them to keep them a live. If you are thinking of buying this game, keep in mind it is still in alpha. That being said Stonehearth has an amazing dev team who listen to all of your feedback posted on their forums. They work hard to give us the indie we want, and despite all the bugs the game has come really far in the past year. If you do buy the game I recommend opting into the latest developement builds. Typically a new one comes out each week, two weeks at most. If you are like me, itching for new content this is the best way to go. New Alpha builds seems to come out every 3 weeks to a month.			"

								This game is not a bad game. I actually Recommend it. The only bad thing about this game is the Price for the content the game has at this moment in time. Perhaps when the game is finished or when they add multiplayer this game will be worth it but right now it is worth around 10-20 bucks. Depending on how much you love games like these will depend how much you are willing to pay for it. I bought this game just to see if its worth it for the price and for the content it has right now its not exactly worth my money. I definitely will be picking this up on sale though.			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR Do you have a realistic expectation of alpha/early access games? Are you willing to wait for more features and enjoy the current game in the mean time? Do you like the genre of this game?If you ansered yes, this game is for you.I have been playing this game pre-EA release, and honestly believe it is one of the most satisfying kickstarters I have ever backed and is already quite fun to play. It has a brilliant balance of city building, crafting and RPG elements, and rewards the player with a real feeling of progression. Each citizen has their own stats and skills which you can improve and you are able to get very creative with your architecture already with a little effort.PRO- Developer communication, every week there are numerous posts on their websites dev blog covering their progress and frequent developer streams where you may have direct imput in the creation of the game.- The game is being designed to be ULTRA modder friendly, I myself, someone with NO prior experience making mods have already made a few myself without causing bugs in the game in an alpha state. (Expect workshop support)- Frequent updates, the game is beginning to progress rather quickly and is adding features and busting bugs EVERY patch.- A wonderful art style, it maintains a simple charm while still looking brilliant and handling rather well even on less powerful machines.- Balanced progression, the game in this current state is slow enough to last but fast enough to hold your attention.- A fast forward button, I personally find this extremely important for things such as building or mining, or passing time while not active.CON- This is an alpha, there are occasional bugs, especially following new versions, but far fewer than there have been previously. For an alpha I have seen a relatively low amount and they always seem to get fixed before I can encounter them more times but there will be some bugs and if you go in to an early access game not expecting bugs you will be dissapointed.- Villager progression through classes is currently incomplete, quite a few are implemented so far but it does reduce the games variety.- can be hard at times as death of a skilled citizen can set you back for a while.

								Stonehearth, Stonehearth, Stonehearth... Where do I even begin? I absolutely adore this game. I have learned about it some time ago and purchased it via Humble Bundle. Since then, I fell in love with it like never before, as this game is my dream game, one I have always been looking for. It is excellent mix of Strategy, Sandbox and City Simulation. This game, as you can probably tell by the screenshots and movies, have it`s own unique feel and it`s as cuddly and cute as it can get. For now, the game is still in early to mid alpha, so there is much content to add, but even now game can be and is fun to play. Why should you buy this game?  Developers of Stonehearth, team Radiant, are the most amazing team of developers I have ever encountered in my gaming career. You wouldn`t probably believe how much they involve us (the community) onto the process of making game. First of all, they stream on http://twitch.tv three times per week, showing us how the game is being made, also taking countless advices from players (you could affect how the monster will look in game, how some mechanics should work or even name characters yourself). They also let us decide on how the game`s development should go from alpha to alpha (using https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap) so we can choose what content should be made next.  The game have an amazing building system, presented in the trailer. Your little Hearthlings will build everything you can imagine voxel by voxel, using scaffoldings. The building system is very intuitive yet complex, and is being updated even more.  Stonehearth is made in a way that allows players to easily add mods to the game. There already some amazing mods made by community members, and we can expect even more of those coming soon.  If you, like me, always want the game to be as filled with content as possible, you can expect some good things from Stonehearth, In the final version there will be alternative planes, additional biomes, extra races to play as, huge campains to play, dozens of enemies and events randomed by computer Game Master. And much more, that`s for sure.  Last but not least, you don`t have to be afraid of this game being abandoned by developers. They seem so excited about this game, and they don`t slow down while making this game in front of our eyes. I believe it`s a privilege being able to take part of making this awesome game.I r8 8/8 m8.			"

								To address people raging about this game so far, I’ll repeat what others have already stated. The game is in development, and it will get better. With that in mind I’ve loved this game so far, and it’s been the easiest timesoak game I’ve had for years.This game, in a word is pleasant. I've played games like Banished (which is probably the nearest comparable) where the biggest problem was keeping people alive, and the only way to do so was to go balls out at it deal with problems decades in advance.This, like I've said is pleasant to the point of a city-building game being relaxing. I personally play games to chill out with, and I've always enoyed games within this genre so getting something I can actually chill out with is wonderful.It's easy to understand, easy to progress through and at the time of writing (04/07/15) there are very few problems with it in terms of bugs that I’ve experienced, but I’ll detail any below. I do also have one or two suggestions but I'll detail those at the bottom. (Again, all in development stage. I don’t expect these to be addressed three weeks ago, chill your beans)On the whole though, I've thouroughly enjoyed what these guys have offered already, and I can't wait to see what comes up in the future. It's a solid game as it stands, and it's far from a regretable purchase. -- For the below, I'm just assuming the devs are watching these things -- Bugs I’ve noticedI was able to place single tables within dining tables after building the wrong tables. I don’t know if this is unique but moving things around to get it straightened out was a ballache.SuggestionsThe daily report – while I fully respect people’s desire to blast through games like this. A play through on peaceful mode (for example) where you play at a fairly slow pace leads to a situation where you can’t keep up with the daily goals. If these goals were changed from what seems to be programmed based on what day you’re on, to a flat ‘Achieve this level of food/happiness/net value to get a new person’ the whole thing would flow a lot better.A priority system, or a worker grouping could be set so sorting to storage can be made more efficient. For instance If I can make Phil gather a set range of materials (or if stores are refined enough, just tie workers to those stores). That or create a 'Runner' class of citizen, where their tasks is simply to move things around. (Teamster to the likes of Tropico)			"

								It is very rare that I log in to make a review. By that I mean (and I don't know if others have this issue) when steam connects me to make one it brings me to a new window where I am not logged in. But that is neither here nor there. Let me begin by saying this game has AMAZING POTENTIAL! However currently the villagers' AI is lacking though it is still an alpha build. Even then the game is still playable though you'll have many of your troopers standing around staring off into the sun like idiots.The great pros to the game:Great potential. Good graphics that aren't hard on your computer (I'm on a laptop, furthermore one built for office work and NOT gaming and I still rarely crash).The ability to build ANYTHING! Yes... anything! You can even build a giant hotdog if you wish.A city builder that isn't annoyingly complicated.The bad:Well, the AI sucks as forementioned. That's a work in progress I hope. Goblin attacks happen very early. I only had a carpenter and I was still working on making a guard when the first attack happened. I lost three of my five villagers. So yes, this is a bad thing but this also hasn't happened every game so perhaps it is just bad luck.Villagers don't seem to really want to work but that's probably just the AI again. Also, there needs to be a method to making each villager assigned to a specific home or shop area. I have farmers sleeping in buildings on the opposite side of town to their fields and blacksmiths sleeping outside the town entirely...			"

								Things I like about the game:Fight bossesSurviveManage a settlement and their economy to a pointTemplate or free style building availableExpandMany recipes, more with the t2 items added. Your settlement has jobs. You need certain jobs to open up other ones. Create traps and defend your settlement.Play all jobs at once. Serious time sink and time management for your hearhlings.Gather resources and minePretty gameMusicCute hearthlingsAs they level up they gain better abilities or buffsQuesting availableEntertainingGraphicsJob progessionCareer and ability progression for most employed hearthlingsStoryThings I dislike about the game:In game pop up's of Engine Errors that wipe your game saves or that make it so you can't ever build again on that save or map that you just sunk 50 plus hours into. Been months and no fix for this issue. Happens to others too because my friend who played has the same problem.Slow bug fixes.Building aspect of it is a mess. You can insert windows and doors etc but you have to force trick it to do it to free-style building by placing blocks behind them to connect it just to get a windows since it doesn't really allow for that. You can just use their walls but they are gigantic. Their huge walls have automatic colums and sometimes there is no color match up leaving you on huge builds with ugly colums in odd colors. Limitted colors to build in. Almost no different textures. Lots of solid colors that are blue, orange, tan or brown or pink hues.Double doors stick out of one side out of the doorway more than another side. Objects just aren't even. Lack of space even when making tons of vaults. Not enough clay without digging a lot compared to all other resources available to you when mining.Not enough building variety.Hearthlings are just too slow. Crafting times are too slow.Town inventory item limit is too low for a game that you can build on and decorate as well.Roofing tool doesn't like to work most times.Changing between colors on a wall means you have to select each wall. You can't just apply it with an option to all walls if you wanted too. Making the game even slower.You can't use the delete erase tool for anything other than slabs when building. Making this far more frustrating when building. You can't use it on doors, windows etc either.I lasted a good while on the game but enough is enough. I don't want to keep starting maps over any more. I can over-look many of these things in early access, however I can not over look their Engine Errors that ruining your hours and hours of maps when you can't no longer build on them due to these annoying errors as it breaks players game save files making it so they can't play or progress further. I played it a lot and re-started countless maps from scratch until finally I got burnt out of starting over. Game is slow paced some what as a result of starting over maps. Will update this once this game functions properly for the better & then re-visit it once bug fixes are made to the engine error issues. Follow it if you want. I can't recommend it in this state until they deliver those fixes. Disapointing to do so much work on it, then you have to be forced to start over again.			"

								Hey!This is my first review, so don't expect too much of it.________________________________________________________________________________(Personal Opinion)I can understand that some people don't like it because of its huge amount of bugs and that it has been in Alpha for an extremely long time. But honestly, if you ignore the countless bugs (which will be fixed) the game is one of the best games I've ever played. This game is a place where you could relax, a place where you can be happy without worries.  It helps me get through hard periods where you feel like life sucks. That's because of the music.The music, made by Raj Mann, here is just amazing (google up Stonehearth OST if you don't believe me, my favorite is 'Sailing into the black clouds & blue skies)  and everything, the animations, world, design style is just incredible to look at.The animals and the hearthlings are soo cute to look at.One of the main reasons why I bought this is because of its amazing soundtracks (Mentioned above)but also because of its simplistic playstyle. The AI is a bit buggy, and there are A LOT of bugs that need to be fixed (Its Alpha) but I do believe that this won't be a game that'll be abandoned, because the progress that has been done is immense and the team is just so amazing. Posting weekly blogs about how the progress is going.The gameplay is nice, and you can do a lot of things in the game.Want a big army with only archers and kill all the orcs that appear in random events, here you go!Want to build a palace? Say no more!You can make a big town with all the possible jobs, fully surounded by walls.Sometimes a big army of orcs will appear, trying to kill every hearthling you got and raze the lovely town you got.Or sometimes nothing will happen, and you can be free of worries.TL;DR====================================================================================+Amazing music                                                      I - Still in Alpha+Relaxing                                                                 I - Some bugs+Nice art style                                                         I - Computer heavy (Slow fps if you progress in the game)+Different playstyles (A lot of choices)                  I - A bit on the expensive side+Easy to understand the mechanics                      I====================================================================================Should you buy it?

								I was looking for a game like Dwarf Fortress but with better graphics and easier to get in to.This is it.Obviously it is not as deep as Dwarf Fortress but the basic mechanics are there.You can build a cute little forest town, or a mountain fortress. You can slaughter all of the pesky Kobolds in the world, or you can be a peaceful little farming village.This game is brilliant. My only problem with it so far, is that you will eat through the Campaign/Story within a few hours.Luckily the replay value so far is in creating new towns etc.Hopefully the devleopers keep up their active content updates and patches until well after the game has gone gold.Couldn't recommend this product enough.

								I am quite a big fan of the genre, and have enjoyed related titles a lot. Stonehearth has everything it needs to fill the  form:- Villagers with names and faces (...and stats and opinions!)- Random maps (...and varying biomes)- Crafting / industry (...and leveling craftsmen)- Resource management (...and storage management)- Trade (...and trade missions/events)- Town defense (...and giant zombies).But it doesn't stop at that, the best thing about this game is that it oozes love. It's being crafted with TONS of love. The devs really care for this product, and it shows. It even inspired me to write them a small letter, to which they kindly replied.That said, Stonehearth still has a long way to go until it's a solid, solid release, but I am extremely optimistic about the outcome and wish both develolpers and early adopters the best of luck.

Other than that I would Recommend this game, but not highly until some of the bugs are resolved.			"

								For an alpha game this has a ton of promise. I am still very excited that the devs for this game are really behind this and whenever there is an issue its fix ASAP, not something you can get for most other games these days. It is simple to learn and allows you to be very creative in your builds. You control your town and your hearthlings and the outcome of the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves to build and control a town of people. Even if you don't normally like this kind of game or if you get bored with them, this one adds other clans to make it a bit more challenging. Of course if you want a calm game there is a mode for that too! Hell you can even choose what kind of people to start with and have a completely different experience playing all over again. I got this game on the steam sale but even then I would have paid full price for this. A game where the Devs are actually working on the game still AND interacting with the community make this a great game so far and I would buy it again if I had to. Just remember it is still a work in progress, but that does not mean its not worth it as it is right now.			"

								Its got little block peeps!Seriously though, if you have played Timber & Stone and liked that game, you will be sure to like this game! Development is top notch! I've not seen any other indy dev team so focused on progression and community input as Radient!Its alpha, so its buggy, but there are constant updates that try to make each alpha release stable. And alpha releases come at nice intervals.My only issue is that every alpha breaks saved games. So although you can save, you cannot progress in alpha builds if you are hard set on a settlement and don't want to lose it. This may change in the immediate future but as of my last game it has not.TBH, Stonehearth is the only website where I track & post on for indy games. I support alot of indy games but none is as ambitious as this one, with a team so focused and honest.If you do not own this game, you need to buy it! I'd bet my bottem dollar that this is a game that will see final relese, and  will be a game changer across its genre's!			"

--Playing unstable alpha 18--I have been playing now over 8 hours, that's not much, but I have not encountered any game breaking bugs that some people complaining, only couple minor bugs.The game runs well on my computer, Game play mechanics are good, graphics looks beautiful.I have enjoyed my time with this game and at the moment I think I will play many more hours with this tactical town building/managing game. This IS NOT Minecraft, if want you to search something that this resembles graphically I will say CubeworldWhen you start game first time there will be difficulties to understand what to do if you play this kind of game first time, otherwise just by exploring game and searching what your Heartling's can do will solve many problems. there is no tutorial atm, hopefully we get one somedayAlpha 17 is current stable version, but there is no option to remove building(temporarily suspended).So be careful with that. so do not forget door from you building/house.Minor bugs:1.After Completing building they will start tearing scaffolding's down and sometimes they will forget couple of these in place - solution for this - ""CTRL-C""  to open console, click select scaffolding and write console ""destroy"" and its gone.2.Some times after building they left some hunk of stone or couple block of wood to roof top, this is quite funny, and if you wanna get rid of those, again console, or create ladders to get them.3.Sometimes when you get new heartling she/he will spawn in odd locations and cannot find way to your village. that is annoying, time build ladders again.I have not witnessed it myself, but I have read that when you have complex building you should save game before you start build it, sometimes they dont know how to build it, but this might be out dated warning.After 8hours I will give this game 8/10. (I will updated verdict again when I know  more about this game) I really want to give higher verdict but after 8 hours I cant			"

								This is a fun little dorflike city builder. As with most of these, you start with 7 people (In this game, they're ""hearthlings"") and from there, you need to set up for food, shelter, resources, and defense. So far so same, right? The two largest twists on this one are how you can set up the housing (completely planning out a building, instead of either a hole in the wall or a prefab structure), and the animation style. I'm trying to find a good descriptor for the animation style, and I keep coming back to ""cute"". It's not the word I'm looking for, but it does indeed match, in my opinion. I feel emotionally vested in these hearthlings in a way I don't really get from the likes of Gnomoria, Towns, or even Dwarf Fortress, and I honestly feel it's the way they're animated. When goblins are charging into your town and you see your farmers scatter from their fields and cower, it makes you want to protect them. The victories feel more visceral when your footman is taking a giant stone hammer to the goblins instead of just getting lines of damage text.That is the best way I can really put it right there. If you're looking to just build a town, then there are hundreds of other games that do the same thing. If you want to take care of your citizens, check this one out.			"

								I had fun playing this game. I really love to see this game to get optimized and be able to play without worrying about the performance. So far, the game starts to lag or slows down after a long session of this game. Hence, you have no other choice but to abandone the current game and start a new game. This cycle keeps going until you get annoyed since all your hardwork were for nothing since you have to abandone them just to avoid the lag. I really want to still play the game but knowing that I wont be able to get far on this game, I just give up on playing altogether.I hope they fix whatever is causing these lags/performance drops asap. For now, I would avoid buying this game yet on it's current state (Alpha 21).			"

								Even though I recommended this game, I wouldn't get it just yet. It's so buggy that it is absolutely unplayable. The developers update it regularly and I have full expectations that it will be one of the greatest city-building games ever made when it is finished. It's essentially Minecraft mixed with Banished. You assign jobs and tasks that need to be done, and your little hearthlings go do it. You don't controll the hearthlings directly, you simply guide them. They can die from combat and starvation, so careful planning and resource management is very important. It's as much a game of strategy as it is creation. The game is currently somewhat limited in the designs you can create based on the terrible AI of your hearthlings and the bad UI. It will get fixed, and when it does, you'll be able to create things on par with Minecraft. All while playing a sandbox citybuilder.

								This game could be great. I enjoyed managing my villagers, building mines, collecting resources and defending my tiny village from incoming raiders. But one key element has made me decide to not recommend this game.Designing and building things is a struggle against a ruthless stubborn AI and clunky difficult to use controls.The core of this game is about building things. Houses, towers, mansions, whatever you need to house your hearthlings and keep them happy. Right now this mechanic is broken. The controls are non-intuitive. I'm still unable to find a simple way to edit or delete plans. If I do start construction and finish a house halfway and then realise that I forgot to design a window, door, or anything else, I can't change the plan. Instead I have to delete the plan, dismantle and destroy whatever was actually built and then start over. Trying to destroy partially built homes is another struggle. Hearthlings will destroy the pieces around them leaving no way for them to exit creating floating walls or floors and even after you rescue them they refuse to destroy those floating pieces.Building a city is what this game is supposed to be about. It's an early access game. I understand. But I've been watching this game ever since the kickstarter and the constant complaint has always been about how difficult it is to get custom unique buildings created. It's been a few years and this problem is still around. Before you make a decision on whether or not to purchase ask yourself if it is a problem Radiant even CAN fix. "

								It's hard to evaluate any game that is in Alpha, so please take that into account when reading this:I have played this game for about 20 hours. (kids have put in another 40 and they love it) and I find it it be very well crafted and well thought out.  They really have nailed this so far.  every feature that is currently in the game is well done, and the crafting system, and promotion system is complicated enough to allow for a variety of professions while simple enough to play without spending a long time deciding what your citizens should be doing with their lives.If you think the videos look good, you should for sure try this game out, you won't be dissapointed.My only conern with the game is the roadmap and direction it is going.  What I mean by that is I cant really get a sense from googling this game on the internet or looking though the forums how close this game is to being finished.  In my opinion at ""Alpha 19""  it is only about half done.  there is no multiplayer yet, (although I believe that is coming)  and what this game really needs is some ""dwarf fortress"" or ""minecraf"" machine building capebility, (using physics, and trap doors and drawbridges and leavers and such to really bring your constructions to life.  I assume that is coming in the future, as it really seems like that is what the game is designed to eventually become.  I am enjoying it so far and am looking forward to seeing where the developers take it.			"

								Stonehearth is a fantastic game, and if you enjoy sandbox/city building games then I highly recommend it.I may be a little biased as I was one of the backers when it was still in Kickstarter, but even then I felt that Radiant Entertainment had a great take on the genre, and a great culture in regards to their backers and fans.  In watching the game and the team grow, I have not changed my mind.  They have shown consistent and impressive improvements to the game, regular updates on the game and the team, and an active role in the discussions.A few notes on the game itself.  It is still very much a work in progress.  Features are still being developed and released, each one coming with it's share of bugs and quirks.  As should go without saying with any Early Access game, only purchase if you are interested in seeing the game grow, and want the chance to add your voice to the development.  Radiant has done a very good job of adding polish to the game as they went, but their primary focus has been features, the rest of the polish comes later.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoy this game, even in it's unfinished state.  Radiant has built a good base for their game, and I look forward to seeing what they can do with it.-NB			"

It's called memory leaks, it's called lag, it's called performance, of course this is in alpha, so if you want to get the game be ready for bugs, i sure hope the devs are dedicated to this game forever, i know i will be playing this a lot, but when the game crashes, i need to find something to surpress my emotions after that point, cause it's the only reason i can't play it.

								This is a beautiful voxel sandbox sim, inspired by dwarf fortress. In its present state it has a good portion of the core features implemented, but it is far from finished. It is very playable, but like other early access titles it does succumb from bugs and glitches. However the Devs are consistantly finding and squashing bugs. This game is updated regularly and the Devs are very open about where the game is at and what is being worked on for each new update (except for a few suprises here and there). This is a fantastic game with a great concept, and if you don't mind an early access with a bug or two its definately worth checking out.I backed this title on kickstarter and have been following its progress ever since. It has been steadily improving bit by bit and its amazing to see how far its come.

								Best town game I've ever played. You build up a settlement and things attack you. Not to mention you have to keep up with how much food you are producing. (you can do much more, I'm just bad at explaining it.) As any game, its not without faults. Here's a list of bugs Ive encountered while playing (This is still an alpha, however)-Footmen will continue to fight even when they are almost dead and you keep telling them to retreat.-Villagers often will stop constructing a building and never finish it.Most of these bugs force you to restart your village.A lot of the bugs I griped about are now fixed, so GG dev team!Also speaking of buildings, the current building tools are difficult m as you can only make simple structures. The visuals are limited too, as you can only use  one or two material types and colors for each section (Except roads and floors). It's not necessarily user friendly, but some pretty cool stuff can be madeCriticism aside, it's a wonderful game. I do believe it is worth the money			"

								Pretty much in alpha still,but it getting so much updatesTo run you must have:Good graphic cardAnd High CPU RAM(For the first 5 hours on your kingdom, if you keep playing in the same kigdom ,you will end with small Lag r*ping your PC life span, starting another kingdom will stop the lag)UPDATE: According to one of latest YouTube videos, the alpha 15 will be about optimization, which will make the game better I guess.Still enjoying this game even there still isn't that much in it.Also the devs keep there promises on updates and I would play it after early access :)ANOTHER UPDATE: The devs actually care and frequently update it since the alpha release and of course after the Steam version, they also have a channel: Radiant Entertainment, which they show their ""weekly"" progress videos called ""Desktop Tuesday"", if you want to get more into what you want to find or be enlightened by what is inside the game and where and how it was going in development, I recommend seeing this weekly uploaded desktop Tuesday videos that uploads on of course as the title says: Tuesday.Unlike any Early access titles (excluding Plague Inc Evolved because it was good in early development but whatever), this get updated frequently and not by 2 weeks but at the least once per month if I am correct.

Early Access Review
								For all potential buyers:This game is very fun and the art style is really awesome. It's like the best of everything from all the pseudo pixel-graphics titles being released so frequently now. I enjoyed playing this game, for an hour or so. The game has a lot of good concepts, but nothing seems even partially fleshed-out. I understand that it is an early access game, but still. Charging $20 for a a game that you can experience everything in within 4-5 hours of gameplay is criminal, in my opinion. While I was watching some of the video reviews/let's plays, I saw that the characters don't have any sort of customization. They have no outfits, you can't assign them to a bed and decide where each one lives. This is fine with me, but I figured it was a trade-off for a more in-depth crafting system and/or building system. However, I was disappointed to find out that this was NOT the case. The crafting is very surface-level(and extremely annoying to level). The buildings have very little functionality other than to make your villagers do what they already do, better. Overall, the experience was a bit underwhelming. It was too much of a simulator(and not even a good simulator at that) and not enough of an interactive city-builder, like I thought it would be. I actually bought this game because I played Cities: Skylines and felt that too much based on the simulation and less based around fun, but in the end, this game left with a similar feeling.TLDR: Fun game. Cool art. No depth. Very little content. If I could reccomend a couple things to the developers: -Add more character customization. Instead of trying to build more into the ""job tree"", give each person with that profession a separate talent tree that gives each character some identity and gives you a reason to have more than one of them other than just that their job isn't being taken care of. -Add more functionality to buildings.-Increase villager cap and allow for more space to build on and allow towns to be converted into cities. -Add more tutorial information. Almost all of the stuff I had to learn how to do, was learned via videos. The tutorials taught me very little about how to play the game.P.S. I will be keeping an eye on this game with high hopes that it will be improved in future.			"

Early Access Review
								On its way to becoming a great game, but what game that is exactly remains to be seen.What's in the game now, is playable and fun, but also fairly bare-bones.  A lot of essential features are still missing. Being unable to tear down anything you've built being the big one. But there is a solid foundation and a lot of promise for the future and the devs are great at instilling confidence that they'll get there.Currently the game seems a bit torn between macro and micro management. The devs are constantly struggling with how much they want the game to ""play itself"". You can quickly and easily design custom buildings or plop down existing ones from templates. Farms are plotted out and then self-sufficient. But then you have to go in and tell your carpenter exactly how many beds, doors, chairs, fense posts, etc to make for the buildings you're planning.  Most of the game so far is ""set and forget"" but then you have to keep a close eye on your crafters to keep them producing what you need.  I could do without that part myself. I'd rather be the city planner than micro-manage the supply chain.Combat is very basic right now. You have guards you can make better gear for, and set areas to patrol or attack but you have no direct control over them. It's more about ""were you prepared ahead of time"" than skill or micro-management.  This approach could work I think but there needs to be a lot more to it. Hopefully new additions like ranged combat that are being worked on will do just that.  If not, I think they might do well to have combat be the one area they allow micro management to play a key role in player engagement.One thing is for sure, Team Radiant is handling the game's development very well. Communication is definitely one of their strong points. The community is always in the loop and updates are consistent and substantial. Bugs are common but generally fixed quickly.  I get the impression development has gone substantially slower than they initially anticipated but their commitment to see it through is rock solid.The game seems destined to be good at the very least, so it's an easy recommendation. It just remains to be seen if Radiant has the design chops and polish in them to make it great.			"

								Amazing game, cute characters, nice graphics, bugs everywhere. For being an early access game I say it's great. The devs do a good job updating the game regularly which makes me want to play again and again, sadly I can't keep playing with the same town for long because the game either takes a lot of RAM slowing everything down, or the building system would stop working in the middle of designing a custom building and delete what I've created. Sometimes the farmers won't farm, instead they haul other items letting my crops to rot. I play mostly this game on peaceful because it's relaxing, also there's no monsters jumping at you every minute or so. Enemies should have a spawn area farther away from the settlement because they can appear besides houses or inside the mines which sometimes is annoying. BUT STILL I RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE ITS FRICKING AWESOME, and cute, really cute.			"

								So, I played the game during 13 hours and ended with 13 hearthlings, 5 sheeps and one pet fox (and a hecking huge amount of everything, especially food). After 13 hours, I started to feel like I did everything. But the game is in EA, and is really good at this point. I highly reccomend it to every city-builder/town-manager fan, but be prepared ! The bug windows will drive you nuts ! At first you'll be softhearted because it's an alpha, it needs time... But those red windows spam so often it quickly becomes unbearable ! I wish there was an option to disable them... We don't understand why they appear anyway...Other bugs to repport : - some scaffoldings stay for ever, same for some ladders- road placing is an easy way to get a red windows party (it's soooo bugged)- some items tend to desapear... - Probably more but minor			"

								I don't think people understand the point of early access.If you wan't a complete bug free game don't buy this.Otherwise, If you like town builders... Well come on in, sit down, shut up and enjoy the ride. HOWEVER...I have been with this game since it's first playable release... wait... sorry since it's second playable, you get it.It is charming, and rewarding. You build up each and every buiding as well as Hearthlings (your villagers) for better or for worse. Each Hearthling can be given a job (Blacksmith, Carpenter, Hunter. ect. ect.) and based on some seemingly random stats, they will preform well or just level really slow.  When you have enough food/shelter/wealth - more villagers will start to join you (I swear they just  appear, no idea where they come from) Yes, they level to. They also die as well... which is why it is important to have someone with a sword handy at all times, otherwise the raiding goblins or night creatures... will end the town abruptly. Merchants, mining, farming all that good stuff with many many more features that will be implimented down the road thanks to their successful kickstarter.Now enough fanboying... is this game really worth the purchase? yes. Is it worth it in it's current stat? Sure, and I would recommend buying it LATER if you don't want to deal with small and some major bugs. But if you really understand what the concept of early access means and you aren't a child with mommy and daddy's credit card, then go ahead! Support the devs and then go to their forums to post any bugs you find! Then we can get through this a bit faster to release.BTW to my friend's reading this... get this, there will be co-op and PvP later.			"

								Awesome little city builder with a pretty good system for constructing your own buildingsits one of those games that gives your AI villagers decent autonomy, so you dont really have to micromanage them.the devs are active and as time goes on, ive noticed my little noobs can build more complex structures without bailing half-way through the construction.there are still a few minor issues, but two main ones that ive encountered pretty consistently:- its still difficult, if not impossible, to delete a building design once youve started it, and once youve started the design, its there for good. so if you try to design a building in the middle of town, but mess up on like one of the walls, your better off restarting the game from your most recent save. itll be quicker and actually work, rather than trying to undo what youve done. And sometimes scaffolding will remain forever because your little nubs think theyve completed a building when in fact they have not even come close to it. so the design/construction system def still needs some work.- youll start to run into issues once your little village has a couple dozen citizens. everything will start to slow down simply because of the complexity and demand on your little nooblets. that being said, the devs have been great and every update seems to fix a little bit more. my village can last nearly twice as long without me getting fed up with a stuttering population! so yea, id recommend it but only for like $20 max. wait for a sale, unless you want to support an early access game with active devs ;)10/10 critters stuck on the roof			"

								The best description I can give for this game is that it is like Minecraft if you controlled an entire town.This is a fun game at first, but I don't recommend it right now because the game is far too content light for the price they are asking. The devs are also slow to add content to the game, so their support for this game is quesionable give how long this game has been in early access. Also, the UI can be clunky in places and your townsfolk while mining can trap themselves and die. The game tries to notify you when they're about to die, but it's usually too late. I think they should be able to build ladders themselves and get out of the mine without having to send one of your other people over to build a ladder to get them out. Also, your townspeople will literally work themselves to death if ask them to carry something back to your town from too far away. It seems like these people could say something like ""I'm not strong enough to that"" to prevent accidental deaths or a UI indicator of how far they can go out to carry stuff back without dying. These kind of things are very annoying but you can get new villagers to replace them fairly quickly at least.You can make buildings for your townsfolk, but I don't see a point to it other than you like to build things. There is no weather cycles or seasons yet and the towns folk have no issue with sleeping in beds outdoors and eating outdoors. Buildings take a long time to build and they don't seem to be worth this investment in survival mode. Walls are okay, but monsters tend to bust down your gates rather quickly. The maps are very wide open in places, so the option to build bigger wall sections would be nice.The classes your villagers can become are cool (there's about 10 or so), but there really isn't a lot they can do and many items are there just for cosmetics. Some classes feel much more fleshed out than others currently. I think this feature will be great once it's finished.Still, the game has a lot of charm and I had fun with it while it lasted, but the game in no way feels finished, so buyer beware, it may be a while before this game is done!

Early Access Review
								What if Age of Empires, The Sims, and Minecraft had a baby? Look no farther for the proverbial answer, my dear reader, this is that game. Stonehearth could be easily dismissed among the ocean of voxel sandbox titles. Upon seeing a few screenshots, I had initially confused it with Cube World, a defunct adventure game that died after its foray into early access alpha a few years ago. Games that employ this simplistic art style are a dime a dozen nowadays... however, Cube World this is not. The premise is as follows: make a village and survive against invaders, mine and collect resources, slay bosses, and construct buildings. You are given a starting set of ""Hearthlings"" (think 'Sims') and can name them, assign them classes based on their strengths, build them homes and view their thoughts through the town journal. Naming them after real people made me feel more invested and attached to them. I'm really excited to see if they'll add more procedural interactivity between Hearthlings in the future because there's a very solid base for a great role playing sim here.From the moment I started making my first village, it was clear that Stonehearth is very different -- for better and for worse. Because there aren't other games quite like this out there, there's somewhat of a learning curve. There are different camera views, zoning tools, a custom building mode, mining/gathering/looting modes, managing classes, placing items... it's all quite confusing and somewhat daunting at first. I think I accidentally skipped the tutorial when changing the game settings to fullscreen (it made me restart the game and the tutorial was nowhere to be found).After becoming mostly aquainted with the systems, I began to appreciate how there are some wicked smart minds working on this game. The custom building tool -- while clearly an alpha product due to general wonkiness and a surprising pechant for not letting you delete misplaced things -- is surprisingly robust. It's pretty clear that their goal is ""If you can imagine it, you can build it."" It isn't as time consuming as Minecraft to make a fully custom house, as you can lay the floorplans and everything can be queued up for you, and soon enough you'll watch your little Hearthlings get to work building your masterpieces. On the fastest speed setting (which can only be enabled in the settings), it feels like watching a time lapse. Very fun to see them work.In my experience, I'm left believing that the AI runs on magic. I have no idea how they managed to program pathing, gathering, build-queuing this good... all while running quite well on my 6 years old system. Your workers will always be productive getting done the chores and tasks you've set up for them to do. Of course, they'll stop and tend to their needs from time to time (which only includes taking a lunch break and sleeping... we don't have room for lazy slaves in this kingdom).The team have laid out their broad goals for 2017, which sounds refinement heavy. I've been impressed with their progress thus-far, and updates are frequent.If you have interest in this game: stop hesitating. Once it gets multiplayer in 2018 (my prediction based on their roadmap), this game is going to get a serious cult following. Very impressive alpha.			"

Lots to do in the game with your people management.It has a few things that it needs to work out. There is a strangely sharp dificulty curve when you get to mid-game when the enemies go from trivial to world endingly strong with no middle step. Would be nice to have the game scale better.I would also like to see a dual class system for the people in some fassion.I would also like to see other villages. For example: an enemy village that can be ally, neutral, or eventually and enemy village that are not goblins. I think it would be interesting to have more variety of enemies/difficulties.TLDR?Fun game about building a village and fighting off monsters. More features and ballancing needed, but currently fun and replayable.Cheers			"

I don't know, it's not implemented yet. Also, there are COUNTLESS bugs that I've encountered in game. Not just tiny bugs-the bugs were so bad I had to make a new game a few times.

								Started this game up around 10 PM, ended up playing it all night t'ill 4 AM. This game is very addictive. Think of it as Minecraft, but now you get to control all the miners in the game and set up tasks for them to do. From building hoses to making tunnels it gets very addictive.Only thing I don't like is the progression ladder. To make a blacksmith you need a carpenter, to make a mason hammer to then make a blacksmith hammer at lvl 3. It takes a while to move up the progression ladder and can get a little frustrating setting up the basic professions. Also at this time there are lots of bugs that get your players stuck but there are console commands to move them out when it happens. In the 5 hours I've played I encountered maybe 6-8 bugs/glitches so just a fair warning it is still in alpha, BUT playable. "

								Stonehearth is a (very) cute 3D version of town-building games like Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria, where you must build a thriving settlement whilst fending off invasions and the like. Like Minecraft though, it has the option to play in peaceful mode for those who wish to just focus on the construction side of the game.It should be emphasised that the game IS still in its alpha stages - that means there's only a limited amount of content in it at the moment. To be sure, there's plenty more to come, but this is definitely *early* access. That aside, it's definitely very enjoyable, and the building editor and the like allows for very complex structures to be built already, and a single game can happily last for a few hours before you've reduced the goblins & undead to little more than nuisances.

								I LOVE this game and it's only in alpha. If the game is this awesome at this point, I am super excited to see just how much more awersome it'll become. At first I was hesitant to fork out $25 for a game this early in developement, but after reading the shining reviews of others, I was like, ""well okay. why not? I adore these types of games"". and let me tell you, I have not been disappointed. There was a bit of a learning curve in the beginning, but just googling the game for faqs fixes that quickly.  Keep up the good work and keep the updates coming! You guys are doing an amazing job!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is so great. It's fun, cute, but also challenging at times. The dev team is extremely receptive to feedback from players and maintain regular contact with their fanbase as well as transparency. When this game was first released, it was very buggy--as to be expected in alpha. And while bugs still remain, the foundation is becoming quite solid and gamebreaking bugs more and more rare. Stonehearth is beginning to take shape into the epic and memorable game it was designed to be, and the love and dedication of this team of devs really shows.Although it is Early Access, I feel like it's one of the better EA titles out there, and I strongly urge those interested to buy it and show support.

								I haven`t played this game for so long, but i have played it long enough to recomend it.I usally dont write a review for games on steam, but whit this game im making the exception, i know the game could use some more improvements, but it is still in early access, so from my point of view this game is awesome.It is a medival time minecraft/city builder, and if you do love building, dont skipp on this product, yea sure check it up, watch some vids on it, get some more info on the game, what can you do in it that you like, is this really something for you, if it`s not for you im not forcing you to get it.The devs sayed in the info box of why early access, that the game will be 8-12 months in early access, and in two weeks the game will have been on steam for a year, so it`s not long untill the egg cracks and a new life begins, because that's exactly what will happen when the game finally crawls out of early access. and i do see the bright future for this game, as i hope you will.

								I really enjoy this game! There so many opportunities and only creativity seems to be the limit. Im looking forward to every update the devs spit out - and the Alpha 11 seems VERY promising! :) I do need some way to control the Heartlings, like ""Go to"" and ""Priority on this job"". Stuff like that. That being said, this game gets a huge thumbs up - and I cant wait for the next updates!			"

Early Access Review
								Alpha 21 Review:I backed this game on kick starter (2012) because it looked like a neat take on dwarf fortress or towns.  The cute little 3d voxel guys with destructable 3d voxel terrain and customizable voxel 3d buildings and forts, I was sold.  I have played the Alpha on and off for years, and I have waited patiently for a working voxel based town simulator that allows me to create neat buildings with little 3d voxels.  So here is my review, because the game should have been finished back in 2014, according to the kick starter page.Is it like Dwarf Fortress?  -No.  You have much more control over your people in SH, and you only get 20 people...Is it like Gnomoria? -No.  Gnomoria is closer to DF, and SH is nowhere near the oh crap feeling of running out of food and everyone dies.Is it like Towns? -Similar, but watered down.  Less jobs, promoting is painfully slow and the level up system is annoying.  SH doesn't have the dungeon diving that Towns has.  SH more or less keeps you on the surface and you are raided just about every day by very annoying enemies.  Dang near have to keep an army on hand to repel attackers, or build a giant wall around your settlement with a simple door...yes, a door, keeps enemies out.  The devs haven't added the ability for AI to bash or bipass doors in..years.Pros: It's cute, stable enough on common alpha builds to play for a time with little to no serious issues, save the occasional CTD, annoying debug error popups, or the dreaded slowing down of the game when you have 20 peasants all moving around.  Though I have a good rig, so it isn't too bad.  The building of towns or forts can be fun, but it's also tedious and frustrating at times.Some things have improved, like AI path finding, which was terrible in early alpha versions, UI / presentation, stability, and overall performance, which used to be terrible but isn't too bad until late game.  However, many other key aspects of the game have actually gotten WORSE over the course of development.  Primarily, the very feature that got me to back it in the first place, designing and building custom buildings.  CONS:This is one of the few titles that has seemed to go one step forward, and two steps back.  What's more, the developer continuously makes excuses and dumps money in useless quests, presentation, and blatantly feminist artwork.  Most every picture features a woman being in the position of authority or strength and the male is subservient, but that's just personal taste, I don't appreciate feminism or cultural marxism in my games, and feel with the times, it's necessary to warn people that do not want to support such things, or support it, your choice.I was furious when one of the Cannon brothers made the comment to me that not everyone agrees that the editor is a key feature, so it isn't a priority, back in 2014.  Yet over the years, I have seen hundreds of people complain about the editor's bugs and features being removed, not fixed, from the game.  Many of the original promised goals have yet to be implemented in the game, which has been in development for over 5 years now.  With each new Alpha build, a few new tweaks are added, but nothing mind boggling, or remotely close to what was promised ever surfaces.  Like multiplayer, seasons, or a building editor that allows you to modify completed structures or delete walls.Funny that you used to be able to disassemble houses, even re-design houses or erase features.  The feature was bugged, like workers get stuck, are unable to get all the blocks, or AI can't pathfind and the project sits idle and is ignored.  Instead of fixing these things, it was just scrapped in order to add cool things (sarcasm) like, leveling up your workers, constantly being wiped out by hordes of annoying goblins on day four, or re-arranging the UI for the 18,000th time. Come to think of it, I still haven't received my kick starter backer pet reward.Overall, this game could have been really really awesome.  But progress has been really slow going.  So I will not recommend this game to friends unless I see significant improvement.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DRA great Village building game with mechanics similar to Minecraft, Banished and Dwarf Fortress. Well worth the money asked. Developers are HEAVILY involved in development and community relations, along with consistant and crisp graphics.The community of Stonehearth show how amazing this game is, and how much potential the developers have.---------Where do I start on this brilliant game? I've been watching this EA game since Alpha 2, and have finally decided to buy it. There are hundreds of pros and minimal cons. It is well worth the money asked for (you could wait until the summer sales heil gabeN) Or you can spend it right now!Pros:- The DevelopersThe developers are heavily community focused, implenting features people think would suit the game, as well as fixing game breaking bugs that are encountered. They do frequent updates (Around one every few weeks) and keep the community informed with ""Desktop Tuesdays"" where they show off new features being implented- Beutiful GraphicsI don't often judge a game by it's graphics. But this is an amazing exception. The graphics are smooth, clear, and crisp, it often reminds me of Minecraft (minus the 16 bit textures) due to its simplicity. The graphics are consistent, and don't randomly change with updates.- The CommunityThe community is very well knit, and are welcoming of new players. You can often find them helping new players settle in to the world of Stonehearth, and help solve problems with bug fixes.Cons- CrashesLike most EA games, there are lots of crashes, there are a few crashes here and there, but if you remembered to save, you're in luck, they've recently added an autosave feature, which is absolutely brilliant, to make up for these crashes. They can be often caused by new features (the 64 bit update) - Steep learning curveLike Banished, it's going to take A LOT of tries to hit the ground running, but after learning why and where you went wrong, it gets a lot easier (my current ""village"" is on 40 hearthlings) and eventually you will end up with a small town.- AIThe AI in this game can be, at times, tedious, often when you mark a place to be deforested, they cut it down, but refuse to transport it to a stockpile (knowing me this will be the problem on my end), but eventually they get around to it.CONCLUSIONI believe that this game has a HUGE potential, and that the developers are prime examples of what should be the norm in the game industry (I'm looking at you EA) The community is one of the huge aspects of this game, there is some mod support, but sadly most are either broken or outdated. This game is well worth the £19 asked, with many features still to come.			"

								Currently in Alpha 11, StoneHearth shows promise. This said, It is in  ALPHA, and there is bound to be glitches. There is a pluthera of content, easy to learn controls, A cute and innocent atmosphere, and other appealing aspects. But, If you are playing the game for around a hour, without pausing and saving, the HUD will dissappear, and you cannot pause and save, making the only move you can make hitting the red X in the top right corner. It is a great game, but an autosave feature would be greatly beneficial.			"

								okay starting off with i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. but there are some things in it that are so annoyingly painful i straight up quit due to lack of control. i understand the ai needs its own personality and the npc's need to do their own thing, but when i have to keep my hearthlings in my base with the alarm because whenever i take it off they want to run out into a goblin camp and loot that log of wood, even though i cancled tasks in that area, i dont get a choice in their decision, so 1 by 1 they run out to loot something random even with haul, mine, job, off they refuse to listen, and because they go out to loot, my 2 footmen with 1/4 health decided to back him up and they all drop dead. would really enjoy a ""no enter"" zone for your characters to avoid (or even better a no civ zone and a no anyone zone) i like where this game is heading, but the ai is to off on its own to make it a game worth playing anymore. i still recommend this game to people because i can see how good the potential is in it. hopefully things get sorted out. good luck			"

								Add more minerals, that can be crafted into items, and used in trading and equippment, also some differnet types of weapons would be appreciated, like a bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 3, a long bow, crafted by the carpenter lvl 6, a crossbow, crafted by a blacksmith lvl 5 or 6, maybe add muskets eventually, they could be crafted by a gunsmith, or blacksmith, the gunsmith could also craft turrents that could be placed and manned by some of your people, like catapults, very unaccurate but do moderate damage, and a cannon, very expensive to build and a lot of damge, moderate accuracy, and add some more variety of crops, like cucumbers, potatoes, beans, squash, u know a small variety, and of course bacon/pigs, beef,cows, and maybe you could add hourses, they could be ridden by soldiers, or put to work on a farm, give them a plow and the farmer can seed and plow alot faster. oh and add fishing, with small boats that can float along lakes, that way the rivers are at least useful.

								An entertaining, calming, slow-paced little village manager. I have fun with it when I play it (rare as that may be). However, development has been extremely slow. Gameplay promises from two years ago have still not been fulfilled. It's riddled with game-breaking bugs. Once you start a new game, it's only a matter of time before something goes wrong that you can't just ignore or build around. In its current state, it's nothing more than an expensive time waster. Currently, the game is definitely not worth the price they're asking, so I unfortunately cannot recommend it despite the moderate amount of fun that can be had with it. Grab it if it's on sale for 50% off or more.			"

								I've been playing the alpha since about 4 or 5.In terms of the gameplay and potential....it's great. Basically what I had hoped Castle Story would be.  It has a long way to go, but it's organized and consistently improving. The Devs may not be the fastest, but they're /far/ from the slowest. Best of all, there's been an exponential curve in development and things have been picking up pace without major missteps.  The roadmap has held up and progress makes sense.  Dev isn't as fast as weekly content additions, but I have complete faith in the management of this team and the game seems deep and well-thought out...modding potential should be epic.			"

This was with max setting. After a quick restart it dropped down to 4 GB ram and less than 1 vram.It is still early access so you cant expect it to feel like a fully polished game.

								A good rounded game that gets recommendation because of how good it will be when finished. You can easily sink 10 hours into the game before even beginning to reach the point when you'll run out of things to do. Right now the game has very frustrating bugs and gameplay progress issues that stunt long term gameplay. But i still think anyone interested in the game or the genre should buy it now. It is good enough to play and it's fun watching the game progress, with regular alpha updates and close communicastion between the devs and community. If you have any doubts just check out the subreddit r/stonehearth to see the very active community.Considering there are less than 10 devs working on it the project is moving forward very fast to the point you can keep up with almost daily updates and watch the game progress. Join the movement now it is definitely worth it :)			"

								=HEADS UP=Early Access Review. The game is not finished yet but still worth the price.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]=REVIEW=First i just have to say how happy i am that this game finally hits Steam. It was on Greenlight for a while and now finally it is on Steam. I have gotten the game before over kickstarter and i am just going to say that i usually dont get things over kickstarter. For me kickstarter was always a big risk and i never wanted to take that risk. But with this game it was completly different. The cute style and the idea behind it made it to something i just wanted to have.The game overall is a normal little Building/Survival Sim. You have a certain amount of Settlers when you begin and start with nothing but a fire and a Townsflag. Over the time you build up your village and go up the steps towards a city. Mining, Smithing, Farming and even Fighting is already included in this and makes the whole experience already alot better than it looks on the pictures, even though they look quite good. (<3)I cannot say how much i love this litte piece of art. This is one of those games where the devs really sit behind their game. And i am not saying this just like that. First before buying the game i had a chat with one of the Devs and i gotta say that i enjoyed it. After buying it i found a bug to submit and it got rid of right away with the next patch that came a few days after the report.This game has a big future. Please whoever reads this: Be part of this future because i am sure that you will love it!			"

								Great game, I would completely recommend it, except the ""Idle Bug"" makes it unplayable once you have more than 10 citizens. For people unfamiliar with the game, the LUA/Pathfinding increases in memory usage until your citizens stop moving, building, or completing any actions, so the game comes to a complete stop. It's happening to pretty much everyone in the community, people are complaining on the forums, and in a recent Twitch stream the game developers have stated that fixing it ""isn't a priority for them"", instead they want to add staircases(?). With the current development cycle it will probably be a couple years before this is playable and I can fully recommend it.			"

								I have preordered and bought into a variety of different early access games, and Stonehearth is the one of the first few where I feel like I got my money's worth, or at least, will. Though there is currently not much content, I have been quite content (see what I did there) with the game's current state and the direction it is going in. The game has a fantastic community and set of developers that are all intent on making this the best it can be.Now, to the actual game:It is a townbuilding game, like dwarf fortress or towns, with combat elements, random scenarios, specialized workers, mining mechanics, and, of course, housebuilding. I must also say that this game can be very relaxing thanks to its laid back theme and fitting music.Because of it's early state, there are a variety of hilarious but also game breaking bugs. If you are easily frustrated by bugs and do not want to deal with bugs, I would recommend waiting until later to get the game.I must also state that this game opened to steam early access on my birthday, so I am only slightly (completely) biased. Nonetheless, it looks like it will grow into a great game!			"

								Up's:- Great gameplay. An unusual kind of strategy, but lots of fun.- That cubic look. Graphics and shaders are well done.- Aspiring for early accessDown's:- Gets boring quick-ish. It content-caps after a while. (personal opinion - there's a large creative aspect of the game)- Combat + Turrets. While combat looks nice, managing your soldiers could use some love. Turret caps is a nice feature, but could do without. (might change - gameplay feature)- Increasingly processing intensive. When you play for a while, and start getting a few villagers, it laggs more. (might get tweaked - not for low end pc's)- Pathfinding is edgy (will probably get tweaked)- AI could do with some love (will probably get tweaked)- Lots of bugs (will most likely get tweaked)Overall: Nice work for early access - Definitely wort the money, or it will be.

								TL;DR1. Open and honest Dev team2. Game is genuinly fun3. Endless possibilities for its finished potential4. Mod support is a thingI have been a supporter of this game since the kickstarter campaign. It has gone through some very rough, very unpolished builds (seeing as this is currently in alpha 11), but the progress is constant. Each update comes in a timely manner and each one is noteworthy. The devs are open and honest about who is doing what and when things are likely to happen. If there is a setback they will tell you. This in of itself is a massive selling point for this game, just look at the mess that is Godus for a comparison. Regarding the game itself, its what I always wanted in a voxel style game; the freedom to create a city/kingdom from the ground up with my own unique band of citizens.Building is fun; you can follow a few set blueprints or make your own from scratch. As the game develops you will eventually be able to make massive castles, but for the current version as of june 2015 multi-story buildings are the new thing.Combat and resource gathering are about what you would expect, but agian this game is in its early stages and will become deeper as builds go on. Some of the stretch goals filled include elemental enemies and several magic using classes of hearthling. It is still in its early stages, but with the team behind it I am confident the potential will be realised. Another commendation to the dev team behind this game is that from the outset they have encouraged modding. In the future I would not be surprised if the modding community embraced this game like they do bethesda games. In closing, its a great game with a great team behind it and its only going to get better as it develops. Grab it now and become part of the community and help the devs out, because you will be hearing about this game in the future, and you will want it then anyway. Happy hearthing.			"

								=HEADS UP=Early Access Review. The game is not finished yet but still worth the price.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]=REVIEW=First i just have to say how happy i am that this game finally hits Steam. It was on Greenlight for a while and now finally it is on Steam. I have gotten the game before over kickstarter and i am just going to say that i usually dont get things over kickstarter. For me kickstarter was always a big risk and i never wanted to take that risk. But with this game it was completly different. The cute style and the idea behind it made it to something i just wanted to have.The game overall is a normal little Building/Survival Sim. You have a certain amount of Settlers when you begin and start with nothing but a fire and a Townsflag. Over the time you build up your village and go up the steps towards a city. Mining, Smithing, Farming and even Fighting is already included in this and makes the whole experience already alot better than it looks on the pictures, even though they look quite good. (<3)I cannot say how much i love this litte piece of art. This is one of those games where the devs really sit behind their game. And i am not saying this just like that. First before buying the game i had a chat with one of the Devs and i gotta say that i enjoyed it. After buying it i found a bug to submit and it got rid of right away with the next patch that came a few days after the report.This game has a big future. Please whoever reads this: Be part of this future because i am sure that you will love it!			"

								I LOVE THIS GAME ITS ENJOYABLE AND I LOVE SPENDING HOLIDAYS ADDICTED TO IT! also a few ideas for a new update i suggest adding a PRIORITY feature where you can choose what things need to be done firstusing a tab next to the move and undeploy menu but for non placed objects and non finished jobsfor example you want them to mine but they are collecting items you could set the priority scale up for the mining and they would stop what their doing and mine i think it would be a good ideaanother good idea is improving water physics and adding multiplayer with friends and online modein the update for water it would add  an upgrade for the weaver allowing them to make sails and later upgrade to a traderthis could allow you to trade with friends towns the carpenter would make a boat and then he sails can be appliedtheir would also be cannons for the ship to defend itself from water based enemys such as sea monsters , vikings and pirates their would be nautical based clothing for the trader made by weavers and they will have cutlasses and flintlocks made by the blacksmith(cutlass) and engineer ( flitlocks (require gunpowder that will be dropped from pirate ships))the traders work by giving them items to trade and you can set the price ( with max and minimum prices) and when set off they can trade to players in online mode (singleplayer but allows you to access trading with online players) it will show the name of who is selling and you must be online and active to buy things when your traders are out,then you set the destination ( pick random player or online friends who are playing the game)set the trader off and soon they will return ( a day or 2) with money and other itemsif attacked by enemys or online players pirates if the fail to defend (sink enemy ship) they will loose 70 percent of items and  have a 50 percent chance to loose hearthlingsthe surviving hearthlings (on low health) and a few items will arive back in a row boat and will be hungry.players pirates work by sending them off, you will get alerts telling you that there is a boat if you choose to attack it you can steal some of their stuff once done you can retrieve the items for money (depending on the value of the stuff)i hope you consider my ideas and impliment them into the game!

								Up's:- Great gameplay. An unusual kind of strategy, but lots of fun.- That cubic look. Graphics and shaders are well done.- Aspiring for early accessDown's:- Gets boring quick-ish. It content-caps after a while. (personal opinion - there's a large creative aspect of the game)- Combat + Turrets. While combat looks nice, managing your soldiers could use some love. Turret caps is a nice feature, but could do without. (might change - gameplay feature)- Increasingly processing intensive. When you play for a while, and start getting a few villagers, it laggs more. (might get tweaked - not for low end pc's)- Pathfinding is edgy (will probably get tweaked)- AI could do with some love (will probably get tweaked)- Lots of bugs (will most likely get tweaked)Overall: Nice work for early access - Definitely wort the money, or it will be.

								This game is amazing. I usually don't spend a lot of time on town managment games, but I was surprised at how addictive this game is. the vox style really gives the game some charm, every charecter is important in some way or form, and it's really noticable. doing simple things like building doors or making improvments to buildings feels really accomplishing, and the game, even in it's dull moments, still keeps my eye.the onyl cons are: it runs on lua script, so once things start to get hectic, expect the game too go through some hiccups. there are a lot of bugs (early access, duh.) so don't expect the best user stability ever. the game also doesn't hold your hand, so you may have to go through some guides or figure out how things work on your own.this game has a lot of promise, and I would love to see it's full form.

								""Great game!"" - 4/5This is a great game and I love playing it! Though as the towns get larger and you start getting more people a memory leak starts to occur and the game slowly becomes unplayable. Its not as though the game is laggy at all its more like as you play through the game you notice that some of the npc's dont do their job at all. You think that's werid... Normally I would restart my client and it would fix it for around 5 minutes but after that it would start to happen again. I feel like if you could fix that I would love to make a series on this game showing the expansion of a mighty kingdom!If you are looking to get this game I do recommend it as you can get some really good fun out of it!Thanks! ~Creative			"

								I actually wrote this, hoping to try and get some sort of suggestion out.. The game itself.. Is pretty nice, however.. You've got to admit that it has loads of flaws in it.. And one of them starts to shine through best when you try and play in hard mode. Makes it (almost) impossible to get off to a good start in that game mode, and will really start to have you wondering exactly how stupid your hearthlings are...Anyways.. the game needs some sort of way to prioritze things.. No.. I'm not meaning the little switches that say ""This person should do farm, while this person builds."" I'm meaning ""Hey you stupid piece of meat, go pick up that herb. RIGHT NOW so that I can make an Herbalist or a potion."" Without a way to give some sort of priority to what your hearthlings will gather.. Those who like to setup their villages to have a lot to do, won't usually have very much fun in hard mode.. If you try to plan too far ahead, the game will punish you greatly. As there doesn't seem to be a way to instruct your hearthlings to even drop all of their current queued projects.. And that is probably the most simple way to fix the issue.. It would suck to have to command your hearthlings to get back at it.. But It's better than having all of your starting hearthlings die, because you instructed them to build a house and they don't want to stop building that house to go get a herb until they're dead...For crying out loud.. I told them to go gather some wild herbs, and had a farmer working on growing some herbs, and he ALMOST finished growing the herbs by the time my gatherers brought the herb into town... But to my surprise, they STILL WOULDN'T GATHER IT!Either the AI need improved to recognize that a lack of items is bad, and make it so that getting items that are currently set at 0 is more important than carrying back the wood that you have 500 of or there needs to be a way to prioritize certain tasks.. Like by holding shift and telling them to gather this item.. They know that is more important to do than anything else.. Or even a way to over-ride it and say ""This needs to be done first."" Alternatively.. Like I said.. a way to tell your hearthlings to stop EVERYTHING. could work as well.Maybe some of this is already in the game and I'm just not seeing it.. But before a hard mode can really be explored too much, little simple things like this really need to be fixed.. Even if there is a way to clear all commands.. A priority system would go leagues and bounds beyond it.. and make the game feel more professional as well.			"

I have only been playing for a small amount of time but to me the game is extremelly entiretaning. I have only had a few problems with the game likeAfter being raided i could not pick up the wood or other items that they had picked up after i had killed themAfter mining for a while for some reason i could not gather any of the ore that i mined so now i just have a giant pile of iron ore that i can not even touch.There are some more problems but none are coming to my head.

								Stonehearth is a management sim where the goal is to create a thriving settlement. While it's a little feature-bare in it's current, in-development state, it's got a smart, minecrafty voxel system that lets you completely customize all elements of your settlement. The game also has decent performance and seems to be developed by a competent dev team. Which is, y'know, rare for a kickstartered early access game.It's also built to support modding! That's always good.			"

								The dev team for this game are very good - the best ive seen for this genre of game. Development is promising, and the game itself is continually growing. I love this kind of game, however, in its current state, stonehearth is probably worth between $5 and $10.The game is very easy - I've so far been able to repel every attack, destroy every enemy base etc with two soldiers (I might have been overdoing it adding the second soldier, too!). Building is very bugged - I've had to cancel innumerable buildings as my villagers couldnt construct certain things or have gotten themselves stuck whilst trying. Being able to watch individual pieces on your building be placed by your citizens is cool but has lead to so many issues when actually performing this key functionality.Progression is basic and unfulfilling - you are a fully self-sustaining within 1-3 days of in-game time. Sure, this might not be a problem, as the game may intend to focus on thriving rather than surviving. However, thriving is impossible as the game cannot seem to handle having >12 citizens (at such numbers, you will see a lot of idling, and citizens with professions flat refusing to do their allocated job whilst there are other things to do - and no, the citizen management screen does not resolve these issues).Keep it on your watchlist, but unless you are looking for a very surface-level experience, steer clear until further down the development cycle.

								If you are into city buidling games, farming,  creating your own army, job management, etc, this game does a very well job presenting the genre of city builders.  The art style has a very cartoonish feel, at the same time giving the game its own charm; style that cannont be replicated by any other city building games out on the market right now. There is a lot of flexibility on how you want to manage your new village/town/city/empire and however you want to play it. With the plethora amount of new villagers coming into your town, you will find that there are many jobs that you can assign each Hearlthing. Build your own army to fight off hordes of Goblins and other such monsters. Loot from your enemies after you slay them and use the resources to help further expand your empire. There are also a variety of landscapes and even races of humans you can choose from; even more hours to explore how you want to play. While the idea of all this sounds great on paper, Stonehearth manages to crumble all those dreams.  Yes you will have fun playing this game and yes you will enjoy the many hours playing this game. However, the one thing this game suffers greatly is the amount of bugs and gamebreaking bugs this game has. It gives Early Acess the perfect meaning of unfinished game, but somehow manages to make it even sound worse. The major bugs I have encounter mostly revolves around trying to build houses. More specifically customized buildings you try to build are very much broken and have been since the start of this game. Builders will continue to remove and build ladders to reach higher areas of the buidling, and be in an infinite loops doing this. Sometimes they will continue doing this until the building is destroyed or if you somehow make the AI build other buildings instead. Also you cannot destroy certain buildings, it doesn't even explain why it cannot be destroyed. It could also be because the way customizing your own building could be broken as hell.One of the most essential mechanic of this game is broken and that's where I draw the line. A game that focus primarily on creating buildings is broken. Instead of the developers trying to fix this, they release more updates on combat and focusing so much into that. It is quite sad actually, made me not want to play this game for a while. I even contacted the developers about this bug, and they know it exists, they just dont want to do anything about it for now. Many other players also complain about this same exact bug. The only answer they gave me is to use console and to type in commands to instant build and instant destroy. Using a game's console to play a game, to even enjoy it is quite appalling to even hear, but that is the ONLY way to play this game without ripping your hair out of your head.I've had a few problems with combat, but it mostly had to do with the Battle music playing in an infinite loop. Other than that the combat is fine and I have no problem with that. Farming, Smithing, Crafting, Etc. are all fine as well No problems there. StoneHearth is a great idea, I really really really really want to say this game is a Great game. I wish, but this game is not great, this game sucks, this game is garbage. this game needs hate rather than love to show the developers they need to change and fix their game. I always look at this game every week to see if there is an update, JUST MAYBE SOMEDAY THIS GAME WILL WORK PERFECT. Don't buy this game until the bugs are fixed, don't even recommend or even mention this game to anyone. This game has the potential being the New way of playing city builders. The Next grounbreaking sim city game, it has that potential, THE DEVELOPERS NEED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS GAME. I know this game has the potential to have a large following, just fix the game.			"

								Stonehearth is a game that has a lot of sources of inspiration, most noticeably Dwarf Fortress, but also old RPGs like Final-Fantasy-Tactics. Stonehearth wears its inspirations on its sleeve but has its own unique charm and play style.Stonehearth is, as is described by its creators, ""a game about exploration and survival in an epic fantasy setting where your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land"". In other words, your goal is to help a group of settlers (or ""hearthlings"" as they are called) to create a colony. You are the mind beyond the operation, you do not control your hearthling directly, you lay out the general plan (mine, build, etc) and your hearthlings commit your plans by themselves. There are also a few RPG elements in the game, like a job three, levels, stats and percs.Two things that i really like about the game are the art style and the emphasis on modding. The devs of the game have built their own game engine with emphasis on modding, which can only increase the lifespan of the game. The game has a really easy to use, and nice looking GUI. the animations are cute and i really like the character design. there is a lot of small things that makes the style of the game charming. The last thing i would like to mention is the awesome community that as been created around the game. since the kickstarter days the game has come a long way, the devs are active in the forums and are actively engaging with the community, they even stream the game development 3 days a week on twitch! All in all the game is very promising, and even though it is missing features it's very fun in is current state. it has a long way to go but I'm really hopeful for its future. if you like what you see give it a try!

								This game is on the road to success. I have been following this game since it was announced on Kickstarter and am very happy with where this game is going. The Developers are very committed to going the distance and listen to their fans 24/7,Now for the gameplay currently it has enough for you to get a basic Idea of what the game is. You will be able to design your own town however you want by gathering resources and deal with goblins, zombies, and Skeletons invading during the night. You will promote your workers (hearthlings) to gain more food or build certain items. Now I know that doesnt sound like much but getting to play with all the different types of layouts, buildings, and designs is enough fun to make you play for hours. Of course this game is not complete so you will find bugs which many of us players have been reporting in.We the players also have the important job of reporting bugs and telling the Developers what we would like to see next. We would love to have you join our community on the Stonehearth discourse website and hear what you would want to see or problems that you are having that should be fixed. The developers are working hard so the game will have big updates every 4-8 weeks which gives you a reason to keep coming back for more.			"

								I've been playing StoneHearth since the first alpha release, it's come a long way since then and with more core parts of the game being done it's coming even further even faster. Don't get me wrong, it's still lacking on a few fronts, content, performance and so on, but each alpha release is improving on that. If you're not here to support a game in an Early Access state, click the Follow button instead of Add To Cart. Wait a little longer then check back.At the moment it shows a hell of a lot of promise, moving forward it's going to get even better! and THAT is what i'm looking forward to.			"

Dont Listen to others saying steep price for little content i dissagree completly anyone remember TITAN FALL, paid 60 for it and played the beta was hyped for it thinking great beta didnt realize that was the actual full game. Anyway this game is well done and being updated at a steady pace. For those who say it crashes there computer i dont know what they are running but mine is a amd build old build Phenom 955 3.2 Quad with a Nvidia GTX 560 ti 2gb DDR5 and 16gb DDR3 at 800mhz none of my build is overclocked and it runs the game on perfect settings. Yes bugs appear as you can see with any alpha game has not crashed yet though. I stream this game to Twitch and Put the Videos on Youtube so while streaming and uploading if it has not crashed my game yet then i say good work to them better than most triple AAA titles anymore. For a ALPHA GAME its fun and well worth the investment. Pick it up and Support the 3rd party DEVS that put their heart and soles into these titles.			"

								This is a highly enjoyable, in development, town building game. I have spent many hours building towns, learning the game, and enjoying the new game aspects they are adding from patch to patch as well as the bug fixes.With all of the good things however, there are a few bad.- The map generation takes quite a while per map roll (time consuming when looking for specific setups)- Save files are not compatible with updates, meaning you will need to restart each time there's an updateThese two things are not game breaking major, and they are wanting to implement the backward compatibility with save files, to prevent the need to constantly restart with updates, so it should no longer be a problem when they implement it.This game offers unique textures and means to build your town as well as prevents the need to have them always be building whatever is placed, which helps prevent accidents. This lets you build roads, houses, and other structures the way you want it. Do you want a flat area? Doable, do you want a roof-less house? Doable. Multi-structured mansion? Doable. Throw your guys in a hole and never able to get out? This can also be done, and those who are fans of the Tycoon games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, you will be familiar with the ability to trap your visitors where they cannot leave, or killing them with rides. Make this your own experience with the city and enjoy yourself as you do so.I will modify and go into more detail with this review as time goes on and as the game develops.Update 11/27/2015:This game has received quite a few updates since the original review. They have added the ability to create multi-tiered structures in the game, however this feature is a bit wonky and not 100% working in my opinion, as the settlers will often fail to build the bottom half of the house before the upper half or not build the building at all. They have also improved the errors that may happen in the game - if something were to bug out, it is no longer in a nasty developer box, but rather something a bit more user friendly to understand and depending on what fails, offers instructions on fixing the issue.There are some present AI issues in the game that can make it a bit frustrating to have a large amount of tasks, I've been able to circumvent this issue in the developer versions of Alpha 13 - which is said to fix the AI issues in regards to building, etc, but may not be 100% done yet - by removing the request and redoing it or suspending/pausing the task then resuming it. Assuming there isnt still a ton of things already requested for them to do, they often figure out that it still needs to be completed. The game is still very much in a playable state and I still highly enjoy it and my original review still stands at this point in time. They are making progres toward finishing the game and adding features. Please note that at the time of this update, that saves are still not backward/forward compatible. And my original con of the map generation taking a lot of time still stands as well, but it feels a bit faster than it once was.A few other major things they've added are a new style of settler and a new map biome type - the desert and raya's children. I've been able to play around with them in the developer build and its a very interesting change of pace to the normal gameplay that I had grown to love. This in combination with new professions and crafting systems in place permit for a more diverse and intricate creation system, making it feel like the crafters actually rely on each other to make the final product rather than it being a one man army. They have also vastly improved the game experience with making it run faster on my machine, and offering various options to help with slower/older machines as well as bug fixes. I haven't had massive bugs in regards to the UI or other pop-ups outside of one where I was clicking on buttons rapidly.So let me mark off my cons at this point in time in regards to Alpha 12/Dev Alpha 13:- Some AI issues in regards to tasks where they fail to complete (see above for my solution and some info)- Map generation still takes too much time- Save files are still not backward/forward compatibleThis said, let me list some pros of this game thus far- Multi-tiered structures- Intricate crafting system- Ability to trap your settlers- Aggressive (normal surviving) & Peaceful mode (for building)- Various travelling merchantsThere's a lot more as well that I would list off but this review would end up to be too long.

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth seems (even after about a year) very much still in the concept stage.  There's not much game here yet, but you can tell the devs are seriously devoted to making Stonehearth the best they can make it.  Even in this early stage you can tell it's the most charming, enjoyable 'concept' of a game out there (check my hours, and that's just through Steam).The devs work closely with the community every step of the way and are immediately responsive to most all bug reports and suggestions.The only caveat I can think of, is that it has been a long, long time getting to even where it is now, and it still has a long long way to go.  I do think it will get there and I have the utmost faith in the devs, but don't expect it in a mere few months.Your money invested here is not to have a fleshed out playable game today or tomorrow, but to help ensure the devs can make Stonehearth all it can be.  You won't have a game you can play day in and day out... just yet.. but it will happen and it will be wonderful.Edit:  I've changed my recommendation to NO for the time being.  There's just too little game here for the high price they're charging.  That high price was fine for kickstarter where you were investing, but now they're selling it on Steam and there just isn't much of a game here for that kind of money.  I also have concerns about how long development is taking.  Don't forget, this game has been in development for two years before it hit Steam early access. Over two years now and frankly, not much has happened for such a long dev cycle.  I honestly think the devs have gotten in over their heads and don't quite know how to dig themselves out of this hole.I'll happily change to Recommended when I see this game kick into high gear, but for now, it's 'wait and see'.Update:  I have to say after ANOTHER YEAR, the devs continue to dig themselve into a hole over their overly complicated approach to hearthling building process - to the detriment of the rest of the game.  The devs seem not to know they are fighting a loosing battle with the manual building process they've tried to implement.  A process so inherently complicated NASA couldn't figure it out.  But still they persist.I'm afraid the game will go nowhere now.  All the 'positive' reviews are based on just a few hours play time and ignore the deep-seated issue of a building process in the game that doesn't work.We could have had the nice rolling hills we were promised early on instead of the 'cliff' design we have now because it was easier.  If all the dev time was applied to landscape rather than this sink hole they've gotten themselves into with building, we'd have a glorious game by now.  And a finsished one.			"

								Great game for alpha. yes bugs, yes some people have crashes, thats all expected. But i'm afraid for myself personally, that after night 10-15 I've run out of anything to do. You build houses, and then........ um..... well thats it. Even on the ""survival mode"" you can get by the entire survival mode with 1-2 warriors. Or just build a wall or a fence and you've outsmarted the game.Only thing i've found lately to make it a bit more challenging, is to increase the number of goblins or undead attacking me to keep it difficult. After about day 15 or so the workers kind of stop caring as much about getting things done, they also seem to get confused with where their food is even when theres a stockpile next door to them. I'm personally having a hard time with the food concept of the game, and NO I dont want it to be a sim. But why do I need 18 acres full of food to get one more person? No one eats much but for some reason I need SO MUCH FOOD. I feel like this game doesnt have any point after you made your first couple cute houses and made room for all the food you will need to get more people so you can...... so you can have more people to.... to build more houses.. well you get the picture. Can't reccomend in current state or for that price. Look forward to see what's on the horizon for this game. I hope it doesnt end up like Castle Story.			"

Early Access Review
								Oooooookay!!! Here is my review, I'm very torn over this game and its for this reason. BUGS. The game isn't ""broken"", even in pre-alpha. It is a very playable and fun game IF you can make it long enough without a UI or engine crash, Bear with me as this is kind of long, but very worth the read if you want an HONEST review of the product youre buying Pros:*SUPER FUN- Ive played many RPG's, RTS's, etc. but this game is one of the most mind numbingly addicting games I have ever played.*Complete Sandbox- Like Minecraft, but better.*Ranking Systems- Hearthlings rank up in their profession, giving them cool perks.*Versatility- Plotting out farmland, building houses around designated land, etc. You build YOUR town how YOU want. To a point at this stage in the game.*GEAR- I love love love the armor and weapon progression for your soldiers*Custom building- You arent stuck to templates, although they are provided. Cons:*BUGGY AF- Remember, it's still in alpha. However, nothing is more frustrating than getting so far into a game then recieving a pop-up ""UI Crash"" report. Seems to happen every hour. Villagers glitch into walls, they wander off miles just to collect random sh*t on the ground, usually dying in the process. They sit and DIE when being attacked. Guards don't wake up from sleep to respond to threats.... this is a big deal when invaders come at NIGHT only and all of your guards are sleeping. Needless to say, the bugs make the game frustrating as hell at times. Once, my entire village got stuck in defense mode, starving to death looking out for enemies that weren't there. *LACK OF EDITING- after or during building process. This is probably the single handedly most frustrating aspect of this game. If you design a massive, beautiful building, spend the time and resources to build it, then realize you fuzzed up, youre SOL. You have to tear down adn rebuild the entire thing, which can take the better half of an hour.  *Villagers forget/refuse to do assignments. Sometimes it is simply because they have a long checklist before they get to that particular assignment. However, many times, they will just stop building walls, digging caves, or collecting resources. And no matter how many times you remind them, they will sit there and do nothing instead.*Mining is sloppy. There is no realistic ability to build UP inside caverns, you have to always dig down.... which is annoying to say the least. *Lack of defensive features...This broke my heart. Sure you can build a mkaeshift stone wall. Sure you can build a really tall building and call it a guard tower, but in a game where you are attacked by zombies and skeletons every night, this game NEEDS operational wartime structures. Maybe a tower your guards actually post themselves in, or a palisade where an archer <--also much needed--> can be stationed. Especially when you go to war with the goblin chieftans, they attack, steal, and raid you every chance they get. It would be nice to see more organized troop and defense structures, as well as a more convienent way to get up to different floors of buildings. Overall, I still think this game is amazing. Please don't be turned off from my review. I refuse to sugar coat it for you. The price tag is too high to lie to you. HOWEVER, I stand by my opinion that this game is beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful and overall this piece has some fantastic potential. I will continue to play this game, and I STRONGLY urge you to support the development of this game and buy it. The devs care, releasing updates and bug fixes periodically, Buggy? yes. Lacking? Barely, but yes. But its still in alpha!  My rating comes to an 8/10 in its current state! I think this can and will quickly be a game to watch though, as long as the community continues to support it.			"

Early Access Review
								Stonehearth is a game that has a lot of sources of inspiration, most noticeably Dwarf Fortress, but also old RPGs like Final-Fantasy-Tactics. Stonehearth wears its inspirations on its sleeve but has its own unique charm and play style.Stonehearth is, as is described by its creators, ""a game about exploration and survival in an epic fantasy setting where your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land"". In other words, your goal is to help a group of settlers (or ""hearthlings"" as they are called) to create a colony. You are the mind beyond the operation, you do not control your hearthling directly, you lay out the general plan (mine, build, etc) and your hearthlings commit your plans by themselves. There are also a few RPG elements in the game, like a job three, levels, stats and percs.Two things that i really like about the game are the art style and the emphasis on modding. The devs of the game have built their own game engine with emphasis on modding, which can only increase the lifespan of the game. The game has a really easy to use, and nice looking GUI. the animations are cute and i really like the character design. there is a lot of small things that makes the style of the game charming. The last thing i would like to mention is the awesome community that as been created around the game. since the kickstarter days the game has come a long way, the devs are active in the forums and are actively engaging with the community, they even stream the game development 3 days a week on twitch! All in all the game is very promising, and even though it is missing features it's very fun in is current state. it has a long way to go but I'm really hopeful for its future. if you like what you see give it a try!

								This game is on the road to success. I have been following this game since it was announced on Kickstarter and am very happy with where this game is going. The Developers are very committed to going the distance and listen to their fans 24/7,Now for the gameplay currently it has enough for you to get a basic Idea of what the game is. You will be able to design your own town however you want by gathering resources and deal with goblins, zombies, and Skeletons invading during the night. You will promote your workers (hearthlings) to gain more food or build certain items. Now I know that doesnt sound like much but getting to play with all the different types of layouts, buildings, and designs is enough fun to make you play for hours. Of course this game is not complete so you will find bugs which many of us players have been reporting in.We the players also have the important job of reporting bugs and telling the Developers what we would like to see next. We would love to have you join our community on the Stonehearth discourse website and hear what you would want to see or problems that you are having that should be fixed. The developers are working hard so the game will have big updates every 4-8 weeks which gives you a reason to keep coming back for more.			"

								First off let me say this: I DO recommend this game, because it's proof of consept is so grand, and it promises everything I have always wanted in a base-building game. That being said the price of $25 is a little steep for a game that is barely playable. I have put about 20 hours into it off steam, and will surely put more. If you are  reading this i am sure you understand the game is in ALPHA and is pretty buggy, however the devs are great at talking to their community and are squashing bugs constantly,There are several Game breaking bugs within the main mechanics that make it unplayable.The building UI is a great idea, however the coding isn't right on it yet, Walls not being build, crashing when creating a big building, hearthlings not building a roof for your house for virtualy no reason. there are ways to make buildings with multiple walls, but most of them are tedious, requiring manual wall building, planning and erasing to get the building to work right, that is if you game doesnt crash on wall building or just make it so that you can not plan buildings anymore without save scumming. Other than the bugs, there are features that are not present (some that they plan to add) that i belive are needed to round out the game and make it playable. I will list them here in hopes of Dev eyes and to establish discorse :D-Stairs (they have already said its on its way, but without them it is hard to make multiple floors, ladders are visualy unappealing and dont support multiple hearthling travel)-Manual Job Prioities (I wish that hauling wasn't a top prioities unless i set it as such)-Underground Walls and rooms (Though possible, it is tedious, anothering on their to-do list)-Better Mining Interface (Wish i could change all three tunnle dimentions)Those are some basic things that i am sure they will add, but without them currently it makes this more of a proof of concept than a game. Here is a list of some otherthings that i belive will make up for the lack of depth-Hearthling Personalities (Other than 3 stats, there is nothing that seperates one hearthling from another, making the game a bit shallow)-Diffrent Starting Zones/Biomes/Varity (These are already on the To-Do list, right now there is almost no varity in starting zones.)Really i had intentions for making this a long review and listing out everything i want to happen in this game in hopes of others seeing it and influencing the game, however it is just to soon to tell, they have so many good things planned for this including Multiplayer i only wish i didnt hear about this until it came out of early access, i yearn to play it everyday in its complete state. So should you buy it? Yes.... Support these great devs.			"

								Stonehearth is a great game, I have been playing since Pre-early access and have been astounded by the progress made by the developers and their level of community involvment, streams weekly, dev logs, weekly, roadmaps, quick responses on forums etc. Usually I'd steer clear of an Early Access game by a newer or less well known company. However Radiant have proved to be extrememly reliable and dedicated to their game. I would recommend this game, however it is in early access so bugs and a lack of features are to be expected (this is a direct attack of those posting negative reviews stating how is feature lacking - IT IS EARLY ACCESS!). If you are uncertain of whether or not you want to buy it, check out their streams look at some recent gameplay videos.			"

								I was fortunate enough to discover and back this game on Kickstarter during the original campaign and I've been hooked ever since. It is worth noting that I'm writing this review during alppha 10 and so many features are missing still. However, Stonehearth has evolved from being a very basic townbuilder game into a rich environment with many, many features (and many more planned). Some of my personal favorites are the richness of buildings that can be made and the burgeoning job system.It's also worth noting that the developers are very keen to support modders. They have made the game from the ground up with an extensible framework intended for modders and is how they are adding some of their own content as well.Finally, the developers are very active with their community, doing multiple streams per week as well as religiously posting blog entries on at least a weekly basis. They're very friendly on their forums and are regularly interacting with their supporters. I 100% recommend this game, even with the missing features.			"

								Thought I would buy this game and play it for 2 hours get bored a refund but instead i played it got hooked on it and cant stop playing it. Right now this game is like a 7/10 because yiou can play it for like 6 hours on one city before it gets boring  but in the future they are working on mulitiplayer and loads of other content so later i think it will be 10/10 no questions asked. But my advise would be buy it now so when more updates come out potentially increasing price you already have the game and dont need to pay more. This is an Idea of what they are working on: http://stonehearth.net/roadmap/ And this is the community suggestion page THAT THEY ACTUALY LISTEN TO unlike other games: https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap "

								Too many bugs to play a file reliably. You build a pathway, some times it bugs out and can't be removed. You try and build under ground to reach the tunnels/dungeons, the camera can't turn the proper angle to create proper tunnels. Constant bug notifications pop up on your screen, some times crashing the file itself. Buildings still don't function properly. The soilders bug out in the middle of the fights if they try to haul. If your civilians all have 'mine' set on, they'll get stuck in a hole forever. Miners can't reach directly above their heads, causing them to get stuck forever if you don't click in a methodical order. If you don't do clean mining strips then you'll have messy blocks sticking/floating out and there's no way to fix it. Sometimes you civilians stop building, mining or doing a task with no reason.The most annoying thing by far is that these games always fall for the same issue because the developers balance this game by being ""arm chair scientists"" rather than playing their game legitimately (without cheats/commands). This is a problem in every single game like this I've played, whether it's Banished or anything else I've unistalled. This problem amplfies the longer you have a file, and the more you develop a file. Your units need to eat, and sometimes while they're half way in to completing a task or walking to location. The result is an endless loop of them trying to complete/reach the location before ending up getting hungry and cancelling it to walk back to the designated 'eat spot'. This is a completely fatal issue, there's no way to combat this until the developers add in proper inventories so your peoples can hold some food in their bags. Assuming you manage to dodge the bug fest and end up creating a big town, the civs will get hungry just by travelling from one side of the town, let alone exploring tunnels or hunting mobs on the map.Stoneheart is the only game from this genre that I enjoy and look foward to seeing developed. It's zelda-like elements and potential make it endlessly replayable once the content rolls in. However once the developers start ACTUALLY playing their game and realise their are some fatal bugs/issues like the 'Food Loop' they completely give up and open up the mod workshops *cough* Banished *cough*. So lets hope it doesn't go down like that. However, this game is pure Alpha, or even closer to Beta. Don't buy it.			"

								At the moment this game could get boring more quickly than you would expect, simply because it doesn't have alot of features yet (which is subject to change ofcourse). I still do recommend this game because for an alpha, it's already great fun to play and watch your town slowly grow.			"

								Thought I would buy this game and play it for 2 hours get bored a refund but instead i played it got hooked on it and cant stop playing it. Right now this game is like a 7/10 because yiou can play it for like 6 hours on one city before it gets boring  but in the future they are working on mulitiplayer and loads of other content so later i think it will be 10/10 no questions asked. But my advise would be buy it now so when more updates come out potentially increasing price you already have the game and dont need to pay more. This is an Idea of what they are working on: http://stonehearth.net/roadmap/ And this is the community suggestion page THAT THEY ACTUALY LISTEN TO unlike other games: https://trello.com/b/4XvM0SUd/stonehearth-community-roadmap "

Early Access Review
								Long way to go, but even if i looked at this game in its current state, only consider all the bugs that it has polished, i would give it thumbs up. So since there are regular updates and fixes i have no reason not to recommend this game. Not all is great but i believe that it will be polished on the way.Digging up and down is badly done, needs re-thinking. The whole way how to look thru the ground in various heights is pretty badly made making it very difficult sometimes to see what you need to see when you ve been digging quite a bit.There is no way how to place dirt blocks back, they make no drop, no resource, so if you accidentally dig away something, you can only ""build"" a piece of stone back, but in x-ray view you will always see it there. There is no way how to make the your folk stop picking certain stuff up. So if your warrior dies in a gnome camp, your minions will keep running there to pick up the sword after the dead body, dying one by one. Sometimes they appear to die for no reason just like that, since the game doesnt tell you what happened you are just left wondering. I only played two games but there seems to be some sort of randomisation in various jobs position in the job tree, sometimes its the potter that is below the mason in the tree and sometimes its viceversa, this left me quite confused. The building system as a whole is a bit strange, i managed to design my stone tower, placed it on the ground and ordered start of construction, but nobody did anything and i didnt know why. There isnt enough of information about things, sorta ingame wiki. What does affect the sattisfaction of shelter? Food? Which food is the most sattisfactory? Optimization is another issue which surprised me. When you town is population 15+ the game will start somewhat lagging. Sometimes re-loading the game helps, sometimes it just stops on its own, its weird. But on my high-end PC its defo not a HW issue.There is a whole lot of things id like to see improved and i have no doubt that they will get improved. It already is very pleasant to play, has nice music, nice graphics, nice gameplay. Its very similar to game called Gnomoria, only with nicer graphics and heading in a little bit differend direction, direction that i like more. "

Early Access Review
								The short: A fun, cute, and refreshing civilization builder in the essence of its age-old predecessor: Dwarf Fortress.The long: As a avid fan of civilization sims and a old school fan of Dwarf Fortress 2, I bought Stonehearth on a hunch that it might be a aptly port to the 3D plane. In return, I was award with a different experience all together. Normally, I am a hard skeptic when it comes to Early Access titles and new wave Indie games. I am proud to say that this is a, currently, diamond in the rough.One of the first things I found with this game is the adorable graphics and artwork, which really appeal to its style. Everything looks nice and has a charming nature, even in the enemy designs. Gameplay-wise, Stonehearth serves really well as a civilization sim. Everything seems to mesh well together and controls are extremely easy to use. While earlier I ran into problems with the building controls, the recent alpha stage has fixed most of these problems and makes building and designing an awesome experience. Progression is very straightforward and aptly spaced parallel to your own speed. Combat, while simplistic, is easy to follow and pushes you to focus your troops into more diverse roles as your settlement grows. All in all, a very entertaining experience that makes me hopeful for a quality game the more it develops.While the current stage has not as much content as some would hope for, the team working on this has been effective at maintaining an open discussion with its playerbase. They have also been very well timed in releasing updates on development as well as new alpha builds, which is something I hope to see with any Early Access game. As with games of this nature, the time old expression of ""What do I do?"" comes to mind for those who aren't well versed with games such as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. However, the game is very easy to follow and figuring out your way is not as hard as such games mentioned.Basically, if you enjoy games in the nature of Dwarf Fortress, but aren't ready for the complexity of such a title, Stonehearth is the game to play. Adorable, addictive, and a fresh take on civilization sim.			"

								I was an original Kickstarter backer back in mid 2013.The development of this game has long passed estimated release times. It still gets updates but they don't add much. Save games aren't stable between versions. Mod support has still yet to surface. OSX/Linux versions are on the backburner and may never come yet they were one of the first stretch goals. According to their own Trello board on their website both are ""to be done in the far future.""The game itself is hardly what I would call playable. Here's a list of the many things that go wrong:* Construction of buildings stalls. This means they never complete a building, which is a pretty important aspect.* Villagers consistently fail on their tasks meaning you have to re-task them. Again, and again, and again.* At random points the AI just stops doing things. It's probably the same issue with the former mentioned construction issue.Anyone comparing this to Minecraft are the people that think all Voxel games are the same.I do not recommend the game as early access. One day if it gets a full release then maybe I would recommend it. It has potential but the developers don't seem to prioritize work on the game.			"

								Written on 16 Nov 2015:Well when the game works it's a fun game to play, but if you are a Windows 10 user, you might want to pass on this game for now.  It took me an hour to get the game going in the compatibility section of Windows and editing the ""user_settings.json"" file.  Even after I had the game running, it crashes every 30 to 60 minutes.  There is also a User Interface problem that keeps showing up that prevents you from clicking on GUI buttons and makes the game unplayable and prevents you from saving the game.This game is early access, but for $25 dollars I feel it should be more playable.  If it was selling for $10 these issues would be more forgivable, but not at this price range.From what I see on the forums non-Windows 10 machines have much better luck running this.  I would recommend Windows 10 users waiting three months or more and then checking the forums to see if these issues have been resolved.  It really is a nice game, but it's not stable enough right now.			"

								I have been following Stonehearth since Alpha 10 and after 17 hours of game I feel confortable enough to share my opinion with you guys. I'm going to do a list of Pro and Con, I hope you enjoy it.Ps:. Remember this game is in ALPHA stage so I can't avaliate everything, because it is constantly changing.Pros:- Game is constantly updated (weekly);- You can follow the game's development in Stonehearth's Website, Twitch Tv or in their Youtube Channel;- The team is always helpful and you can contact them in their own Forum or in Steam's Forum;- The game has an original cube style which is kind of criative and cool;- Stonehearth is pretty complete for an Alpha version;- The game has gorgeous graphics for an Alpha state;- The animations are pretty good;- We have nice bosses and monsters;- Building mechanics are good and you can basically create everything you want;- You have a lot of crafting options ( Carpenter, Blacksmith, Herbalist....etc). Therefore you need to update them;- The furniture of the game is just amazing;- You have three different difficult modes (Peaceful, Normal, Hardcore);- The game is always challenging although you play in normal mode; < Disregarding the Peaceful mode.- Hardcore mode is really amazing and challenging; < ( my favorite part )- You have a nice story although it's kind of silly;- The combat in the game is really nice. You have 4 different classes in combat ( Tank, Ranger, Cleric, DPS );- You have 2 biomes to play ( Desert, Florest ) and they are creating more + season system;- You have at now 2 different ""races"" to play;- The game's community is active.Con:- The game still having some bugs(Buildings/Combat), but it's in Alpha stage. It will change with the time;- The music is nice, but after a while it feels monotonus. I hope they put more soundtracks soon;- The combat's system is really great, but their auto-attack make it harder to play. I hope it's just a question of time to their change it;- The ""races"" seems predetermined for each biome which is a pity. Maybe they can change that;- The citizens also delay a lot to build something;- By the way, the game is not really optimized which means more work for your hardware(>> RAM <<);- Water bugs <<< It's really annoying but I bet it will change with the time.It's everything that I could see about this game. The game is fantastic, I personaly love it. I would recomend it for almost everybody. But remember, this game is Alpha Stage which means that you will find bugs. I recommend this game for people that have patience and understand that this current stage is going to be improved slowly. Ps:. Before you buy this game give a look at their website and on their development map. So you can catch up what they are working in.My Opinion:The game have a great potential for turn the best sandbox construction game after Dwarf Fortress. I personally had a great time playing Stonehearth. Building your own castles, Keeps, collecting resorcess, constructing a solid economy and defending your town against strong Trolls and goblings is pretty nice and cool guys! I had played other games before Stonehearth such as Towns, Craft the World, Terraria, Timberstone and Dwarf Fortress. I can assure you guys that no game is like Stonehearth. No game mix RPG + RTS + SANDBOX so well as this game and this is because I love it!Ps:. Remember this review was wrote in Alpha 17. So, the game can be better or worse after some updates.Ps2:. The game is on development I can't review it completely for that.			"

								Stonehearth, is a stoned survival and exploration game in a epic fantasy world, where you settle a town of hearthlings while defending agens invaders.The games layout, animations and sounds are really great, specially the way we can build the houses and duplicate our buildings on the ground, for each pieace. We can design everything from: Window, floor, door, roof, flags, fire, beds, and more. On the path while playing the game, people will visit your town and you can sell / buy upgrades. The atmosphere of the game is really nice, and you getting hooked really quickly.Be aware! They need some fixes aswell. Please keep in mind that this is Early access, and it's not finished. Check out my and others suggestions here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/253250/discussions/0/594821545179359856/Don't be a fool and think it's not worth it because of the missing features or sometime crashes with 5.273 error messages.If you search a relaxing and interesting stone, exploration and survival game in a fantasy world with invaders either in creative or survival mode, then this game is for you.Here is some old gameplay footage from june:

								*July 2, 2016* I love this game and can't wait for the core mechanic to work.Simply put, you cannot build houses. Builds often stop halfway. On top of that, you can't scrap the failed build. OCD nightmare.Googled it and... the same problem has been around for 2 years. Whoever is on top of this is not on top of this. So it would seem.If it's not fixed now... it's possible it'll be fixed by tomorrow (x_x)*October 2, 2016* It's been 3 months since my post above. I figured another go at this game was due. But after spending hours collecting resources to build a simple castle-like wall, well...It's disappointing and hilarious how bad this game still is. First off, everything but the actual walls were built. lmfao, I know right :sThen when I clicked on the structure to shamefully have to use insta-build, I couldn't.It said the build was finished. I realized it was hopeless after playing around with it.Maybe next year...			"

								Holy crap, there's an actual game here! After ages of being pretty boring, buggy and unplayable, I was able to play for about 6 hours straight the other day with no hiccups, crashes or incomplete buildings. I was rewarded with a rich town builder that, while still missing some key features, is surprisingly deep. As a Kickstarter backer, this is a huge relief: most Early Access projects don't get nearly this far, especially in the town builder/management genre (example: Gnomoria).Furthermore, the team responsible for the game, Radiant, was recently acquired by Riot (makers of League of Legends). The team here is dead set on getting this project right from day one. Even though development has been slow, updates have been solid and have steadily built on themselves to create a game that is finally beginning to take definitive shape as a fun and unique take on the Dwarf Fortress genre. Keep an eye on this one, DF fans. It's going places.			"

Currently it is in alpha so yes there are quite a few bugs but I personally still find it very enjoyable to play at this stage. Definitely recommend 10/10!			"

								I have had this game for over a year but just got into it a few months ago. The developers really listen to the community and try to fix bugs right away. I posted a bug and a screenshot on the forums and within 40 minutes a developer had replyed and asked what I was doing when the bug occurred, then a few minutes after I explained what I did they posted how to recreate the bug and that they were working on a fix. Great game, great support and I really reccomend it.			"

								Stonehearth (Alpha 10) can be best described as a pretty, easy to use, and lightweight Dwarf Fortress for the masses. None of what I just said should be taken negatively. It's a great concept. I absolutely can't wait for final release, because I'm convinced the devs are going to make it happen and hit a home run in the process.As the game stands, it wasn't until the latest Alpha release (alpha 10) a couple of weeks ago that Stonehearth actually started to feel like a game. So giving a fair review is hard to do. Let's just jump to whether or not you should buy in to the game as it is now. If you are an indie supporter who likes to see a game evolve and support a project early on, then yes, it's a great buy. Also if you are content with what amounts to a sandbox that is still very much a trial run of the features in the design doc but are OK with may features still outstanding, then certainly dive in while the water is relatively clean. The game is being made by great team that stays heavily connected to the community.If you are looking for a game that is near feature complete with only minor bugs, then perhaps it's worth waiting. If I had to guess, Stonehearth is at least a year away from being ready for final release; so if you don't have the patience to wait until the features you want are in the game, then you may want to wait. Perhaps the Early Access money from Steam will afford a larger team and speed up the development...In the end, be sure and check out the games website and watch some YouTube videos to help with your decision.

								I spent a small amount of time playing Stonehearth and with a brief summary can say this game is the future Gnomoria. It does everything a simulation civilization survival game should do. It has a bit of leveling up, looser micromanaging, customizing buildings, unlockable classes, and a better feel of the open world. When your Hearthlings get hungry and you ask them to harvest berries, they don't starve themselves on a job and wait for another job class to go do it, they stop everything and grab some wild berries. I will say Gnomoria has a leg up in terms of making your own classes and uniforms but I'm sure as this game progresses it'll have the same options if not more that Gnomoria had to offer. The music isn't half bad and is soft however it does keep reminding me of the little mermaid...It is an EA and like all EA's theres errors but to have the game working on the day of steam release is a first +1 for its score, having a few options +1, having a save and load function +1, having most of the key features working in-game +1, having a balanced and playable gameplay +1, and finally I only encountered 2 bugs that have already been reported the headless bug and the red error box when making a custom house, neither were game breaking or that annoying due to being able to move the red box and the heads stay on if you zoom out. So for me a personal +1. I also want to wrap up by saying a huge HUGE THANK YOU to both the greenlight voters and the developers! The developers I thank you for stepping up to the plate WHEN YOU FELT READY, taking time to process your game and release it almost stable is a huge hat off to you (even though I don't wear hats).The price is a bit of a shock to those with lower paychecks and what with the economy the way it is don't be to embarrassed to wait. This game has great delivery, great promise, and a great dev team so far from what I can tell at least. I'll wrap this up by saying Steam needs more Indie dev teams like this who wait until the game is stable and has most of its key elements already in game.			"

								I saw the potential in this game since the kickstarter. The team behind this game are dedicated and actively involve in the community that has grown around the game. At this point in time the game is still in early alpha but it shows great potential. When the game is complete, then combined with the talented user modded content the sky is the limit for your Hearthlings and long term game play for you.  I recommend this game if you enjoy city builders, action and adventure. When you play the alpha, don't look at it for what it is now, but look at what it can be.  "

								ive been playing this game for a while now ( since aplpha 6 first came out), and it keeps bringing me back for more. i would reccomend it for anyone, it is at a very reasonable price for what it has to offer. it is fun to see your city grow and constantly find new things too do. when i start to think it has nothing more to offer,i get sad, and then about 5 minutes later ill be at war with a goblin tribe, and while the combat isnt the best, it is pretty good. the construction doesnt have too many custom options but it still allows for some pretty massive and beautiful structures. This game is frequently updated and i have never had to worry about a bug for longer than a week. my only complaint, is that somtimes i will have to repeatedly remind my people to build stuff.			"

								This game is in early alpha. As such, temper your expectations. Bugs, Weird gameplay quirks, and some problematic AI script errors tend to make the game a sort of ""How long can you play before you need to save and restart the program"" thing. But dont take what I say as a negative review. This game is lovable and unique, and every moment I have spent playing it has been more or less a blast. And difficult, to boot. With Enemy zombies and goblins constantly reducing my villager count by 1 or so every night, it becomes far more difficult to maintain the city with each passing death.Good game, Still early alpha release, can't wait to see how it improves.

								Stonehearth is a sandbox-rpg town builder with a lot of heart. I’ve been playing the game since Alpha 3 and it’s the only early development game i’ve had zero regrets about purchasing. Community And Developers:The Stonehearth Discourse is full of awesome and helpful people. It’s a very good grouping of gamers really trying to help each other out. Friendliest discourse on the net.The developers at Stonehearth truly are one of a kind. They continue to be very open about what is happening with the game and participate in discussion on the discourse. They REALLY do listen to feedback, i've seen it happen multiple times where the community will spotlight a great idea and it makes it into the game.But the main thing is… they stream THREE times a week on Twitch, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Two design live streams and one coding stream. Tony and Tom answer questions accept feedback with the best of them.On top of this, they do a development blog once a week, sometimes twice.Alphas get pumped out one every 6-8 weeks on average. In between that, they update the unstable branch that allows you to play test the upcoming features, and those come pretty quickly after main Alpha releases.Gameplay:The game plays great You set up the tasks and then can kick back and watch as your Hearthlings go to work. Farmers need to direction as they constantly plant, harvest, and replant food. The trapper will automatically head to the trapping zones you set up, survey the lands, and place out traps to catch small game. And one of my favorites... footman will patrol along your roads and stockpiles, wary for danger.With the Dungeon Master Ai system, it spawns events and campaigns (I won't spoil what) that come to mess with your village. In some cases, you are given multiple options on how to handle it.Overall:I think the Devs said it best""It’s important to understand that Stonehearth isn’t finished yet. Not by a long shot. But Stonehearth, as it stands now, is a game with fun, robust gameplay and plenty to do and explore.""Pros:Community ++Developers ++Development Speed +Developer Openness and Communication ++Plays smoothJust good Fun!Oozes Character and cutenessDungeon Master System AICons:Buggy!

								This is one of those original games that you know can really go so far with the right amount of love and development. And for the few months I had this game before it hit steam early acess the devs have really proven that they are dedicated and willing to release frequent updates, and as important: fix bugs! Sure the game isn't complete and they are still adding more features, but already this is an awesome and open world, a city-sim with the micromanegement that an rts player would love. Another thing that really strikes me as impressive, and eleviates most of my concerns regarding the fact that it lacks content in some areas is their openess to the community. These guys are really awesome and open about their plans, have frequent dev streams and will tell you exactly what they are working on. In my opinion this is truly early access done right, and thats why this game is much more than some buggy early access scam. Definitely recommended.			"

The ability to create your own buildings and really design your city is much different than many other city builders.TLDR: Easy, Simple  yet very intuitive city builder that keeps you busy!			"

								Great game. I recommend this game to anyone who likes creative sandbox games and even the casual RTS gamer. Its alpha, so obviously there are bugs being worked out. None of the bugs are game breaking and most can be fixed by simply saving and reloading. They also make console commands available as a work around for some bugs. Its great for releasing your inner creativity. Think of building something in Minecraft or Terraria, except not having to place each individual piece yourself. You design the building in a design mode and when you are finished editing you hit the build button and then your people do all the work. This makes building larger more complex structures much less time consuming. There is a building template saving feature so that your creations can be saved for other games. If you make a massive structure simply save it and you can copy paste it to another world, all you need is the materials. The combat is fun as well, but can be turned off if you wish to play in the sandbox mode. Being able to assign units to gaurd (footmen) roles and creating/finding better gear for them to use. The game gets progressively harder to a point then seems to level out and nothing can defeat your footmen. But again its alpha and the combat was only just released so its basically there to be tested and tuned.Multiplayer has not been implemented yet but it is planned in the future and I believe that this game has some great potential at some fun multiplayer gameplay.

								I have a few things to say about this game. It has become one of my favorite pc games ever. No joke. It has unique gameplay and a very nice plot. It even has story progression for once you get to about the second in-game month, goblin camps start appearing. The game itself looks very well made and polished but even for this game, it has got PLENTY of cons.First off it is highly buggy and mainly when designing or building a house. Sometimes building the second story wall makes it two layer and overlap leaving it unable to undo or do anything otherwise without restarting the game. The AI could also use incredible amounts of work. They don't build under bridges of any kind and they need to be specifically ordered to do so or they will never get anything done. There is a feature that needs to be added single-handedly and that is making it to where the AI always run back to headquarters. Everytime there are mobs coming out and chasing after my Hearthlings, do they go towards the footmen who could kick some goblin♥♥♥♥♥ Nope. They run out to the woods to dig their own harty graves. That's not all for I have had to start my game over far to many times due to the poorly-made engine failing from doing simple tasks.But the reason why you see this thumbs up on this review is that this game overall has massive potential. And since I adore early-access games so much, I have gotten used to these bugs. But, then again, when the developers ditch the game to run off with the thousands and millions they make, then it is a big thumbs down for me. But greatly enough, they are still updating it. Maybe a bit slow at times, but they are still producing the game towards better recreational fun. I do reccomend this game and it is worth every penny you buy it for.			"

								This is a really good game but i really can't recommend it.I have put only a few hours into the game so far but i have struggled to build the simplest of houses because the hearthlings will not build the roof or they wont put the beds into the houses. Sometimes during the struggle, the engine even fails to complete the task and slowly begins to break down to the point where you cant even finish desgining the building or even get the pause menu up.Right now there is too many bugs which is obviously going to be in the game due to it being an EA game. Once it is out of EA then i will recommend getting it. At this moment, I cant recommend.			"

After this point I've read on the forums it is a possibility that is a gamble for x64 users and AMD users since we happen to be the ones getting most of the issues.The game runs for me for about 5 minutes and then It freezes. Not during the same actions or anything either.I also tried reinstalling and running on x32 with no luck.I'll wait until the next update to reinstall and try this game out... hopefully.			"

								Honestly, it's not worth the exorbitant price they're asking for right now. The game isn't close to being finished, and 25$ is just too much for such a  buggy game with only 5 hours of content within one playthrough. Good potential, you just won't get a lot of hours out of it in its current state, and half of the hours you do spend will be filled with frustration over your ""Hearthlings"" or citizens lacking the brain compacity to build a fuctional two story building. I would probably have trouble thinking too, if my head sank into my chest, but i think you get the picture; this is a game to wait on.			"

It is a good game and if I just bought it to help it's progress and support it. This game might just need another kickstarter IMO.I really would like to see this game prosper.

								Aslong as the Devs keep updating it and don't leave it for the great Early Access Graveyard, Stonehearth has ALOT of Potential, and hope to see it progress.Pros:--  Its a nice game visually, Despite being voxel.-  You can make your own buildings (needs more options than just Wood and Stone though, like making the floor out of linen and having it any colour you want)- Plenty to keep you entertained for a good amount of hours in its current state- I'll say it again, this game has so much potential in the long run.- Like Banished, another great title, but more forgiving, and no teen pregnancy.Cons:-- Occasionally, the Hearthlings can be moronic- Combat is a little lacking, Most of the time 1 Footman equipped with a Boneclub can scare away a group of 4 Goblins- No way to remove ghost furniture when dumb Hearthlings don't Place the item thereOverall I've really enjoyed what Stoneheart has to offer so far, and hope the Devs keep working on such a fun little title, I hope to see the Magma Smith and Geomancer and Bunny-Human pictures from the Loading screens ingame one day.

								An awesome game but I feel it can be frustrating for people who have just bought it as it has its fair share of crashes but nothing (for me at least) that cannot be resolved by the devs' fixes found in the forums. I love the customization aspect of it which I feel games like Folk Tales were really lacking. It has a slight lack of features but pay this no mind to this as the game is in early access. Now on to the reviewShort ReviewPretty run of the mill soundtrack/sound effects 7/10Graphics are in a plain yet charming style 8.5/10Gameplay lacks in features but considering its early acces state a 9/10Overall 8.5/10[EDIT]Do NOT buy this game if you have an AMD PC just look at the forums and all the people that are having problems right now (I am having this problem myself) I repeat DO NOT BUY IT UNTIL THEY FIX  THESE CRASHES (I absolutely love the game but it's really f***ing annoying)			"

								ive been playing this game for a while now ( since aplpha 6 first came out), and it keeps bringing me back for more. i would reccomend it for anyone, it is at a very reasonable price for what it has to offer. it is fun to see your city grow and constantly find new things too do. when i start to think it has nothing more to offer,i get sad, and then about 5 minutes later ill be at war with a goblin tribe, and while the combat isnt the best, it is pretty good. the construction doesnt have too many custom options but it still allows for some pretty massive and beautiful structures. This game is frequently updated and i have never had to worry about a bug for longer than a week. my only complaint, is that somtimes i will have to repeatedly remind my people to build stuff.			"

								This game is in early alpha. As such, temper your expectations. Bugs, Weird gameplay quirks, and some problematic AI script errors tend to make the game a sort of ""How long can you play before you need to save and restart the program"" thing. But dont take what I say as a negative review. This game is lovable and unique, and every moment I have spent playing it has been more or less a blast. And difficult, to boot. With Enemy zombies and goblins constantly reducing my villager count by 1 or so every night, it becomes far more difficult to maintain the city with each passing death.Good game, Still early alpha release, can't wait to see how it improves.

								I sit here in my desk chair, 3am on a cold Scottish morn. Listening to the gentle hum of my PC as I watch my little hillside hamlet of Edoras expand, 4 houses, a public feasting building, a guard barracks, a blacksmith and a completly filled food storehouse. Every little hearther is happy, at peace and happy in life as we press further into the hillside, ever expanding, handing out food to passing merchants - we have plenty- in exchange for fancy chairs and rustic fire pits for the long houses. We gather to eat and jest, then sleep in simple beds with roaring fires to keep us warm.This is simple. Peaceful. This is Edoras.Ok, I'll be truthful, i was expecting a quick hour or so to get into it, set up farms, housing... basic stuff then just steam roll it for a half hour then refund it cause i wasn't enjoying it.But no, Stonehearth has this... charm to it that i just can't pinpoint. Maybe it's the building system - you have a few preset designs and the rest you can build using a fairly simple but effective system of drag selections and semi voxel based building -, maybe it's the constant strive to better your town and lure more hearthers (little voxelly pixelly villagers) into your town for workers.Maybe you just enjoy the sense of wonder of seeing your town flourish by your hand.Stonehearth is probably already worthy of a release, i don't even begrudge them £18.99 because the game is truly extremely fun. BUT One problem is... The AI... the hearthers are a little... single minded, monkey see, monkey do sort of thing. Like place desings for a house... they start building. Good. Place designs for another hosue and a... idk, a storehouse, and sometimes theyll  all flock to build the storehouse and begin construction. So that house you placed first unless you reinstate the build order, will become last priority. Not bad as such, just a little... irritating seeing half built buildings (storehouse and blacksmith in my village) being used and slept in with no roof, half a wall missing, and no door.. :pPersonal peeve and i'm sure others will feel the same way...

								A very enjoyable sandbox game. Want to lay back in your chair, tell the hearthlings to build templates, grow large farms and just enjoy watching them... This game is for you... Later when Oggo's army comes, you can see it burn down. :)Are you a stratigic mastermind looking for a challenge, wanting to build large cities and castles and fight off evil, and well, build an invicible empire... This game is for you.... And don't you worry, Oggo's army will test how invincible you just think you are. ;)Personally, I don't like it... I love it! You build a city, maybe an economic or a military powerhouse, while a simple but very enjoyable script of events undergoes, and how to tackle them is up to you. Of coursen there are also random events or raids that happen during all of this so you get a little disparity between games.But every game has it flaws, for this game, it's mostly bugs like: During the event of the Goblin chieftain, when you say you're gonna pay him tribute but wait it out and he's asking you for the last time before attacking, you can just press esc and it will go back to the notification bar, until you say ""I have changed my mind"" or pay the tribute. And the blacksmith leveling process, yeah, I get it's very late game but to mine up and let him smelt literally 500+ ores, just to get him to lvl 4 so you can finally get the engineer and do it all over but with cogwheels... The process gets a bit to  grindy.And for Oggo's army, you need atleast 2 decked out knights (and a max lvl healer), which again requiers a lvl 3 - 6 smith.Now if you should buy this? For me, the price is right, it's a well made (alpha) game and if it will be multiplayer later on.... It's very much worth it.If you should buy this now during early access or later is up to you, if you don't mind restaring worlds that you have built on, then yes. Otherwise wait.I have been playing this since alpha 2,5 came out, and I think it has been a blast watching the game unfold, becoming bigger and more complex for every uppdate and test new things out, so if you want to help the developers and ge tthis feeling, buy it.For you who'll wait until the full release... 1v1 me later when/if multiplayer comes! ;)			"

Every week there are multiple updates on the forum regarding the new alpha releases or other changes.This is definitely a game still in development. If you purchase do not get too attached to any build because upon the next alpha release you will be starting over again and systems may change. Things crash and odd bugs will happen - but that's the definition of an alpha.This game has huge potential and even though its only an alpha there is enough content to keep me procrastinating for hours on building my town. I just love it - for me its the next best thing since minecraft - or it will be!			"

								I've been excited for Stonehearth since the Kickstarter which I happily contributed to. I saw a team of people who were passionate about delivering the product they envisioned instead of a watered down version.Two years later I'm happy to see that I wasn't wrong. The development team is very transparent, honest, and are not willing to give up on their vision like so many other games have. Unfortunately, that means that some things take longer to do and have more bugs because the implementations are more complex. I've watched and played the alphas, though, and I've seen fantastic and surprisingly rapid growth so I'm optimistic about where this game will be when it's finally complete.Worth the price, but please remember this is alpha-quality software so there may be some frustrations. Alpha 10 is pretty stable but if you'd like to avoid some of the game-breaking issues that can sometimes pop up I would wait a few more versions or even until Beta when the real bug fixing kicks in.

								Only five hours in but I'm having a TON of fun, and it's only in alpha.THE QUICK VERSION: Do you like Gnomoria (or Dwarf Fortress)? Do you like Minecraft? If you answered ""yes"" to either of these, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you answered ""yes"" to both, you'll DEFINITELY enjoy this game.THINGS TO LIKE:+ The building system is the most robust of any citybuilder I've seen to date. You not only get to lay out buildings for your Hearthlings to construct (very intuitively, in my experience!) but you get to place furniture within and without at your whim. There's already a great deal of different types of furniture and decor your Hearthings can craft.+ The music is excellent. It's rich and well composed, and it gives the game a very quaint feel.+ Game generation is simple but fun and really makes you feel like you're having an impact on your game before it even starts. You roll a set of Hearthlings, each with their own stats, and can even name them. You also get an amount of gold to spend on a selection of items to start yourself off with. You select your options in storybook form when the game asks you to pick between two types of Hearthlings (one medieval-ish group and one nomadic, desert-like group), two types of biomes (temperate or desert), and two types of game (either you can be raided by enemies or you can't). Then your map is generated and you select where on that map you want to settle. Each region has access to different resources.+ Trade events. Just about every day, a trader will come by offering different deals. You can buy or sell certain goods from some, some will ask you to make them x number of items then come back after a set amount of time to trade you something agreed upon for them... It keeps things fresh and gives you new ways to get resources you maybe don't have access to based on where you settled.+ Hearthling jobs. There are several different jobs in the game and they all feel useful. Every Hearthling starts off as a basic laborer, who can only gather resources, haul them, or build. With items (most of which are constructed by the various crafting jobs), you can promote a hearthling to any number of other jobs such as Farmer, Carpenter, Tailor or Trapper. Every job has levels that increase as your Hearthling performs that job and gains experience. At each tier, a new ability is unlocked. These range from increased speed to the ability to randomly create high-quality furniture that takes on a finer appearance than the base item being crafted. Many jobs are also laid out in a tree wherein you must have a Hearthling of level x in one job to promote to another. For example, Cook requires Farmer at level 3.+ The ability to save your building designs for easy placement later.THINGS THAT NEED WORK:- Currently it's very difficult (possible though!) to build a second floor that functions. I'm sure this will be ironed out as the game plods along in development, though.- A few of the job abilities aren't implemented yet, but this will definitely be remedied later just on nature of the status being ""not implemented"".- You get occasional errors when trying to do things, pretty much always in regards to building. They haven't crashed the game for me, it's basically just the game telling me the engine didn't understand what I was trying to do.- Sometimes the building bugs a bit, but all that generally means is that you have to cancel building and start designing from the start again. Bit of a pain, but with trial and error, you'll get where you're going, and this is sure to be ironed out in the long term.FINAL VERDICT:It's already an incredibly addictive game for me. In its current state, I'd rate the game a solid 7.5/10. It has the potential to be at LEAST a 9. If for whatever reason you trust my opinion, I'd tell you this game is worth the buy right now. It's one of the sharpest alpha states I've ever seen for a game and there's already so much to enjoy and lose hours in. Five hours in, I've only scratched the surface of jobs and the like and I'm still going strong. I can see myself easily logging over 100 hours in this thing.			"

								This is a very satisfying game with a rather cute artstyle that scratches all the itches that towns left me with.Essentially, you indirectly command a small village of settlers to build up a town, attract new residents, and defend your town from raids by wolves, zombies, goblins, kobolds, and all sorts of similarly nasty monsters.The game, unfortunately, can be quite straining on your computer when you have a lot of villagers, but since I've started playing, the game's performance and optimisation have both improved dramatically. When I started playing, the game would get completely bogged down at around 20 villagers and they would stand around doing nothing until they starved, now I can have 30 villagers comfortably and the game only gets a little clogged after playing for several (8+) hours with that number of villagers.The developers are also very communicative and active and chat with the community regularly to take suggestions and feedback. If you enjoy citybuilding and sandboxy games then I really can't recommend this game enough.			"

								Stonehearth is much like a city builder, but with some RPG/Adventure elements in it. The goal is to keep your Heartlings, or citizens alive by finding resources, building houses and defences and fighting off invaders. When I first got into this game I had a hard time getting used to it. There were many game breaking bugs that got your Heartlings stuck or buildings that could not get finished. Most of the bugs have been fixed and you won't run into any for the most part. The ones that do are often easily shrugged off.UiThe game is quite easy to get into. The UI is quite easy to handle and you can easily access any information you might need. Important events like raids, level-ups or traders will pop up and notify you of their arrival. You can ""slice"" the ground  so you can see your mines underground and the same can be done for the buildings (although this might need some improvement for buildings with multiple floors). BuildingBuildings can be made in any way you want as these can be build much like Minecraft block by block. After you're finished editing your building you can let your Heartlings build it for you. The game also offers some blueprint for you when you don't feel like building houses yourself and these too can be edited to your liking. When building starts your heartlings will get everything they need to build the structure bit by bit. They even build scaffolding to make the building making it cool to see your buildings being build from the ground up.ProfessionsYour heartlings will be able to be given specific roles. Like a carpenter, a farmer or a footman. This will allow them to level up in this respective tree which in turn will allow you more to make and progress your town further. Each role has their benefits and are overall very well balanced out. You will mostly want to have all of them every time.ChallengesWhile supplying your town with supplies is not hard all on its own, it does get a bit more exciting when enemies start appearing. Having to call back your citizens to the safety of your building while your footmen, knights, archers and clerics move in to take care of the threat. Combat is really fun, even when it's this simple it still gets you to hold your breath sometimes when its a close call for one of your soldiers. StoryThe game does not have much story going on yet. But it is easy to see the potential the game has and the devs are working on the story as we speak. Which brings me to the next part.DevelopmentNow, many people have been complaining about how slow the game has developed over the last months. And I can't blame them. But one thing you must keep in mind is that the development team is a small one. Personally I still back the dev team as they seem to actually care about the game.My overall opinionI like this game. Quite a bit. It is a bit like minecraft but more strategy based. Which I like. The game's theme is great. Very cute and playful making even the biggest fights look cute and huggable. The game still lacks some contend but even now I would pay my 30 bucks for it and think it money well spent. I love the system of the game and the way it works. The UI is simple and much to my liking. My only real downside is that I too would wish for more content being thrown out more rapidly. I give this game a 8/10. Some might say this is way too high. But you just cant deny this game is a lot of fun and still has a whole lot of potential. I hope the game gets some big updates in 2017 and I feel like the devs will deliver on this. My advice? Buy this game! Support these developers. It's small companies like these that make the greatest games. If given the chance.			"

								Fun game to pass the time, pretty simple but enjoyable. For EA game this has ton of potential it already feels like full game with a few things lacking far as content, has a similar feel of prison architect but ever so slightly. For the price tag it's worth it and since it's not done I hope they'll give it some much needed filler. :)			"

If you want to upgrade a piece of furniture in your house you have to destroy it and rebuild it from what i can tell. If you want to make a vertical mineshaft you can wish some of your hearthlings dead. Sometimes random items get in places you can't get. This game has good potental. It could be a great game if the building management was much easier.			"

These two patches alone convinced me it was time to support the devs by purchasing and recommending the game to others.  I wasn't sure you guys could/would pull it off, but this game now feels great to play for being in such an early stage.  Keep up the hard work - this is a gem awating it's final, glorious cut & polish!!!10/10 would stone my hearth again.			"

								What can I say? This game is just a ton of fun. I soaked up 4 hours playing this when I first bought it. If you like town/city builders, and like to manage colonies and the like, then this game is right up your alley. I thought that the art style would bug me at first, but to be honest, it is kinda nice. You don't get caught up in the graphic nature being a big point in the game, even though you can make some nice loking buildings and stuff anyway.Stonehearth looks like Minecraft, but plays very differently. It is in a top down-ish format, so you aren't controlling a single character, but rather managing what the colonists will work on. I won't go too much into the mechanics of such a game, as it isn't the first to do such a thing, but it is worth noting that you don't have IMMEDIATE control over what the colonists do, unless they are doing nothing at the time.This is an amazing game. I can only assume it will get even better, and it looks as though the devs intend to stick with it, fixing some annoying bugs already. If you are on the fence, I'd say just buy it, give it the 2 hours to decide, and if you don't find yourself completely wowed by it, Steam will give you a refund. You really can't go wrong here.			"

								I've been following Stonehearth for years, and finally picked it up on Steam.  It's a very fun game for passing the time.  You have partial control over your hearthlings by giving them tasks and telling them to walk to certain areas.  The rest is handled by the AI.  But once you have 20 hearthlings doing their thing you have plenty to do.  There are multiple job paths and little mini quests along the way.  Buildings can be custom designed as well or you can use some of the pre created cookie cutter models.The game is still in alpha but its looking very good and is very playable as it is.Another massive pro is their support!  I had one issue and they immediately replied and had several team members assisting me.  After some other recent Alpha flops I can't tell you how reassuring that is!!!  Very much appreciated.I hope this game only gets better and better!			"

								EDIT: I'm rewriting a review because I love this game a lot and want people to really understand whats going on. This game has so much potential. The devs really care and want it to be a good game. It's playable in the current state but at the same time it isn't. You will face several gamebreaking bugs during your play. I frequently try to play this game and see how it's going. HUD breaks, hearthlings don't do what you ask. Devs post weekly (most of the time on tuesday) about the upcomming updates, and i really like how much they communicate with the backers/supporters (i backed this game on kickstarter awhile back) overall I believe it would be better to add this to your wishlist/watch list and check back every once and awhile. If you buy it now you might find a few bugs and get frustrated. I'll edit this more in the future. -original short really bad review- (im sorry)I have been playing this game since the first alpha and let me tell you The devs listen, they care, and they want to make this game the best for us. I know $25 is a bit much (i bought it for $30 on their site) but it will be reduced to $15 on release. Either pick it up now, or wait. Either way this game is excelent and I love it.			"

								Pretty good overall for an early iteration. Lacking some significant fleshing out of features, and suffers from some pretty serious optimization issues and slow downs. With a little love it could be a beautiful dwarf fortress clone.The job system is more interesting than DF and DF clones, and with some more work could become worth the depth it shows in concept, however as it stands it seems more like a lazy content gate. Hopefully it will be the method they use to set themselves apart from the previous games of this genre.			"

								The devs put their heart and souls into this game, and it shows! They're always adding in new and intersesting features and complete a new alpha release every month or so. It's nice to have a game where you can build whatever you want while defending it from the various and expanding array of monsters. I love the RPG elements of needing a previous class in order to advance further. Or a different class is needed to craft the necessary tool to level up a hearthling. Alpha games have lots of bugs you say? Fear not! Many of the game-breaking bugs or annoying bugs that I experienced when I first bought this game are all gone or at least are being addressed and steps are being made toward fixing it.			"

If you enjoyed any form of base builder game, you'll like this. if titles like dungeon keeper, cultures, settlers (and many more) make you feel a little nostalgic then one day this game will too. Only thing to consider if you're thinking about buying, dont be dissapointed if you get bugs - everyone does at the moment. be prepared to search the forums for console commands or common problems. it is still alpha so its not without its unexpected complications			"

								Rewrote this Review due to new updates, current Stable: Alpha 17, but Alpha 18 is playable and looking good too. Previous Review had 4 of 7 Helpful votes.Short Version: It's still a Dwarf Fortress/Gnomoria style game, but less focused on deep digging and more on exploration, crafting, and building. Class System is simple but interesting and more unique than simply assigning jobs, and much more user friendly than most. Don't let the simplicity fool you though, you can pour some fair time into this if you like these kinds of games.Since my previous review, it's still in Alpha, but has resolved or at least lessened alot of the Optimization issues, with more tweaks focused on that to come - judging by the dev blog and their videos, they genuinely care about fixing this, and they should since 2d Dwarf Fort lags up pretty bad once you have a big enough population going, imagine how bad it's going to be in a 3d game like this. Smart focus on their part, one of the rare devs that learns from others' issues, unlike every MMO dev out there.The AI is much better now, though still a little prone to bad decision-making. You can somewhat ""control"" their pathfinding by building Roads, as it favors those almost exclusively unless no road exists to follow nearby. The Building issues I had before seem resolved for the most part, though I'll still find a ladder or scaffolding stuck floating and undestroyable without using the Console.Combat has advanced by leaps and great bounds since my previous review - many more weapon/armor options, as well as 3 new classes: the Knight, with heavier armor and 1h/shield focus, bonus defense/stats and buff auras for his allies, as well as Taunt skills to protect the squishies - the Archer, your standard ranged attacker who can either slow or burn enemies based on their Arrow Quiver equipped(and double-shot at max lvl) - and most importanly, the Cleric, a Healer Monk who can do melee dmg and defend himself but puts their first priority as healing any nearby units with damage, both directly and through a passive aura. I make 2 groups of 1 of each class and it protects my bases pretty well + deals with the Story armies nicely.The Mining system is a little more controllable now but still not as fine-tuned as I would like to see, and usually see in other games of this kind - there's no Ramps or Stairs to be dug, and manually digging them up doesn't usually work because the AI prefers to build and use Ladders instead of stepping up/down 1 block steps.Overall they're making nice strides in the right direction, and I'm eager to see more.Bonus: There's already a decent-sized Mod community, and they make some pretty good mods so far, from whole new classes and items to entire Biomes(The Archipelago one is awesome)			"

								At the time of this review (7-16-2016), I would say the game is already worth the purchase price. There are so many games that charge far more while delivering far less. And this game is only in the alpha stage. As many have already commented, if you like sim games (SimCity, Civilization) and other open-world, crafting type games then this is worth a look. With any sim/crafting game there is a learning curve and there is one here, but it hasn't felt particularly harsh. One thing that really struck me was the quality of the music--it's fantastic. Like, Howard Shore cinematic quality. Well done, sir.			"

Leaving you with a half finished house that you can't delete.After an hour of playing, the shine really wore off.Update december 24th 2016: Sonehearth was on sale for 20 bucks so I decided to give it another try, and sweet mother of baby Jesus this game still has the same exact bugs as the last time I played it! Scaffolding everywhere. unfinished buildinGs. Settlers just standing around. I really wanted to like Stonehearth I really did, but bought the game twice and requested a refund twice.

								Good game if the only thing you care about is crafting a cute little town. The strategy tag should not be attached to this game. I really liked this game at first, but once I had a basic town set up, there was nothing else to do. The game has minimal story that can be beaten with only a few hours of effort. Yes, the game is randomized and its technically replayable an endless amount of times, but with the lack of content, I don't see myself replaying this game at all and I don't see this game really improving a whole lot in the future.

								Don't buy this game until all bugs are fixed. there are so many bugs its not funny.Whenever I play this game for more than at least a few minutes, it just pauses and stops responding. the game looks real fun, But with a bug like this that stops you from even playing it, i find that this early access game is really expensive.4/10			"

								Amazing game, In recent months development has taken a turn, when I first purchased Stonehearth it was updated one to two times a week, sadly it is lucky to get a single update within a month.  playable but lacking any content that is challenging and is possible to complete everything within a few hours without having to repeat anythingFun and exciting designGreat fundamentalsLacking contentSlow developmentUnsure if it will ever be finished			"

								While I may not have that many hours for this game on steam, I have played more than 20+ hours outside of Steam and have been following it since it first appeared on Kickstarter. This game is definitely worth your money, it's a great combination of RPG and City building and has many planned features that are currently being added or will be added eventually. Another great thing this game has is its active developers, who have consistently provided updates on the games progress and listened to the communities feedback, so you always know what's going down and will never leave the community out of loop wondering where the games is *Cough* Cube World *Cough*. If you want to see for yourself simply go to stonehearth.net and visit the Dev Blog.So if you're into city builders, RPG's and active developers this game is for you.			"

								I really do love the concept of this game.  The game has settlers left in the wilds to fend for themselves.  They slowly start to learn the basics to create their own city and a home for themeslves.At this point, though, the game is not ready.  The bugs are hard to get over and the game has not been updated to handle 'end of game' content or what happens when you level.  I build a place for everyone to sleep, to eat and then I'm pretty much done.  I have everyone collect resources, but really this only happens sometimes.  My blacksmith or Mason level up to create new things for my settlement, but I'm unable to impliment them, I don't see a reason to use them, and I can't make my own due to glitches.  Now I don't want you to stray from the basic game.  Despite this all, as I frist stated, the game is headed in the right direction and I hope it continues that way.  If the developer can pull this all together I think we'll have a huge hit on our hands a game I won't be able to stop playing.I do think the game is worth a try!  Watch out for the goblins!			"

								StoneHearth has a very ""cutesy"" and ""family friendly"" look to it, and has a good and wide range of genres mixed together. its a great game for kids and adults alike.now the game is not ""feature complete"" or anything like that, it still has a lot of content to be added, but dont worry the devs wont give up, and most certaintly will finish the game.word of warning, the game is still very buggy. but then again that is the entire point of an alpha, squash the bugs and add awesome content. if you dont like the idea of playing a game that has lots of bugs and potential to crash, then this game is not for you. however if you love being right up front helping the devs hunt down and squash those bugs, then i recomend this game.Edit: it's been over a year since i reviewed this game, and i gotta say, Stonehearth has come a looonng way since my original review. the game has a ton of new features: new playable race, new monsters and campaigns, bunch of new classes, perfomrance improvements. and a bunch of other good stuff. and yes, there are still bugs and some crahses, but they'tend to be less frequent as before.so even after a year, i'd still recomend this game to anyone who likes town/city builders, early acces games, finding/reporting bugs, and being part of a great and friendly comunity.

								I've always been big on strategy games (since mid-late 90s) where you build your base, army, and go off killing those who try to kill me, such as command & conquer series, age of empires series, stronghold series and more.  I saw this game, ""Stonehearth"", on Kickstarter and just loved the whole concept.  they even had a great goals display to show you what their plans are.  Now I was skeptical to even put my money down because I was afraid they will just stop eventually and disappear like a great game that had potential, (The Stomping Land).I must say I’m very happy to have put my money in and then support them.  I played it since the beginning, even though I only have a total of about 15hrs, I just fell in love.  I stopped playing so that it can come up with better fixes, changes like any newly forming games.  I played it recently within few months and my goodness, it's even better!  they even have a dev map and objectives! I love it!Honestly, I highly consider this game to anyone that likes this whole minecraftish, base building, survival sandbox.  you can wait to buy it later or buy now, still great.  the dev's constantly work on this, they don't quit, they find more issues and fix them. they show videos on what they are working on, their issues they've encountered and so on.  I’m glad I put my money into this game.  i know in few months, this will become better than it is now with the speed and dedication all these workers put in. "

								One of the greatest Alphas I've ever seen. Period.Want to hear the details? Well, my fellow offspring of Rayya, sit tight for my story will be a long one.It's hard to begin describing what's so good about the game.Is it replayability?Great community? (and believe me, I don't treat these words lightly)Catchy art style?Responsive and responsible team?Warm and fuzzy atmosphere of cuteness?Before Alpha 16 Stonehearth, while interesting, was a barebone system. Now it's a game, and with the new hard mode it's challenging exactly how you want it to be. With multiple military classes and new difficult enemies able to break through your doors you get yourself dragged into the turmoil of battles trying to keep your little sandbox settlement safe.What games does Stonehearth resemble? Suddenly, Dungeon Keeper. There is no dungeon, yes. But the same ""indirect control"" and ""build your town"" principle is still here, and voxel retro graphics gives you the right nostalgic vibe.Thanks to Stonehearth I have discovered Discourse - a free and open-source web 2.0 engine SH forums are built upon.Thanks to Stonehearth I got myself deeply interested in voxel graphics. And finally installed Blender.This game is built with love. But more than that, it is built with extreme mod-friendliness in mind, that, I won't fear to say, I've never seen before. Information is in an easy readable format. For every task, there is a free software available. If there is a downside, it's that skilled programmers are yet to turn their attention to the game.For those who like looking at a pros/cons list (I'm one of those types), here's one.+ Already playable and very enjoyable+ Watch and influence development through Discourse forums, Twitch streams and Trello feature lists (with voting for feature priority)+ Easily moddable (including translations, many are already available - check the forums)+ Quite playable without any mods (unlike that dragon-slaying bestseller RPG)+ Nice, if somewhat simple, 16-bit stylized voxel graphics+ Create building templates, then share them (or not)+ Nice music+ Active development (unlike some other titles, Stonehearth is an example of an Early Access done right)+ Rabbits- BugsBe ready for them. This is, after all, an alpha. While there is backward save compatibility now, I recommend starting a new game with every new major Alpha release. Some bugs have workarounds. Sift the forums. Stick to stable builds if you don't want to risk and make in-depth testing. Report bugs to the forums.- Lacking pathing and priorityThe cause of unfinished buildings in 80% cases is that hearthlings can't get to the next queued block with current scaffolding. Try building more ladders manually. It gets better with every major alpha, but still has issues.- The price is arguably a bit too highI'd like to mention separately some things that are planned, but not there yet:- No water physics- No weather effects/seasons- Some classes are missing (namely Magmasmith and Geomancer - yes, you will be able not only do digging, but raise mountains as well). As of Alpha 17, Engineer is in development.- No multiplayer (it's late in the dev queue). I'm amazed how playable the game is with no multiplayer yet.- Diversity of items is comparatively poor. Will be fixed, but the eyes of the devs' right now remain on gameplay (which is, in my opinion, totally justified). So no Cthulhu... yet. Can be somewhat fixed with mods (but still no Cthulhu).- Building mode is still limited and lacking (gets better with every major Alpha though)- The number of biomes is currently limited to 2 (will be more). You can try fan-made ones.- The number of playable races is currently limited to 2 (will be 3 or so)You may think the review is full of flattery. Your right. Make your research, see for yourself. All and all, with no revolutionary things in the box, Stonehearth can still be your heartwarming casual pleasure. The source of modding frenzy. Or both.The choice is yours.			"

								I want to love this game sooo much. It has so much going for it. There are just a few flaws in logistics that are keeping it from being perfect.The AI is terrible - My workers are currently all standing around ""idle"" while I have crap everywhere that needs to be collected (ores, wood, wool, farm goods). There is no way to direct them to do what they are supposed to be doing.  I end up having to use the cancel option to permanently delete the items even though some are super rare. Amazing when i tell the workers to delete the item they are all over it....There is no way to edit the land once you have mined it. If you make a mistake...oh well...i hope you are not OCD like me. I currently have the grass layer near my village floating in the sky because either i made a mistake or my workers did not do as they were told.Finally, once food starts going bad in your storage it is a nightmare. Your workers do not remove this rotten food on their own accord. You must manually delete each basket of rotten food. Im at the point now where I literally spend a quarter of my day scoping out the food storage to remove these rotten baskets.This game is definitley on the right track but I would still wait until release to see if these kinks will be worked out. If they are this would likely become one of my favorite games in this genre on steam.TL:DR- AI needs work- Need an option to turn off rotting food or make workers remove it on their own- Need a few more land editing options in case you make a mistake (or your workers)This is a great title and I hope they continue to improve these imperfections. Giving it a thumbs up for encouragement to the Devs!			"

Sit down and turn on some music or a movie and just play for hours on end. I find this game very relaxing. well.... at times it can be relaxing.The only problem i have with this game is the frequency of attackers when playing in normal or hard modes. i find it hard to get thing done and make progress at times because im all ways focused on my army and possible attack routs. over all I would give this game a 8/10 as it stands right now.

								OK, Where to start.Well the game doesnt have an autosave so my first 3 hours are no longer exsistant. So SAVE REGULARLY. Other than a few engine bugs and trapped citizens the game performs well. By trapped citizens, i had to start 3 different saves as the citizens would spawn in some tress and be trapped up there. Engine bugs tend to happen when i place items into the chests.Its fun to an extent, once you have a knight, invaders are kind pointless as they dont really get stronger, just the same enemies in a bigger group. When you get a cleric it becomes stupidly easier to fend off invasions as they seem to heal only the knight and the knight likes to tank everything in the vicinity allowing for quick easier kills on everything else with archers or footmen.DO NOT BUILD TOWERS IN A HOUSE OR CITIZENS WILL KILL THEM SELVES BY BUILDING THE WALLS AROUND THEMSELVES.Farmers seem to be a bit slow a tending crops as well as having a short attention span, would be nice if you could assign a farmer to a specific group of plot.Altogether, Great game. Would recomend if you like being god.  Just dont build into the mountain side like i did, hard to grow crops under 40ft of stone.EDIT: There is an auto save, im just a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to give a cautious thumbs up to this game. It is still very much in Early Access and it shows. There are bugs, unfinished features, very little documentation...pretty much everything you'd expect for a game still in active development.For all that, the devs are very active and quite open about where they are in the process and what they are working on. Much more than most other developers I've followed. It's reassuring to see things go up on their list and bits check checked off as features are added in.And what it does have already is quite fun and I find it rather addictive. Despite a few crashes and failed villages due to bugs, I keep coming back for more. There is just something so engrossing and relaxing about this game, I can't seem to make myself give it up!Personally I'm quite excited to see where it is going, and I think it is going to just get better and better.

								Sadly rare when a Kickstarter game lives up to expectations, but when it does happen they usually knock it out of the park. Stonehearth is one of those rare long-term Kickstarters which I've never regretted for a moment. The dev team is always responsive, the game is constantly evolving, and the community isn't as vile as a lot of toher builder games. It's an easy recommendation for a more casual building-focused DF-like. It's going to be a long haul for these guys as they get everything in this game that they envision, but it's worth every build!			"

								A really good managing/city building game.My specs: GPU: GTX750ti                  RAM: 12gb                  CPU: i7-920Pros: -The game is often updated for bugs/optimisation (about once per week)         -The game is mostly in a playable state.         -Core gameplay is mostly there.         -Solid building system with rare bugs/crash.         -Load of jobs for your hearthlings (about 8 at the moment).         -There is really high number of stuff you can do to customize the way your city look.         -The game is quite well optimised unlike other Early Access game ive played.Cons: -Game sometime crash.          -Game has a weird thing that pop in the UI which block the entire screen sometimes and need the game to be restarted to fix it.

Review: Alpha 10TL;DR:Do you like games like: Cultures The Settlers 1-4 (Before the serie was butchered) Castle Story City/Town Management games Designing thingsThen this is for you.More about the game:This is a sweet little gem of a game. The play-style is very much as a Cultures-like game, where you give your citizens a profession, which they get better at/more experience with. And then they can learn the next step of the profession tree. As an example Trapper(Hunter), who get's the bright idea that, ""Hey, i can just have animals in a pen, don't have to run around setting traps"". Much like how it works in Cultures, but you do not have any direct control over your citizens besides assigning them jobs. Some jobs, needs a workbench placed (Click on the citizen you have assigned a job to set a workbench), from there you can order items that the worker will make over time. The more they make, the more they can learn to make, some items can also be ""Fine"" which looks nicer.Any citizen that dosen't have anything to do, will help build buildings, mine, gather items and cut trees if given the general order (You select areas to mine/cut trees, which then whoever got time for it goes to do it). The games building system is pretty smart, tho still needs some slight work. Easy to build, place the floor. Auto-snap walls, auto-snap roofs, manually placed windows and doors. But the game also offers building templates, so just click and drop more or less(Works well if you don't want to use time building fancy buildings).There are currently two game modes, one which has enemies (Normal) and one without any dangers (Peaceful). The game is not very challenging just yet. Tho it might be a good idea to try out peaceful, just to get the general hang of things before heading into normal.The game itself looks great, very aesthetically pleasing, the characters look charming, smooth animations, pretty great character variety, trees have different ages and sizes. Terrain looks nice, eventho slightly plain right now. Will be looking forward to a bit more variation.Currently the game is in need of optimization, but that is something that will come along, especially since this is still in a early alpha. Alpha is all about adding new features and stuff for you to do. Optimization mostly comes from the beta. If you get a low framerate, i highly recommend turning down shadows if you have some performance problems.Conclusion:Personaly i really love it, it is a solid city-builder/managing, with some added rpg and combat. I know city-building isen't for everyone, but this is a great entry into the genre.Worth buying, if unsure, take a look at some gameplays!			"

								What to say about this game. First, it has a lot of potential. I believe it takes the best parts of games like Minecraft and Timber and Stone and meshes them together to make a charming little building/simulation game.For now, I'll do 5 Pros and 5 Cons.PROS:-Designing buildings is quite intuitive and easy to use-RPG-ish ""leveling system"" of jobs for your hearthlings to improve them-Can move your hearthlings similar to an RTS by putting them into parties-Relaxing and charming sound track-Active and determined dev crew that listens to player issuesCONS:-Sometimes hearthlings don't tend to certain tasks and will sit idle (can be bypassed in a few different ways)-Designing multi-level buildings requires finesse and sometimes doesn't want to work the way you hoped-Combat needs a little tweaking. If enemies run away, even if you hit them, they take no damage.-Currently there are various errors and cpu-usage spikes.-All in all, this game is only going to get better and is a perfect fit for anyone who likes to build, create, and/or manage towns and people.

								8-5-16I've had this game for a very long time and have seen it come a long way, here are my gripes at this point that have prevented this game from being great and finally landing a negative review:They have kept the game ""playable"" throughout development which was a plus, fixing critical bugs along the way as well but the game, from the beginning, could not function past 4-6 hrs of playing because of poor optimization. This really limits the whole idea of this game and really enjoying the full potential of having your own little town. Another area of ""soreness"" has been the pathfinding AI, it has never really been great to begin with even with all of the improvements to it over development. The maps are quite small in reality and more people would complain as well if you could play long enough on one without having to restart. Another reason of really wondering where this game is going or what the final product will become.Until huge leaps of optimization and pathfinding find its way to this game, I'm going to have to say wait till a sale or more updates centered around these issues.

								Backed this game a while ago, great concept, and the Dev team is really doing some work to pull it all together.I do recomend this game. Its unusually addicting. I try not to play it very often because i want to experience more of the game all at once. Remember it is still very heavily under construction, so buying the game means expect bugs and what not, and please add constructive feedback. This game is backed by an excelent group of Devs.Great graphics for the style of game, music is addicting to say the least if not a bit repetitive right now. Gameplay although lacking many of the features they want to put in, even in its current state its amazingly fun.Similar to Timber and Stone but a little less hardcore in the mechanics (another game i recomend you check out). Free build cities block by block. Assign jobs to your people (Carpenters, Stonemasons, Chefs, Soldiers, and many more). Keep them fed happy and protected from an assortment of baddies.The only con i can see is the price. For the state of the game $25 is a little iffy. Certainly worth maybe $15 if you can catch a sale, and as long as the Devs stay on point it will be worth the $25 or even more.			"

								Amazing game. Having a ton of fun on it so far. However, I've had to completely ditch a few of my well-built worlds because of bugs. Sometimes I have to restart my world because it bugs out and my hearthlings won't build a building I've requested them to build.Also, I wish there was a way to make seperate rooms in a building. I mean, you can with freestanding walls, but the freestanding walls have ugly columns and if you connect it to a corner, then it makes these ugly columns. If you could hide the columns on the freestanding walls it'd be good.Other than the massive amount of bugs (only because the game is in early access right now), the game is amazing and I enjoy it a ton.

My OpinionStonehearth is fun game of Village construction and management. As the Devs said, it does remind me a lot of DnD or other fantasy worlds and universes. The Hearthlings all have their own streangths and weeknesses, but if you have too many they do start to seem quite similar. The building prossess for buildings, wall, canals, and bridges works quite well, allowingyou to build something simple and quickly, or complex and intricate over a period of time. The only issue with it is that on occasion the Hearthlings seem to stop building for no reason, causing you to have to save the blueprint and start over from the begining of construction hoping that it doesnt stop again. Rarely, they might accidentally trap themselves inside a buildings walls and starve to death because of this. Its more annoying then game breaking, but it is something the devs need to fix.The world that the Hearthlings can go to build a new home is quite diverse. Ore dominating the mountains while plants and fertile land dominates the lowlands. It cause you to have to think about where you settle at the start, as you dont want to send your Hearthlings too far from the saftey of your town. Goblins, Orcs, Entlings, Stoneling and more roam the forests and mountasins to attack, set up camps, and steal your stuff, providing quite the challange to defend your Hearthlings and stuff.Pros+Nice art that compliments theme of game+Monsters provide challange untill later game when you have a decent military and can deal with everything thrown at you+Animations on Hearthlings and Monsters make them have personallity and express feelings+Easy to use building system that is an, ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" type of thing+fun and easy to come back to gameplay+Really helpfull devs that actually care about their work and the issues their players are havingCons-Building is buggy at times, but it is still in alpha, so this isn't as bad-Hearthlings are utterly stupid and keep putting themselves in dangerous situations sometimes and not at others with the same command issued to them-Mechant stalls only seem to get the basic merchant types and not special or more specialised onesFinalFor a game in Alpha, it is incredibly far along for what it is. Many of the games core mechanics are implamented, and the game is a blast. I personally cant wait for Multiplayer, Magmasmiths, Geomancers, the Expanded story quests, visiuallised travaling merchants, Transportation options, the Rabbit clan, alternate planes, Dwarves, titans, more construction parts and decor, the combat system expansion, and all the other stuff the Devs are planning on adding over the versions. Stonehearth is game game I would reccomend to everyone.			"

								I want to love this game sooo much. It has so much going for it. There are just a few flaws in logistics that are keeping it from being perfect.The AI is terrible - My workers are currently all standing around ""idle"" while I have crap everywhere that needs to be collected (ores, wood, wool, farm goods). There is no way to direct them to do what they are supposed to be doing.  I end up having to use the cancel option to permanently delete the items even though some are super rare. Amazing when i tell the workers to delete the item they are all over it....There is no way to edit the land once you have mined it. If you make a mistake...oh well...i hope you are not OCD like me. I currently have the grass layer near my village floating in the sky because either i made a mistake or my workers did not do as they were told.Finally, once food starts going bad in your storage it is a nightmare. Your workers do not remove this rotten food on their own accord. You must manually delete each basket of rotten food. Im at the point now where I literally spend a quarter of my day scoping out the food storage to remove these rotten baskets.This game is definitley on the right track but I would still wait until release to see if these kinks will be worked out. If they are this would likely become one of my favorite games in this genre on steam.TL:DR- AI needs work- Need an option to turn off rotting food or make workers remove it on their own- Need a few more land editing options in case you make a mistake (or your workers)This is a great title and I hope they continue to improve these imperfections. Giving it a thumbs up for encouragement to the Devs!			"

As for gameplay, it has its issues and is incomplete, but the game is beautiful, fun and, if the devs keep the good work, it will be a must for any lover of the style.But, as it is an early access, I'd like to focus on the developers. They are excellent people, work on every bug they can, are very transparent and posts constant updates in their blogs. If you're afraid of buying it because it is in EA, then you shouldn't be afraid anymore. Just hit their website www.stonehearth.net and take a look at their roadmap and devblog updates.			"

								So... Stonehearth.It's Early Access, and noticably so. Bugs, the fps drops lower the further you progress, your Hearthlings don't respond to commands, yada yada. Still, these bugs don't ruin the experience. Lower your expectations, it's not a fully completed game.The -in my opinion- biggest problem with this game, is the lack of difficulty scaling. Normal mode starts slightly difficult, but it gets too easy very quickly. There is a hard mode, but it suffers the same fate, except that it starts out very difficult.Once you've set up your farms and hunting grounds, your walls, your houses, there's not much that can hurt you anymore.Monsters don't destroy structures, which is both good and bad.Good, because given how clunky and weird the building system is, having walls get holes in them would be annoying to repair, unless hearthlings do it automatically, and then it becomes pointless. Bad, because they don't destroy anything. Put up some picket fences around a goblin camp without them attacking? Good job, they can't do anything to you now.With having said all this, the blue thumbs up might look strange, since all I've said are the negatives.But now that they're out of the way, I've got to say, this game is fantastic.The things that work, work really well.Having multiple combat squads, for example. Easy to assign, easy to control, incredibly satisfying to attack monsters from multiple angles, with seperate squads. Mining is easy, and the slice system is a godsend (and a necessity) for making multi-layer mines. The x-ray mode (it's not for finding ores easily, don't worry) is also fantastic. Being able to see your structures without all the other stuff in the way, it's great.And there is so much more good to be said about this game.Hearthling (they're the settlers, for clarification) professions are nice, and really allows for a personal story. Have a Trapper who has been there, doing the same work, for al the days he's been in the village? Let him retire, by making him a Shepherd (not saying all shepherds have easy lives, just that the hearthling ones seem to be in no rush, as they slowly walk through your village)!Maybe your farmer has farmed for so long that they've inevitably gotten exquisite knowledge about what they're doing?Promote them to a cook, and let them fill the metaphorical stomachs of your hearthlings!So, do I recommend this game?Obviously. But I also recommend patience when playing it. Everything won't go 100% perfectly, but if you work past the bugs, you'll have a fantastic time.			"

								This game has more in it than one would expect from an Alpha game. There is such a huge amount of fun to be had during your first play through, if you don't die that is, while unlocking the new jobs you can assign to your citizens. The game is cute and also quite the management simulator making decisions on what products you need vs how fast or what order you should do them in in order to keep your troops geared and healed to keep protecting your town etc. Overall this game is gonna get 4 big stars from me. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is tha the combat is just a bit bland. There are the healers, archers, and melee units. There is no differences between healers and archers they all work the same there is just a slight difference in melee units. All melee you will face only damage 1 of your guys at a time and just have a smack battle to see who dies first the only melee that is different are the giant ogres which have an aoe. So the combat is very cool looking and you have a lot of control as to what your individual fights do but the actual mechanic variety in the enemies is low to non but hey its Alpha theres alot of potential to be had.

								First off, I love this game. I completly understand that its not finished, and still needs a lot of work, but gosh dang do i love this game.This is the type of game that I can get lost in. Sit down and turn on some music or a movie and just play for hours on end. I find this game very relaxing. well.... at times it can be relaxing.The only problem i have with this game is the frequency of attackers when playing in normal or hard modes. i find it hard to get thing done and make progress at times because im all ways focused on my army and possible attack routs. over all I would give this game a 8/10 as it stands right now.

								Stonehearth is a great game by Radiant. This is one of the best purcheses I have made on steam. It's a nice city building game unlike any other! Monsters will attack your colony of hearthlings, but if you're not into the stuff, you can turn them off. The UI is great and it's fun to watch your colony grow to a threiving city. Another really cool thing is that I feel more conected with my hearthlings in Stonehearth then I do my villagers in Banaished or workers in Rise of Nation. They have names, there own look, and you only start off with a handfull so you get to know them very well. Remmeber that the gam is still in alpha, so there will be bugs and lack of content.Good:-City building (I like sandbox city building games)-Can turn enemies on and off-Kid freindly-Nice UI-Can design buildings-If your not gooding at building your own houses, you can use pre-made ones.-Even there it is still alpha, it's not an aboundend Early Access Game like banished and other uncompleted games that are on steam-The devs will sometimes stream them working on the games so they can get live feedback with the fans and can add what the fans want while the fan talks about it.Bad:-It's early access, there are bugs and a lack of content, but they are still coming out with updates to add the contenct. They even have a multiplayer mode planed.-Lack of tutorial so it can be hard for new players, but the games is only in alpha and there most likely will add that later.			"

								Stonehearth. Not to be confused with the card game Hearthstone nor the novel Stone Heart by Charlie Fletcher.It's a medieval town building game where you control what your settlers, also known as Hearthlings, do, somewhat.It has a Sims-esque overhead view where you can position the camera to watch settlers eat, sleep, mourn over the fact they ate a turnip raw, or plant the camera into a nearby mountain and see how fast you can scroll out of the mountain.Enough about the camera, what about the gameplay?It does have strong points, the Hearthlings can farm, mine, deforest an ecosystem for a chair, or be threatened by goblins about 1/3 of their height. Hearthlings don't fight back when attacked by monsters. Oh, sorry, they do. They just have to have another Hearthling be killed in order to do 1/4 a heart of damage. Sort of a human shield metaphor going on.The only ones who will fight back before wimping out because they were attacked are footmen, knights, archers, and walking bandages- whoops. I meant clerics. I thought this supposed to be a town building game, not a DnD set up.Before I continue, I'd just like to point out that the ""heart"" I speak of serve as a HP bar, when there is only one heart.The combat is interesting, albeit unforgiving if you are outnumbered. Enemies will group up if Hearthlings don't kill them fast enough and they will chop at their health like a chef to a carrot.Speaking of carrots, there's farming. It is quite smart to have a rot system on raw ingredients, but from what I know, cooking the food will eliminate rotting and make it an MRE, essentially. But before your Hearthlings can have a nice serving of cold soup, you must have a cook because it seems like the Hearthlings were spoonfed and never learned how to roast a carrot over the campfire you are given from the very start. Oh yeah, there are levels for jobs as well, still leaning to the DnD metaphor, since the Hearthlings get buffs and skills from leveling up. Extra damage, more recipes, being able to herd sheep you pulled from your bum.""Ok, it looks like I need an archer and a knight since these footmen are getting destroyed by a sentient stump.""""Hold on there! Your footmen are only level 2! They need to be level 3 before you can promote them! Just have them walk in circles around that small farm plot for 4 hours!""""That seems easy, 4 hours ingame isn't that long, it's 4 minutes.""""No, I meant 4 hours in real time.""So I may have exaggerated there about leveling up. The Hearthlings level up their job by, er, doing their job. Farmers farm, Blacksmiths smith, Soldiers stare at dirt.Some Hearthlings level up faster than others because of their special buffs. There are 3, but based on value, the only ones worth having are Body and Mind. Body (health) is pretty straight forward. Mind makes your Hearthlings level faster and create better versions of items.I didn't really understand that. How does a carpenter take the materials to make 1 chair and create 2, while one chair is of higher quality?The higher quality furniture doesn't have any other use other than having a nicer look and a higher gold value. Trading in this game is similar to other games; Vender sells item at a fixed price, you can sell the same item for half. Sometimes you can get specialty deals from wandering traders. While some are good, the others are asinine. Some come along the line of ""I'll give you one twig for your 54 baskets of pumpkins!"" or ""I'll give you 40 steel bars if you show me a smile, you heartless being!"" Before you can make this transaction, you must wait a period because, I don't know, the trader has to preform a broadway play or something. Which makes sense, they make a deal which can be done in a minute or in 5 days. Sometimes you can get a trade for something from the other band of Hearthlings, which is nice if you hate seeing the same stalks of yellow vegetables. I couldn't say it WORKS yet, let me find out later, I got an offer for watermellon seeds and it just seems like it took my corn.Deforestation is also an issue. They fixed that by adding farmable saplings. ""What? Now it's both DnD AND Minecraft?! It's just a rip!"" And that is why those who point out things like that shouldn't make reviews. Wait... Anyway, be prepared to either have a sapling farm that makes 1 sapling every harvest, which isn't a lot, or 200 every harvest, which is just a tad too much.While writing this, I realized this review was long. Before I end this and rethink my life, there are a couple of things.Do I recommend it? Yes, I do. I'd recommend it only to people with beefy computers.What did you mean ""control the Hearthlings somewhat?"" Hearthlings act like they are their own AI, they run to get a log of wood that is guarded heavily by wolves. They destroy ladders from construction of a building while a Hearthling or 2 are still on the roof. Which, in return, they die from lack of food and things to do.What's a good starting point? Stay in the forests and on ledges, you can dig a trench and monsters won't attack your town (it actually does work based on it's pathfinding).			"

								Amazing game. Having a ton of fun on it so far. However, I've had to completely ditch a few of my well-built worlds because of bugs. Sometimes I have to restart my world because it bugs out and my hearthlings won't build a building I've requested them to build.Also, I wish there was a way to make seperate rooms in a building. I mean, you can with freestanding walls, but the freestanding walls have ugly columns and if you connect it to a corner, then it makes these ugly columns. If you could hide the columns on the freestanding walls it'd be good.Other than the massive amount of bugs (only because the game is in early access right now), the game is amazing and I enjoy it a ton.

								Reminds me a lot of dwarf fortress. I can only hope that the game gets that depth and complexity that dwarf fortress has. Excited to see where it goes. Definitely a fun few hours if you like city building type games.For the devs the only thing I wish is turning off the shadows of the clouds. Love the look but right now it slows down the image even through my i4-4790@3.6ghz doesn't get above 50% nor does my memory 16gb ddr3, Radeon R9 200 series. The only thing I can think of is that the shadows/lights isn't making use of all the resources and that causes some slow graphics.very dwarf fortress and when a game tries to do that (in 3d voxels no less) you're gonna run into some funk.

								This game has more in it than one would expect from an Alpha game. There is such a huge amount of fun to be had during your first play through, if you don't die that is, while unlocking the new jobs you can assign to your citizens. The game is cute and also quite the management simulator making decisions on what products you need vs how fast or what order you should do them in in order to keep your troops geared and healed to keep protecting your town etc. Overall this game is gonna get 4 big stars from me. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is tha the combat is just a bit bland. There are the healers, archers, and melee units. There is no differences between healers and archers they all work the same there is just a slight difference in melee units. All melee you will face only damage 1 of your guys at a time and just have a smack battle to see who dies first the only melee that is different are the giant ogres which have an aoe.

								I love crafty games (if you haven't already noticed that by my reviews).This one is interesting in that you can control villagers - to a point.  They are constently wondering off doing their things, getting stuck in places they have no business being, and just acting like they have a mind of their own!However, the crafting in the game is pretty fun and easy enough to follow.  I am excited to see how this game evolves, and I have loved all the new updates when they come out and all the little tweeks the devs have done to make it more enjoyable.Its a solo, but i do recommend it.

								I love the personalities that you create for your little Hearthlings, aswell as the large ammount of customisation involved with the construction of your settlement, including good mod support. I unfortunately do encounter quite a few bugs, that become more apparent the longer you play a save. If you don't mind having to put up with bugs here and there and would like to support a devoted indie dev, I would recomend it in it's current state. However if you are put off by this: I strongly recommend keeping an eye on it up to it's final release; that will include a multitude of new features.			"

								If you like these kind of ""build"" and ""take care of your pop"" games. Then this is something you should try out.I joined in on the kickstarter and ever since it was greenlit i play it for a couple of hours every 1-3 months. Why? Since that way the improvements made in patches have made the game more fun than the last time.What i really miss at the moment is having more pop (at writing moment, the max limit is 20, which is just enough to have a working settlement and 6 soldiers). More pre-made buildings; would be nice to have one building for each profession.Game crashed just as i reached the end. But unlike when i played last time, it didnt really lag or stuff like that. (when i played last time, it started to lag after a few hours and then started to ""slow down"" until it crashed.			"

The most popular one ive found so far is when workers just stop doing there tasks, for examample one time I spent a good 10 minuits planning a new HUGE portion of one of my villages, clicked ""start building"", everything was going fine, then all my workers decided to sit down and have lunch. Once they were done they just stood. No matter what tried I couldnt fix it and had to restart. I found this glitch happens 70% of the time whenever you build anything, weatheer its a small 1 person cottage to half your village this glitch will happen. I really really want to give this game a big thumbs up but I cant do that until the developers fix these game breaking bugs and glitches. "

								I've been on the fence about if this game is good or not, but this small little bug pushed me over. One of my Guards who were on duty spoted an enemy and attacked. Good as usual, until I noticed the enemy was away some ways, then when the guard started to loose (he had the smallest amount of health left) he ran away. Which is good, unless after taking 3 steps away he ran back and died. 1 of my Hearthlings died, because the game didn't let him run away and heal. My Hearthlings also nearly died when they got trapped in a mine and the other Hearthlings on the surface (who where generic workers) wouldn't build a ladder down to save them, so I had to demote a farmer and that worked. But cmon! Stop adding things until these bugs are fixed! Soon enough my town will die out because there's no food though there are 7 plot fulls of food sitting infront of there eyes!			"

For me after and hour of playing, didnt even save the game yet, a UI error appeared and the game broke, it was somewhat playable but i couldnt open my building tabs or job menus.... this was truly a waste of $25... ive read the reviews and watched gameplay... i reccomend you buy this when it is fully developed or when they lower the prive because this is more of a $10 game than it is $25... But hey add some things and it might even be worth $14.99 but not $25, even if everything is fixed and done it wont be worth $25, thats just a ripoff.			"

								Without a doubt some great potential here! The game is pretty damn awesome!! BUT also very buggy currently! So dont expect to much  :PThis pretty much still holds true.......but i had the game for a year and devlopment advancements seems very limited.....So im starting to be a bit more doubtfull about this recommendation.community is generally good but does hold some favoritisme in my impression......and i think the game suffers a bit under that......moving focus to things that dont matter......get the basic building system working before you start making sheep behavior..and unfrotunately i seen nothing of that.......heartlings still faill my most basic buildings.....the core of the game :/ Not even incredible simple stuff has been added as more color choices..Vertical build space is still not a thing.  see tru wall tool will never work.....I still reccommend it but it wont stay this way for long......

								Before you play even though the reviews are very positive, make sure there is a sale before spending $25 or so.The game somewhat acts alot like Rimworld and Minecraft except you cant manually control your civilians.Bugs Ive encountered: missing heads, or head is where the torso of the character is, Stop building and working, no tutorial even though it takes around a hour to figure out how things work. For me after and hour of playing, didnt even save the game yet, a UI error appeared and the game broke, it was somewhat playable but i couldnt open my building tabs or job menus.... this was truly a waste of $25... ive read the reviews and watched gameplay... i reccomend you buy this when it is fully developed or when they lower the prive because this is more of a $10 game than it is $25... But hey add some things and it might even be worth $14.99 but not $25, even if everything is fixed and done it wont be worth $25, thats just a ripoff.			"

								When it comes to voxel games this might be the next holy grail. A sandbox ""city building"" game with crafting support and basic trading, this one mixes it all into one enjoyable game.Due to its early access phase its not a game I would suggest everybody to play right now. However, if you are not easily aggrivated by bugs in an early access game this might be the one game you have to try in the least.This game has a very active community which can be found trough the discourse Stonehearth website.Ofcourse the quality of the game isn't decided by its community, but the support the developers receive of all the players does help it to get in on track of becoming one of the better games out there. What does make the game so great is that it carries a replayability in its core design that will keep the players coming back over and over to sink more hours into Stonehearth.The music you hear while playing is not distracting and fits the game just right. Same goes for most of the sound effects. After about 15 minutes you'll learn to recognise the warning sounds from when your town is under attack and it feels almost like it has always been that way.The graphics aren't the best but its a voxel game that pushes the feeling of older 8-bit games into a modern 3D game environment. And it does it great, it shows a style that wasn't unique among similar games but if you see video's of screenshots you know that its Stonehearth. Together with the sound and music it just fits.The UI is userfriendly enough that without a tutorial you will learn to use it within the first 30 minutes. A small concern is the usage of the combat menu. You will navigate trough to many buttons in my opinion to react quickly enough to the enemy invaders of your town that there is a higher chance that one of your soldiers wont survive the battle.Also, because the game features your villagers as free spirited enitites, you give them commands that arent't always exact. This will give you the feeling that the AI is not listening or your villagers seem to be complete idiots.This can be very frustrating sometimes and with the early access bugs you will need alot of patience.With everything together I would give the game an 8 out of 10 score and when it comes out of early accesss I'd advise it to any voxel/city builder/strategy lover out there to at least give it a try.

								After a few hours of play i think this game is very promising but has bugs which has caused me to quit towns multiple times. main game breaking bug is when the workers stop building a building leaving scaffolding and a half made building in your city with no way of deleting the half done building. Once these have been fixed and further content is added i see myself spending hours designing cities and defenses.			"

								It has the potential to become something great, but i feel the game is a little disorganized in gameplay.  Theres some micromanagement needed to produce goods, and I feel the hearthlings needs better AI to collect reasources and items that are just lying on the ground. Not only that I have trouble crafting because i don't have an instant idea of what reasources i already have and and what i need to craft new items and even build buildings. I guess what I think the game really needs right now is for the hearthlings to become more intilligent and autnomous so that they're always doing something productive other than restocking the stockpile when i'm not giving orders.These are all things i think should be dealt with as the game updates. Quite frankly i'm impressed that the game is set to continue running depsite all the erros and bugs that pop up which is of course a clear indication that the game still needs some polishing. But I am sure that once this game is eventually completed it should become something very fun.			"

								Been playing stonehearth for some time now. Devs are great people and listen to their audience. They are fast paced at fixing issues and listen when you give advice. The game itself is amazing, even in early stages like this. With each new alpha the game grows phenomenally, and gives you so many additional things to do. It has it's bugs yes, but its early access and people need to remember that. If you bug out, read into it, find out if its common, and talk about it. We have the opportunity to form this game and make it what it is that we all want to play. Give the devs your ideas, but remember. They are gamers just like us, and want to help end our boredom and give us something great!			"

								TL;DR - If you like sim/survival games à la Gnomoria, Craft the World, etc... This game VERY worth it.This is one of the best Dwarf Fortress clone on the market at the moment. It beats games like Gnomoria out of the water mainly because of slick UI and easy to navigate Z axis for depth mining.There are bugs. But nothing extremely game breaking at the moment, the devs seem to be doing a good job of cleaning up their code.As some people mentioned, VERY CPU intensive. I've noticed that it seems the game has a memory leak problem, it'll run smooth for a few hours, but after 3-4 hours straight in one settlement, it starts to frame lag. Closing the program, waiting, and restarting fixes this. So at least it's not something permanent even if you have 30+ settles and a lot of business on the screen.I love the Tech tree idea, I hope it will come with a lots more jobs and advacements.Building design is HARD! If you're new, don't bother with it, take the default buildings and run with that. After a few games you can start banging your head on the design thing. It's not intuitive, that's the biggest problem, but once you get the functions, it DOES get  quite easy.Pros- FUN! The game might not be feature complete, but it's a hell of a lof of fun- Slick UI and non-confusing X,Y,Z in 3D environment nagivation (not easy to do imho)-Crafting! Gosh I love crafting, and this has already quite a few recipes. Could have a lot more, hope it gets more, but already very satisfactory- Sound and music: bravo- The two different tribes and map types give interesting variation in gameplay. - Some jobs are retro compatible, e.g. cook will keep faming. Which is a very cool feature- There are small quests and bigger mission types to get your town marked with township and such, so keep on going even if it seems you are at the end of progression, some nifty things are coming your way- Nice graphicsCons- Seems the mobs are very scripted, completely not random. Depending on your difficulty, you will always get the same waves at the same time. There are random mobs and spawns on the map, but by now I can already mark down when the first 5-10 invasions will happen in a Mid or Hard game. Takes away from the excitement.- Some bugs. Most annoying at the moment for me is that after level 6 or so while digging, mining highlight do not sticky. The task seems to be set in, but the yellow marker doesn't show. Hard to keep track of where I clicked.- Current soldier AI is not very good. I've had my soldiers die because they completely split up when attacking, specially when chasing Archer/Ranged type enemies, and they end up dying 1 by 1 even at high levels because they just don't work together. Lots of micromanagement needed on your troops which can be annoying.- Some parts of the game are no obvious. Where do you get sheep, or Poyos? Still need to find it out...Suggestions- Give workers levels too. They work so hard, and get nothing for it, poor things. But seriously, it would make sense to have your base workers be able to gain levels and maybe advance in things like: harvesting, mining, hauling (inventory expansions, etc...)- Priority system for the regular worker tasks (see Craft the World)-Allow remapping of the keys! I can't tell you how many times I send my damn tribe in alert mode because I am trying to turn a furniture piece to the left before placement, whoever took R as the alarm instead of ROTATION never played these games before :P- It doesn't seem to have any benefit to level up a class to the max before promoting your Hearthling to the next job. Would be cool if some bonuses would stick. Specially when it comes to the military, as a Knight level 1 might get trampled even if he was a Footman level 6 before.- Would be nice to be able to set patrol areas for your soldiers, instead of having them just marching in the base camp all the time- And on/off switch for soldiers would be great. If not walking/training, they could function as regular workers- Training area for soldiers/archers etc...- MORE MAGIC! Love the cleric, need more- Babies! Marriage, love, interactions, old age?- Fishing!- Multiplayer would be a blast, but I guess quite hard to do with Co-Op mode?- Dyes for clothes, more clothes with bonuses for the various jobs- Bit more functionalities for pets, don't even notice I have any most of the timeSpecsWin 10intel i7 479016 GB RAMGeForce GTX 980			"

								I enjoy this game for the first 30 or so minutes but you can tell it's still a work in progress. One major issue I have problems with is after about 30 minutes of game time it slows down and starts lagging. I'm not sure of the reason for this, I assume it's because it's loading more of the map into RAM as I explore. So i find that the more of the map I explore the slower the game becomes until it's basically unplayable. Once this issue with lag and RAM hogging is resolved it would be a great game and I will recommend the game.			"

								TL;DRToo exensive for so little content.In itself the game has a lot of potential. Basically it is a RTS Minecraft more or less. You decide what your villagers build, what furniture or weapons they craft etc etc.Sadly, the content so far is very limited. And it does not feel like there is any progress in this regard.After the first few nights it feels like there is nothing left to do. You have accomodation, a few farms and traps and a small military squad to fend off invaders.From that point onward it is literally just wathing your villagers eat and sleep.If the devs would add more content this would definitely be a recommendation. But in its current state the game is way too expensive.			"

Multiple-story buildings, combat, raids and counter-raids, and some nasties that come say hi at night. Great town simulation game with fun RPG elements.At the moment it's still short of what it wants to be, but with the progress the devs have made in the transparency in their progression, I doubt it will be long before you can play with your buddies and experience the other classes and goodies the game will offer.It's a game I've had fun coming back to nearly every update, and one that I eagerly await release of.

I reall suggest this game for anyone who likes/liked Bansihed or games along those lines. The only bad point for me is thatfor me the maps you chose and settle in the area is a little small for me. But apart ftom that this game is worth the money and time if you are willing to put it in. in my eyes this game has an easy 9/10  "

								I've had this game for about six months now. Enjoyed it a lot ! This game is brilliant and is kind of  defining a new game ""genre"" with it's unsual mix. Minecraft, Final Fantasy Tactics, real-time strategy with complex economy and yet... a significant touch of RPG. You really have to try it in order to understand the thin line on which the devs are refining the new concept. One of the best thing is probably it's adaptability. The game let you choose without asking or inteferring if you want to focus on building peacefully or on the adventure and the fighting... or both. You don't have to developp and max every job tree available, yet you can try and face a really interesting challenge.BUT... I'm beginning to be bored. Maybe it's the fact that the game developped so fast during the first months... now the last 2 alphas we're about the building system. But everytime I come back and try and lunch a new game to see if the bugs in the building system got rid of... I just face the same fact : those scaffolding are driving me mad ! It's still impossible to build a decent 10x14 blocs, 2 floors house without having those staying on the stairs inside or on the walls or on the cliffs or...whatever... Are the devs going to clear this bug definitely one day ?			"

								Stonehearth is a rather charming village builder. You start out with a handfull of ""Hearthlings"" to start out your village. By making buildings, gathering food, getting wealth, and keeping moral you can grow your population. I have been playing this on and off for the past year or so and have seen some great improvements from the devs and can't wait to see what is coming in the future. You kind of have to be in the right mood to play this game; sort of in a relaxed, animated fantasy sort of mood. But I suppose you kind of have to be in the right mood to play any game. Today, I'm going to break the mold and start with cons:-It's still in alpha. There are some bugs yet and I have found some in various parts of the game. -There isn't much of an end game. (That I know of)-the bugs that are fixed cometimes create new bugs. Pros:-The building aspect offers some cusomization with custom floor plan, building material, and a bit on roof design.-Depending on which job you give your Hearthling, they will progress in levels and you can promote them to an advanced job or let them increase their level at the current job and be more productive.-You have hard mode which offers a big challenge to your management with planning and managing. -The devs are very active and take in feedback and bug reports and fix them within a few weeks. -The devs also keep regular updates in blogs every other (or every) Tuesday about what's going on and near future plans. -I enjoy the cartoony art style. The Hearthlings are cute and the monsters are kind of ugly but in a cartoon, funny kind of way. -There is a job tree with various different jobs to give your villagers which is still in progress but improving with every alpha release. Hope this helps.			"

								This game has potential but as of right now I think they are asking for a bit much when it seems they don't have that much yet. The game is super laggy just a couple of minutes in to gameplay even on a monster gaming pc. And the gameplay engine seems very un-optimized when it comes to queing orders of building or crafting. For some reason they just refuse to make stuff for the longest of times and blacksmiths focus more on building than cfrating what you ordered and so on. Doesnt seem to be other players as of yet even ai is only limited too some random single or up to five unit squads attacking, but no bases or ai players to attack or loot. Very small map too. Still I am going to put this as a positive review because of the potential and what this game could be. Please dear developer, don't screw your fans over. You have asked a high price and received it, please live up to the expectations that come with it.But no updates in a long time and to many bus for me to recommend.			"

								This game is one of the best, challenging,and fun all in one. The game allow your to build amazing building with its free building system. The game is also challenging in the ememies of course they get harder the more your grow your town but there is actually there is a story in the goblins and the hearthlings (names of the people) when you get in late game they send whole armys of goblins attacting your town. So now the things i don't like about the game....at it current build the game is laggy but i know its just because the game is in alpha so i can past that through now (just seen its in aplha 20 and they said in alpha 21 there gonna fix the lag). Somthing else that i thing is just because its in alpha is somtimes the actual game engine breaks XD and you gotta to delete your town and start over so yea. So do i think you should buy the game well yes but at this momment its up to you since it is in alpha its still have alot of problems and will still get more and more content. So if you wanna wait till the game is fully released i think its ok but like i said its up to you if you wanna buy it right now.			"

								Disclosure: I backed this game on kickstarterHonestly, I think this is the most gameplay-filled and most stable ""Alpha"" I've ever played.  There are some bugs and glitches here and there (Your villagers are REALLY dumb, keep an eye on them or they'll get themselves trapped somewhere and starve to death) but it is absolutely playable and very fun.I would call this game, as it is right now, a very casual version of the Dwarf Fortress/Gnomoria genre.  While it is not nearly as in depth or complicated as those games (yet), it has a great style and good UI that is more approachable than those games.The in game tutorial is brief but really good for easing you into this genre.The building system is also head and shoulders above other games in the genre allowing you to create unique and interesting buildings for your villagers very easily.The two factions campaigns are very short, unfortunately, and after the 30ish hours I've put in I feel I've seen most of what this current build has to offer in terms of prescripted events and variety of activities.  I look forward to more things being added later, but certainly feel I've gotten my money's worth already.			"

								Its a okay game for sure but the game don't do the stuff u want them to do.1st thing those little people don't is carry almost anything or everything to storage I have finish my buildings, digging,  hunting, and farming. But they they just leave it behind fastforwarding or use using normal speed 15 days later barly any thing is in storage I got the space but more than 7/8 is not in storage.2nd issue process of making custom building. You see the list builds there only 4 options and want to make a better build so making it and guess what u want to remove a piece because it looks or mistake (this part already placed were u dont want to undo) guess what can't and forced to deal with it or remove the whole building build it again. Part 2 of 2nd issue Okay everythings done you have just finished build but wait a sec weres the finish build button aprently the game doest want the keep the button hay game make sure that button is always avliable.3rd building there are 2 issues in building that seen constintly they build it but then won't build it even though i haven't pause(and of course this is after days of waiting) then forced to cancel it and rebuild it again. The part 2 of 3rd issue is that when they build they put up those ladders and wooden platforms right and they dont remove it so i got a build with stuff that i cant even remove.This is after 14.7 hours of game time and this issues i've encontered so far the game crashing seems to be a issue also but its not to constint. So develpers work on the game more.			"

								Fun in concept but garbage in reality, the AI is crap and often abandons jobs or mining sites for no reason and you gotta struggle trying to figure out a way to get them to clear that piece of land or finish building a certain building. And often they will refuse to remove the structures no matter how many times you command them to remove it. Only hope at that point is to start a new game or have a village that looks half abandoned.So it's all inconvenientWhen the game actually works, it works well, but until it's updated futher it's not really something I'd reccomend, the games description and screenshots hype it up a lot more than it needs to be, as do the reviews. The game will be fixed in a matter of decades, early access games have a habbit of not being completed or living up to the real potential or hype, like most kickstarter campaigns.tldr; gay game			"

								Several of the helpful positive reviews used the word Metroidvania to describe this game, and that set a certain expectation. I was very quickly disappointed, as the gameplay is basically ""exploring"" empty cooridors with the occassional environmental hazard or upgrade until you reach the next boss. What these reviewers meant by ""Metroidvania"" was true in only the barest sense: get new weaponry -> use to open path to next boss.			"

								A cute little game. The art and play style are very endearing very quickly, and it's a good way to spend a few hours relaxing. My only real complaint is that ATM, it's somewhat limited and repetitive. I hope to eventually see some greater variety in building types, not just living and eating spaces, and maybe some more goals you have to meet in order to gain your next villager. But overall, I'd recommend this even if you don't like Early Access games. This is one that gets better and more interesting with each new build.			"

Early Access Review
								As a big fan of games like Minecraft and Civilization I decided to buy Stonehearth even though it is only an Alpha. I am very impressed from playing so far (Alpha v11), yes there are bugs which can be game breaking and there is so much more that needs to be added, but this really has the beginnings of a good game. I've done a couple of play throughs and am getting the hang of managing the little town and it is very addictive. At the moment there is a bit of a lack of things to do at the later stages of the game, mining for minerals has only recently been added and beyond upgrading gear doesn't seem to have much purpose, but I'm sure more will be added.Of course, it is still in Alpha so there are many issues that can be annoying, the AI of your workers can be poor at times and they can just get stuck doing nothing. I think it would really benefit this game to allow some control over individual workers, or at least allow some prioritization of tasks because at the moment it is a bit frustrating when for example you want a worker to pick something up that he's stood next to but he just doesn't do it.These bugs aside the game is very promising and I will certainly be following its development closely. If bugs annoy you then I would wait for the retail version. If, like me, you like the look of the game and can't wait, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

								Read the reviews. Don't buy the game unless you are interested in its development. Game has some game breaking issues and bugs. Biggest issue for me at the moment is that buildings CANNOT be destroyed or deconstructed, without using console commands. -Graphics are perfect for this type of game.-UI feels more like a browser game UI. Game its self is great and has some potential.-Some advice if you do want to buy and play it, is to save often so if your building bugs out and doesn't get completed or you don't like how it turned out you can just load a previous save.

TLDR:Game I thought I wouldn't like because I've never played Minecraft, but ended up falling in love with it. This game is really amazing and it's still in alpha/early access. 8/10 and worth the price even in Early Access.My Impression:My first impression of Stonehearth after watching their presentation video was that I didn't think I would enjoy playing it. Although I have never played Minecraft, the graphics reminded me of it. I never really got into Minecraft because I prefer single-player games and because of the graphics. I paid $19.99 for the game during the Steam Winter Sale, and I thought I was probably going to refund it due to the game not being worth the price. I decided I would buy it during the sale and if I didn't like it I would refund it. I was wrong, I love the game. DansGaming also had the same feeling as me. He thought it was going to be a mediocre game and was only going to stream it for a bit. He ended up falling in love with it as well.Positive:+ City builder but with a mix of RPG elements and character classes+ Unique party system to manage your civilians easiers+ Multiple races and scenarios to play with+ Crafting and building system are near perfection, well done+ Fun quests and random encounters+ Different modes if you want to just build or battle enemies while you build+ Relaxing gameplay+ Great soundtrack+ UI is aesthetically pleasing  + Overall extremely well polished for an Early Access titleNegatives:- Optimization could be a bit better, depending on how high your citizen setting is at (I found my sweet spot at 22 citizens), performance can be slowed down. Fire effects also slow the game down.- Using the house builder at the moment is very unintuitive and not easily done- Could use more built in premade buildings- Bugs, things you would expect in an early access title- No steam workshop for building blueprints- No cloud saves- Added some suggestions to the developers at ( https://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/suggestions-after-playing-about-15-hours/27403 )Very Good Game: 8/10I have refunded many games on Steam before. I am often very skeptical of the prices developers list their games at, but I can say that this game is worth it's price even in Early Access.			"

								Man do I want to like this game... I mean I really really do but... I just can't recommend it in its current state at its current price tag. There are some good things worth mentioning about this game like the music and the design your own buildings aspect. But you just sort of run out of things to do or things start feeling repetetive about 8 hours in. Most game destroying bugs are fixed at this point but for $25, I would at least wait several updates. Spend the extra $5 and get Rimworld in the meantime.			"

								I might change this with further updates but as of now i wouldn't reccomend getting this.When i bought this i thought it would be a bit like a minecrafty version of Rimworld but its not really.It's like rimworld but 1. the ai storyteller isn't trying to actively kill you ( a plus ) and 2. the building is realy realy horrible.Everything and i mean everything is made using that new building button, so you end up with roads counting as a building.Don't even get me started at making 2 floors or more.. i can't figure out how to make stairs at all, even though you think it would just be block on block right? not in this game.So what i do is i go into the mountain and make cave dwellings. this works rather well. Untill the lack of optimalisation kicks you in the teeth.All in all it looks nice and it's fun to play but until they do some major optimising and some work on the building aspect i say go play Rimworld instead. It's not threedee and looks a lot like prison architect ( and last time i checked also still in alpha ) but at least the reason why your settlement dies out is because the game actively kills you not because your computer is getting strangled.

								I got this game months ago, since I wanted something relaxing and sandbox-ish, and this game's charm and city-building/adventure mechanics looked really great. Back then, I had a bit of fun trying to build a village, but found things quickly messed up with buginess, especially with the building editor. Fair enough, I thought. I'll come back to it later.It's been months, and the devs still haven't fixed up the building editor. You can't even undo or delete structures. If you make a mistake, it's permanent. This game has been on the market for almost 3 years, as of writing. Building is a central mechanic. It needs to be playable in this regard before the developers even think about adding other content.Keep an eye on it if this is the kind of game you enjoy, but I'd advise against spending your money on it as of writing.

								Still very broken at some points. Truly a fun game but has many issues that can break the game and force you to restart. They just added a new feture where you hearthlings will be knocked out instead of dying so you can try to save them. I was not far into the game and had 3 troops while playing on normal. Out of no where can this enemy that was really tough but they game through more enemies right away and all my troops were knocked out. My hearthlings couldnt do anything. With this new update it seems like hearthlings, even troops run away more. they get hit when they run away and then im left with 20 hearthling knocked out and unable to do anything. Also any enemies that survive the battle just linger around so if i get a new hearthling, it will get butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the enemy in a second. Great game, just too many issues that break the game, like the difficulty not making any sense, hearthlings not working anymore, too many powerful enemies attacking too early. One game it was day 2 and a really powerful giant came and wrecked my village. they need to really just take a step back and look at the game and fix the bugs.			"

								So far I can gauge this game being a ""Minecraft/DF town sim blend done right"". Things that are in the game work well and good (until you meet bugs), and the whole process of managing your town is quite smooth and nice, easily the best or near-best of that I've seen in similar games.So, why it's ""not recommended""?At the moment, there isn't much to do there. The amount of content that you can try is extremely low, vertical progression is basically nonexistent - you can unlock all the things that are currently implemented in the game in 2 to 3 game days (that's 1-1.5 hours of playtime at most), and afterwards there's nothing left to do apart from ""build more stuff because you can and it's the only thing you can"".Additonal grain of salt is the building editor - customizable buildings is one of the defining points of the game (that is, one of the defining points that is actually implemented right now), but the editor is rather clunky and hard to use in cases other than traditional 1-story building (multiple stories aren't implemented at the moment) with simple inner structure and minimal amount of walls. Try to do complex multi-room irregurarly-shaped buildings, however, and you will be fighting the UI much more than actually planning.And finally, the pacing of development is nothing to write home about. The initial plans (from Kickstarter campaign) were to release the game towards the end of 2014, you know. Now it's the end of 2015, and we recently had an alpha version where devs were mostly fixing internals, such as pathfinding. Going by this, it is extremely unlikely that we'll see any reasonably-sized chunk of gameplay - that is, content and actual mechanics - available until the end of 2016, and beta/release stages may follow even later. And that's only if the development won't stop abruptly at some point.To summarize, it's a game that promises really great things, but currently allows you to plant turnips, design and build simple small buildings, dig through mountains, and hit randomly-appearing enemies such as goblins with some swords (archery is not implemented yet). That's all.			"

								It is fun, I won't deny it. But the vast amount of bugs get in the way of that. From villagers not building things to them getting stuck in walls or tables (sometimes a save and reload just does not work), to not explaining what you can actually do. I designed an amazing house for instance, clicked ""build"". Nothing. Nothing at all. Nobody doing anything. The worst part is that i still dont know what was the cause. There is nothing to tell me what im doing wrong if I am doing something wrong at all.It is early access and so far the gameplay is fine, but with the large amount of bugs and the high price, I just cant reccomend it in the current condition. But I will be keeping my eye on it.			"

								To put simply this game is Age of Empires meets Minecraft. It is still in Alpha, so obviously there are still bugs, however the game is completely playable right now. The only issue that interfers gameplay wise as far as I can tell is building, if you design complex and large structures sometimes your hearthlings (citizens/people) will have trouble completeing it and handling objects. Keeping this in mind you can simply use the command console to instant build the building or just build it in easier to manage chunks, and if there is scaffolding or ladders left up just use the destroy command in the command console to remove them. Furthermore, if you see that your hearthlings have yet to place an item there is a good chance you simply put it ontop of a block above the path they can take, in this case just build a ladder and take it down after the item is placed. I know you may be thinking, I shouldn't have to do this extra junk to play the game, but again it's in alpha still and the ""extra work"" is like an extra click. All-and-all this is a very fun game that gets even funner as they add new stuff and c'mon if an Alpha version is already fun and awesome then the completed will be even better.			"

A least half of the buildings I told them to construct are still unfinished despite having well over enough resources available.  You can't edit a building once it's told to be constructed, unless you want to remove it entirely, and even that task gets ignored by workers.I would only recommend this game after the developer fixes a lot of the core issues with building.

								Purchased the game 9 days ago after watching it for months.  It is way over priced at $24.99 for what you get in return.  The game is fantastic up to the point where you get numerous engine error messages.  The game completely freezes up after about 60-90 minutes of play.  No crashing, game just pretty much stops.  Now you can either check on the game every 10 -15 minutes and see if any of the people have moved or start a new game.  Starting a new game just puts you back into the position of having the same freezing game problem in another 60-90 minutes.  I have played on the 11 build and the 12 build version and the freezing problem happens on both vesions.  Hope this will get fixed so the game is playable rather than the DEVS adding in more content.  The portion of the game that I could play was really great, would just like to be able to actually play it longer and see what the people can actually do.This is not on my end as I run an AMD FX 8350  Eight Core Processor   4 GHz  8 GB Ram   64 Bit Operating System  Win 10.

								A cautious recommendation. Buy only if you are keen to support the title during development.it shows a lot of promise, but needs more devtime to add content, bug fixing and polish. Had some bugs, such as buildings not completing, villagers not doing what is expected... very much a work in progress with what I can only assume is very little QA performed before build releases ( Which is somewhat expected in Early Access, which is still stupid )I started to have performance issues around the 18 Villager mark.

From villagers not building things to them getting stuck in walls or tables (sometimes a save and reload just does not work), to not explaining what you can actually do. I designed an amazing house for instance, clicked ""build"". Nothing. Nothing at all. Nobody doing anything. The worst part is that i still dont know what was the cause. There is nothing to tell me what im doing wrong if I am doing something wrong at all.It is early access and so far the gameplay is fine, but with the large amount of bugs and the high price, I just cant reccomend it in the current condition.

I've lost my entire village 3 times in a row compared to pre-patch I never lost the whole village. I have fences up, plenty of soldiers and still get overwhelmeed. For one thing, with the new rangers in game the fighters get low on health and run around with their arms up and DESERVE TO DIE.  The rangers just sit in one spot and kill them.

If you want an interesting game with a lot of potential and a solid base, then I would say look into this one.  The dev team is really straight forward and keeps the community informed on the current state of the game.  What they do, why they are working on what they are currently working on.  The pace at which they work is steady and with care and attention.I feel that they have a good idea on priorities with development.			"

								Great Game, absolutely love everything about it... except the fact that 9/10 times when building a structure my workers will just stop in the middle of building and nothing I do will make them resume. I'll build a wall and they'll leave the scaffolding up and the enemies will just climb right over it. I'd really love to give this game a positive rating but until this problem (earliest reports going back all the way to 2015!) is fixed I can't make myself give it a positive rating. I've been forced to stop playing because I simply can't get anything done with this bug around.			"

								Hello everybody! I have been with Stonehearth since alpha sixteen, I believe. This game is amazing, BUT definitely get it on sale if you can. I think it may be a little expensive right now, considering that it has no multiplayer and still in alpha and all that. So, here I will make a pros and cons of this game.Let's begin with the PROS:- Unique building system- Minecraft-like creativity- Recent updates allow for more complex structures to be made- Combat- Updated frequently. (Weekly updates/Bug fix updates, new alpha versions about every month or two)Now for the cons...:- Pricey- Buggy because it's still in alpha- Enemies are overpowered on harder difficulties- The game has the basic idea for turret defense but for the price it's virtually useless- NO MULTIPLAYER, something the devs said would be in the game in about 6-8 months, and about a year later it still isn't here.- No memes. (This one is just a joke don't get you panties in a bundle :D)What I want to see as a player?- MULTIPLAYER- Lower pricethats about it :D Keep going devs your doing great.would recommend if you can get it on sale for >$20 :)			"

								I wouldn't call this game fun. It's a bit satisfying to build your town, defend it and upgrade everything, yes. Fun? Not really.I've run across a couple of consistent problems, however, across the patches.1- Strongest problem I came across was a bug that kept the game going, but removed all controls but the camera. Couldn't press ESC, couldn't issue orders, couldn't interact with anything.This prevented me from saving / loading the game. I had to force quit.2- A BIG nuisance was that builders kept taking furniture from completed custom buildings in order to build other buildings. Effectively making my town with 11 buildings to have a grand total of 6 beds.3- A functional nuisance I had is that there is no way to influence what workers will do. I kept trying to expand up a mountainside, jut to have all my workers occupied elsewhere and none dedicated to mining.--As of late, I have noticed that most of the workers will pick an item, pick another, then drop the first one, then drop the second one on the spot. They do this over and over and then forget about the issue, setting off to do something else.4- As of the latest couple of patches, farmers will tile about half the farmland area I set, then ignore it and do something completely different and not farming-related.The game becomes generally unstable when the goblin invasions become ""upgraded"".The game is simple and a bit cathartic, but I can't in good conscience recommend it at this point. A lot of bugs need to be solved, and with the current early access trend, I'm on the fence about this game being abandoned before it's finished.			"

								Hey guys! This is my review of the game as a newbie to it. This Is a honest and non bias review. Ok. So. When first starting out you may be like what the hell but as you start to figure out what there is to do and the system it gets amazingly good! At first I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth $20 (steam summer sale) but within 30 minutes of playing I loved the game. It's fresh, intuitive, creative, and seems to be VERY OPTIMIZED for all of you who don't have the $ for high end pc's. I truly believe this game is worth the money and is definite worth a shot! Especially if your into games that involve build your own community, exploring, surviving, and taking care of your little towns people! The only downside I found to this game was that there was really no clear instructions on how to start or even controls, the controls feel kinda weird but as you progress you start to like them since they make building amazingly easier. Also that the game has a full base building system and resource system, caves digging ext. I am very picky when it comes to these types of games but this one was just to good to let go. Definitely recommend it! Worth your time for sure!!!			"

								This game is hella cute and could totally be fun if it weren't for the game breaking bugs and lag issues. I bought it with high hopes, which is my fault since it is still early access after all, and was vastly dissappointed. In its current state, I would not recommend it until bugs and lag issues are fixed, especially for the cost of the game. Currently, I refunded my money so I could play other games I'm interested in, but I can see this game being something really awesome in the future. At a later date, when things seem to be fixed, I would consider purchasing the game again.			"

In its current state for its price, your looking at maybe a weekend or a couple sessions worth of game time. Updates are a bit slow but are pretty steady in frequency. Been playing stonehearth on and off since alpha 5 and the game does have quite a bit of potential (devs are also active on their forums which is a plus)If you do choose to pick it up just remember the early access tag means early access. In its current state you be able to play around with the basics but will likely run into bugs/glitches your village grows. Also, its a good idea to save before you start a new building that way you can reload your save should you run into any bugs/issues.			"

								This game is quite the mixture, when I play it, I always have a calm feeling and a urge to keep playing...However bugs are still a big obsticle in my imagination, but however you can experience how the game could evolve as well as getting to the good stuff now or never...Yes, Stonehearth is a long road away from completion, but right now it still feels like a urban medival type game you can make, or destroy whenever you want.Trust me, it's good!

								Stonehearth will likely become a great game once it's finishd; however, it is hard to recommend it in its current state. Its utter lack of features leads to boring gameplay, which makes its price of  $25  completely unjustifiable. This game has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it is hard to recommend at this time.			"

								The game isn't very deep, and a lot of the time your work orders get ignored.  A least half of the buildings I told them to construct are still unfinished despite having well over enough resources available.  You can't edit a building once it's told to be constructed, unless you want to remove it entirely, and even that task gets ignored by workers.I would only recommend this game after the developer fixes a lot of the core issues with building.

								I've waited years to play this since it's announcement solely because I didn't want to be playing a game that isn't fully developed. I was immediately captivated by it's concept because I love voxel-sandbox style gameplay but 4 years later...Fact of the matter is, at this point, anybody playing this game is technically paying the developers to test their game for them. What a way to save money, Every player pays you $25 to do the majority of your QA. Villagers randomly stop performing their tasks, the game progressively gets laggier, large majority of tasks don't have keyboard shortcuts (namely combat), you have to jump through hoops to drink a damn potion, etc.Normally that wouldn't be a problem. But 4 years...? Don't buy games in any testing phase kids.It also means you're risking your money because there is always that chance the game doesn't release.P.S. Shame on you guys for putting Marvel on the chopping block. I can't respect that decision. No matter how you cut it.			"

								Awesome game.Bought this game during the Steam Holliday Sales, and the 2 games I've played so far where going great. Well the second went great, the first one  I lost all my hearthlings to a large walking rock :PFor a game thats in early acces it does have very few bugs, it runs smooth (on my crap pc) and looks nice (in Voxelish way).Every day that you survive it gets a little harder, you get bigger enemy's coming for your Town or more frequent raids.In the second game I started my 1 Knight 3 Footmen and 1 Archer where able to kill everything without much effort (day 24).One of the few things I do have problems with is the Custom Building Creator, mainly when a wall is blocking the building of scaffolding, wich in turns prevents the builders from building another wall. Some extra tools and hints for this would be great.9.5/10 "

								This game is great, but there are some things that would be nice to see.There should be difficulty settings, they could edit things like how long before enemies begin to attack, or how powerful the enemies are.There is no way, that i've seen, to make specific units do specific tasks.It would also be nice to be able to set patrol paths for footmen.The terrain seems very blocky which does not meet the expectations of the thumbnail.Also, how do I equip my units with other items?All of these complaints are to taken with a grain of salt, I know that it is difficult to make games, and I know that Early Acess does not improve that. In addition I know that as an early acess game, it is not done. This is just a list of things to consider.All notes to the developer aside, this game comes highly recommended and has been one of the only games I've continued playing for long periods of time lately.

								Purchased Stoneheart about half a year ago when it was still in an earlier phase of developement.Team Radiant is doing good work, the updates are coming steady and the Forums got an active community.The game itself is... from my POV a mix out of minecraft and dungeon kepper.Where you pile up the blocks in minecraft yourself, here you assign a silly crowd of beings to a schedule to terraform the world in a way you want it to be.Design your own Buildings from the very scratch. Or dig. DIG! and build the dwarven settlement you always imagined.Personally, only played in Peaceful mode so far. Reminds of Settlers in the Free Settlement Mode.Hopefully, as its displayed on Stonehearths website, there is a multiplayer support to come. PS: This game is very RAM intensive, and even made a 16gb RAM machine crash once, from lacking memory.			"

								Game is good. Dont get me wrong its like a way easier dwarf fortress and Gnomoria thing. But heres the trouble, Its been in early access for quite some time and it still has an absolutely massive memory leak issue. After a while of game play usually around 30 mins to an hour, it starts to feel like you are clicking through mud. You'll click something and it wont happen for ten seconds or so. They really need to fix the leak, Gnomoria has this going on too but after much longer in game. I dont know what it is about this style of engine but it lends itself far too easily to this leak issue. If its a known issue which all of the forum posts about it makes it apparent that it is, then it should have either been addressed or fixed long ago. Im wondering if they even plan to. In case you care or wonder what my specs are here:Visheara 8 core 4.2Nvidia GTX 970Windows 7900 watt HE power supplyCrosshair IV Formula Mobo16 gb Ram gamer stock I dont remember name.  and thats probably all ya need.

								Thumbs up for the game. Style is great, idea is great and gameplay is good. Bug squishing is pretty good (with interim updates for bug fixes between major updates)Progress?Their own progress graph and trello board claims that most of the single player stuff is about 70 - 90% complete? I hope that isn't the case.Having owned this since  the second day of the Kickstarter back in early 2013 I'm pretty underwhelmed at the content in the game. The Legos style building is nice, much better than it was a few Alphas ago, but the gameplay itself is still very under developed.Very few professions, not much threat, not much in the way of resource or tools to manage them.Even on hard level this game shows you everything in a few hours.As of Alpha 18, (September 2016) playing all this game has to offer currently, and seeing all there is to see -  will take you half a day at most. Taking the two ""races"" and exploring the 2 available biomes is a very similar experience after the opening 20 minutes of play, that might turn half a days entertainment into a day? Ok I was hoping for a well realised Dwarf Fortress with a decent voxel art set and a good UI. Not the full depth of DF of course, but at least on a par with what one man teams did with games like Gnomoria and Towns. At least that much depth given the backing and the much larger team involved.Sadly this isn't the way Stonehearth is panning out.It's more of a kids game. Very simplified. The complexity comes with designing your own buildings, and that is a great feature, but serves no gameplay purpose at all. It's like""Here's an abstract building game like DF, Prison Architect, Clockwork Empires Gnomoria, Towns etc.And here's a architectural Lego gameLet's put them together and errm? Well you can build big buildings on the map - and then imagine that their is a reason to do so - because in reality there is none.""Then you are left with a virtual lego set. Which is nice and all, somewhere to express your imagination.But big buildings that have no purpose other than to exist? That's not really a game -  and I'd rather do that with a real lego set than in here.			"

								Sadly I dont think the makers can get this game right, the mechanics work for some thing and not for others, this game needs one awesome computer to run it aswell for high population villages, I find once I go over 12 people the game stuggles to play smoothly (Quadcore, 32G RAM@2400, Geforce gtx 970 4gb ect.) when I did get luck a few times (no bugs) I found all my hard work would always be lost at some point from a massive glitch, which has totaly killed the game for me personaly.My advice to the makers would be ""Try alot harder"" My advice to anyone wanting to buy this game, dont, buy some gaming making software, make your own game and sell it before it is finshed, you might get luck like the dayZ boys and rake in millions for an Alpha release of your game, minimum work, maximum money.

								How many other early access games do you know that update it AT LEAST once a week, ESPECIALLY with a studio of this size.None of you 13 year olds know what Alpha means, the closest thing you can relate to is POSSIBLY the BETA of Minecraft, which was NOT ALPHA. So stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about features and bugs, you already knew what you were buying before you bought it, an UNFINISHED GAME! This will NOT be another Starbound, so learn to be ♥♥♥♥ing patient while the TWO DEVELOPERS WORK ON THE GAME! THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF THEM, THIS IS NOT A TRIPLE A TITLE LIKE THE RECYCLED CoD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T YOU STEAL YOUR MOTHER'S CREDIT CARD TO BUY EVER YEAR WITH YOUR SAVED GBP!/s.Great game, has a great future. It has hands on management aspects like Prison Architect, with survival aspects like that of Terraria and Minecraft. Can't wait for multiplayer to be added.			"

								I really really like this game and look forward to see where the development will lead it. Nice voxelbased world to build and survive in. I bought the game somewhere around Juni-Juli 2015 I think and played for a while and recently played some more and wow. They had really improved the game a lot. Much more stable, so far after these months I haven't had a single crash or save that had to be abandoned. Not only have the stability improved but some more content has been added and you can really see the long gameplay to take shape. There is still much more to be done but so far the developers have proved to me that they are working hard and they well deserved the money I droped for this game. There is also an active modding community which is always a big plus in my book.			"

								Very Addictive game!!Basically Minecraft meets SimsI am very addicted to this game and feel like it will be great once it is finished. However, only 13 hours into the game with only 19 villagers and my game suffers HUGE lag spikes and FPS drops especially at night. I run a decent PC core i5 with 8GB of RAM but the SIM lag drops to almost unplayable levels. I am very glad i purchased this game simply to support the developers and look forward to when it is finished.Ideas for developers:- Promoting Shepards to war animal trainers (wolves, bears, lions that turn on you if not fed)- Promoting basic foot soldiers soldiers to generals and bowman- Refrigerators or ice boxes to keep food from spoiling so fast- Tougher enemy progressions			"

								A couple notes on playing the game; Have at least 1-2 Farmers. Once you make one of them a cook, they help harvest, but you still need them to plow the fields. Workers are VERY much so necessary. Although the carpenter, potter, mason and other occupations do help build/haul, you're going to want to keep the people with low-ranks down on the worker size (1, 1 and 2 for the body/mind/spirit; Keep them a worker) Fighters and such need to be the most populace unit category (Archers, Knights and Footmen); At least have one of each with an herbalist. (For the three, high Body and Mind. Mostly so they don't run like cowards) Herbalist and Cleric; Have one of each. One heals while the villagers sleep/get into beds, one heals just by walking around/in combat. (High spirit for these guys is necessary) All ""Worker-class"" occupations need mind and spirit. All three are much so needed for the farmers than anything. ALWAYS. ALWAYS remember there's a pause button that lets you keep playing. Helps you plan things. Town watch; Love it, use it, learn it, remember to turn it off after everyone is done fighting. Always go after goblin camps/""stray monsters"" after the next invasion summon (Ents/Golems/Etc), that way your villagers aren't defenseless.			"

								I have played stonehearth every now and again for a long time.If you asked me when I first got the game I would have said no, but the game has come a long way!This is in the core exactly what you'd want from a settlement city builder.You choose how you want to play, do you want to be creative? or create a strong military and fight monsters?The gameplay is great, and the building tools have improved a lot! There are still ocacional bugs and script errors, but it is way better than it used to be. Though I still hope for more optimization in the future. My computer is a decent pc, but since I have had a lot of problems with it because of age I'm not sure if this is true for other people. But around 20 villagers I start to get a fair bit of lag. I am sure a better computer would allow atleast 30 or 35. But don't go hoping for a massive village of 100 people with tons of activity.This is a slow paced relaxing game, that can be either challanging or creative, depending on how you play.			"

								ALPHA REVIEWJust don't get this.  There's potential for days, but the UI and AI are both infuriatingly bad, which is made worse by the design decisions made for the game.  Wait until release so they can fix it up.  Right now, it's exactly what you should expect from an alpha build, and nothing you should expect from Early Access.  Wait a while, and this will probably be an excellent game.  The music - all nine minutes of it - is really good.  The art is charming.  The game is terrible.I backed this on Kickstarter and have been playing it off and on for months, hoping with each new alpha release that it will become enjoyable.  It never does.			"

								I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. It's in Alpha right now, and it's fantastic. If it continues like this, the finished product will be a gem among god-like resource management games.Pros:1. Citizens (Hearthlings) that actually ""think"" for themselves. Feed themselves, clothe themselves, the whole shebang. Just assign them to a job and watch them go. They even run away from monsters, which I really appreciate. Unless you manage to strand them on top of a mountain, they're going to be fine.2. A really nice crafting system. Easy to manage, as precise as you want it to be. Personally, I like to set things up so my cook always has food on the table, but I let my blacksmith run wild between mining trips. Again, the Hearthlings do everything on their own.3. Building Construction. What I really like about this is the scaffolding the hearthlings construct around the building, consuming wood but giving it back after the building is complete. It's a really nice touch, in my opinion. The buildings are easy to design and look great when they're done. I would like a little tweak to one thing, but I'll talk about that later.4. Challenging Enemies. Basically, if you get into some deep trouble, all of your hearthlings are dead. I sacrificed one of my first footmen to a Varanus (the smaller variety) and it proceded to slaughter the reast of the town. The things that attack you in this game are genuinely terrifying, unless you watch seeing tiny litle people who depend on you for survival die.5. Actually a sort of story line. I won't go into too much detail, but there is some interesting stuff going on in the world around you. Goblin Warlords, Ogres, Necromancers, and something called Squirrel People? (They probably won't appreciate me eating their brethren) There's a prophecy and everything. I, for one, am fascinated.Cons/suggestions:1. Performance issues and low framerates. This is probably just my computer. It's pretty out of date. Beware people like me: this game does not run at even 30 FPS on older machines. Probably an issue that will be lessened as developement continues.2. Minor glitches regarding construction/buildings. The hearthlings will occasionally stop building things that are only half complete. As far as I can tell, this is an issue that occurs when loading a saved game. It doesn't happen very often now that Alpha 18 is in place. Also, game devs, I would like a tool to move up and down the floors of buildings while constructing them. So that if I have two floors, I can make the 2nd one invisible and just look at the first. It would make placeing things on the walls a whole lot easier. Please and thank you.This game is totally worth your money.(Oh, and whatever you do, don't place that decorative scout gong too soon. Trust me)			"

								While still very much in the fledgling stages of the development, Stonehearth is still an amazing game that offers a voxel-themed sandbox/city-building experience that gives you plenty of direction with what to ""do"" next without being constricting about it.About the biggest concern I have about this game is the lack of micromanaging. If you're a fan of games like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, or even Towns (or what you had hoped Towns would become), Stonehearth may leave you wanting for a bit more control over your individials and their priorities, or just the allotment of work between citizens.I hope to see Stonehearth grow bigger and stronger, particularly with things like Seasons, expanded climates and map varieties, and some additional aesthetic content, but that's no reason to not pick up a copy and try it out for yourself. Stonehearth has got a solid foundation, a history of active and attentive devs, and a bright future ahead.			"

I backed this game in 2012 with the vision and beautiful screenshots only to be fooled into a tiny map with extremely limited things to do and buildings to build. In the most recent updates they have added pretty useless features that weren't even wanted they just thought would be cool to waste months on and throw in instead of adding actual content or work on that MP that one day will appear.Hopefully one day they will realize the people who put them where they are are no longer behind them supporting them.Don't let this steam hours confuse you.

								Nothing more frustrating than playin on hard... And you end up losing your fighters while defending the town because  several other fighters went to go sleep while the town is under attack. So your guys all die because they went to bed? THEN your game auto saves overwriting the previous auto save... WHILE in combat. Once all your fighters die, there is no coming back from it. They die, your town dies. Nothing can be done to fix it except revert to a previous save. Didn't realize that the autosaves overwrite the previous save... Or else I would have saved more often. But you know, I figured that was the point of regular saves so that you could revert back if needed.This isn't the first time this has happened. This, in my opinion, is a huge flaw in the game where instead of defending the town they would rather go fulfill their needs by eating or sleeping.I've lost everything one other time because my carpenter wouldn't build things... Unfortunately, when the game bugs out it can kill your entire playthrough if you aren't prepared.			"

I have to pull up a seperate tab that blocks the craft button!There's not a lot of job options (yet)The villagers tend to forget what they're doing if they go too far away from homeThe Ui is kinda sticky with no way to quickly check on villagersSuggestions:Race options, a village with just humans can be boring. why not throw in some other races with new benefits?have two story housesa tutorial would be nicehave morale specific things, I don't really know how to raise morale other than with food and bedsmake mining more precise. when selecting what to mine it looks like i'm mining the ground when I should be mining the wall!more enemies!Overall, I'm enjoying this game.

The Hearthlings sometimes get stuck on an object when picking something up next to another object, itd be awesome if stairs were added or ladders could be put inside buildings, and more attacks by enemies would make it a lot more fun. More decorations and building objects would be nice as well as finishing the job list. Overall, the game is very good and im hoping it gets even better with updates. 10/10 would play lol. Multiplayer would be pretty cool too, just saying :D			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game looking for a good city/town builder type of game with crafting and rpg elements. So far I've really enjoyed it. I think it really has the potential to become a very good game as development continues.The game looks great, has good replayability, and looks to be frequently updated. I love that there's a building designer! The crafting is good so far as well. The downside is that it's early access which means there are a lot of bugs, some of which require you to start a new game due to their severity (but the game is so replayable that it's not that big of a deal right now) and there are features that are not finished or not implemented yet. The UI is also a little clunky and there are some quality of life features I would desperately like to see rolled out soon. I would definitely recommend if you don't mind early access and bugs!  "

								This game reminds me of Dwarf Fortress. Its great to have everything animated and all but the content included is very low and it starts to get laggy at around 15 hearthlings.3 hours in and I'm wondering why I don't go play Dwarf Fortress instead.I can see this game becoming good but it's going to need a lot more content and optimization before its worth it. Pros:Animated Dwarf FortressYou can click objects in-gameCrafting system is easily accessibleCons:Lack of ContentWorkshops are hard to find (you have to find the item when its crafted, to place)Laggy at around 15 HearthlingsWhen this is updated, I'll consider changing my review but right now its not worth the price they're charging. I understand 'early access' means you're paying to test but honestly this game is more of a concept/remakea than an actual game or early access.			"

								Currently running the Alpha 18 build, game is heavily buggy when it comes to building, to the point that within the first major building I start, game bugs and can no longer build in the current game, even save/load wont fix it, must start a new game, and wait for it to happen again there. Very frustrating to have happen in a game that revolves around free form building. Another problem with building is hearthlings building up higher than the scaffolding is leaving them stuck up on some high peak waiting for someone to either build up to them or for you to make them a ladder. If you dont baby them, you could end up with multiple, or even all of your hearthlings stuck up there forcing you to use console commands to make ladders to save them.Currently the enemy difficulty peaks out very early, once you get 2 clerics along with 1-2 knights and 1+ archer combat just fades out. In other words, a leveled up blacksmith means you win. Archers never want to defend high ground and will always run to the enemys level and fight them there. No establishing patrol routes, only defend locations.Another bug I have found that seems to be constant lately is the starving of my hearthlings, they will have 0 tasks other than harvest food and will just stand around and starve to death instead of gathering the food.Game has amazing potential, the mod community is growing and has some good ideas and the devs seem to care and are constantly trying to improve things. But with the current build problems and building be a core part of the game, I wouldnt recommend paying for this game until its more consistently functional.			"

								I played this a bunch last night, and plan to play a bunch more in the future. This is a fantastic little game. I can tell it still needs some work, but so far, pretty fun. Things I wish were better:-The camera is a little awkward, and I wish I could get on a lower perspective to the ground sometimes, since the animations and art are so damned cute, it would be nice to be a little closer to the inhabitants.----It would almost be worth it to have a 'walk around' mode, where you can 'be' one of the characters-When you have a blueprint for a building, and don't build exactly the required item for your specified blueprint there is no way of knowing, and the workers will not override one door for another, and if you decided to manually place items into the build, the ghosty blueprint remains-Items like fences don't 'auto complete' the way I wish they would, and leave gaps-I wish you could follow around a specific character, and their overlay wouldn't cover up the entire screen.Anyway...that is what I noticed so far....I will be building adorable little towns soon...and I am sure I will find little irksome quirks. But, that won't stop me from playing.UPDATE: just picked it up again...still really fun. It seems like some kinks were ironed out. I really like this game.			"

								I once did a review of this game around when it came out explaining how the game was a little glitchy. But since then it has been updated a bunch. Im normally not a town builder type game fan but I really love this game. You have to use your people wisely and give them correct jobs. Such as a footman who protects the others if the footman's spirit is not very high they will run away or get scared in battle, if their body is high they are most likely to not take much damage. Once my footman took down 3 wolves without getting hurt because she had high body. Also there are specific tools, if you gave everyone a job and you want to mine some ore you wont be able to because only workers (people with no jobs) can use pickaxes. Although I agree that the price for this game isnt cheap I still highly recommend buying it.			"

								$25 will buy you five large cups of coffee. I would rather have the coffee than this game. +An interesting game that has potential if the devs come through on their promises+Lots of possibilities for creative projects+The best minecraft clone out there that isn't trying to be minecraft+A nice aesthetic-Characters move super slow even during fast forward speeds-You start with a map of the generated world, then must choose a terribly small section of it to be your entire game world.-The building system is difficult and unforgiving. Small mistakes means you have to scrap the entire building plan (alpha issue)-Very unstable with frequent bugs ending entire game worlds (alpha issue)-Currently a very real lack of content outside of the buggy building system (alpha issue)-The game has been in dev for five years but they are still in the alpha stages and they have announced that they intend to start making other games. They've really done a good job keeping frequent contact with the community but I'm worried they will eventually abandon this project all together if the seams cant hold it together.			"

								Too much ""good enough"" programming in this product. The building editor stops working when Hearthlings try to build user defined buildings.  Well if the user sticks to premade buildings or just uses walls instead of slabs they will be fine.  Good enough for early access.  Hearthlings can't mind direclty overhead on a ladder.  Well if the user sticks to the blocks in front of them they will be fine.  Good enough for early access.  The user can't select on the verticle plane.  Well they can select the horizontal plane.  Good enough for early access.....etc.I get that the devs want to put in more features, but the current features should work or at least not introduce frustration to the user.  Right now I'm quitting on playing this game for the moment.  Its just not good enough to spend my time on or, really, the asking price they want.Stonehearth is getting a provisional down vote.   Fix the above in the next update and the game would be worth playing and buying.			"

								I like the idea of this game. I like the visuals and ultimately I believe that the final product is gonna be very enjoyable.However, in the current state I can not recommend this game to anyone. We all know that ""early access"" means bugs, and that's ok, as long as you can still play the game. Sadly, this is not the case for the Stonehearth today.I've spent ~1,5 hrs and was not able to design a single house (which is sort of the purpose of the game, right?): the game crashes, or freezes, or the UI gets broken, or something else happens. Ultimately, after more than a dozen attempts to restart the game and get to actually play it, I gave up. I do hope that the devs will fix this and I'll be able to change the review. But right now, my advice - don't loose your time on this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Well i have played this game for aprox 10 hours and i can say that at its current stage its not worth to buy it. The reason is that the game doesnt have enough features implemented to it and a lot of bugs.The good:+nice graphics+the gameplay is verry fun+the combat is ok (the enemary archers kitting you is verry annoying since you might end up chasing them to the enemy base)+the crafting&gathering system are verry well doneThe bad:-a lot of bugs-horrible UI for building stuff like walls and bugs out often. Editing a building is verry difficult since it doesnt always take your commands and its unintuitive.-at the moment building any kind of buildings its pointless. Your people can sleep verry well outside even on a bed for example. So its mostly decorative and to increase your value as a town. I really dont see the reason to build anything because they dont provide any bonuses and they are far to little buildings at the moment.-Mining or digging is verry poorly implemenred as well. For example if you want to mine in a mountain for example and then decide to go up you need to manually build ladders for them to go up or down for that matter otherwise the order to mine will not be done. Why cant this be done automatically by them? Digging also requires ladders to be built manually for every layer you go down because otherwise they cant haul what they have mined and they cant get out to eat and they will soon die. So you need to be carefull.-Poor ui and inuititive. For example it took me a few hours to finally learn how to edit a building and when, i had to google on how you can build roads or walls etc. These are just a few examples but its an overall feeling.-Verry ppor AI pathing. For example a lot of time i see my workers doing a hauling of an ore just to put it down and go pick up another ore imediatlly next to it and haul that one instead. Also they tend to take the longest paths when building anything or just leave their work completly do something else and then come back.-Another bad thing is that devs are pushing updates at a verry low rate. This game is from june 2015. so for over one and a half year the game is still in alpha. Also the last update was October 2016. That means that the game development will go verry slowly and you wont be able to enjoy it at its full features.My recommendation is not to buy this gama at its current state since it doesnt offer a lot of depth to it. Its fun to watch your people them build stuff, gather and fight but it seems shallow as you get depper into the game and the fact that a lot all of the buildings are useless and just cosmetic doesnt provide any depth to mid to late game.I would wait untill this game goes into beta before buying it unless you really want to try it or support the devs.			"

								Stonehearth is a voxel based RimWorld game. Poorly optimized, pathing needs a lot of help, and guards cant use ladders. Over all I like the style of the game, BUT in its current state I would hold off on getting this. If you want something more optimized I would say take a look at RimWorld. When I say its not optimized I mean when you get to around 12-14 villagers the game starts lagging bad. (dont start saying I have a bad rig, 16gig ram 1Tera SSD 7950ATI card and 8 core 4.2ghz cpu) Most of the class's arnt in the game and about 25% of the skills for the class's that are there dont work. The game itself is easy going but when your village gets up in size everything slows down. I cant even get them to make a wall. Ive been waiting over 5 hrs for them to hang 2 doors. Give this game some time to flush out everything. Should be good if they fix the bugs(there is a lot of them atm) and do some real optimization.			"

								I've been looking at this game for a while now, something told me to stay away from it, but I gave in and grabbed it on a city builder binge. I'm sad that I did.I like the defence/survival element of Stonehearth, where camps of enemies will spawn around the map and periodically attack your settlement, you can either attack them early and risk your guards, or just wait out the attacks for the XP. There are also loot boxes and such around the map to be discovered, usually guarded by some mini-boss creatures. That part they did right, it's fun.For a game that's been in development for such a long time, I really wonder why there are so many bugs. I understand it's a early access game, but that's not really an excuse for the really terrible building mechanics. It's a city-builder game, if i was developing a city builder, the first thing i'd get sorted would be the building mechanics, at the moment they're extremely frustrating and unintuitive. You have no ability to change things once you've placed them, so if you want to extend your wall out by 2 squares, you need to undo everything you've done to get back there. This is really frustrating when building and planning complex structures.I'd like to see defensive walls (properly) added, or at least the ability to create stand-alone walls outside of the custom structure editor, for a simple project like a perimeter wall the player shouldn't be forced to stuff around too much. I noticed also that it's very clumbsy at sticking to things. i tried to incorporate a pre-existing structure in my town into the wall, instead the custom structure editor decided that the sections of wall touching that building now belonged to it, and not my wall, so the only way to get rid of those walls was to destroy that building. Annoying to say the least.Along with numerous bugs that caused my workers to get stuck on window ledges, placing objects is a real pain. I've been forced to build a cobblestone fence piece-by-piece because if i try to place more than one at a time, the workers freak out and wont complete the task.At this point I can't reccommend the game, I feel like I was ripped off, to be honest.

								I would recommend this game but, I think it's better that you wait till further upgrades or the final version is released.. there are many bugs and also issues which will make your experience in Stonehearth unpleasant, such as combat issue, unable to support over 20 citizens and many more..

Early Access Review
								Would I recommend this game? Absolutley. However, not at this time will i suggest you purchase it. There has been many moments in game where I have reached at least 20 people only to have the game glitch. Not in such a way that it can be overlooked. Buildings glitch. Making them inhabitable or unusable. There's no erase option (At least not in the ""stable"" version) so have fun with that. Assigning Footmen to different war parties makes them not able to fight. They stand there. Lifeless and take hits refusing to dull them out or even respond. Footmen run in one direction after setting your banner and stay there. No matter if you delete it or set another somewhere else. Sometimes when you're creating your own customly designed building, an error pops up and builders stop constructing. Usually, at this point, I wouldn't say it matters much but this game does seem like it is based around building. As I see it, the devs are cool. They've been updating the ""Betas"" branch somewhat often and the art style is cool as well. Although, I can't recommend it at this time. If you are patient and want to take a leap of faith, buy it. If you are skeptical and don't want to be dissapointed? Wait. Watch the updates. Because I do believe this game will be great in time.			"

								Without a doubt, this game has huge potential. The gameplay is fun, the combat & building system is great, & it's just a really relaxing game to play. Only problem is it's unfinished and broken. Once you max out all levels of 20 citizens, there's nothing else to do. There's no goal after that other than making useless buildings, & stacking up mistakes & bugs that cannot be fixed. If you're interested in this game, keep it on your wishlist until it's released from Alpha. You'll get through all the objectives in a day or so & then you'll just be waiting on updates to arrive. This game, at its current state, is not worth buying unless you are willing to fund its growth.			"

								ok so first of in it's defense, it's early acces / alpha.I played Alpha 16 (559) , in essence it's already a neat little game.Though the game is at this point still very glitchy and clunky to control.It does have a nice charm, loads of potential, but at this point i cannot yet recommend this game to just everyone. Building homes is a bit bugged and you can easily glitch a building (and it never finishes), also combat is not very balanced yet, and a bit boring , and again , a bit fiddly to control.If you don't mind playing aplha's go ahead otherwise, just wait a while.

Early Access Review
Please note: This is an early access review.I tried Stonehearth on a whim after I had sworn to myself that I would never play an Early Access game ever again. This game has simply reaffirmed my convictions in this matter.This is not to say that this game is terrible - it's not. It has potential, and there are a lot of good things about it. It has cute animations, enchanting music, and a nice crisp graphic style (although I must admit that the minecraft-esque aesthetic is getting a little old at this point).As for how it plays, it is a minecraft derivative (not necessarily a bad thing), though instead of building and defending your settlement by yourself, you must order AI-controlled peons to do it for you. This is an excellent premise on paper, and sometimes it works beautifully. Watching your peons work, collect, harvest, eat, sleep and fulfill their tasks is sometimes very rewarding.However, in many other ways, this game leaves something to be desired. The UI is confusing, tutorials are nonexistent, the camera controls are clunky, the building tools are even clunkier, and the minion AI is so glitchy that they will fail to build even the simplest of structures. Even the basic building designs that are shipped with the game will be left incomplete by your peons once they start building despite having all of the materials available. This forces you to scrap those structures in an attempt to build them again, and of course, there's no guarantee that your peons will actually finish them the second time they try.Other crippling bugs include peons who will simply freeze in place and refuse to move. Even when they become exhausted and start to starve, they won't move even to help themselves. The only way I've found to fix this is to reassign them to another job, but in doing so, they lose all of their accumulated levels. Not fun!Issues like these are a bit concerning, considering that the game is over halfway through Early Access by now. But even with the bugs aside, Stonehearth seems to be sorely lacking in content. The plain, empty expanses of the landscape really aren't very stimulating and there's very little to do out there. Once you get your settlement up and running (and it's not hard to do, despite the fact that most of your houses will be missing the odd door, wall or roof), you will simply repel invader attacks over and over again, collect whatever loot they drop, and continue to farm your crops.This might actually be fun if the inventory management was enjoyable, but it's not. You can't really manipulate the objects in-game directly, so you have to rely on your peons to manage the plethora of items that you will craft and collect. Usually this means that they will throw them into an unsorted jumble within your stockpile; other times, they will squirrel it away in crates and boxes. If you have more than one, it will be anyone's guess as to which one they've put it in. If one of your items is missing and you can't seem to track it down, good luck finding it!Stonehearth gave me a few moments of fun within the hours that I played it, but mostly I just felt bored and frustrated. It's a shame, because I really like the idea behind it. I may revisit it once it leaves Early Access, but if what I've seen is indicative of the final product, I could probably take it or leave it.The good news is that the developers are providing regular updates and are obviously very dedicated to this project. It should improve over time. I really hope it does.			"

								The game has such promise, but is loaded with bugs currently so I cannot recommend it to anyone just yet. Updates also take longer then they should and the release is still years off at this rate. The game is very feature incomplete and you have to branch past Alpha into dev version to get any usable gameplay right now. Check back in 1-2 years imo.			"

								Kind of a mix between Minecraft and Banished. Not much to it as it's still in early access, but with a few updates this could be a great game. Hopefully they're looking to add multiplayer. Because there is a command in there which is titled 'loot (steal loot from another PLAYER)'. And seeing how this is singleplayer currently, I'd assume that they will be adding multiplayer in the future. Would recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								this game has alot of potential. and if you are a banish fan. this game has the ability to blow it out of the water. however there are way to many bugs at this point. so much so after about 4 hours of game play things just stop working for you. workers tend to all of a sudden pick up resources than drop them all, pick them up and drop them all. when you want to promote a worker to a  specific class this ability stops as well after a few hours. if you buy the game you will enjoy it for about 3-4 hours. and than you just have to restart. and restart. and restart. even if you want to help out with the bugs the developers need to get the game going to a point where you can atleast advance in the game without bugs stopping you. to many bugs, game crashes once and awile. i would wait 3-6 months at the time of this post. and if the developers finish the game accordingly and dont slack off. the game will have very good potential for unlimited hours of building and fun. its a thumbs down at this point. dont release the game this early with this many issues. i get the whole alpha thing. but it should be the developers, developing the game. not the consumers who pay to develope it for them.

Early Access Review
								While I love these type of sandbox/management games, this one seems to fall a little short. Originally, I bought this around the time I was playing Towns, and liked the idea that it was graphically superior to Towns and had a few more features in planning. Many features were still in development, but I don't mind supporting independent developers. Skip forward some months, and the problems inherent to this kind of development become self-evident. Even easy-concept games can be a nightmare when you start adding in features. While the community is very strong and supportive, the developers communicate frequently and consistently, the game itself is fundamentally flawed. Gameplay is only tenable for about 12 hours, from there it's the same thing in a new setting. At the moment, many core features of the game are either uninteresting or broken. The engine itself is unsustainable or poorly written. AI still breaks itself after enough time has passed (or becomes so inept at tasks they become useless). Town areas are by default limited to 20 citizens, because the engine really can't handle much more than that. The map bogs down after about 10 in-game days with very little activity (2 gb ram and 16% of a decent quad-core processor on PAUSE). If you're looking to purchase this game, wait. See if the developers iron out the bugs, but even then know that it's likely not going to be a game you're going to come back to or play for too long. It'll be something casual when you've got nothing else to do - download, install, play, get bored and repeat in a couple months. Pros:- Good looking UI and general landscape - blocky but tastefully done.- Good conceptual design of core elements.- Good balance between difficulty vs. reward - easy enough for new players, but can't immediately make everything.- Consistent small updates, if a little slow for what the updates usually are.- Consistent and constructive communication from developers and community.- Implemented crash reporting that actually means something will get fixed eventually. Cons:- AI bogs very quickly.- Processor hungry for package size. - Gameplay can get repetitive (not talking about unimplemented features).- Spend much time after initial rush just watching your citizens do things.- Buggy as hell, but to be expected in Alpha.- Gameplay is geared to non-expansion - there's no reason to really expand much beyond starting area. Just pick a good one and wall yourself in. - Gameplay itself is very short. When you've done it once, it's the same thing on a different map. tl;dr:Wait a while if you're following this game. It's buggy and VERY casual. Devs are slow, but do communicate.			"

								I was one of the original kickstarter backers. This summer will be the end of the third year (going on the 4th) since this game has been in development. To say the progress has been slow would be an understatement. Triple A games take less time to develop than this has and it is still far away from release. Very little content because so much time has been spent constantly fixing things that should have been fixed in the early alpha's.A lot of the bugs have been with this game since Alpha 1. Especially with AI. They have fixed AI building at least 3 or 4 times and it still doesn't work right. They have to keep going back and rewriting code over and over again.They are nice developers but watching this game being developed has been amatuer hour. I was really into this game the first year watching all the dev streams and such but then it became obvious that it was going to be one of the longest development cycles in the history of gaming and I lost interest. Here it is - March of 2016 and they just had another stage of Alpha dedicated totally to bug fixing and fixing AI - Again! This game is very charming and the music is top notch. It has such great potential but many of us have been waiting a very long time to see it realized and we are still waiting....EDIT April 2017 - I just checked the game out again after almost a year. Some really good improvements have been made. They added a lot more devs to the studio and things seem to be moving along a lot more quickly but considering we are going into the 5th year that is not saying much. The personality system for the Heathlings is quite good but limited. It is a great start though and I am liking the direction they are moving in. Game is also pretty stable - it was running smooth although I did experience quite a few bugs. The new combat and classes are good - a lot better than the combat I was playing last year. The Herbalist seems like a total waste of a class. It doesnt do anything at this point and the only reason to have one is to make a cleric. They need a major revamp of the herbalist because from what I played it is totally useless.Overall the game seems to be coming along but it needs a LOT more content. I didnt get any stuck workers so it looks like they FINALLY got that problem resolved. Overall I am a lot more optimistic about what I played today then what I was playing last year but I still can't recommend it due to the low amount of content. Still no flowing water, weather, etc.			"

								Ok, Picture Gnomoria, but with better graphics, better UI, and Papa Johns Delivers.Now you have your delicious or disgusting pizza, depending on where you live, and you can start your crafting and managing and building journey to keep your citizens alive. The crafting system is very simple and easy to learn, while still being of a good size for this early on in development. The raids on your town can be very simple and easy to fend off, to brutal cavity defiling, child sodomising, soul endingly devastating. So always make sure you have a Fighter or two ASAP. Focus on getting them better equipment over getting your next crafting milestone. Your people can live on without a Trapper for a few more weeks. They won't be living if a horde of goblins kill your Defenders and then your people because all they have for equipment is still padded armor and wooden sword and shield.This game is very much still in progress but I like the progress thats being done. Most games in early access that say they are still in Alpha (Which this one tells you it is right at the start) have half the content, and 1,000 times more bugs and crashes. All this has that I've noticed so far is a couple of UI and AI bugs and logic loops, and a small tendancy for data leak. So restart your game every hour and a half or so and you will be fine. Also you have to turn on Auto Save, which was weird. Sometimes your Citizens will go to move an object you designated to be moved elsewhere and someone else will get to it sooner and that previous citizen will still go to where that object is. Though once they find out the object is there they move on to the next objective which is nice. Sometimes in Gnomoria (A finished and released game) Gnomes will do the exact same thing but instead get stuck in an AI Loop and you pretty much have to wait for them to get hungry or tired to reset themselves. So far the majority of negative reviews about this game are about buildings not being able to get fully done. In my opinion since I have a fully functioning town with 12 buildings, 5 of which are custom design, roads, pastures, lengthy defensive works and what not, all of them 100% completed. That the complainers are idiots, and that they try to do multiple projects at one time, run out of materials and then complain that the game is broken. Much like that meme where a guy rides a bike then puts a stick in his own tire and complains about someone else doing it. Your citizens will do multiple projects at a time, and the game will tell you that you have enough resources for a building if the resources are still in your stockpile. That means that if you pause the game, and try to construct 3 houses, each time it will tell you that you have enough resources in your stockpile. If you are that tired and don't notice that logic issue, please go to sleep. Or stop being a moron.A couple of suggestions that would be nice in my opinion.-Make it to where when digging a mine tunnel, they auto construct ladders, since people will sometimes forget and well there goes 3-6 of your citizens. -Possibly already in development but if there could be some sort of food preservation thing. Like an Ice box or something that will keep my fruits and veggies fresh longer would be nice.- Lower the amount of food it takes to get a new Citizen at ALL levels. I am currently sitting at 15 Citizens and producing enough food for 80. Still can't get a new Citizen. I realize this may be due to the developers wanting to give people a possible Siege supply incase they take heavy losses to Food or Food production capability from a raid, but there is an option wether or not to accept a new Citizen. Let us take the risk.-Developers. This tip more than all the others is the most important and I hope that if you read this review and take anything from it, that you take this one to the heart.

Any other game like this that involves city management with no Army management or Cities to pillage and conquer leave me bored and moving on to another game. YOU got me to play this for 4 hours so far, and once there is more content I can happily say I will gladly add 100 hours just to explore and enjoy this finely crafted game you have made.

								I just bought this game like 3 days ago and I'm already pushing 30 hours played. Highly addicting even for early access if you enjoy sandboxy games. LOTS and LOTS of room for cool and new ideas with seemingly active developers (2 patches/bug fixes between now and time of purchase) which is awesome! Very much looking forward to watching this game evolve and happy to support it. Despite there being a few annoying bugs I'd say the game is 99.9% playable with what content is added so far and I actually found trying to play around the bugs half the fun once I learned how to recreate them.

								I bought this game because I truly love the genre. Now that ive put a few hours into this game here is my two cents. the game concept is reaally cute, watching my hearthlings struggle to survive and build a town is about the most fun I think I can have with this kind of game, however, struggling with the interface to design buildings.. having my game crash, redesigning my buildings, crashing the game yet again. redesigning my buildings only to get the camera stuck beneath a tree I think.. finally giving up and just making nothing but boring square one floor buildings, was about the most ive ever cursed at a game in my life. Now im not a game designer but from the comments ive been reading these building design bugs have been lurking about since day one of EA, you would figure they would have at least made the building designer functional and mostly bug free.in all honesty I cannot recommend this game at its current price of 24.99$ you would be better off spending an extra 5$ and buying rimworld, which although is also an EA title seems to be way more playable than this and offers most of the same concepts as this game.

Good job, and keep it up.			"

								I bought this game directly from the developer's website and I played it when it was in Alpha 15.  I still don't understand why this game is fun or otherwise enjoyable.  Everything happens at a snails pace.  While it is interesting to build your own houses, ultimately it amounts to little.  Playing a game like Rimworld moves so much faster and there are consequences galore.  The story telling in this game is practically nonexistant.  The gameplay hasn't changed much and there are still the same graphical glitches that happened even in Alpha 15.  I'm pretty disappointed and so I'm moving on.  I wish the developers luck because they're going to need it.			"

								Recommended, but with a caveat...I cant say as it is right now I find the game that enjoyable. The dev team has a lot of work to do to get the game finished, but its the dev team behind the game that makes me want to like this game. They constantly release new content that addresses mine and others issues with the game, and its progressing quickly. In a few months I believe there will be enough substance to it to make it a really fun game. Get it only after taking a look at the devs homepage and deciding yourself if what they have planned still makes you want to buy it. Also note that its not a complete game as is and you will be playing a watered down version of what is to come.			"

								This is an excellent game and I can't wait to see what they add. The only bug I have seen so far is that when you design a custom house, the people don't finish building it. But as long as you use the premade buildings, then everything is fine. It would be great for them to fix this, but I can definately live with it. Also I think it would be great to add some more wildlife besides foxes and racoons? But overall, this is a great game and I definately recommend it to anyone who thinks they may be interested in it.			"

								This is a lovely game which has a lot of potential, but it is lacking on a single point, for me. It requires some micromanagement. You need to build the individual pieces of furniture that each building requires, and you need to manually set this to be done. I like games like Banished which require you to pay attention in general, but where you can make decisions through macro-management and their effects take place on the micro-level.			"

I throughly am enjoying the game and what is currenly implimented.Positives.-Very Unique builder with very minecraft, sim city, cube world, and tower defense feelings.-Customize buildings, to a degree.Negatives-Not much implimented yet.-Seems to be a memory leak, after playing for a bit of time, or if you build to much, the game sturrs and crashes. If you remember when Minecraft was in its Alpha/Beta stages, it had an issue with memory being a bit overbaring. This seems to be the case here and prevents from really getting into building a massive city. "

								If you've ever wanted to create a village/kingdom with control over crafters and defenders, farmers and the sizes of farms, locations and the ability to move those fields. This is for you.First let me start with the cons -1) This is Alpha and does not represent the end product.2) It's not finished yet and has bugs.And now the pros in my opinion -1) Ability to set where you want to start your village.2) Ability to determine who is right for the jobs available.3) Ability to change jobs of your Hearthlings (townsfolk).4) Ability to custom build any building and save the template.5) Ability to place stockpiles inside of buildings for protection against raiders.There are many game aspects that I have not listed, but I hope I have at least touched up on some important deciding factors for potential backers. I love the game and can't wait for the release.With that in mind, every Tuesday they have a post ""Desktop Tuesday"", it's a great place to see what the team has been working on, and don't forget to check their website for additional information.

Alpha 14 Update -There has been a lot of new content and improvements since my initial review.New enemies, new jobs - herbalist (that makes potions and bandages for healing and buffs), cook (self explanatory).New crafting stations which allow a more unique look and feel to your crafters including more crafting options, more armor, weapons, decorations.They still have a lot more planned and coming, they still do their Desktop Tuesday so be sure to check it out!

								Stonehearth as a game in its current state is an enjoyable playing experience. It has a mix of City Building, RPG, Crafting, and RTS elements that mix well together. The blocky art style is interesting and makes for interesting building designs. The terrain is destructable, and moldable to those with the imagination to shape it. The two main factions and later the other 2 main factions, along with the npc faction and all the enemies the games developers will be adding, offer a diverse gameplay that is enjoyable and will be even more enjoyable when they finish.Normally, I do not buy early access games because I don't feel like buying unfinished games is worth my money, particularly when there is the chance that the developer could just take my money and not complete the game. I have had an incident where i bought an early access game and the developer abandoned the project. However, that is not a justifyable reason not to buy stonehearth, The developers do regular updates and even stream their work on the game occasionally. They are fully upholding their end of the deal when it comes to early access and are model company for others in their line of work to follow.In this I must give Stonehearth my recommendation. The game is not complete, no, but I have no doubts that it will be eventually completed, and when it does it will be even more enjoyable than it is to play now.			"

								There are too much bugs in the AI which make the game unplayable. Your ""Heartlings"", or ""Lazylings"" as how I call them, go idle after a certain point in the game. Mostly when you go above 17-20 heartlings what i've noticed the past months. They stop mining, stop collecting resources and when you want to build a new building, they build it up for a part, then stand idle for many ingame hours... As a gamer you want to make progress but this game lacks a good enough AI to let you make progress. You can only build up a little, then the AI fails. Only thing you achieve here is stress and irritation, dont pay money for that.When the game has a proper AI I will probably update this review. You still want to buy this game after reading this? well, thank you, hope that money goes to the AI coder so I can finally play this game in the future since a refund is not possible anymore.			"

								Seriously I cannot say enough good things about this game.  The best early access Fort-like experience you can get in 3D.  This game and Gnomoria are the best Fort-likes on Steam.  The  dev's on Stonehearth are constantly adding new content and the recent update with a new playable Kingdom type and terrain just reminded me how much I love this game.  There are a few more playable races in the pipe if I'm not mistaken, and multiplayer! Oh I cannot wait till MP.  (It is not MP right now to be clear.) I'm an EA who ore but this is one of the ones I would recommend with no reservations. In the game you plop down a group of curated settlers in a hospitable or inhospitable landscape and have a solid town building survival experience.  Give Hearthlings jobs and watch as they level up, then you can promote them into higher tier professions.  With awesome mods like Candledark you can really add some variety to your game.  The community is great and I've got nothing but respect for these devs that regularly live stream their work on ye old Twitchbox.Edit: They added more classes!!!!I (still) love this game.			"

								Cute, funny and interesting little game, with a dedicated, wonderful developer team.It's pretty addictive to play, just make sure you save every now and then.(especially before you're about to attack the enemy AI, if you are unsure) - because you might lose interest if you even lose one citizen, i've experienced many times. Also save alot if you keep using the experimental max speed, it could crash the game eventually.Sometimes it's a big unforgiving, but this game's kind of challenge doesn't want you to quit permanently, at least.It's always fun to see the game waiting to be updating in the download tab of steam, and I'm really curious on where this game is going. I had hoped for snow here in december :'(			"

								I really like this game. Seeing the rate of content added with respect to the roadmap that the developers have made available on their website at http://stonehearth.net/roadmap/ gives me an inclination as to how much effort they are willing to put into this game, and it looks promising. The blocky and simplistic style of the game really contributes to the charming, cozy atmosphere of the game (when enemies aren't attacking of course) and gives you something that you want to protect, if that makes sense. The music itself is also charming, and fits well with such a simplistic style.However promising the game looked and looks, I believe it still requires a tonne of bug fixes, for example the soldiers going off to attack enemies without your command, and the unfinished building bug, however I am yet to check after the latest update whether that has been fixed yet. Another downside is that the normal difficulty seems way too easy as you progress further into the game. The attacking of small miscellaneous enemy camps can get quite repetitive and pesky at this point too, but I suppose there isn't really any better alternative, and it makes do for gameplay.At the time when I bought the game, I regret paying as much money as I did for it, however from another point of view involving contributing to the growth of the game I am glad that I took the gamble of it not being another abandonment in the piles of steam early access games. £18.99 is a little overpriced, even though I enjoyed it. Despite having addressed the negative side of the game, don't misunderstand me. I really enjoyed it, and await to see further development.			"

								This game has a lot of good things going for it, and I think it'll get better.  The villagers and enemies are stylized in cute manner, and the little plot dialog that exists carries the cute theme as well - but that doesn't stop some battles between the two from being deadly serious.  Combat is simple once you figure out how to develop your battle team to survive with the difficulty curve (two tanking armored characters, backed by archers, with a cleric thrown in will get you by the majority of the battles).  I can easily see more event battles being added as this game progresses but it would be nice if enemy bases  spawned more often around the map - perhaps sending their own raiding parties.However, the real bread and butter of this game is customizing your village exactly the way you want it.  This is the most complex part of game play and it takes a while to get the hang of.  Editing a blueprint is tricky and time consuming at first but I highly recommend saving one to greatly reduce time later.  If your Hearthlings stall during mid-construction, check your available recources needed, then try manually placing ladders in case they cannot reach the upper construction areas.  (I highly recommend a building blueprint that has doors and window frames, but no other furnishings or decorations which can be added later.)  What's really needed here is more terrain options like adding soil blocks for leveling surfaces and undo'ing building mistakes.  Far too often I found myself relying on back-up saves because nudging a building over 1 or 2 blocks or fixing an errant click while digging is not very forgiving at this point.This game is good so far, and it's going to get better.  Highly recommended.			"

								An another videogame with potential.Created with the style of Trove and from the ashes of Cube World, Stoneheart is a strategy version of the two games and taking inspiration from other famous videogames like Imperium Civitas, Imperium Online and the Sims series.You can take care of your settlement (if you keep up the good work you can make it into a real city), of your citizens, promote them to different jobs, making everyone of them an indispensable member of your progression and your city; however (if you choose the right mode) there is not always peace around here: train some soldiers to defend yourself from any menace (wolfes, goblins, undead, animated stones?!), kicking their butt or send a raiding party in order to loot and destroy enemy camps.This game is still on Early Access and on the Alpha development and that means the develop is still open with ideas and I'm pretty sure that the final result will become a good rival and a strategy version of Trove			"

								After the tragedy of the game Towns, there was no real replacer for that game. This one is quite the spiritual successor to that game, with a far more responsive dev team and prettier graphics.The buildings, if you haven't guessed, are customizable down to the very block. If you create a custom building during one game, you'll be able to save its blueprint for all of your other games. Yay!Despite the nice graphics and smooth gameplay, bugs do exist. Sometimes they are game breaking, but the devs of this game usually patch it within the next update, which is ~2-4 weeks. Considering that this game has been out for over a year already, I'd say the development has come a long way.You should probably wait for a sale, however. Whatever amount you spend on this game, it's going into good hands.			"

								I love stone hearth and like how it is updated regularly but I would really enjoy if the developers added Stonehearth to   Xbox 1 and other consoles because I enjoy building and creating defences but after awhile it gets laggy and eventually unplayabe but this is mostly because of my computer. I think that if this game was available to consoles it would be much more fun later on in the game because the preformance of my Xbox is alot better than my desk top. I also think muiltiplayer would be really fun to try out,  and controlling on of your hearthlings might be kind of fun too. But in the end I really enjoy this game and enjoy how it is updated regulary.			"

Even though the game is in early access you should pick this up to help the devs make this already amazing game even better.There are only two downsides:It's very buggy but thats to be expected in an alpha build andIt is CPU intensive but they have sorta fixed that and will probally improve the performance as months go on.Anyway pick this game up, you won't regret it!

								I've been around since the beginning of this games origins on Kickstarter, and this game has evolved so much since then. While true, this game AS OF NOW is a little shoddy in some places. However, even with those problems the game remains to be a fun and enjoyable experience. The devs spend countless hours fixing bugs and moving the game forward, relesing beta updates on a weekly basis and constantly keeping the players informed, even taking in their suggestions on their dev stream and the Stonehearth forums. The game is, unlike most, being molded by not just the developers, but the players aswell. These qualities make me certain that this game will travel from the state it's in now, which is still a good game as is, to even grater heights.4/5 would recommend AS IS.5/5 would recommend for the future.

								This game is Great, The AI is stellar for an alpha, (though some rudementary things could be fixed, like not trapping yourself in a roof and starve to death when you build a large building) the graphics are great, and the enemies are tough (in the begining) However There are a few things that could be fixed, and i have some ideas for the developers (if they read Steam Reviews)Game Mechanic Complaints/Ideas:1. Unless i'm stupid, the insta wall thing could be a click and drag(Like the Sims games), instead of a set spawn on the floors. It's Incredibly frustrating trying to jerry rig the walls to do what i want.1a. Make vertical single block placements count as walls(once they reach a certain height) And make walls able to delete SINGLE BLOCKS (or in general) so you can make better looking walls, Also, its incredibly frustrating too.1b. Allow Floor placement allowed to be clicked on the inside of a wall not just ontop, it makes the outside looking a tad weird1c. Allow the entire map to be accesible when you spawn (unless thats a bit too Pressing on comps) at least make it optional.1d. Make AI run a bit quicker (or notice the enemies from farther away) so they have a chance to run when they are far from the village and the guards1e. Make guards patrol roads, not farms and storage plots.1f. There are more, but their minute1g. Ability when creating your new town to go back in the menu when you change your mind.General Ideas:2. Have an optional giant invasion to happen at the extreme late game (for the sake of seeing if your awesome defences hold, or having an awesome dramatic slaughtering of your village)2a. Have hearthlings make the childrens (And see they're Genology so you can have a cool history)2b. Ability to make a mayor/lordly job (not sure what it'd do, mabye make hearthlings more efficent?) just want it for awesome RP purposes2c. New races to play (Orcs, Dwarfs, Elfs, etc.), More lands to choose (Swamps, Snowy tundra, Oceania Islands, Rainforest, and my personal favorite, Underground cave biome)2d. Fishing Jobs So docks have uses instead of just being decoration2e. Hearthlings(and monsters) have the ability to climb two block high walls2f. Green Stone option.2g. option to have the Ability to make muliple towns (on different maps) and have them interact with eachother somehow. (Trade? war? join together in an empire? Merely existing?)2h. DRAGONS!2i. demons and hell portals2j. Undead invasion?2k. Disease, and plagues (Optional for those who hate those mechanics)Those are some of my ideas. Such a great game even without all of this. keep up the good work!			"

								What can I say. This is a game that I keep coming back to, even while it's in Early Access.The depth added by allowing players to design every aspect of their town is amazing, and the construction system, while it has it's flaws, is likewise amazing.Every time I go to play this game, I have to set aside several hours, because I know for a fact I'll miss something important if I don't.

								This game is one of the best games i've played in a long time. And keep in mind that this is Radiant's first game! Even though the game is in early access you should pick this up to help the devs make this already amazing game even better.There are only two downsides:It's very buggy but thats to be expected in an alpha build andIt is CPU intensive but they have sorta fixed that and will probally improve the performance as months go on.Anyway pick this game up, you won't regret it!

								Its one of the games that I wish I could love, I really tried.  It is just rife with bugs though, not the typical alpha build, minor annoyance type of bugs either.  Game breaking bugs.  Workers not working, buildings glitching out, soldiers doing stupid attacks to their death.  I cannot think of one feature in this game that actually works properly.The latest update did not address bugs in the slightest.  Instead it added more content, which added even more bugs.			"

								I played a little when I first purchased StoneHearth. At the time it was Alpha 12. I thought it lacked a lot of content and was so extremely buggy it was unplayable.But now, It's Alpha 17 on the stable branch and 18 on the unstable. And the game, after 5 alphas, it 2X better than I remember it. It was OK at best but now it's pretty fun. Seeing this kind of progression though 5 alphas, I can't wait for full release! Very fun game so far!			"

								So far I can say the game is going great for me. It is a bit slow on my laptop but thats because it is a Windows 7. Otherwise on my beefy computer it runs great. I've encountered a few bugs. One being the screen blacks out besides a tiny box and then the other where it froze. The Devs have beenworking hard on this and don't seem to be going anywhere so you shouldnt have to worry about abandonment issues. As of right now though don't buy it unless you want to support the Devs and play the core. Otherwise wait till its Release or Beta and I can gaurantee you won't lose your money.			"

								The game has a lot of bugs and performance issues that can hinder the experience but I'm giving it a thumbs up anyhow. Even with all the issues you should still consider getting the game if you like Sims or building games because this meets both areas. Also, the game is in early access so it is bound to have more content added and have more patches to fix the performance issues. Once multiplayer is added along with improved combat and increased village populations the game will be a must buy. Until then, I would consider holding off on the game if you don't like bugs and limited gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								     It's another early access, but why should you take the risk of buying the game before release?  This game is receiving updates every Thursday.  An update usually includes a new entity or two (some new content) and a lot of bug fixes.  While the pace seems a little slow, the updates are frequent and the two developers have a reputation of interacting with the community and effectively implenting feedback.     The developers are talented individuals with computer science degrees and related career experience.  Check out their website: http://www.radiant-entertainment.com/     They're not your average joe indie developers working out of their parents basement to make a quick buck.  These two are passionate individuals that want to create something truly enjoyable and worth playing.  That being said, Stonehearth still has many bugs and is definitely not as enjoyable now is it's destined to be.  And Stonehearth is destined to be the best Dwarf Fortress-like game of our age, that doesn't require a nerdy learning curve to actually enjoy.     Stonehearth is promised to be a depth-filled, fun adventure of building a village.  But unlike Banished or other village-builders, you will find yourself fabricating stories about your villagers as you explore, survive and build.  Just watch half the youtube Let's Plays if you don't believe me.  It's that imaginative element, that makes games like Stonehearth more than just another city-builder.  Stonehearth is not just another game, it's a journey into your own imagination as you build a village.  So, if the experience resonates with you, support this young and promising studio, as the developers craft a gem in the indie gaming world.  Personally, Stonehearth rubs off that feel-good aura, that this early access is an investment that's worth the risk!			"

								Wow, no reviews for this game? Stay a while and listen!This one, this is a masterstroke in a careful and delicate balance between the game being a city builder / user interface hell. Yes, it is still early access and you'll probably hit a bug while playing, nothing has crashed the game for me in 30 hours so I'd say this is in the better half of Early Access (though I had not purchased the game sooner so I'm not aware of initial foibles. There is so much to love here: Likable residents, cute formatting and design. The UI is clean, the layout does pop over itself but that is trite in comparison to the data you're shown / what you need. What you need is where you'd expect to find it with a very responsive layout. Basically, you can get in and play without having to dig through where you were or push F1 to research many words to explain a simple concept. Well executed devs.Cheerful would be one word to describe this game. I haven't found a single annoying aspect, and willingly will put many more hours into this game with content that is sure to come.You do not need a wiki to play this either, if you need help you can surely find the answer here or in a wonderful community base posting your question.This game has brought the best aspects together in a very clean voxel format that does away with common issues that has will take away from the experience of the game. The difficulty can be scaled in game through use of items (placing trophies), and you can pause to collect yourself if you're in trouble. I eagerly await content and consistently return to an enjoyable experince each time I load up StoneHearth. It is one of my favorites, and an answer to what I seek in a city building game. Thank you for putting this idea out there to make me realize what I'd been missing in this genre.			"

It's maddening.I really want to enjoy this game, and sometimes I very nearly do.  However, I cannot reccomend it in it's current state.  Too many game breaking bugs to be any good.			"

								I Just want to bring to light what has been my experience while owning this game... I bought this game before it hit steam, for $30 USD. After it was released on steam, i noticed it was $5 cheaper, when I created a ticket to the Devs, explaining my situation, and asking for some sort of compensation. They reponded back by saying there was a post on their website telling people it would release on steam for cheaper. Thinking to myself that i was an idiot and feeling kind of down, i let my friend know about what had happened, he went on the website and found out that they had actually created that post AFTER the date in which i bought the game, and lied about it. The Devs have yet to repond to any of my numerous emails. I just wanted to let people know what kind of Devs they are getting in bed with. ***Thumbs Up so people can see***			"

								Cannot reccomend as a core mechanic of the game is completely broken. Building is attrocious. There are 4 or 5 prefabbed template buildings (ugly and boring) you can get away with, but any sort of cuztomized building whatsoever and the game just breaks. What's more... this is the central mechanic of the game for improvement of your tribe and village... you need to craft buildings for your population to grow. The game has charm and potential, but week after week I see zero improvements to this game breaking flaw. Please fix buildings and I will change my review and start reccomending (and even playing) your game.			"

Its more work to acctually get something to build than it is acctually designing something. Also the performance is sub par. I often have to reload to get a game to run decently. I would like to comment on what the later stages of the game are like but all my games have bugged out impeading my process and halting my progession. At the moment dont buy, but if you see this in a few months check it out. I have no doubt that this game will become something amazing, all the deves seem very passionate about the project and i have the best of hope for it.			"

								Of course, this game is still early access, so it is missing a few components in a game. I like it as it is, but it is missing a very large piece in a game: a tutorial.			"

								Persionally i loev the game. it has very good graphics and is very fun. the only downside is the bugs, there was WAY too many bugs, crashes and lag moments that make the game worse. And to be honest i have seen better games for free, i think they should either make it less money or just get rid of the lag and crashes, which i know they are doing now but its just taking too long.

								Very fun and addictive! Alouth i feel i've brought this a few years ago and it ended up going abandonware and resurfacing here, so i brought it again and almost every mechanic is the same just totally different textures and a way more simple world generator. From what i can see already devs are getting sloppy and the building system is currently bugged. once i tried to use to dev tools to fix stuff, things would really break lol as you would expect so im going to give it a month or so and try it again and hope for a better experience. The game itself is very fun, extremely cute and ridiculously unforgiving!!! The ui overlays are very nice and easy to navigate. Units are very responsive to commands although i did feel a little clustered at some points latter on. Being able to move individual workers would be nice to control them when there being attacked or walking into a pack of wolves, saves me calling everyone back to safety because of 1 idiot who wanted to pet the wolves pup. BUT the biggest let down, The tutorial left me hanging -_-concept 9-10mechanics 7-10 (please fishing) graphics 7-10 textures 5-10 performance 4-10 building 3-10 gameplay 7-10 overall 5-100GL Deving!

								3/5The game is alright. I really enjoyed the 24 hours I played it, and finished it. It was super cute and I found it refreshing. However the game lacks depth. So you go to the game's official forums and talk about it, and any ideas that introduce an idea of depth other than building little houses that after 4 hours all look the same, and harvesting loot and trying to get the max amount of villagers--they are all met with the same retort.""Mods.""I do not suggest this game to anyone unless they are a modder and want to learn how to program and make this game for the the devs. They don't even have Steam Workshop enabled, yet are relying 100% on mods to keep people interested in the game. It's a fun game, don't get me wrong, but if you buy this game you're buying ""Mod Simulator 2017""I hope they change this mentality before leaving Early Access.			"

								Game has taken way too long to make. It's still in early access after years of development, and they haven't even added many of the main features they promised to add. It's very dissapointing honestly, the game has so much potential but they are developing at the pace of a 2 man team even though they've made so much money off of it. I wouldn't reccomend buying it unless you can wait another 4 years to see if they ever finally finish the game. I check back every 5 months or so to see if any new features have been added, but it seems as though they've only worked a week.			"

								It's got quite a game-breaking bug where many (basically all) custom buildings will not get completed. They just bug out and your villagers don't work on them anymore. There's no fix for it aside from cheating to instant-finish them.And the bug has been around for awhile. Not really worth playing until this gets fixed. unless you don't want to play for the building aspect. You can just lay out all of your stuff on the floor. But where's the fun in that?Should I not give it a thumbs down because it's still in early access? Of course I should. I'm giving a thumbs down to the early access because it's severly broken. Steam handles beta reviews when games are released, don't worry about it. I'll reconsider when the bug is fixed.			"

								Lack of content and buggyness can get annoying. Also when you have lots of things happening at once (When you get a giant village) your computers RAM will get overburdened and then the game is very slow (Unless you have LOTS of RAM. But you will still reach this point if you haven't gotten completely bored with the game yet). You might be able to squeeze out a little fun in the beginning but then it becomes a very boring.

Then I've quitted for good.Which is a shame: beside this issue which kills a good 75% of the game, the rest is great. Fix the god damn building system, make it so that we can build ANYTHING and not just cubbicles or at least put a warning that the dudes wont build this or that because it's out of their reach. Do that, and you'll have the perfect time waister. TL;DR: Fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ building system.			"

Absoultely a total blast.I have a very beefy computer as I do dev work too. This game uses just under 9gb of RAM on a consistent basis... very impressive, and scary at the same time.Good work Devs! You have a fantastic concept here - one that is well wanted. You mix Warcraft, minecraft, city builder, sandbox, RTS, and Sims into a single package.... And it's incredibly well laid out and easy to understand. Kudos.			"

I play whenever I can, and when I have time to be spent, and litterally, it never gets boring. And I love how you all put so much effort into creating this game, like, you update almost monthly, and sometimes even weekly. There has been days were I just find a new update after a couple of days from the last update, not even a week apart. Awesome really. LOVE IT!!! Please keep doing this, and I would really like if the population could also grow timely, like if children generate. Thanks again :D			"

								Stonehearth is a great game with a lot of promise. It could be great if it weren't for a few things. One: The building mechanic is great yet is a bit limited to what you can decorate with (this is excusable as its till in alpha). Two: There is a bug with building where your hearthlings stop building a structure halfway through no matter how many materials you have. Three: Some hearthlings refuse to function and stand still and slowly starve to death slowly killing your population. Other then that stonehearth is great yet don't buy it at this stage as it is incredibly frustrating when your village refuses to function and starves to death.			"

								For an Early Access Game it's really fun if you are into city management games and making a nice looking village for your self and slowly upgrading it to be better and to expand your land to do more things with.And I have only had two issues with the game, but it's an Early Access Game so thats to be expected so I am very sure they will get fixed soon enough.But all in all I would rate this game a 9/10 just until the bugs get fixed.

								so many years have passed since the developpers promissed us the world and here we are still in alpha... yeah the devolopers promissed us that the game would be in beta 3 YEARS AGO. and a finished game 2 years ago. i thought hell ill take a chance and i even want beta access..... this was clearly a mistake since this game is a buggy mess that is still lacking most of what they sold it on. "" Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?"" “8 to 12 months”... thats what they said on steam 19 months ago. so they keep promising and never deliver. this company is the main reason i dont trust kickstarters and early access anymore. i have waited and waited on this game but at this point its a running joke. sure they make updates to the game. but they are nowhere near where they prommissed to be no matter if you go by the steam prommis or the kickstarter.

								It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but there is a severe lack of an end goal. I've played enough of each character type/map to understand the basics and I don't find myself trying to improve my town. I just leave it as it is and hope new Hearthlings come by. It's fun to play, but it's too easy to unlock new components. I would rate this game higher if there were time or population based unlocks that kept me playing past the first 15 citizens.			"

								Very fun game. I have been itching to play a game like this for a while and it has satisfied me. The only reason why I am not recommending this game is because of all the bugs. Yes it is in early access, but some of the bugs that I have ran in too can push you back an hour or so of building, including a bug where your workers refuse to finish the building that is currently under construction. Once these bugs are fixed then I will be glad to recommend  this.			"

								This is not a game to buy at this point. The devs make excuses to some very long time game breaking bugs. If you like restarting your game every 10 to 15 minutes to make it work, or losing whole towns because of errors.. then maybe this game is for you. In its current state it is unplayable and all the devs focus on is new content without correcting the game breaking bugs. What good is new content if you can't play the game?Your town people will idle for no reason (stop working).There is pathing issues that will make your town people die of hunger.They will not complete buildings early in the game, this is for the simple designs forget trying to build complex buildings.Restarting the game every 10 to 15 minutes in hopes it corrects the issues ( and most the time it does not).It will use up your ram at high velocity and spam you with error messages (got over 5k a few times on error messages).This is just a few examples of the state of this unplayable game. If they had a report game button I would hit it in a minute.Be warned before dumping money into this game.Steam forums are not important to these devs. I am sick and tired of devs thinking we owe them something and have to use their forums.. because it is easy for them, not the customer..

Early Access Review
								So, I have been playing for 40 hours as shown, included about 4 play through, I really love the concept and art work, but I can not recommnad this game.This game has 2 critical problem and 1 of them is greatly affecting the core of game play, and I believe both problem been exsisting since alpha 17 began or even earlier.The building system is either coded badly or the whole coding design was wrong in the very first place.When I encounter a gaming bug I generally try to assume why it happened and try to work around, but I just dont understand why the hearlthlings would just stop building the already planned stuff so suddenly.When player confirm the build, the building plan would be executed and set as first priority, it is a do until done task.I'm confused becasue the hearthling's AI doesn't seems off at all, they can access even just 1 single block, they know how to switch around between build and collect. It doesnt make sense for them to just stop building.A few possibility would kind of explain but a bit stretch. For example I started my latest 2 buildings together at the same time and put it real close.They eventually stop at 50%. Maybe becasue not enough room? but they build both to about 50% for no problem, I even mannually asked hearthlings to put up stairs to see if it's spacing prolbem, but nope, they went up normally and got down without any hardship and ignore the half way done building. Now only 1 possibility I can think of, hearthlings got confused by getting 2 building order, whitch I cannot explain why if this is actually what happen...Another bug is, hearthlings will not put down stuff when told to. But there's a fix, whitch is when they refuse or ignore the order to put down certain stuff, just go and build a new item. They will start putting stuff down when the new stock come into inventory. I assume this is some sort of data lost whitch the items in the inventory was not visible to the hearthlings.The invaders also got some problem which I just discoverd today.Goblin Kings Dialog show up said that army was arrived, but they did not... and never did after days... It only happen once.I really wanna play more hours but I can't when I cannot build up my town... The whole game is about fighting the invader and build your customized town, 1 of them is 80% broken.I understand this is an early access game, but alpha 17 has been out for 1 whole years, I watch the video for last year and compare with my game there were so little different to be honest. Dev. really need to work harder on both coding and debugging.			"

								If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.But for the review's sake, 9/10. The game is great, but pike all games it can be buggy.			"

								Simply awesome, one of my favorite town crafting game. Lots of change since I voted for this one on greenlight, gameplay is basic aswell as graphics and animation are basic, but it all fit perfectly for this kind of game.Pros:- Town builder- Use one of the 5 or 6 building already there to build your house, or do them by yourself with an amazing system that made the house crafting really easy- Your settler do their job and seems to focus on what is more important, did not found any problem with the items collection yet- Tunel digging, (a bit hard to handle for now, with the camero position)- Invasion (not so hard for now, but I saw my brother fighting a huge beast) :D- Like I said earlier, gameplay is really basic, making the game really fun, really easy to handleCons: (Only found one yet)- Hard to stop playing :D			"

								Horrible. This game has way too many game breaking bugs. It has potential but is horrible at the moment. Your world may last about an hour before the bugs start happening. If you wan this game, wait for it to update a couple of times because this version is really bad. Now, on the bright side, this game is still an ALPHA game, which means its not complete and has many more updates and bug fixes. Dont get me wrong, this game IS fun just that the bugs get out of hand. The bugs can make your game crash too so i suggest turning auto saving on because if you dont you could lose a lot of progress.I give this game a 9/10 for what does work but as a whole i give it a 5/10. This is after an update: Update didn/t help. This game is still broken. Don't get it.			"

								You know those over-ambitious games that you hear about and think they'd be amazing, but then you play them and are immediately dissapointed?  That's this game.I got suckered in by the Kickstarter, and it's been the same glitchy mess for three years.At its core, the game wants to be a city-planning, strategy, completely customizable dream of a game with strong community support.  The problem is that, at the moment, there's very little customization, no strategy, and no real city planning.  Towns rarely last long enough to build more than a handful of homes before glitches break a save.The new features that have been added over the years have been nice, but they'd be nicer if I could actually enjoy them without having to restart because of a game-breaking bug.One of two things will happen.  Either your adorable hearthlings will simply stop doing anything, or some problem will arise when building a structure and nothing will be accomplished as all citizens will get stuck on a ladder or permanently be stuck holding materials or literally lose their head.Some bugs are fixed, but the game hasn't progressed nearly far enough while in development, and now that Riot bought the company, I sincerely doubt anything will come of this game.tl;dr - If the game didn't break so much, it'd be a fun little time waster as it is, but that's a pretty big ""if"" at this point.

								I would love to love this game, but it is incomplete, clunky, and boring.  The ""voxelated"" graphics are a poor and cliche aesthetic choice.  Progression is slow and meaningless.  Building design, though quite intricate, ultimately adds little to the game mechanic and ends up being mostly a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  (You must pre-design buildings rather than construct them block-by-block as in Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress.)Yes, it's an early access title, but the only material change in the game in the last 9 months seems to be breaking save compatibility.  Give these guys 2-3 more years to put out a finished game before you pay anything for it.			"

I am so over early access. Let me know when the game is more user friendly than I might play it again.  I'd ask for refund but I aleady had the over 4 games this last month I ask for refund. Very disappointed at the moment. I don't think I want buy another Steam product at the moment.			"

Because everything I try to find never exxplains how resolve it.  The videos on the game and progressiion is great over the year (I watched over 200 videos on the game before I purchased it.)But not sure ift worth paying 27 for a game I can't figure out how to play or I am not sure if its a bug that is preventing me from playing it. I am so over early access. Let me know when the game is more user friendly than I might play it again.  I'd ask for refund but I aleady had the over 4 games this last month I ask for refund. Very disappointed at the moment. I don't think I want buy another Steam product at the moment.			"

								While I haven't yet put in a lot of hours into the game, I will say that what's there is quite fun to play.It's an ideal game for anyone who likes Dwarf Fortress or Towns, as well as anyone who enjoys the whole ""minimal input"" genre of games. You can designate a plot to build on, then watch your little workers get to work. There's also resource management, combat, farming, and lots of other stuff that you indirectly have control over. Presentation wise, you can see that the creators of this game have put a lot of love into the detail and mechanics of the game. There's leveling up, skill progression, exploitation of resources, and all the fun stuff you'd expect from this genre of game.All in all, a worth it purchase.			"

								This is a good game. This game takes alot of ideas and throws it into a bowl without any part overpowering the others. It all blends really nice. Like a backrub from a high quality german stripper who, on her off time, met you at a coffer bar. She noticed you needed someone to talk to and came over with two Caramel Macchiatos. She sat down and asked how your day was, and you reply, ""Stoneharth is difficult and I lost my favorite villager."" Knowing how important it is that you keep all of them alive, she offered to help you play it. She sat you down and coached you through the hard parts. Told you to always work on military as well as how much food and wealth your village has. ""Defences often save your life."" She noted. You realized that at that moment, this game you've been playing is depper than you thought. The german stripper smiled, and left. You were too busy playing this game to ♥♥♥♥. That is alright. It is worth it.9.8/10 (Early Acess, it'll be 10 soon enough)			"

I believe that once Alpha 12 comes out this will be a better game.			"

								Stonehearth is a game of soldiers meets time management; you build a town and keep your inhabitants happy and defend them against enemies. The controls are simple enough to understand and do not require players to have an insane amount of dexterity to master the game. It's something of a sandbox designing villager's houses and towns.However the game meets a limit once you've established your colony and becomes tedious to defend against mobs. There are also times when I find myself sitting around doing nothing.			"

								The concept is fantastic, and there's a lot of potential in the game, but...There's far too many issues with its current state. Building custom buildings is near-impossible, the controls are often non-responsive, there's a nasty memory leak (this game should not require +6 gigs of RAM), and that's only the biggest problems. Workers that don't work, ladders and furniture that can't be deconstructed, etc. There's many small things that combine to make the game very hard to enjoy. Putting aside the bugs and building problems, the game is well designed. The progression of your minions is simple but effective, the resource harvesting likewise. My only quibble is that it takes a very long time to do anything with only a 2x speed option. I'd like the ability to go up to 8x at least.Given the strength of the underlying design, I look forward to playing the game more once it's had some bug-fixing done. However, I can only review it based on what it is now, so I cannot recommend this as is.			"

This game looks amazing and the game play is awesome...But I can't recommend playing this as of now. So many glitches and errors make the game for the most part unplayable. This is ridiculously true when attempting to build a multi-story building: things get stuck, walls get stuck, building undeletable, etc. Hopefully in the future I can upvote this as it does look promising. There are better things on Steam to spend $30 on.			"

								I participated in the kickstart and got two copies from it because of my pledge. I played several alpha versions up to A20 and finally quit trying. If you watch the Kickstarter and earlier videos and then you play the game as it is now, it is like water and wine. The original seemed a lot more casual and about building a nice town and eventually castles with aspects of crafting, hunting and so on. However, the game grew in complexity so much that it is now not only too complex to be casual, but it is too complex for the developers to keep it up and follow up on the infinite bugs that it has. This game will never be complete IMHO because the development team forgot their basics and went for a too complex approach to be any good. When you get stuck over and over trying to build a single building, you will notice it won't go far.They should have left all the detail and minimalistic things and gone FIRST to the big game: place buildings, structures, etc... make enemies, little wars, little raids. Get the game WORKING, allow you to make any city or castle you wanted without worring if the door is aligned to the freaking wall or will even work. THEN elaborate the minimalistic things.Clearly, a team with no programming experience. Shame ...			"

								So far, after a few of hours of play, I think the game has potential but gives me the feeling that Alpha projects like this shouldn't be ""Early Access"" or more so paid for. Though I feel good about the developer and hope things update often. Hopefully weekly. If I get updates often and ones that pay off like I'm used to with the Early Access games I'm currently playing, then It should be well worth it.The art and sound all seem pretty good. More so for an Alpha... so much so that it worries me. I won't say anything bad about it... just that it seems like that energy could have been used to make better gameplay. Maybe they had more artistst durring development. I understand they have a plan and all but I'm not sure what they are going for.I'm looking at my red LUA error window, and it's up to 3000+ errors. I can sometimes still play but the window likes to pop back up a lot. I think this already exists sort of, as some kind of building error so I technically would be submitting a duplicate report... so I don't report it. Not even sure which or what of the errors I'm supposed to report.  If I could just push a button and send off a report, that would be fantastic. Alas, I have to navigate to the bug forum and search through a bunch of other existing errors to make sure mine don't already exist as posts. 3000+ of them. This just turns me off and discourages me. I came in with the concept that the game would be test-playable and easy to report problems, but that's not the case. Make it easy to report problems and a lot of that frustration goes away. I'm all for helping debug and I wouldn't have minded paying as much if there was just a little bit more attention to problem reporting detail before the Steam release. Feels bad to have to pay and do grunt work to get bugs worked out. Maybe there is a reward in it somewhere if one plays long enough. If future mod support is superior, that might make me feel better. Speculation and promises don't at this point.The other thing that is boggling and disappointing is that the game has fully featured building elements but no way to demolish the buildings that are made. Seems like someone is missing something important. I don't know if the developers are locked in some strange dimention far away from logical game mechanics... I don't want to sound mean, but this seems very dumb even for Alpha.The other things, like villagers not finishing buildings properly, idling when stuff could be done... I think these are already reported a few times in the ""bug tracker"". And most of the time I can close/open or just save and re-load and that seems to fix some weirdness and the error spams. So I got a bit of fun out of it but the problems seem to crop up frequently, killing the flow and feeling more like developer work than gameplay. It seems worth giving it time, or rather I want to feel like it's worth giving it time, but if I don't see a good bug fix in a week I'll probably have to ask for a refund. I can't recommend paying for this yet and I feel dissapointed considering what I paid.			"

								Do not recommend. Combat controls are too awkward, and the dev tools mod is too limited.  You should be able to edit characters' stats and such.  Part of the fun of these ""sandbox"" games is to do what you want, but it feels very constrained.  You either have ""Peaceful"" mode, or ""survival"" mode, but you can't setup your base to, say, fight off hordes of enemies.  I think what annoys me most, is how *easy* it should be to implement those tools.I will happily change my review in the future if more edit-ability is added.			"

								The bulk of their updates have been color swaps of already existing items. Two years on and the game still tanks with around 15+ hearthlings. Two years on and the game still doesn't really have a story. Two years on and the maps are still extremely small. Two years on and we've only gotten a handful of classes and new items. Two years on and we've only gotten a few new enemies. Two years on and the game is still plagued with bugs and errors, the same ones in many cases too. Two years on and the building tools still haven't really been improved. See the pattern? The development for this game is as slow as Interstellar Marines.Avoid, this is one of those Early Access games that will likely never be finished and they'll just rip the EA tagging off of it and abandon it. Regretful purchase. Most people I know who have it only put a few hours into this sandbox game and abandoned it. It was a great idea, but unfortunately it's the wrong developers. Play for 3 hours and you'll experience all that the game has to offer, which is pretty much the same as what it offered two years ago.			"

								This game has some potential but due to several (gamebreaking) bugs it is barely playable.For a game with a focus on building stuff, one would expect the builing mechanics to work more or less (early acess or not) but it really does not. Most builings (which are slightly more complicated than: four wall + roof) wil not get finished or the building tool will kinda crash. The inability to remove buildings does not help.The worker AI is also very glitchy and in most cases a (pretty annoying) reload of the game helps, but not always...So, what do i think about the game?I like the overall setting and i also like the simplistic graphis style. I think, this game has a lot of potential and will be very good + addicting, when its finished.Is it worth your money (leaving aside the early access nonsense)?No, not yet -> ""too early access""			"

								Giving a bad review because just trying to move around is terrible, your camera view is so clunky and just bad. Like you can't hold right mouse click to turn and use ""w"" to move forward at the same time. Then trying to view in mines or trying to mine at all is nearly impossible due to really bad camera. Could be good game but the camera and how mining works makes it unplayable, waste of money "

I wanted to play on full screen, but apearently that froze the game when ever i started it, I can not even click on the settings to fix that. The developers should be a shamed to put this out on steam, it did look nice so i wanted to play it, now i just want my money back.			"

								im enjoying myself so far but wont be long before im bored, had to configure computer to play the game as , as soon as it downloaded i was faced with white error screen when loading start up so had to sort that out before playing .... the game is pretty buggy, although not really crashing on me the games performance slowly but kinda quickly if that makes sence drops on you the more minutes your in game and you start to notice things stutter . gave up on normal play and had to start playing hard as other options are just way too easy, but im finding hard to possibly be way too hard, theres no middle ground. its ok i suppose and i would give this game a thumbs up if i had payed no more than 12 pounds for it			"

								Interface workflow makes management a chore, the ""art style"" with its complete lack of material textures is downright ugly, building design includes game breaking bugs, combat means finding your soldiers and individually pointing them into the rough direction of the enemy.A good idea and concept very badly implemented. After 1.5 years in early access, I expected something more playable, not having to write down items from one interface to feed them into another.			"

								As far as potential goes I think this game has quite a bit, and while I would not reccomend the game as it is due to the reasons below, in time it should reach the point of being a worthwhile game for the current cost. Which is another thing..this game right now at most should be 15-20, since its not a game with a lot of content and with some major fatal bugs. Currently most lot of the planned content is no where near being in which makes me question the pricing decision. Right now only 1/3rd of the intended jobs are in.During my five hours of gameplay I consantly ran into UI crashes and system failures, which would result in parts of the UI or game becoming unusable forcing you to reload. Twice now it has nearly crashed my pc to the point I was forced to do a false restart where the computer shuts the program down since you hit the power button but you then cancle the restart when it asks you to close your notepad. The game draws more ram then needed from your system causing sound glitches. Also combat in it can be frustraiting, having to use a badly designed party/designated area targeting system. And a warning, do NOT save when one of your characters is in direct combat, when you load the game takes a while to load the ui and seems to suddenly jump a minute or so ahead in combat, often instanly killing any non guard character without giving you the chance to react.

								Okay, this is fun. Heavily racist, but very fun with a mod. :-/ Danger zone maybe? Nah, heres how it is:It's a Banished/Minecraft clone essentially with the diffrence that exploring is limited to a smallish area and it's purely a town ownership and creation type game gathering resources etc with ikkle people/hearthlings, but it's enough to keep you hooked for endless hours once you realise that you can actually create your own building designs from literally the ground up. Forget the standard builds you can just select and place in the world for the Hearthlings to work for you, honestly, I recommend creating your own 10>20 person dining hall with a sleeping area on a second floor for the same amount in the beginning of this, then create walls etc.There are still some bugs that need ironing out, but for the price at the moment, it's a very enjoyable game and the devs are working hard on this continuously.Now, if you havent already fallen asleep reading this boring review I will get to the racism part...........We all like Multiculturism to a level where certain religions are NOT concerned, but if you choose ""The Ascendancy"" and want to have your town based on European based medievel type era castles etc you have to go through the randomise option a hundred times before you can get a full set of ginger, brown or black haired WHITE Hearthlings and 9/10 times they will all have rubbish stats, so you are forced to relive history as some kind of reinvention where all other nationalities were magically ""transported"" in like a bad star trek episode, where in the early year 1000's there were all colours and nationalities in old blighty and Europe. Yes I know, it's fiction with regard to stone monsters etc, but the castle walls and weapons etc are based on historical European designs.Not racist on my behalf, I want to recreate my tribe as per my historical descendancy!Now, however and the MAIN point here.........if you choose 'Rayyas Children' to play on either the Forest or Desert biomes and decide to import your white Hearthlings through that randomise button, you will spend eternity clicking and clicking to have a WIlliam Wallace white, brown haired hardcore dude as a hearthling because you can only play that sect as people with coloured skin! See where I am going here? ;-)Luckily there is a non dev mod available in the Steam store I eventually found, but really? You shouldnt have to use a mod to recreate a castle and medieval atmosphere! This is a game for the paying customer after all and everyone is scared of pointing this fact out due to being branded racist against colour of skin. This is racist against whites in my opinion!All that being said, with the mod it's a fantastic little gem this and worth under 20 quid in my opinion. A lot of work to be done ESPECIALLY with the system resource it requires even though its a tad basic (Needs optimisation in the code), but it's already worth that asking tag at the moment.Great work you racist bunch of devs, but mods shouldnt be needed! :-D			"

								Well this game looked kinda interesting. Mild humour in the loading screen and light, hassle free gameplay with a lot fo customisation if you want it. basically it looked to me like a cross between a build your village game and minecraft. That's kinda cool. Sadly I am very disappointed to report that this game doesn't work for more than 3/4 minutes at a time before bugging out and ""not responding"" as windows likes to put it. I appreciate that this game is still in its alpha version and I wasn't expecting alot of awesome content till much later in development. For the princely sum of £18:99 which is more than Minecraft btw I would expect to actually be able to play this game. I'll give this one more shot before I give it up as lost money. Until I actually get to play thsi game I'll give this game a big thumbs down.Edit: I gave it another go and manged to que up buiding a building before it bugged out on me. My next target is to last a whole half-day.			"

								This game is cute, Not only cute but it look really fun. Is this right?? yes and no. This game is a good idea, hell a very good idea, but the bugs... pretty bad, I can understand when your people just leave♥♥♥♥♥♥on the building but when they just ignore youre commands to build or do anything at all... thats something else. Half the time my people needed food, I made a farmer and set them to plant corn, he just sad there and continued to starve, same with the trapper(s). Not to mention the building system is very unfriendly at the moment. A. when you try to make your own building, the game almost breaks when you try to have a structure with more then one floor, Then if you somehow get past that, half the time when you tell your workers to build it, even if you have everything you need they will continue to sit there. One this game is fixed I have little doubt it could be one of the best games of its type. but now it is anything but that. Do Not get this game now unless you want to wait for updates			"

								This game is some what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, your builders dont mine all blocks you set them to, they are running towards the other side of the map carrying materials, you cannot direct normal workers to move somewhere. I just lost a hearthling because of stupid game design(seems to be the norm in this industry for the past decade), when moving items in my town from box to box, the hearthlings walked to the other side of the map IN THE WATER for no reason, goblins spawned and killed them in 2 hits, seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why are the path movements blocked? i have a town with roads, heaps of space, yet the AI decides to go on a trek for no reason (no loot to collect on this side of the map btw). ♥♥♥♥ knows why they are going out there? and why the hell cant i control theyre movements? get a grip....

								Look promising and graphic look nice. Did not play much before refund. The reason is the building mechanic makes me frustrated. It is quite clunky and you cannot modify the building once builted. I think, building modification should be able since early development phase, especially this game is sales in alpha state (which is already 5 years). I think there are different between adding addition features and debug VS problem of game mechanic and functionality. Browsing through the developer website and forum, there is no mention about putting this feature in the game at any stage of development. Probably the game engine is at fault and building modification is not possible. Hope the developer or those with deep insight with this game can help answer my question. For now, I do not recommend this game due to the problem I mentioned.			"

								I think this game has loads of potential but in my opinon it's far to bugg to be sold for that much money. I have yet to get past about 10 days before the saved game deletes itself or something happens which means my map is unusuable. There are some little basic things as well that are quite annoying and you would think would be standard in a sandbox creation game. You cant take down items you have built. You cant have more than one building job on th go at a time. If you do start more than building at a time then they will do the latest one and never go back to the previous leaving lots of half finished stuff. and just more glitches then i can count. I was hoping for a more animated version of Gnomoria and frankly im dissapointed, especially after spending nearly £20. This will be fun when it's further along, but right now? No. Very dissapointing.			"

								Update: 8-3-2015Current version is even more unstable than before. It seems that the development team is going backwards each time they add a new feature.-Multi-story housing construction nearly impossible.-Roof construction causes severe Lua errors.-Almost every game I've started becomes unplayable after a few hours of gameplay.Avoid this title at the moment. I'd hardly call it Alpha.Although I would normally recomend this game, I just can't justify recomending it for now. The idea is there, and the foundation of the game is more or less built, but it seems that the developer doesn't know what they want to do.-Very little content. The addition of goblin packs and wolves have extended gameplay somewhat, but at best it is a bare minimum for your average game.-The content in game is very repetitive.-Extremely slow development schedule. It seems to me the developers are working on this either part time, or are severely short staffed. It can take months for systems to be completed, and usually once implemented are extremely buggy.-Extremely buggy. Be prepared for constant crashes and damaged saves. I'm not certain with version 10+, but every new version requires a whole new game.-Game is not what was advertised and has switched focus/goals. What originally was intended as a city/realm management game, has turned into a village micromanagement game.-Game has lost focus in that it wants a combat RTS element, but still relies on its old villager micromanagement foundation.It's a good idea and so far a solid foundation for what could be a great game in a few years (think Kerbal Space Program). I strongly recommend against purchasing at the moment or at full price. I would wait until it is either on sale, or it is much further along.			"

Early Access Review
								Almost all of the reviews so far are from people who have played the pre-Steam Early Access version a ton (I mean it was on Steam, just not publicly available) and I get why the like it, because it is a good game for what it is, but I'm going to not recommend it, not yet, because of what it claims to be, what the Kickstarter explained it to be, and what it is now. TL:DR it is nothing like the Kickstarter pitched it would be, which might be just fine, but it isn't what I backed. One of the first tags you will see for Stonehearth says city builder and when you see that tag do you think of something like Gnomoria or Towns? Probably not. Those are more like town or village builders with some micromanagement and customization of each individual villager, which is great because you you start with maybe half a dozen and build up from there, but even if you end up with 20 villagers (which is a lot for this game) would you say that is a city? You might argue that I'm just talking semantics and being trivial, but let me quote what the Stonehearth Kickstarter summarized the game to be, ""A sandbox strategy game with town building, crafting, and epic battles!"" It certainly does not have town building and crafting at the moment, but a strategy game it is not. At the moment the game is very much like Gnomoria, Timber & Stone or Towns. You start with a few villagers, build a few structures, place stockpiles, farm, mine and craft things while also defending from random attacks from enemies. I've seen the game grow into something that has some level of polish to it and visually looks pretty good, but never has the game seemed like it could technically manage anything like an actual city. Once again, my focus is that this is meant to be a city sim with light micromanagment for people and focused more on the large picture, not the small. Like, the original explanation for multiplayer was, ""Share a living world with your friends and family! Build sprawling empires of towns, cities and castles, and unite in mutual defense against the towering threat of ancient titans."" There was this huge focus on building cities, castles and fighting off these big factions and threats, as a city with some level of strategy and more like a city sim mixed with a game like Dwarf Fortress. This isn't that and it has going in a direction that makes me think it will never be anything like that. It will certainly be a good or great Dwarf Fortress, Towns, Gnomoria, style of game at some point and that is fantastic, so if you want another one of those then good, but if you were an early backer like me who wanted something with strategy and a larger scale then I think you will be vastly disappointed. I was drawn in by early screenshots of cities with over a dozen structures, a castle in the background, large statues and tons of moving citizens going about their work, and that's just not going to happen. Which is fine, but I don't want anyone else to think it is that game either.			"

								I like this game, but there just isn't much gameplay right now in the game. You'll chop down some trees, farm a bit, build some buildings for sleeping and then the game mostly dies off. They've just started integrating a ""goblin campaign"" wherein your settlement is supposed to be attacked by increasingly dangerous hordes of goblins, but I just sort of killed them all. The game developers need to focus on how they are going to challenge the player within their simulation. Right now, that focus just isn't there. Instead, they're doing things like advanced programming to make water flow realistically, but water has precisely zero significance for gameplay. This, I believe, exemplifies why I'm concerned not just for the state of the current game, but future development as well. If the game eventually reaches a point where gameplay is enduring and well-thought out, I will gladly remove/rewrite this review.			"

								Hey just going to say this first this is only my 2nd review okay. I think this game is quite fun to play myself, you start of with few people and some tools and thats it. You have to gather resources from around the area you live inn and and either hunt, farm of find berries for food. Design your own buildings or choose one from the pre-made. Just remember to equip your guards to defend your Village from enemies. One of the things that you can do is to give each villager a job like a cook, blacksmith or a guard and more.Remember that this is still an early access game and there is still some bugs. But it means that there will come more fun stuff in the future aswell. I hope my review helped you in some way, Bye.			"

								NEW REVIEW: 3/9/2017PROS:-Fun management game.-Like the art style.-The ""Build-Your-Own-Buildings"" feature is great!CONS:-Crashes constantly. Sometimes it'll crash at random and other times it'll crash while saving.-Bug where people won't finish buildings. All the resources are made but they refuse to continue their work.-Bug where villagers build ladders then get stuck on ladders so you have to build a new ladder to get them down.-Bug where Cleric will not heal. Instead, they'll bash baddies with their book but they really should be healing!-The bigger your town becomes, the more your game will lag.-I'll mark a boulder I want the villagers to take down. Three weeks later, it'll still be there.			"

								Great town management game!Good to have a expansive crafting menu and a nice little military side to the game.Purchased quite early in the early access scheme and got annoyed with many bugs.Just recently returned to give it another look and its great to see many of the bugs fixed, although some are still around... but they dont outway the fun had whilst playing in my recent experience.This game has been out for a little while already and the bugs are slowly weeded out it seems...Hopefully the devs keep going, i dont think they are getting enough sales to devote a full time job worth of time and money for a a few to get it up there without too much delay... even though the early access is ment to help with that.Not sure id agree with the $25 pricetag... Try and snap it up on a sale on steam, or sneakily through Go2oA (take out the ""o"" steam doesnt like me listing the name) if they have it going for a good price.I just hope they get to the end for this game... its got decent potential to be awesome.

								So far so good I'd say. It's pretty decent for the price I'd say... If they would lower the price a little further I'd give this game 5 stars. I still run into a couple of glitches which require the game to restart, so just make sure you switch on Autosave.Building: It seems like they got a pretty good concept going, and if they keep working on this, this game is going places. You can get a little creative right now, but if they expand on the ideas they currently got, this will defintely be a hit.Farming is pretty easy, just plop down fields and let the farmers do the rest, very simple so far. All in all, it's a decent game, overpriced for what their offering right now but if you don't mind investing $24 on a game which has good potential, go for it. If you'd rather wait this out a little further, I don't blame you.			"

								Its a fun little game. Not much going on now, you build up a city and then eventually you get it to where you want it and restart, or monsters come in and kill all your people and you get annoyed and restart. It's a bit pricy at $25 which is a lot to ask for from a game ""in the works"" but I think the price tag is due more to the donors backing up the game than people actually paying for content. Either way this game is making good progress and honestly I am happy to pay full price to support this game and its development team. Pro: Game making good progress in developmentKeeps the public up to dateYou can spend hours and hours doing nothing but building the perfect cityHas the basics and some of the more advanced features already includedCons:Pretty repetative after a whileOnce your town is constructed theres nothing really left to doA few bugs (To be expected from Early Access)Price v content isnt the greatestOverall Opinion:If you want to support a game and its Development team, this is a good investment. There is no keeping people in the dark here, this is Early Access but you know where the game is going. The game is constantly being updated to include bigger and better things but currently if your going for content your overpaying. The game is a big time killer though so if your going for hours of gameplay this is the game for you.			"

								   Although it is still buggy in its early stages, this game has a certain potential that few games seem to achieve. Such games include StarBound, Dirty Bomb, and of course, this game. You should get it now to experience the growth of the game as it develops.   This game is tons of fun and really in-depth. All they need to fix is the inevidable bugs, and this game would be one of the greats. I reccomend this to anyone and everyone looking to create something.   Another neat feature that some games fail to achieve is having your structures that you build have a purpose, and they do. You can have a dining hall, sleeping quaters, a workshop building for your hearthlings, and more. This game greatly influences meaning in your buildings. I am willing to bet you will love this game!                                                                                                                                                  -9/10			"

Early Access Review
Potential and CharmI purchased prior to early access, Fall 2014. If the videos appeal to you, and you are willing to put up with bugs then I feel comfortable recommending this game now. As of 11/2015 the primary issues I have with the game are bugs. Many are fixed weekly, but I still can't quite build what I want or I have to game the AI to keep whem working.  If the developers deliver on everything it should be considerably better.This game has a lot of potential, and I respect the developers for being very open with the community. They communicate through their blog weekly, and often push a non-stable build weekly or every other week. This game has not been abandoned like some other early access titles. Pros:Responsive Dev TeamOpen for ModsGreat visual styleFun personality in the writing Extensive replayability (no two games the same)Building interface has great potentialCons: Buggy... it's alphaLong dev cycleMany features that give the game legs are not in yet (MP,Co-Op, more factions)I purchased this because I wanted to support the developers, and I'm glad to see they are still going strong.

								A fun sandboxish town builder.   It is in the earlier stages of development so if someone is looking for Dwarf Fort with graphics they will still be looking after checking out this game.  While much of the game is quite straight forward, I can't wait for the developer to come out with more and more content.   The game also doesn't take itself too seriously which makes for a good, lighthearted time.			"

The game itself is a gem.  I lose hours in it coming up with new ways to devlop my town, create storage, develop buildings and mine out tunnel empires.  I recommend this game ot anyone who loves a town builder sim and the game is only going to get better. Check out their Kickstarter page to see what they have planned for it, it's pretty exciting!

								This game is so addicting i cant come off it i play this more than any other game i have.First time Experienceat first i had no idea what to do (I know there is guides but im going simply from the game itself) it doesnt really explain what you do. Then i when i figured out what to do i felt quite stupid (Personally).At first i was just gathering resources but wasnt sure what to do, but then realised you have to set you people jobs, after that i started expanding, defend my self from goblins, then built a wall round my town and have just expanded on.Although it can be quite annoying to play due to the bugs and what have you it is only and Alpha so dont expect bug free.ProblemsNow yes it is only and alpha im not hating on it i understand but im only sharing a few bugs people should know about.Buildings with more than floorThis can be a pain as they will get stuck on the inside of the top floor if your not planning on using the second floor.UIIts written in C++ json files, similar to Minecraft. so yeah can expect the kind of bugs from it, if your changing a Person job and your looking at the list it can crash and stop you from setting Jobs, saving, crafting, and other things that require the UI to pop up a menu.(To fix this just press F5 to reset the UI)Lagyou wont notice this till you have explored your area a bit and have at least 20 people in your town. When this happens prepare for all the Bugs. The UI system comepletely fails and stutters the game due to the all the for loops and the while scripts (Basically 24 FPS is coming your way).(I have found a way to sort of delay the lag, when its happens Reset the UI by Press F5. this resets all the Loop Scripts causeing it to refresh all the code thats waiting or looping in the game it wont cause any harm that i know i do it and i have no problems)ConclusionYes there are problems but its an alpha and this game has insane potential im sticking around for the updates and playing it daily you ignore the bugs and just get on with it. i still recommened getting this game.

Potential and CharmI purchased prior to early access, Fall 2014. If the videos appeal to you, and you are willing to put up with bugs then I feel comfortable recommending this game now. As of 11/2015 the primary issues I have with the game are bugs. Many are fixed weekly, but I still can't quite build what I want or I have to game the AI to keep whem working.  If the developers deliver on everything it should be considerably better.This game has a lot of potential, and I respect the developers for being very open with the community. They communicate through their blog weekly, and often push a non-stable build weekly or every other week. This game has not been abandoned like some other early access titles. Pros:Responsive Dev TeamOpen for ModsGreat visual styleFun personality in the writing Extensive replayability (no two games the same)Building interface has great potentialCons: Buggy... it's alphaLong dev cycleMany features that give the game legs are not in yet (MP,Co-Op, more factions)I purchased this because I wanted to support the developers, and I'm glad to see they are still going strong. This little game has a lot of charm, and potential. As it stands right now I check the game once a month or so just to see all the new stuff they've put in.

								For being a early access game, I'm pleasantly pleased.  Other games I have purchased in early-access were a disaster; unresponsive devs, focus on pay-elements #microtransactions, while the game is more-or-less unplayable.  While this game isn't free of bugs, the overall game play mechanics are here and there is easily 10-20 hours worth of quality game-play.I've been looking for a game of this type for sometime.  Minecraft is too much like 'Toil-craft' and this game gives a lot of thought to how to get the great parts of minecraft (city building, resource management, warfare, politics) but multiplayer hasn't been executed yet.  My personal hopes is that they make a persistent world for multiplayer where multiple player-controlled towns can be built and trade established between them. If they can knock multiplayer our of the park, I imagine a large group of people will put down toil-craft for Stonehearth (where you're NPCs do the toiling and leave you to planning / management). Worth a look!			"

The game is pretty solid, there is a tiny chance you get some bug unless you're playing the beta which is more buggy. You build, craft, farm, and survive attacks from the enemies. Although I want to see more classes in the game, the game is has its core built up already. I really recommend it for those people who like building towns, cities, or empires.			"

								The game has a good start and is a load of fun to play.  However the large amount of bugs I keep coming across prevent some simple tasks.It'd be nice if when you start tunneling down that the villagers could at least know they need ladders to get out.I will also point out how the interface is very simple to get the hang of.  For those who have played the game Gnomoria, the stockpile system is very similar and won't be hard to get used to.All in all, this game has a ton of potential as a sandbox village creating game.  It just needs to be regularly updated and developed further.  After all, it still is in the early access phase!			"

								When I first picked up this game I thought I wouldn't like it, but I was completely wrong.Despite having a long way to go, this game shows some very unique concepts of which I haven't come across before.You play as a band of settlers trying to make a home for theirselves in the wilderness. If you want your town to grow you need to increase food, morale, and wealth. There are a few features that need refining, like for example, if you want a farmer you will need a carpenter to make a farmers hoe, but unless you bought a carpenters saw at the start of the game, your screwed.All in all a brilliant game, and the feature I love the best is the fact you can design your own houses! I love city builders so for me this is a dream come true, but this also may need refining			"

								I got this game about a year ago, or whenever it first came out to public (I think it was a year ago) on radiant's website. I had followed the game for a while, and it was a game that really caught my attention. I had seen timber and stone, but i liked this better. I played it for a few hours when i first got it, not having much content then. So, I stopped playing it, until recently. I came back to the game, and it had so much more than it did before. Everything was better. Then, i realized the potential for this game. Going onto a server in a huge world where you build up large kingdoms and have huge armies and fight other kingdoms and claim them. This game is really promising, and is still fun in it's earlier stages. It also gets updated constantly.			"

								The game has a good start and is a load of fun to play.  However the large amount of bugs I keep coming across prevent some simple tasks.It'd be nice if when you start tunneling down that the villagers could at least know they need ladders to get out.I will also point out how the interface is very simple to get the hang of.  For those who have played the game Gnomoria, the stockpile system is very similar and won't be hard to get used to.All in all, this game has a ton of potential as a sandbox village creating game.  It just needs to be regularly updated and developed further.  After all, it still is in the early access phase!			"

								This is a really grest game that i really want to play and have a lot of fun with, but the bugs right now make it extremly annoying. trying to make any house even slightly customized is a flat out joke. every time i go to erase anything, or try to build custom walls i run into game crashing errors. thats one of the only areas of the game ive found to actually have issues though so i sill highly recomind this game, that and the developers are working all the time to update the game, so please fix the cutom building and all will be right with the world. the blnding of city building, rpg, citzen mangament and amny other genres that this game brigns are amazing!EDIT: most of the building issues have been fixed, there is still a few issues here and there with removing scafolding but all in all working pretty smooth. Still a great game!			"

								This game is VERY addicting and cute, although I would never, ever buy it at full price os 24.99$ (what I am seeing while posting this). It is riddled with bugs and glitches and at some points completely unplayable because the people won't continue building a structure. If you can get past the bugs the castle-defense style game really is unique and fun to play, but I would buy it on sale. It is NOT worth the full price tag, at least not yet.			"

								I love this game. It allows You to build up a kingdom and fight off monsters as well as promoting people (hearthlings) to several jobs such as a carpenter, farmer and blacksmith.You can design buildings that are then created by the hearthlings that you can then use for houses. This is the best simulation game I have played so far.Whilst there are still some bugs and the game can be annoying when your saves bacome incompatible, it is an amazing game hence why I recommend it.It is a nice and stress free game (most of the time) that has been developed to be a sucess.This game is also frequently updated therefore fixing bugs and adding in new content making the game more fun and interesting "

								Hi there, I am playing Stonehearth since Alpha 5 or 6 I think - not regularly, but whenever a new alpha version comes out (which is roughly every 1-2 moneths).As all the posters before me already said, it has elements of a city builder, of RPG and visually connects to titles like Minecraft, Timber and Stone etc.What I like about this game is the cuddliness of the Hearthlings, which sets a very light tone. When my children saw the first fox to scratch its ears, I had to let the camera on the critter for at least ten minutes. Music is great, day and night cycle works fine, even monsters are cuddly in a way.If you are a hardcore strategist, you will probably miss depth in the skill tree and challenging campaigns to crush your adversaries, but if you love building, designing and a little melee fight every now and then, give it a try.Sure, there are a few bugs in the game, but hey, thats alpha, and usually they are fixed quite fast. Devs communicate a lot with the community via the forum, and each tuesday and thursday, they even stream their work, so you can look over their shoulders.I'm glad the game is in my collection - still a demo version would be nice to allow people to enjoy the ambience and understand what I mean.

								Oh i love this game. It's so much fun but really developers, 25$ for an early access game? For the content at the moment i think either 15-20 would've been better. But other than the cost, bugs and occasional crashes (of course the game is still being made), and lack of content (again still being made) it's fun. I would not recommend buying it now unless it's on sale because it just doesent have enough late game content. My town survived more then a month and i already had an almost infinite supply of food and steel armor and weapons for my three soldiers. The game's just a little too easy at the moment. So in all, i think it's a good game 8/10. Really fun early game with tons of stuff to do, but once you hit about a month in game there's nothing left for your people to do. But remember it's an early access game so i'm doing this review with a little slack.			"

Make sure you are always armed with a footman. Because it its early accsess you may encounter a few bugs witch is obvious. 8/10			"

								Even in the early stages, I'm finding Stonehearth to be incredibly addictive. Watching your Hearthlings build and thrive as you direct their actions is endearing. Though the characters are adorable, watching them slaughter adorable Goblins is great.Still, there are a few things that could be improved in this game. Keeping in mind that, as an Early Access title at this stage, there are improvements and features yet to come anyway. Regardless, here are a few things that I feel could be worked on:- The 'Build a Custom House' feature is in dire need of a more reliable 'Delete' tool. If the changes I wanted to make to an existing blueprint requires replacing something that has already been placed, I'm out of luck. I'd just have to tell my Hearthlings to undeploy an object and deploy the one I actually want there. (Like an improved bed.)- I would like to be able to either see a queue of actions and be able to to change the priority or simply have a click-and-drag tool to call the Hearthlings to a certain area to work on it right at that moment. I have seen far too many crops wither and die because they become neglected by my farmers. Not to mention, the buildings that become abandoned in the middle of construction because my workers suddenly feel that everyone mining at once is more important than finishing another wooden dining hall.- Please bring back the Name Randomizer for towns. I honestly liked seeing the sort of names built into the game and I'm horrendous with naming settlements in the first place.			"

								Well,well,well ... what to say... One of the moust promessing games i have seen so far, but still just that, promessing... As far as i have known, i have been following this game for almoust 2 years, and i can´t say that a lot have change since, sooooo ...  if you are hoping for all the media arround ( big stunning monsters, castle gates, two or more floor buldings with a seemingly inside staircase, red or personal castle banners, pre-made hudge statues, easy interface, small stockpiles, large maps, easy mining, more than a handfull of different jobs, large castles and towns, people coming and going from/for & out of town, and so on ... u can forget about it for the time being ) Aldo... if u are willing to look at the great potential, u are enough open-minded, patient and u can forget about comparing with other games such as "" banished""... This is your game... see how things grown, times changes, and little by little enjoy every single game news, a game that promeses freedom, ever changing, allowing u to face unespected challenges, from goblings and orcs trying to still your hard works fruts, or blackmail you, wolfs at the orthers of the enemy, misterious messages left giving you nice and strange quest, merchants with all kind of proposals, growing your own food, making your own tools and comodities, and thieves from hidden camps... Even zombies and skeletons as night walkers will come over ... So remember till a long way to go... a loooooooooooooooooong loooooooooooooooooong way to go... almoust bug full... but still a real diamond on it's way to glory, ready to outshine it's competitors... ;-)...

								As good as you'd imagine!Fun sandbox with defined purpose to expand. It isn't exactly as easy as one would think, which makes it enjoyably challenging. Hopefully as the updates come more features/objectives will be introduced to keep the replay value high; Goblin villages? Other human villages to compete with? Multiplayer PvP??? Only time will tell.It's not without bugs as there are plenty which include game crashes, engine crashes, ui crashes and the irritating building glitches. It's all worth the patience though with the cool and active devs and community that aspire to make the game as good as it should become. I honestly wouldn't imagine the game to be done anytime soon as there are many noticable features missing, but I'm sure they'll be filled in with time.More to reviewing to come with more updates and playtime.

								In short, don't get this... Yet. The main gamebreaking bug for me was that my class-based 'Hearthlings' did not do their tasks, instead being idle or collecting random stuff lying on the ground, followed by more idling. There are a small number of other core bugs at the moment, and it saddens me that I have to refund a game that has so much potential. If you're interested, follow this game, as the positive comments bestowed upon the devs suggest this will be getting fixes and content.Here's hoping I can change this review to positive in a few months' time.EDIT 14/08/2015Okay, so the things that 'break' the game are easily fixed: Craftsmen who don't work don't have the resources (although the UI as of yet does not tell you that, so your workers simply don't do the job). A workaround is to press 'i' to open your inventory and make sure you have what you need. The same goes for a building's requirements.And so, with that, I'm putting this up to a recommended.			"

								This game has such great gameplay and replay value.  It has been awhile since I have had a game that I played for so long straight.  The graphics are a bit light hearted and reminds me of the Settler games.  I will continue to play this for awhile.  Some reviews I have read are saying that you will only get a couple hours out of this game in its current state but i disagree.  i sat down at the computer with my 5 year old and she and I both had a great time for hours (of course we would pause every now and then, she is 5 :) )  It seems that the developers do listen to the users and allow ideas and active participation to go both ways.  Of course there are things I wish they would impliment and be quicker about it, but I am just a user trying to enjoy a game.  Thanks devs for creating something that has been done, but with a much better vision and implimentation.  Keep up the good work.			"

								Stonehearth is an amazing game and the developers at Radiant Entertainment do an excellent job of listening and responding to the player base as they move foward with Stonehearth, keeping players updated and giving them a say in mechanics and additions. That being said, Stonehearth is an EARLY ACCESS game, it is by no means complete. The essential game mechanics are in place, and the game is a ton of funas is, with the promise of adding content for a long time coming. The finished product will be an incredible game about sprawling civilizations and gameplay suited to your playstyle. As is, the gameplay is fun, and inviting, with a low learning curve and instant reward as your Hearthlings run around your small village, doing various tasks like farming, mining, building, trapping, masonary, carpentry... you get the idea. The goblin campaign is developing beautifully and the zombies are great combat fodder to boot. Bug will appear from time to time, but are rarely more than cosmetic such as a scaffolding not disappearing. This is a great agme, I enjoy the frequent uodates and new content as it trends more and more to a game I can pick up and play for hours.BUY IT NOW!!! "

								I really enjoy this game. The only main downside is the buggy game play and lack of certain features (lack of sandbox/god mode, automatic harvesting of lacking material when queuing crafted items, better item/building removal or maybe an error message if a hearthling can not do something because maybe there is no ladder or space to do certain actions). However, the game is still in ALPHA. So i am not too disappointed or bashing of the cons right now. There is so much potential and fun with this game. We get to do so much even though it is only alpha. Players get a large variety of promotable jobs and there are so many variety of jobs too. We get to fight goblins and zombies and build custom buildings. I am looking forward to playing the game through each big update and just loving the game more and more.			"

I've enjoyed the content very much and can't wait for new jobs to be added like maybe a fishing job for food or maybe some magical type classes healers ect.  Also more different types of mobs would add a very nice addition to the combat system.  Over all I recomend this game in it's current state and wait to see what's next.

								Stonehearth is a town building micromanager. If you like the idea of building a town from the ground up, harvesting resources, protecting your community, upgrading your village and leveling villagers to unlock more potential... this game is for youThis game... This isn't your usual early access. These devs are serious about bringing a quality game to the market. They don't want to take your money and run, they want to make a work of art for people to enjoy. Even in it's current state(no idea how many more updates are to come) it has gripped me - like no games seem to do anymore. I have played around 10 hours over the past two days and I'm pushing the limits of what is left to do, besides expand more. I will come back after more updates because at the moment I don't want to ruin the fun. It is more of a casual game at the moment, where you would play here and there. Not in 5 hour runs like I have done. I highly recommened buying and supporting the devs, it's seriously worth it!			"

								Ooof. First off I'd like to say I play a lot of early access games so I know to expect bugs and issues. You'll need that mind set for Stonehearth. For time's sake I'll just say there are ALOT of bugs still, some rather serious. There is almost zero in game help on how to do even the most basic game functions, thats ok it is a alpha stage game after all, but here's the next issue that finally made me have to turn the game off and write this review. When you look online how to do the super basic ABCs its old outdated infomation that no longer has any bearing with the current game. Assuming very few readers made it through all that complaining I'd like to end the review on this note, its still pretty fun (when you aren't pulling your hair out) and while the developers aren't pumping out updates like crazy they do seem to be plugging away at steadly which is more than you can say about a lot of early access.P.S. Bottem line is Stonehearth has a ton of potential and I'm glad I could support the developers. I just hope they keep working hard to make the game more stable to play.			"

								This game has to much ""potential"" and it seems like the devs do care and are working on it, the short time i have played it has been amazing. My only gripe's are the optimizing isssues and lack of content witch will both be fixed later(i assume) The only reason i say optimizing issues is because once you get 25+ ppl in your town and a few sky scrapers it starts to freeze alot. So far it feels like every encounter is balanced and the wandering traders feel real, my favorite part has to be the charm of the game tbh, it really takes survival and gives it  light hearted but still important role, some how to artwork really makes the game. p.s They should add a zone called ""priority"" so anything in that box is built,picked up,stored or mined out first.

Build what you want, survive, and fight to live another day. With updates and pacthes coming out at a great pace this game is always having new things added too the game with more and more to do. Also it is promised that multiplayer will be a thing in the coming future!			"

								In short, don't get this... Yet. The main gamebreaking bug for me was that my class-based 'Hearthlings' did not do their tasks, instead being idle or collecting random stuff lying on the ground, followed by more idling. There are a small number of other core bugs at the moment, and it saddens me that I have to refund a game that has so much potential. If you're interested, follow this game, as the positive comments bestowed upon the devs suggest this will be getting fixes and content.Here's hoping I can change this review to positive in a few months' time.EDIT 14/08/2015Okay, so the things that 'break' the game are easily fixed: Craftsmen who don't work don't have the resources (although the UI as of yet does not tell you that, so your workers simply don't do the job). A workaround is to press 'i' to open your inventory and make sure you have what you need. The same goes for a building's requirements.And so, with that, I'm putting this up to a recommended.			"

As far as i have known, i have been following this game for almoust 2 years, and i can´t say that a lot have change since, sooooo ...  if you are hoping for all the media arround ( big stunning monsters, castle gates, two or more floor buldings with a seemingly inside staircase, red or personal castle banners, pre-made hudge statues, easy interface, small stockpiles, large maps, easy mining, more than a handfull of different jobs, large castles and towns, people coming and going from/for & out of town, and so on ... u can forget about it for the time being ) Aldo... if u are willing to look at the great potential, u are enough open-minded, patient and u can forget about comparing with other games such as "" banished""... This is your game... see how things grown, times changes, and little by little enjoy every single game news, a game that promeses freedom, ever changing, allowing u to face unespected challenges, from goblings and orcs trying to still your hard works fruts, or blackmail you, wolfs at the orthers of the enemy, misterious messages left giving you nice and strange quest, merchants with all kind of proposals, growing your own food, making your own tools and comodities, and thieves from hidden camps... Even zombies and skeletons as night walkers will come over ... So remember till a long way to go... a loooooooooooooooooong loooooooooooooooooong way to go... almoust bug full... but still a real diamond on it's way to glory, ready to outshine it's competitors... ;-)...

The game is pretty solid, there is a tiny chance you get some bug unless you're playing the beta which is more buggy. You build, craft, farm, and survive attacks from the enemies. Although I want to see more classes in the game, the game is has its core built up already. I really recommend it for those people who like building towns, cities, or empires.			"

It already has a lot of great gameplay, great aesthetic, and a communicative dev team. All positives.Just needs better support for newer, high res screens. Seems to really bog down on 3k and 4k at native, despite the low poly nature. Probably just a low level rendering issue.			"

Early Access Review
								Hi there, I am playing Stonehearth since Alpha 5 or 6 I think - not regularly, but whenever a new alpha version comes out (which is roughly every 1-2 moneths).As all the posters before me already said, it has elements of a city builder, of RPG and visually connects to titles like Minecraft, Timber and Stone etc.What I like about this game is the cuddliness of the Hearthlings, which sets a very light tone. When my children saw the first fox to scratch its ears, I had to let the camera on the critter for at least ten minutes. Music is great, day and night cycle works fine, even monsters are cuddly in a way.If you are a hardcore strategist, you will probably miss depth in the skill tree and challenging campaigns to crush your adversaries, but if you love building, designing and a little melee fight every now and then, give it a try.Sure, there are a few bugs in the game, but hey, thats alpha, and usually they are fixed quite fast. Devs communicate a lot with the community via the forum, and each tuesday and thursday, they even stream their work, so you can look over their shoulders.I'm glad the game is in my collection - still a demo version would be nice to allow people to enjoy the ambience and understand what I mean.

I can not wait to see it fully released.There are some bad aspects so far for me, but they are not related to gameplay really. I get little lag spikes all the time that freeze the game up for a little while. While this is still playable, it's a bit annoying. I have not seen any other major things though, which is great.I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone that likes the city building genre games, such as Dwarf fortress or similar games.

Alpha 10.5: Pros and ConsPros-Fun and addicting gameplay-Charming voxel graphics-Decent soundtrack/audio (although a bit repetitive at times)-Excellent dev team and community-Surprisingly good mod supportCons-Extremely buggy-Quite feature lacking-Crummy performance at times (crashes, memory leaks, low fps)-Unoptimized for a lot of PCs-Hefty price tag for an early access gameAll in all, it's a great game with lots of potential.  Sure, the constant occasional bugs and lack of features is a bit annoying, but it's to be expected with an alpha game.  Definitely a game to keep your eye on - I'd recommend buying it if you've got $25 to spare, but otherwise you might want to wait until the price goes down and the game itself is more polished.			"

Early Access Review
								* I AM WELL AWARE OF THIS BEING EARLY ACCESS*      This game has a very interesting idea. I was so excited to get it, and build a city that flourished with Hearthlings I believe they're called. Right away I had issues starting up the game, and had to fix them with stuff that I usually don't do. Changing the compatability to see which one launches correctly. x64 bit doesn't work for me, and I'm pretty sure not for anyone else. Once I was able to launch the game I actually enjoyed the features I was getting to see and play with. I began to have a crashing issue. I still have this issue, and I turned my settings down, and it helped a little bit but it randomly crashes currently. The 3.5 hours I have on this game there's about a total of 45 minutes of solid gameplay. The other is just me starting it up and then figuring my second issue which is saving my game. I don't mind having the game crash as long as I can save before (they have an auto-save ability which is nice) and be able to relaunch and continue slowly but surely. This is the only game so far where I've had an issue that hasn't been resolved with trying every solution on the forums. Onward to the pros and cons (as much as I could gather). *THIS WILL CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT*Pros: -Ability to create/maintain a city -Having different classes of people you can promote your Hearthlings to-Being able to create custom buildings with a purpose of your choosing-Having the option to build into a mountain as a cave type way of living-Ability to trade with people who come through your town-Fighting mechanics with enemies-Auto Save ability Cons:-Crashes every 10 minutes or so (UPDATED)-Save does not work at all ( Pointless to play really ) (UPDATED)-Poorly optimized ( I don't a terrible PC but I am sure it can handle this game ) -Poor response time from anyone on the forums, both Steam and their forums ( Still haven't heard anything yet; It's been 4 days ) (UPDATED)     So all in the end I do NOT recommend this game, but this will hopefully change soon enough. I will edit the review accordingly. That's if I can get the help I need. As of 8/31/2015 the game was a waste of $24.99. The reason it's not reccomended is because I personally can't play it.EDIT (September 1st): After recieving help for my issues which they were nice about. I played the game a bit more. The game needs to ran in windowed mode to not crash and save properly. The game is actually good. As I figured before, but now I have seen it first hand. I do recommend the game. They are coming out with more features soon enough. For the money I think it's worth it when it's playable.			"

								Its a fun little game. Not much going on now, you build up a city and then eventually you get it to where you want it and restart, or monsters come in and kill all your people and you get annoyed and restart. It's a bit pricy at $25 which is a lot to ask for from a game ""in the works"" but I think the price tag is due more to the donors backing up the game than people actually paying for content. Either way this game is making good progress and honestly I am happy to pay full price to support this game and its development team. Pro: Game making good progress in developmentKeeps the public up to dateYou can spend hours and hours doing nothing but building the perfect cityHas the basics and some of the more advanced features already includedCons:Pretty repetative after a whileOnce your town is constructed theres nothing really left to doA few bugs (To be expected from Early Access)Price v content isnt the greatestOverall Opinion:If you want to support a game and its Development team, this is a good investment. There is no keeping people in the dark here, this is Early Access but you know where the game is going. The game is constantly being updated to include bigger and better things but currently if your going for content your overpaying. The game is a big time killer though so if your going for hours of gameplay this is the game for you.			"

								In short, don't get this... Yet. The main gamebreaking bug for me was that my class-based 'Hearthlings' did not do their tasks, instead being idle or collecting random stuff lying on the ground, followed by more idling. There are a small number of other core bugs at the moment, and it saddens me that I have to refund a game that has so much potential. If you're interested, follow this game, as the positive comments bestowed upon the devs suggest this will be getting fixes and content.Here's hoping I can change this review to positive in a few months' time.EDIT 14/08/2015Okay, so the things that 'break' the game are easily fixed: Craftsmen who don't work don't have the resources (although the UI as of yet does not tell you that, so your workers simply don't do the job). A workaround is to press 'i' to open your inventory and make sure you have what you need. The same goes for a building's requirements.And so, with that, I'm putting this up to a recommended.			"

								Finally! A Dwarf Fortress for people who want graphics and a simple interface.Easy to play, easy to learn, easy to enjoy.As a very easily bored person, the fact that I've played for so long even through weird graphics glitches and a single crash (the crash is why I have time to make this review before jumping back in) should be a sign that even in ALPHA with glitches and a handful of ""Oops, better start over"" moments, this game is AWESOME!I cannot wait for the next update, no matter what it is.If it's fixes, great!If it's new content, super!If it's both, OH BOY!If you liked or thought you'd like games like Towns or Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress but they're just too... Dwarf Fortressy: GET THIS GAME!			"

								So excited to see what else they will do with this game.

Overall I would definately recommend this game to those who enjoy City builders, group management, and RTS gameplay.			"

								Excellent game so far, still more work to do. Hop in and play for a few hours every patch. You'll get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it, and can always look forward to the next patch.When this is done, it's going to be a remarkable game. It already has a lot of great gameplay, great aesthetic, and a communicative dev team. All positives.Just needs better support for newer, high res screens. Seems to really bog down on 3k and 4k at native, despite the low poly nature. Probably just a low level rendering issue.			"

								I rather enjoyed this game, though, it can be rather buggy at times. Here's a fix to one of those bugs, actually. Press F5, should your menus dissapear, and after a moment, they should reset and come back into view. Now, that's said. This game is quite, quite enjoyable, if you're a fan of city-builder/resource gathering games, if not, you might not want to buy it. At full price, it might seem like a bit of a trap for the less wary, but, if you want to support the developers(and have a few extra dollars laying around.), it isn't that big of a problem. While I enjoy the game, it definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea. I would reccomend you do a bit of research on it before you buy it, to make sure it's any good for you.			"

								As a kickstarter backer, I've seen this game grow from a game where all you could do was watch your ""Hearthlings"" eat berries, to a game where you can grow your population, build magnificant structures (kind of :P), dig mighty caverns, and slowly build up your tiny 7 man town into a flourishing city. Despite the bugs that occasionaly break gameplay completely (at the time of writing this post the crafters stop working after a bit), I truly believe that the tiny dev team behind this magnificent little town builder will squash every bug and conquer every challenge that gets in the way. With things like multiplayer, new crafting classes, archers, town pets, mac and linux support, and many, many, many more good things coming, I see nothing but greatness for this game.			"

								Update 10/10/15 -  The game is really coming along and doing so a decent pace.  I actually think one of the coolest things for me is watching the entire game develop.  You don't log on for a few weeks and now you have a new class to try.  New enemies pop up.  I've definitely enjoyed this game already, despite some of the bugs.  Even in alpha, this game has a lot of positives to it.  You can see where they're going with the job system, and they make your units mattering, which is very different then some similar games I've played.  To give an example, you can't switch a unit to a shepard until it has reached lv. 3 as a trapper for the unit.  That makes things like goblin attacks actually matter, because your lone trapper in the woods will die.  It's little ideas and notions like this that make the game good.As some people have mentioned, the content isn't all the way there, with a large amount of the jobs missing, and several bugs that can be annoying. (units not finishing a house, i.e. laying the groundwork but not actually completing it.)Overall though I really enjoy the game so far and I would definitely recommend picking it up.  It's definitely shaping up to be a successful title.			"

								This is a really fun game, but other than the villagers being dumb and not finishing houses its pretty solid for me. Though right now I can't do anything because a few of them are either frozen in a pose or will be if they try to do something I tell them to. Still I would play this everyday and can't wait for it to be fixed more. Though I would rather play a endless mode instead of ending all your hardwork at a 1000 days.

								I'm in love with this game. Don't get me wrong, it's not fully optimized, has some glitches, and is nowhere near complete.... but the gameplay is right up my alley! I love the sandbox feeling but with still having some structure involved. I love that you have full control over city/town building but that the inhabitants actually physically carry out your orders and you don't control them directly! I love the cute art style and the class system, it's all great.My only beefs are some of the annoying UI and citizen pathing/building idling glitches but I just save often and freely use the console commands to delete problem objects. ALSO, this game is far from complete so don't expect to get anywhere close to 100 hours of novel gameplay out of it... that isn't to say that if designing custom buildings/towns are your thing that you couldn't put 1000 hours into it though. The devs do an update every Tuesday on their website so progress is being made towards expanding the game. It's awesome to come in now as it's slowly growing as opposed to all the disappointed Kickstarter campaign people who expected a completed game already.... but I'm not complaining.			"

								Overall Stonehearth is a good game with HUGE potential. First and most importantly, as of January 2016 this is still an EARLY ACCESS GAME.  If you want a complete game with all the bells and whistles then this is NOT for you. If, however, you don't mind playing a game while it's in development then you will benefit from playing Stonehearth.The game is playable but with it's not without issues. That's what the Alpha players are for; they find an issue, report it to the website and the developers get to working. (unless it's DayZ lol)Secondly, there will be updates!!! The more people to get involved the more WE get to influence the final outcome! To actually have some say in the development of a game is most excellent.So with that being said, here is a list of pros and cons, and these are PURELY my opinion.PROS:Stated before, the game has huge potentialEven in early access it is still very enjoyable, it has an adventure mode as well as a leisure mode.It allows you to actively manage and maintain villagers and their actions WITHOUT having to micromanage.The graphics and character types are reminiscent of Bomberman (Nostolgia effect if you like that kind of thing).Overall a good way to enjoy some downtime.Time control that allows you to pause, resume or speed up gameplay.CONS:Sometimes the villagers are OFP (Own F***king Program) and don't respond to what you tell them. Im not trying to raise a Tomogachi with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude, you know.The layout for menus seems to be counter-intuitive until you get the hang of them, once you go through the ringer you learn where the items/options are. Sometimes it feels like a ""Where's Waldo"" search when trying to close out a window.The Goblins... THE F**KING GOBLINS!!!! Their fingers are stickier than my keyboard. They seem to have an invincible leader that will absolutely annihilate your villagers. (Perhaps this is a good thing though).As the game progresses, depending on your equipment (IRL folks) the game could get some lag going on.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SummarizationThe game is still in alpha, so of course you will find an idiot who is quick to review and say ""Meeehhhhhh, the game isn't complete, it has bugs and i want my allowance back"". These people are either dense, ignorant or just didn't read the product before purchasing, OF COURSE AN ALPHA GAME IS INCOMPLETE. The more people who purchase, the more input and the more the CUSTOMERS get to influence the final product. I can think of several things that I want added and have read many other great suggestions as well. While the game has it's problems, these problems are not, by any means, fatal. Get involved or not. I do not feel like I wasted my money, and this is maybe the second game I actually took the time to review, so thats gotta say something.Overall I RECOOOOOMENDsorry bout that, sticky keyboard...			"

								This game is a fantastic city building RPG. This game has so much potential and I highly recommend playing this game and helping with the development. As a huge history geek I would really like a gunsmith (A footman with a gun). If the gun has to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ so it's not op that is ok. Maybe have a musket or something where you could engadge in line battles like in the American Revolution or the Napoleonic war. Also maybe add mud after rain so if you chose to build a trench, after guns, there could be the muddy expirience of being in a trench and Maybe it could lower mural?

								What to say about this game? Well its early access for sure. Is it fun? Yeah in the beginning. Then it just becomes blah. Dont get me wrong. Its similar to a re-vamped Settlers. Just the devs need to make more in game challenges rather then a few odd ball goblin attacks. PVP option? oh yeah. More military units? yes. The core of the game is brilliant. Making custom buildings is awesome. Graphics are great. Random maps are cool as well. So bottom line is it worth the cost? Truthfully atm no. A price drop or future update then I will say yes. But being a big city builder fan I am Im putting my faith in this. Hope devs dont let me down.			"

								Definitely worth the try guys. Game is a lot of fun and there is more to come it's not a complete game yet but the experience is still great even when not complete. I highly recommend giving it a try and sure there are bugs however, the fun experience outweighs annoying bugs(which is not that bad).			"

								This, is the game I truly looking for my entire lifeABOUT THE GAME AND ENGINE:this game, is a mix from minecraft x stronghold crusaders, my both favorite game. they have ""collecting resource"" that i like, and the most important thing, hearthling, i love to see my hearthling running everywhere, working, fighting, mining, crafting, etc., the AI is surprisingly smart, although sometimes they got stuck on something and i need to remove the furniture so he/she can back to work, also some bugs made their head misplaced, moving while sleeping, sleep standing, etc., it's hillarious tho XDABOUT THE GAMEPLAY:although I just played about 5 hours in steam record, actually I already played 48 hours. So you asking where did the 43 hours go? mostly because of bugs, all my saved village is gone, or after 3 hours of playing got some bugs that force quit your game before even saved, or sometimes the auto save didn't work, you guess what the cause...first few hours I played this game is only to figure out how things work, it would be nice if they added some tutorial, but the only tutorial they add is just simply how to move your camera and thats it. after I figured out how things work, I starting to build my own village, some were lost because of bugs, and it's really frustating. after building village, it's time to create my very own structure, because they just give a few model for house such as dinning hall and sleeping quarter. they said if hearthling move faster on road, so I created some, and and don't see any diffrent, but still worth it because now my village looks prettier.ABOUT GRAPHIC:I have the minimum requirement for this game, windows 7 32 bit, intel core i3, intel HD graphics 3000, 2GB memory, and still laggy. it would be nice if they add some graphic settings, so I can set it at ""extreme low quality"". I am into the game quality, not the graphic quality. mostly any game creator failed to understand this, and they failed to get more player to his game, only because quality problem. there is so many game that i liked to play, but got limited by graphic, this game is almost became one of it if they set the quality any more higherSo, after all my writing, now it's time for score, and the score is...........7/10, pretty nice for an early access gamealthough there's still so much bugs, this game still worth it, keep it up and i will give higher rating			"

								SO far Stonehearth has been an awesome game to watch as it unfolds. it has great potential and is fun to play as is. I can not wait to see it fully released.There are some bad aspects so far for me, but they are not related to gameplay really. I get little lag spikes all the time that freeze the game up for a little while. While this is still playable, it's a bit annoying. I have not seen any other major things though, which is great.I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone that likes the city building genre games, such as Dwarf fortress or similar games.

Alpha 10.5: Pros and ConsPros-Fun and addicting gameplay-Charming voxel graphics-Decent soundtrack/audio (although a bit repetitive at times)-Excellent dev team and community-Surprisingly good mod supportCons-Extremely buggy-Quite feature lacking-Crummy performance at times (crashes, memory leaks, low fps)-Unoptimized for a lot of PCs-Hefty price tag for an early access gameAll in all, it's a great game with lots of potential.  Sure, the constant occasional bugs and lack of features is a bit annoying, but it's to be expected with an alpha game.  Definitely a game to keep your eye on - I'd recommend buying it if you've got $25 to spare, but otherwise you might want to wait until the price goes down and the game itself is more polished.			"

								Well, I bought this game as a Christmas Present for myself.  I saw the trailer and thought it looked amazing, so so I picked it up.  I'm glad I did.As of now, Jan 21st 2016, Stonehearth is in an alpha state.  This means that features are not yet implemetned and the game is bare bones.  That said, it manages to have all the implemented features work well.  There is plenty of annoying things that happen, but the core gameplay is solid.  The bugs and glitches were relatively minor and did not destroy my experience.The developers for this game seem amazing, and they have weekly blog posts detailing the new content they developed.  They are in touch with the community and support the game, as opposed to many early access developers.  This is a great thing.  The art style of the game is fantastic, and the music is delightful.  The theme that plays when you turn on the game is great.This is the lightweight version of Dwarf Fortress that I have been waiting for.			"

								I'm only recommending this game because I'm a big fan of Dwarf Fortress and DF clones.  Stonehearth is a simplistic take on DF and Gnomoria.  I've yearned for an animated version of DF and I found Stonehearth so I had to try it.  So far, I'm impressed.The game starts by selecting your tribe, (only two for now) and then select your location (either a forest or desert, again...for now).  Your starting tribe affects your beginning workshop. (Wood or clay).Game appears to be VERY early release.  Too early for my likes, but it's addicting.  What I do like is to watch your little workers go to work, building scaffolding to build a building, chomping away at mining or defending your little outpost from the baddies.What I don't like is it's too easy.  The enemy AI is kinda wonders around your town until they decide to strike.  It seems when they spawn, they have a specific town member in mind to attack, then go for the target.  During my latest play through, I only lost one tribe member.  Only because he/she just cowered in fear as the armed goblin was slashing away.  Excellent defense if I must say so...fetal position and hope you get saved.  Overall, I'm not too impressed with the combat right now.I do like the experience aspect for your tribe members.  Example, when you finally unlock the blacksmith, he/she has to gain experience before they can make a better weapon or armor.  Same goes for most other work shop members.  I don't like the chain of jobs.  For example a trapper has to level up before he is eligible for a shepherd.  That doesn't make sense to me.  But that part of the game is not nearly finished, as many ""?"" fill the chain of jobs in the job screen.  I'm excited for this game and it's addicting to some extent.My biggest concern about the game?  Updates are slow.  Very, very slow.  I'm hoping development doesn't stop on this game.  (I'm looking at you ""Towns"").			"

Early Access Review
								I wanted this game since I saw a Youtuber called 'The Innkeeper' play it. He did a great series and I'm grateful now that I have the game. I only have a few issues though.For example I play this game on a laptop that runs quite slow and because it is difficult for me to customize and create my own buildings I use the templates. Unfortuntly there are only four to choose from which means that my town doesn't look very different since I have to use the same buildings. If there were a few more templates to choose from I'd be much happier.Also I think a good idea for the game to make it more realistic is to have children in the game. Like if your hearthlings could start families. I think that this would be good because I often look at the journal and a lot of the time it says that the Heartlings are enjoying their time here with friends and family. However there is no family connections.I think it would just be cute if your Hearthlings had personalities and could start their own families. It would also be a challenege in its own because obviously one of the parents would have to look after the child. If your Hearthlings could get married as well because as they get older and pass away their family carries on and you can get a real emotional feeling to your town knowing that they aren't just expanding with buildings or crafters but as like little indivisuals in your computer. It would also mean another job avaliable like a priest. He could marry the Hearthlings who want to be married. It would also mean that the Blacksmith could create rings, not only to sell but for personal use in the town.However when it comes to kids I don't mean that one day there is just a child there and you get a little notification informing you that there is one. I think that your Hearthling could get pregnant. Of course keeping the game PG so you dont see any of the nasty but it also makes it harder as well, especially since if you've just started and there is already a married couple with a pregnant woman, she shouldn't be able to build or do much work since she is with child. I do enjoy the game but I think that these adjustments would help improve the game because you'd be able to see each indivisual Hearthling grow.It also works especially well because everyone has to have their favourite Hearthling. It would also mean that there would be more journal entries, from crushes, to planning weddings or even finding out that one of the Hearthlings is pregnant. Because the Herbalist could check up on them to make sure that they're healthy. A lot like a midwife.			"

Well worth the $.11 classes, something around 100 items already, and designing buildings down to the individual brick. Even though its a little slow in pace and increasing population is tedious in that it takes forever to aquire new hearthlings. As far as alphas ive tested over the years this one is probably the best.			"

								When I first went into the game, it took me a few minutes of expirementing to understand how it actually works. Once I figured out the basics, I was hooked. I played it three hours straight and really found myself entertained.As I progressed, the game seemed to get buggier and buggier. I constantly had to restart and save to get the game to keep going. Eventually, the people weren't doing what they're supposed too and I had a lot of issues with building. Destroying items and moving stuff around proved to be a really big issue as well and eventually reseting wasn't enough to fix it.I really enjoy this game and I hope that these problems are fixed in the future so I can enjoy it even more. For people who are looking for a game with little to no issues, I reccomend you just follow it for now and wait for later realeases as it still has some large bugs that need to be fixed. Otherwise, I liked this game and I reccomend it.			"

								I've been a great fan of this game and I love the community aswell as the devs. They are helpfull, nice and honest. Stoneheart has come a long way since it was kickstarted . A lot of people enjoy it and love the way it is growing toward a full game release. I'm certainly gladd i bought this when it was still on there website for a better price. This doesn't mean i woudn't buy it now, I just mean that it's understandable to be paying this much for a game still in ALPHA. If you want to wait a bit longer to see more features than wait. If you can't wait to support a awesome game and the devs behind it and see the game grow its way to the top then buy it right now.8/10			"

								As good as you'd imagine!Fun sandbox with defined purpose to expand. It isn't exactly as easy as one would think, which makes it enjoyably challenging. Hopefully as the updates come more features/objectives will be introduced to keep the replay value high; Goblin villages? Other human villages to compete with? Multiplayer PvP??? Only time will tell.It's not without bugs as there are plenty which include game crashes, engine crashes, ui crashes and the irritating building glitches. It's all worth the patience though with the cool and active devs and community that aspire to make the game as good as it should become. I honestly wouldn't imagine the game to be done anytime soon as there are many noticable features missing, but I'm sure they'll be filled in with time.More to reviewing to come with more updates and playtime.

								Like any game in Early acces and in Alpha you should expect bugs.A voxel style sims with a unique rqg like aproche. This game has a lot of potential and i cant wait for the next update. With a long road map, the devs seem very active and supportive.personaly im sick of voxel style games but i love chibby art style the devs put on loading screans.like any voxel game you do expect a sandbox feel, and Stonehearth does not disapoint, if you can get passed the bugs.At a steep $25usd price point in alpha stages, its always a safe bet to wait for a steam sale. But if your interested in the game and want to watch the game evolve go ahead and purche.Overall the game has great replay value and the dev road map makes the game more promising.alpha11 20150827			"

								Even in the early stages, I'm finding Stonehearth to be incredibly addictive. Watching your Hearthlings build and thrive as you direct their actions is endearing. Though the characters are adorable, watching them slaughter adorable Goblins is great.Still, there are a few things that could be improved in this game. Keeping in mind that, as an Early Access title at this stage, there are improvements and features yet to come anyway. Regardless, here are a few things that I feel could be worked on:- The 'Build a Custom House' feature is in dire need of a more reliable 'Delete' tool. If the changes I wanted to make to an existing blueprint requires replacing something that has already been placed, I'm out of luck. I'd just have to tell my Hearthlings to undeploy an object and deploy the one I actually want there. (Like an improved bed.)- I would like to be able to either see a queue of actions and be able to to change the priority or simply have a click-and-drag tool to call the Hearthlings to a certain area to work on it right at that moment. I have seen far too many crops wither and die because they become neglected by my farmers. Not to mention, the buildings that become abandoned in the middle of construction because my workers suddenly feel that everyone mining at once is more important than finishing another wooden dining hall.- Please bring back the Name Randomizer for towns. I honestly liked seeing the sort of names built into the game and I'm horrendous with naming settlements in the first place.			"

								If you like building games with an RPG style for your citizens, this is quite fun. It's still in alpha state, but they working hard on it. I won't compair it with the most ambitious and genius builder game there is: Dwarf Fortress! If you do not know what that game is...you not really a building game fan...honestly you are an idiot if you do not know DF. But FF you are drifing offshore...- The style is a bit like Minecraft...everything is made of square blocks. It has it's charm and it's done very nicely. I even got some ideas from this game build in Minecraft.- The game has two kind of races and maps: Dessert and forrest. On the forrest map it's too easy, chop trees build wooden houses and mass produce wooden swords for trading. On a dessert map it's more difficult at start and you need clay to continue, build houses and so on.- The RPG element is limited: If an citizen has no tool equipted it's a worker, that digs,chops and carries stuff around. If you equipt a tool it gains experience for that class. To a maximum of level 6. This is done very easily and imo far too fast to gain a long live expancy of this game. You gain a special skill once you reach this level. If you pick another profession for that citizen after level 6, it virtually must reach level 7. Leveling up opens up different kinds of classes and items it can make. For instance, a farmer needs to be level 2 to become a cook. And a level 4 cook can bake bread etc. Also some experienced classes have a change to make a nicer version of that item.- Buildings are premade or you can design it yourself and even save them! This is great idea and very easy to use. Some bug here and there... If you want to change the colour of the walls, while the construction is already started, will leave the building unfinished. But I do not doubt they will get rid of that bug asap.- Interface is easy to use, you can select for every citizen what he/she must do. (like dwarf therapist for DF) You can look at the map several ways, closed buildings, half open or x-ray. Which are very good and handy to place items or mine.- To gain new citizens you need an amount of placed items and building and gold. And if you reach it on the start of a new day a new citizens will arrive. This is very cool and you will need to keep trading and building to gain new citizens. Also this amount will be raised once you reach it.So in overal it's very fun to play, but it's way too easy! (especially if you expect a difficulty of DF) Also you can reroll your starting villagers till they all have six for the 3 stats they have. If you save just before sunrise. So when an new citizen arrives you can reload if you do not want that one. It's ahs some bugs but very good support and most bugs are gone within a week. Now that's something other developers can learn something about. Combat is funny to see but enemies are again way too easy...even giant skeletons are killed one on one by your 1 lvl soldier with a wooden sword... So I hope there will be more challence. Also I miss interaction between your citizens, they are just walking around, eating,sleeping but there is no communication between them...that's something they must implement asap! Cause now it's fun but boring after a while. Ohw yes I want a trader that drinks too much or goes to sleep while the traders are almost leaving! I want citizen that gossips about another citizen or even falls in love...if they put that into the game...wow!			"

								Sims. Minecraft. Majesty. Elements of three games rolled into one for a combination that is... quite good. If I could make a pre-game suggestion, though, it would be to get your bearings in sandbox-mode first. The game isn't overly complex but it doesn't hurt to get a feel for the flow of things before attempting the more survival-esque side of things. That being said, it is a fun game and has appeal for nearly all ages (and is very family friendly).			"

								Stonehearth has come a long way very quickly and the frequent updates reflect this and show the devs aren't really going anywhere in terms of slowing down/stopping. They estimated the game would be out of early access within 8-12 months after launching in June 2015, so it is shaping up they will overshoot that target by quite a bit, but that's all pretty normal for game development.It's already very playable and the development team are clearly talented coders, but I recommend waiting until the release as that will offer the best experience, plus they will have multiplayer then (hopefully).

								I am really enjoying playing stonehearth, i've only just bought it as indicated by my low play time but really enjoying it. The concept isn't a new one but it has been carried out quite well. As it is an early access game you are quite limited to the people you can choose and the Biomes that you can play in but that is to be expected. If i was to make any suggestions for advancemt they would be as follows:1. Make more Biomes to release in later updates, hand in hand with this comes the creation of new races to play as. Wouldn't it be nice to have a snowy Biome whose native people are viking like? (no horned helmets please).2. Allow Hearthlings to make dedicated Fortifications, for example Guard Towers and maybe catapults. 3. When you dedicate a hearthling to become a soldier allow for different soldiering paths....for example an archer whom if you have a watch tower can be made into a permanent Sentry, watching over your Hearthlings as they work and protecting them from range.I hope this helps, and of course these suggestions are only my preference.Cheers.

								TL;DR Lovely game with problems, but highly recommended.This game is similar to Gnomoria, there are some important differences:- graphic is much better (I like retro graphic, but Gnomoria was too much for me)- game mechanics are simpler, or at least it is much easier to understand- buildings!!!I don't deeply know Gnomoria, so excuse me if this is not a correct list. In my opinion these were the three most annoying things in Gnomoria, so I was really happy when I found StoneHearth.Pros:- lovely graphic and atmosphere- the settlement looks pretty cool with all the interesting buildings- classes and abilities are interestingCons: - still alpha, so lots of features are not finished (I hope underworld will be improved, ores will not be just a random drop), there are bugs, balancing issues. But development is active, there are releases every week, so I don't worry much about these.- biggest issue for me are the buildings (this is in the same time the best feature of the game). So you first have to design the house (or use a template), and then your hearthlings will build it. First problem is that quite often they cannot build the house (this unfortunately happens with the templates as well). Second problem is that the game won't give you any warning or error message, the only thing you see is that the building is just paused. There are scaffoldings around the house, some walls are missing, but no one is doing nothing. I couldn't figure out what is wrong. The best thing I could do is that I built a few ladders here and there, maybe they were not able to reach some parts, but that didn't help. But the worst thing is that there is nothing you can do, you will have a half ready house with scaffoldings in the middle of your nice village. If you don't like that (I didn't) then the only option is to reload an old save where the building wasn't at all designed. That wasn't really a viable solution for me. There is a console command which erases a building, but it won't clean up the scaffolding, and also the base of the building will still be there (the hole in the ground). My feeling is that the devs were too optimistic about this type of building, I guess they think that there are problems, they can solve it easily for the next version, no need for error message or any tool which would help players work around a failed building. And then the next release comes, and there are still lots of buildings not correctly building. I think this is not a new issue, many recent releases had this. But I thrust them, I hope sooner or later they will be able to solve this, and players will be able to build a very nice village. "

								Stonehearth is a very fun and innovative twist on the classic city builder genre. Rather than only being given templates or static buildings, you can make your own. There are a lot of interesting details that make this game one of my all-time favorites.Pro's:1.) There is plenty to do, many playthroughs can last a long time. (My current play through has 95-ish realtime hours invested into it as of this review.)2.) There is plenty of strategy involved with this game, even with a town of 49, 15 devoted to Military, invasions can still be very threatening.3.) You can show off your creativity in this game,as stated above, you can create your own buildings, which is very nice to put your own unique touch on each village.4.) The job system in this game is very good, and the more time a hearthling puts into a job, the better payout you will have in the long run.5.) Despite being in Alpha, the developers have done a great job pushing out updates, fixes, etc.6.) This game is a lot of fun, even if you only plan on playing for an hour or so a day, you'll still make good progress in your town.Cons:1.) Hearthlings can get themselves stuck very easily, and it's important to keep a close eye on them when they're building structures, and if you aren't careful, they could starve to death.2.) Despite being given a job, often times hearthlings won't always perform that job, or task that's been assigned, and a restart generally fixes the problem.3.) The game has optimization issues. I have 32GB of RAM with an i7 processor and I still receive significant lag spikes.(granted this is with 50 Hearthlings, max graphics etc.) 4.) Difficulty ramps up but becomes static at some point, and if you're established, it takes a very significant misplay in order for your town to become in danger. (Currently I'm running 2 Knights, 2 Clerics, and 11 Rangers (all masters) with BiS gear.)5.) The invasions, generally speaking, are very predictable because invaders don't have much to throw at you that you can't deal with.Overall I give this game a solid 8/10. It's a very well-made game with a lot of love put into it by it's developers. There are a few hiccups with this game yes, but it's in Alpha, it's to be expected. There isn't a whole lot I would change about this game. And if you're on the fence about purchasing this game, you should, you can play this game to relax or to put conscious effort into it, either way, Stonehearth is a phenomenal game that deserves more attention than what it's received.

								Adorable art style in this city builder. Probably the BEST early access game i've ever seen. The developers issue with frequent game updates, and bug fixes. They do weekly videos discussing development. They actually read the forums and listen and respond to community suggestions/ideas and bugs! I feel spoiled by their game support as no other game company supports their products on this level. Recently they have added more combat and continued to improve the building functions. Plus there are some cool mods to the game! I just can't say enough positive things about the game and the studio making it. They game as of yet is unfinished, but i have no doubt with how well the studio has been doing with the title over the past year that they will finish it with the same level of quality that they have to date.

								Ive been playing this game cause its addictive like cocaine. Its ridiculous, but development seems a little ""stumped"". I'm sure the devs are able to get this game finished eventually.A couple things i would desperately recommend adding:The ability to assign homes to hearthlings, or rooms. OR make it to where only 1 hearthling can open up a certain door ( or just make doors assignable, like beds! ) Assignable relationships: ie; brother, mother, father, daughter, grandfather, etc.You should add a family tree type system and aging, so our town has a history and a fully stocked graveyard hahahaAnother thing is customization, i feel like our hearthlings are anchored to this Blue empire!Instead of adding factions we can play as, why not just make it to where we make our own factions? Custom colors / and at the beginning where you choose to embark, you can choose either the carpenter saw or the potters cutter.I also think you should make it easier for us to roll for citizens without wiping the entire colony at the beginning before embarking. We dont want all women or all men colonies, or a majority of either, which brings me to my next point!REPRODUCTION! I don't like the way we get new hearthlings! Daily update is very unrealistic, You should make it to where a male and a female hearthling are drawn to eachother, or you can choose who is in a relationship, and they mate in their own house/room and after a certain number of ingame days, a little baby hearthling pops out!A couple of other fun ideas, cause for me it seems like you guys have the potential to develop the game but are running out of ideas! Maybe im wrong, but i dont care! haha!queen beds that are assignable to 2 hearthlings (and bunk beds like this for barracks)more animalsmore types of placeable itemsmore jobsability to assign farmers to certain farms ability to assign patrols for footmenability to assign archers to the top of a wall ( to combat invading goblins )easier ability to become a dwarf-like fortress, because the 4x4 tunnel mining doesnt seem optimal for hearthlings in regards to space, which makes them so glum!You have a road builder, but how about an auto path builder? Like a worn dirt road.ability to place dirt on rock, or maybe PLANTERS. so that we can have indoor cave gardens, or farms on the mountain.			"

								As someone who has a high standard of gaming, I can say that there have been quite a few Indi games that have caught my interest only to never be fully developed. After playing Stonehearth, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is one of the best Indi games I have seen in a long time. Even in the alpha build, it's easy enough to understand, yet open enough to allow so many more options to be added. I cannot say how much I love this game, and the idea behind it.I will even go so far as to say that this is a game that NEEDS to be made. Speaking not only as a fan, but as a gamer. This is a prime example of people making games who truly love making games; and who can set an example to other game developers out there to stand by their work and see it through to completion. Radiant, I implore you to see this game through to the end. Not just for me, a single fan, but for all your fans, and all the Indi developers out there with uncompleted or unrealized games. Set a standard for Indi gaming, one that future generations can adhere to with pride.			"

								Ok so I played it for several hours. First, Ill start with the fact that the game is amazing. I realy like games where you build a city but in this game you have freedom to build the city as you like. Starting from editing the houses and buildings to naming each member of the city.Now, I think the game is a bit too buggy. For example, I ordered one of the crafters to craft 3 weapons, and he built only one and then he forgot his job and just wasted my time.I realy recommend this game for anyone who like games like SimCity, Banished, ZooTycoon, or Dwarfs. This game has so much to it and its only an alpha. This Is one of the few games which worth more than twenty bucks. And if multiplayer system comes out its gonna be the BEST GAME EVER.			"

								Minecraft + City Builder = StonehearthI took a chance on this early access game. As others have commented, it does have it's bugs. Since the game is still in Alpha, this is to be expected. All I can say is, save often. So far the game has been charming and fun. I enjoy city building games, but have never seen one this small and quaint. It takes the creativity of a game like Minecraft and gives it direction. It isn't the most challenging game and focuses more on imagination and less on hair-pulling micro managing. I am glad I got it and I can't wait to see what other features they add.  "

								Stonehearth is a great game and needs more recognition, but it needs work and fast. There are some problems that occur every time i start over and its not consistently the same problem, like sometimes it'll be that the hearthings wont build a house or craft when told to and sometimes they wont pick up any minerals or resources and will stay idle,  the problems can also expand to the heads of the hearthings shrinking down to their feet and floating around as if theyre midgets or levatate as if they were laying down. Although glitchy at times, its very fun and unique with every time you play. I hope I get to see a lot more content from this game and bug fixes ;), hope to see an update soon :)			"

The graphics are also nice, I expecally like the style for the characters/monsters/npcs. Edit:also there are already a few mods, 3 for the minute I took to find them, this could lead up to a big amount of mods! As a side note the game will at some point have multiplayer! That means you can build with friends, and then destory them with a army! :3			"

								It's unplayable for me. Everytime I get into the game, it works fine for a few minutes and then the screen goes black. The game is still running ( I press escape and the menu sound plays, I can hear my villagers working) but I can't see anything. I saw this game on youtube and was excited to play but I guess I'll have to wait for an update...EDIT: Well, I've been playing for several hours now and while I can't say that I have completely resolved the issue, I've managed to reduce the number of these crashes by playing mostly in the  'slice' view. Not sure why that works but anyway it is a good game for early access.EDIT 2: Been playing for a few days now and it seems the issue had nothing to do with wheter I'm playing in slice mode or not. I switched to the 32 bit version and I have not experienced the crashing anymore. However I have noticed a ton of ""UI errors"" that keep popping up during gameply. That aside, I still recommend this game and think if people are willing to look past the little issues here and there, this game is AWESOME! Can't wait until it is completed!			"

								While still a bit buggy (what can you expect from early access, right?) this game is fun, and a good time killer. Some of the recent updates have introduced food going bad (be careful of production, consumption, and cooking!) and better pathing support for your hearthlings (workers) so they freak out less when multiple things are going on.A little bit frustrating when you want to custom build some awesome buildings, especially with multi-story buildings, but you can have them build basicaly whatever strikes your fancy. It's like minecraft, but you manage a town full of minecrafters, instead of being one. Deal with extorting goblins, angry wolves, thieves, and the occasional raid by the undead, all the while making sure everyone is well fed, housed, and your soldiers get the best armor and weapons.I can't wait to see more updates - unlocking all the jobs, building y castles and towers (without having to stage things floor by floor) and the implementation of magic, it seems?Worth the money and the time!

								 pretty awesome game where you take control of a town of blocky individuals, who can take on quite a few different roles depending on their stats. They build buildings, mine, and craft items. If you want a game that is cute and you can design your own buildings and control a little town then this is the game. That said, there are some glaring issues I see with it. The whole way you design a new building is in my opinion quite badly done, you can't choose how high you want the walls and they are all encompassing, so you can't really have a 3 walled kind of thing. The main issue with it though is once you've designed a bulding, and then set it to be built you cannot edit it or demolish it. You'll need to use a console command just to do so, which is far from ideal. So the building system is:-Kind of basic, it really could be a lot more in depth, maybe being completely single block placement designing instead of the parts and pieces you can choose from. -Dodgy. I didn't like that I could only ""undo"" something, instead of having a proper deletion tool, the erase tool only seems to work on slabs and furniture. This can be frustrating at times. What's even more frustrating is slabs can actually clip through items and it does look quite terrible, but you don't notice it 'til the building is fully built, thus having to either deal with it's glitchy look, or demolish the entire building using cheats. The building system isn't the only thing that is annoying about the game, the mining can be just as annoying sometimes. Say you wanted to have a mined out grand hall in a mountain. Now though it may be difficult to see the ceiling in this game due to the camera being physically incapable, you do notice that the ceiling of a mined out area is quite low. If you want to have a higher ceiling it's near impossible to accomplish. Because of the fact you can't look up at the ceiling you can't select it to be mined, and even if you can the hearthlings have a great deal of trouble doing so. I planned on making a tunnel just over the room I wanted to heighten the ceiling of and one of them got stuck on a single block. So either players will need to have foresight or ingenuity to raise the roof or the devs should add a horizontal slice mode perhaps, which really would make my dwarfy self and brethren happy. Combat is quite great and the hearthlings themselves are pretty good at most activities. Though whenever they run away from battle it's only for 1 second, at which point they forget their♥♥♥♥♥kicking and return to fight the giant ogre they have no chance at beating. I'd suggest having proper retreats, perhaps to safety zones if the hearthling needs to run from battles, it would make micro managing them a bit easier. SPEAKING of micromanaging and combat. It at least for me is kind of unintuitive. Having groups is fine and all but then I have to select the combat tab, select the group, select what I want them to do and then send them off to do it, which is quite tedious. It's such a simple game yet so mindboggilingy hard to control at times.it really is a good game apart from these few things which make me almost pull my hair out sometimes, but that's probably just me. And it is in early access, hopefully they iron out all the bugs and the terrible building system in future. Otherwise there's alot to love about the game, and I think I'd recommend it at this time due to the devs updates, hopefully they continue to or I'll be changing my mind.			"

								The cure for your heartbreak about abandonware. Stonehearth keeps getting better. It's good as it is right now, and has potential for even more. It is adorable, humorous, and ultimately relaxing despite butting up against the occasional flaw. While still in alpha stage, the developers go to great lengths to try to keep the community happy, and that shows. Harvest, mine, build and farm, care for your little Hearthlings and protect them from the harsh world beyond. Grow a community and help them play to their strengths. There's very little I could ask for in a little town sim like this beyond fulfilling the potential of their intriguing skill-tree, and as I've followed this from early alpha that's exactly what they've been doing. When I started there were barely any jobs on that tree available, and this game was still a lot of fun. Now it's well on its way to being filled in completely, and every new job has enhanced the game experience. The flavor elements like dialogues and encounters keep getting more amusing, and the whole game just has a lot more character than any of its competition on Steam. Crashes are variable, and they've implemented various means to limit the crash potential (such as being able to self-cap the total population, turn off lighting and shadows, etc) for those who are weary of restarting while awaiting the next patch. Animation bugs are sometimes hilarious but rarely game-breaking. Hearthlings still get stranded from time to time, but we're given console tools to help keep them from starving to death in unreachable places. It's easier to take these moments with good humor even when they do die. Even potentially game-breaking bugs don't seem all that bad when you can trust the team to respond. So far, I trust this team. All in all one of the most caring, courteous developer teams I've ever encountered in beta testing, much less alpha-- and I fall for 'early release' far too often. This one redeems my faith in the idea. Glad I bought this early and got to see the result unfold.Definitely worth our time and attention. This is not a game to miss.			"

I love the periodic invasions you get to break the monotony of just simply building and creating.  I also love how they added the option of being in a desert compared to the forest setting of pretty much everything else.  I hope one day they will add a jungle setting as well, here's hoping!			"

								This game is like a previous game but 2.5D called ""Towns"". You lay claim to some land and thriving place were your villagers can live without fear of the zombies, goblins and anyother terror that can come from the woods.I seriously think this is a huge step up from anyother type of AI run villager system too. They seem to have been able to make it smooth and also the villager AI are very smart and intuitive. If they have some wood with them, and are trapped in a whole they will build a ladder to get out. Also when you ask a worker to make somethings, or a traders person to make a specific item, they actually do it and don't just eat all day like other AI villager systems I have been subjected to in other types of games like this.For a Alpha this is a very good start even in somecases almost close to a beta when it comes to graphics and gameplay. It does however need the rest of its trade's classes made in it and also some tweeks when it comes to eqiuping villagers with trait specific items that are already in the game. Example, better clothes to increase your worker speed. Can't and don't know or atleast haven't found a way to equip it. This holds for almost all items. The ones it doesn't are the items needed to change the job of your villager.All in all this is a awesome alpha in my opinion but the price seems high for a alpha when the finished product isn't made yet and could possibly be a few months to a year away.

								I've been following the production of the game since their kickstarter launch and it was the best kickstarter I've backed! They're continuously updating their game and have a great contact with their community.About the game, it's still a bit thin! The growth however is exponentional. Would recommend! "

								""How beauteous mankind is! o brave new world that has such people in it""William ShakespeareStoneHearth,Is it in early access? Yeahis it buggy? Ooooh Yeahis it worth buying now? Hell yeah!this game is a quant little trip in a world that feels like it was pulled right from the pages of an old fairy tale, with a gentle graphical feel that ties the whole feel together. now its not with out its kinks as all early access games do that controls can sometimes not work, games can crash, saves can be lost and my favourite villiager's heads can become their feet. However with an update fairly reguarly bugs like these can be ironed out in a mater of hours. do I think you should buy Stonehearth? Yes, as by all rights whats to say the game on final release doesn't rocket up and up to $50 for a time. I say buy the game now, have access to the updates the day they happen and play the game as it grows like the city you create.  will you create a quant little farming villiage, a Hamlet by the lake. a city of forrest dwellers or will you create a grand castle overlooking a town? Get Building. The Hearthlings are waiting8.8/10			"

								I would definitely recommend this Game and here is why:Since I bought it, around October/November 2014 they have added a good few things. People think that Character Models and Code just appears when the Developer wants it too. Character Models and Code take time to create, then you have to bug fix whatever you screwed up or isn't going the way you want.So far they have released a new Alpha nearly every month with at least one new feature (Class, enemy, Campaign, Water, etc.) they are following what they want the game to be and add what interest the Gamers who have bought the game up till now.Every Wednesday and Friday at about 2/3 am the Developers will have a Live Stream of what they are currently working on. Sometimes this will be boring to most like writing Code and sometimes it will be something fun like creating a new Splash Screen.The Developers are definitely working hard on this Game to make it what we (US AND THEM) collectively want!

								Ah Stonehearth, a game that I have been following since alpha two and for some reason decided to buy it now instead of before. I have seen Stonehearth as a game where you could build a house to being able to raid goblin camps, craft varius items such as a rabbit toy and more. As its still only alpha its limited but you can find pleanty of things to do. As developers Raidiant entertainment frequently update and listens to what the players want. Unlike some studios.... *cough *cough Sauropod studios.The employes also have a few years of experience in the software industri so they know what theyre doing, and have shown that over and over again. As this has been the more serious part of the review here comes the funnier part.Had lots of black immigrants, made them all farmers while my white guards patroled nearby. 10 out of 10 would racism again.Made my workers live in a cave.Zombies and skeletons spawned inside.Sealed it of and let everyone die.10 out 10 would communism again.Whenerver a worker class wanted to eat I sent to a defense flag.Only my promoted villegers got to eat.10 out of 10 would capitalism again.Promoted a villager to a footman.Fought plenty of battles won all of them with some other guys.He always went behind teh enemies and never took one for the team.Raiding goblins with wolves raiding my village.Demoted all footman except him.Got eaten by two wolfs and got his head smashed in by a goblin.They killed everyone in the village.Worth it.10 out of 10 would be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again.

								i've had this game since before early access but these develpoers are so trusty and have added so much to an amazing game that it definately deserves a 10/10 . i've been checking in with the developers since december 2013 and i have to say that before that the game was unplayable. Now it has tons of new stuff; a campaign, animals you can trap, farms you can have, raiders that will make your day miserable, skeletons and zombies now walking around jumping people they see, better ai and ui than ever before, not many bugs, new developers. The developers are very nice, they answer peoples questions and do livestreams every tuesday and thursday to add stuff in that the viewers recommend like the skeletons and different looking mushrooms like when we joked about it looking like cheese with Tom.

Early Access Review
								Let's get this out of the way up front: I'm not in a hurry to try Early Access games after some of the stuff that's happened with those. (It's a shame for the good ones that the stink of the bad apples has rubbed off.) So I resisted getting Stonehearth for months. That Early Access tag made me avoid spending money on it, even though a friend of mine couldn't shut up about it and it did look like fun. (And cute. Have you seen the Geomancer loading screen/concept art thing, with the bunnies? Adorable.)  In fact, I dithered for SO long, that same friend got me the game as a gift. (You rock, friend, thanks again!)I played it. And I played it some more. And some more...Okay, I can admit when I was wrong. Alpha or not, Stonehearth is fun.It's exactly what I needed to scratch that itch I get when playing Minecraft and longing for a sense of greater purpose within the game. In Stonehearth, that purpose is building and growing your settlement and becoming a proper town, but it's still sandboxy enough to suit my desire to proceed at my own pace and wander off onto side projects (while being mindful in monsters-on modes that the monsters don't wait for you to finish that building project you're working on). If not set to monster-free Passive, the secondary purpose is making sure your Hearthlings and their property and goods don't end up in the backpacks and bellies of equally-ambitious (or just flesh-hungry) monsters. You can outfit and train them to better their chances of survival, and build wisely to make the settlement more defensible. Stonehearth does have micromanagey elements, some of which are more so than others as Hearthlings can be dumb as rocks sometimes. Workers build ladders when commanded to do so, but don't expect them to think to do this on their own after they've mined themselves into a hole. You'll find them gazing mournfully at the sky as they slowly starve to death, rather than digging themselves out of the hole or building a ladder. I expect this will improve somewhat as the Alpha progresses. In the meantime, prior proper planning prevents pathetic pixel-death, as does the occasional head count to be sure nobody's stuck on a floating ledge you were trying to clear, because they dug their way away from the ladder. Now, Stonehearth IS Early Access Alpha, so there are optimization problems, crashes (so far only one crash-to-reboot, not bad on my unimpressive PC), game freezes (quite a lot of those -- save early, save often, turn Autosave on. If you play multiple playthroughs and turn Autosave on, you should know that while you can make lots of separate manual saves,the game won't make separate autosave slots as far as I can tell. If the game crashes and your last save was an autosave, load it and manual-save it before switching to your other playthrough).  There are bugs, and things not implemented yet. (FE: I accidentally manually saved just as the game autosaved. That manual save was stuck perma-Paused even after restart. The Autosave was OK.)Potentially spoilery bit to follow, with workaround: Pet feeding is an example of a work in progress. I made a bunch of rabbit food before discovering that the current kinds of Cook-crafted animal food are apparently for Farmer-raised rabbits, not the pet animals Trappers can tame. Pets don't get food out of storage bins, nor could I find a way to get food out for them or make my Hearthlings feed them. So I had sad hungry bunnies hopping around begging for food with no way to feed them. I made a pair of small fields with a row of ground storage in between, so my Farmers would leave a little harvested food where the pets could get at it. The raccoon seems to prefer meat, so I put a couple of squares of storage near a nearby trapping area as well. It works, but it's exasperating; welcome to Alpha. *(I'm told that pet kibble is in the works to resolve this problem. Looking forward to it! Hungry pets are sad pets!)--(/end spoiler-type-thing)--So, stuff is not fully implemented/tweaked, or not in yet, as is to be expected in Alpha, although it's looking pretty solid so far. The game WILL sometimes freeze or crash, because Alpha. And like any Alpha, there's always the chance that a meteor will strike Earth and support will stop. So far so good, though, looking at the update history.The fact is that even with the game freezes, Stonehearth has been really fun to play. It has multiple modes, including two different biome types, and a Peaceful option if you want to just play and build, and not have cute little monsters come stomp through your town. Having played both monsters-on and monsters-off, I like both so far; my most stalwart Hearthlings became the town guards, and aside from an incident where I regretted giving one a two-handed weapon because he was taking too much damage without a shield, they're mighty and courageous in defense of the town. (Spoiler-ish/Test pending: going to see whether I can use the destroy object option to ditch a weapon once it's equipped, as it looked like held weapons can be selected by clicking on the weapon in the Hearthling's hand. There seems to be no way yet to instruct them to ""downgrade"" to sword and board from a higher-damaging, two-handed weapon. I didn't want to revert to an older save, so I worked around that by granting Halberd Boy a knighthood, which forced him back to sword and shield. Item deletion would waste a few gold worth of metal, but beats losing a sturdy and courageous Hearthling as monster chow if promotion isn't workable at the time.)--(/end spoiler stuff)--Performance-related stuff:  Because of my less than awesome computer, I'm leaving my more advanced saved Stonehearth games to pick up later on, or start over, as at around 20 Hearthlings and a sizable hoard of goods, my PC begins to make emphatic complaints about running the game. (More frequent game freezes, flickering menus, framerate problems.) That's actually not bad for a game that only just had its first big optimization effort, on a computer that's several years old and was mediocre when it was new.Stonehearth is cute witout being too much so, Minecrafty without feeling like an attempt to capitalize off of Minecraft's popularity. I like Minecraft for the design-and-build stuff but it does make me long for a sense of direction I don't need to make up for myself, sometimes. So the feel of ""Minecrafty elements and freedom, but with purpose besides that which I invent"" is something I really like about Stonehearth. It has more of an ""adventurey"" and ""questy"" aspect in ways that are fun and useful, and hopefully will continue to balance sandboxiness and RPG-osity. I like the ""from a far-off land"" trade-quests, as far as ""useful quests"" go. Hopefully they'll make quests/merchant alerts/attack alerts stay onscreen longer or fold into an openable alerts menu. Unless I'm missing a way to call them back up again...? It's a little too easy right now to miss one because it came up while I was in the middle of something, with 3 other menus open and a placeable object on my cursor, or a gang of zombies trying to eat my Hearthlings' brains. More stuff to add to a future feedback post!I realize that this post's mentions of Alpha issues may read like damning with faint praise. It's not meant as such, I enjoy the game a lot. But it's Early Access, so, better forewarned and forearmed. If you can deal with the expected hiccups of Alpha and the facts of Early Access, I recommend it. Have fun building your township, as well as helping an already fun game improve!Oh, and, watch out for those pesky Goblins.  ;)			"

								I bought this game having high hopes for a sandbox where i could create just about anything i could imagine. I was not dissapointed. At the time of this review the game is still in early access which means that it is not a complete game. Knowing this, be prepared to encounter bugs and glitches that haven't been quite ironed out yet. Dont buy this thinking its a full finished game yet, because its not.Here are a few pro's and con's of the gamePro's Fairly constant updates which allow for new mechanics and bug fixes to be addedTwo types of biomes to choose from each varying in different main resourcesbuilding templates to help you if you need themA quest sysyem, currently rather short but i beleive they plan on expandingdifferent classes for you little villagersthe game has nice music and a very nice art styleConsSometimes the ai of the viligers can be a little wonky causing them to get stuck oftenBuilding can sometimes be a pain because sometimes they glitch and wont get finishedthats honestly all i can think of for cons at the momentOverall i really enjoyed this game and i would recomend it to anyone who can deal with a few bugs and crashes now and then. Make sure you put the autosave option so if it does crash you dont lose all your progress. This game has a lot of potential and they are adding new aspects to it with every update. "

								STONEHEARTH:  EARLY ACCESS GAME w/ GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!Voxel Building, Crafting, Exploring, Surviving.. all around fun time SINGLE PLAYER game... My son bought this game, showed it to me and I secretly giggled and thought; I'll never play that game... then a few weeks of watching him play... yep you guessed it... I bought the game and then I really liked it!!  That 'simple' looking game kept me busy, on my feet, alert, paying attention, building, crafting, fighting, exploring, mining, and moving upward and onward to bigger and better things.  I was addicted. Hooked almost instantly upon loading.  This game does not come without its quirks, but what I can say after over 200 hours of gameplay is that I am not slowing down anytime soon.  The Community here is great, friendly, and upbeat... they listen to their peoples... they are active and upfront on a daily / weekly basis check out their YouTube channel... follow them all on Twitter, and keep up to date on Facebook... the Tube is the best spot to keep up to date weekly on new things being implemented, new designs being worked on and other peoples builds... not to mention Twitch *thumbs up there* and GitHub.  EARLY ACCESS GAME: Please look up and understand the full meaning and understanding of that term before purchasing.  I can say though the developers are always working on correcting, fixing, helping, and adding new things all the time.  GOOD SUPPORT TEAM HERE!			"

								Interesting game. It feels like a love child of Banished, Sims, and Minecraft. This is quiet a  fun game. Difficulty starts racking up later in the game and I even got sad when my stone mason was brutally murdered by invaders. In this game you start out with about 7 settlers and build up a small village. You later can get access to raid goblin camps and get some nice loot from them. My only problem with this is it crashes pretty often. It seems counter-intuitive but whenever it auto saves and I have a hotbar open, it freezes my game and I lose my last 5 min of progress. Other than that it is a damn fun game, I just hope they get around to finishing it.			"

								I been watching this game ever since it was on kickstart, and now it came to steam and it is better than what I thought it would be. Even in early access the game is missing features, mechanics, and it's many bugs it is still very enjoyable experience. I highly recommend game it's very addicting and fun experience.			"

								Stonehearth borrows many aspects of minecraft and dwarf fortress to make an excellent city builder/survival game, and while it isnt nearly as polished as the games it takes after, it has an amazing amount of potential. The devs are very dedicated for such a small team and do livestreams 2-3 times per week, actively listening to and acting on feedback from the community. The game still has a ways to go before becoming an excellent game, but updates are very frequent.			"

								Update 10/10/15 -  The game is really coming along and doing so a decent pace.  I actually think one of the coolest things for me is watching the entire game develop.  You don't log on for a few weeks and now you have a new class to try.  New enemies pop up.  I've definitely enjoyed this game already, despite some of the bugs.  Even in alpha, this game has a lot of positives to it.  You can see where they're going with the job system, and they make your units mattering, which is very different then some similar games I've played.  To give an example, you can't switch a unit to a shepard until it has reached lv. 3 as a trapper for the unit.  That makes things like goblin attacks actually matter, because your lone trapper in the woods will die.  It's little ideas and notions like this that make the game good.As some people have mentioned, the content isn't all the way there, with a large amount of the jobs missing, and several bugs that can be annoying. (units not finishing a house, i.e. laying the groundwork but not actually completing it.)Overall though I really enjoy the game so far and I would definitely recommend picking it up.  It's definitely shaping up to be a successful title.			"

I like to still be able to give my hearthlings a task in general and let them do it or some work that is more important. But it would be easier for the combat units.Horse cartsMore animalsShipsOnline cooperative play. Maybe PVPAmbient soundsGates and bridgesFires maybe have a firefighter professionStationary weapons like a balistaA school?Make your own religion or non-religion. Just something to make your own culture it would be a whole lot more customWeatherAnd I really want to see hearthlings being able to start a family and breedingI like it being a survival game. Please don't -unlike other titles (COUGH STARBOUND)- become an RPG game. Great game I love it. Good luck!			"

								While still a major work in progress, StoneHearth provides a great experience. While primarily a strategy/resource management game, it also has the look and feel of popular voxel style block games. Also, it has elements of RPG that many town builder games lack.However, the game, as previously stated, is still a work in progress. The updates seem to take forever to be released and the game is riddled with bugs. I hope the game designers can pull together and really get some work done. I would love to see a finished product within the next year, though i currently doubt it.			"

								Boy this game has grown so much since it was first released in to Alpha.  It's like if you took Minecraft and Banished and put them together this is what you get.  Really fun Building game with some cool twists.  The different jobs you can assign your people is a cool way of making your village feel authentic.  Building little shops and such.  I also like that you can just play in peace, build and grow, OR you can play with invading goblins and things.  I read a lot of the negative reviews and just didn't understand what they were expecting in an Alpha game.  It's already great game and is only getting better!PROS:-Fun and decently replayable-Quick to get in to (You don't need hours to have fun)-Custom buildings and different material for a nice unique feel every time you play-Invader Mode and Peace Mode-You can put the town Militia into different groups-I could go on...Cons-Alpha and all the things that come with it...

								A very promising city-builder game. As of this review, it's still on its alpha version, so expect bugs. I get my hearthlings stuck here and there when mining and I've always got to put a ladder to ""rescue"" them. It's annoying. I hope they fix that. Here's what you get:Hearthlings - a collective name for your citizens. In order to gain more citizens, you've got to make improvements to your town to reach daily goals. Hearthlings have stats, and depending on those skill points, they could be suited to a particular job/task. It's still up to the player to assign what kind of work a hearthling would be doing, though.Enemies - you can get attacked or stolen by enemies. It's funny to think that these enemies could have their own camps/towns, too. I haven't played enough to the point of seeing a very good ""monster town"". But defeating them, you can pretty much loot their things.Resources - it's either you buy your things or you craft them from your own hard-earned materials. To get your raw materials and craft them into something else, you've got to rely on your hearthlings.Build Mode - there are a few building blueprints you can choose from and these pre-existing blueprints depend on your hearthlings' ancestry. Heck, if you don't like them, you could always customize your own! As your crafters become more experienced, you'd get to see new items you can use for building your buildings. So, it's not all laid down for you. I find that neat. We'd probably see more items for buildings as the game grows. It's unfortunate that once you finished constructing a building, you can no longer edit it. :(Quests - just a few, really.Opportunities for Trade - these pop out randomly as messages? You could always refuse if you don't like the deal. I wonder if we could have other towns to trade resources with? Even enemy towns? Haha. That'd be neat.Hmmm... I don't know if I've got everything down but those are the features I remember as of now. Anyway, you should check this out! "

								Stonehearth is a fun town building game with some performance issues that are slowly getting patched out. You start with worker settlers until they slowly become more specialized. Your worker settlers will build houses that you design (or one of like, five prefabs) where they will live, and eat, and get massacred by goblins if you are a noob like me. Even in the game's current state I can recommend it for the price they are asking.On top of all of the gameplay features, it really makes you realize that you have been taking the autosave feature in about every other modern game for granted when windows decides it wants to shut down your computer to update, and you lose 3-4 hours of progress. SAVE OFTEN. Or you will regret it.EDIT: I just realize that there is a periodic autosave function that is disabled by default. Disreguard the 2nd paragraph.			"

								My only other experience with this genre is RimWorld. I really enjoyed that game but there was something missing from it for me. I think I found it in this game and that's design. I won't try to compare the two games that much but its just going to happen. +Pros++Personalized building designs that allow you to create your own buildings from scratch +Job progression through experience working with certain tasks (ie. a Farmer can become a Cook once they reach level 2 and have the necessary tool)+Progression in the fact that you will be approached once your village becomes big enough to establish yourself as a town. You even get rewards for it( Edit: Tier 2 building templates, Tier 2 Random vendors, TIER 2 BGM!! )+Random events that aren't too overpowering(on Medium difficulty) ++Bonus point for a goblin wanting some of my stuff then actually getting mad and attacking me for not letting him have it-Cons--With cons I have to get nitpicky and this is where my RimWorld comes into play. Trust me I know its still EARLY in developement. Edit: A serious Con for me but I know its just a bug and bugs will go away but since it's happened more times than once is this: You build a building. You put items in that building, chests, beds, etc. You get down to the last piece you want to put in the building and you get a stacking error where the outline of the piece goes into the building but that's it. The only fix I have for it? Save the current configuration of the building, name it whatever you want, and destroy the building and start over. Its a bit frustrating but once this gets fixed I'll edit this part out.-Not being able to combine same stockpiles into one larger pile. You have to create multiple piles in order to cover an area. -I think it needs a layout tool so you can put grids on the ground so you can plan out your village a bit better. I've just been using stockpiles with it set to none but a simple layout tool would be awesome. -Not being able to edit buildings after they're built. I'm sure there's a reason for it but for the life of me I can't see it. Even if you limit the options of editting like floor and wall color. I don't think we should have to tear down the building because I want a new coat of paint on the walls.For the Cons section, I truly had to reach deep within my nitpickery to come up with personal negatives. I can get over those things rather quickly honestly.All in all this game is amazing for where its at. I want this game to keep continuing in its production and I will support it any way I can until its fully developed.			"

								While still in development, this game is great. The building style gives a great look to the cube constructed buildings. Furthermore, the profession system makes gaining better crafters feel like an achievement. The downside of this game still being in development, however, means that it is not yet fully optimized (all villagers stop doing things in large villages on 2x speed) and that the game doesn't contain any real endgame yet (except for creating nice looking villages and buildings).

								This game is so addicting i cant come off it i play this more than any other game i have.First time Experienceat first i had no idea what to do (I know there is guides but im going simply from the game itself) it doesnt really explain what you do. Then i when i figured out what to do i felt quite stupid (Personally).At first i was just gathering resources but wasnt sure what to do, but then realised you have to set you people jobs, after that i started expanding, defend my self from goblins, then built a wall round my town and have just expanded on.Although it can be quite annoying to play due to the bugs and what have you it is only and Alpha so dont expect bug free.ProblemsNow yes it is only and alpha im not hating on it i understand but im only sharing a few bugs people should know about.Buildings with more than floorThis can be a pain as they will get stuck on the inside of the top floor if your not planning on using the second floor.UIIts written in C++ json files, similar to Minecraft. so yeah can expect the kind of bugs from it, if your changing a Person job and your looking at the list it can crash and stop you from setting Jobs, saving, crafting, and other things that require the UI to pop up a menu.(To fix this just press F5 to reset the UI)Lagyou wont notice this till you have explored your area a bit and have at least 20 people in your town. When this happens prepare for all the Bugs. The UI system comepletely fails and stutters the game due to the all the for loops and the while scripts (Basically 24 FPS is coming your way).(I have found a way to sort of delay the lag, when its happens Reset the UI by Press F5. this resets all the Loop Scripts causeing it to refresh all the code thats waiting or looping in the game it wont cause any harm that i know i do it and i have no problems)ConclusionYes there are problems but its an alpha and this game has insane potential im sticking around for the updates and playing it daily you ignore the bugs and just get on with it. i still recommened getting this game.

Potential and CharmI purchased prior to early access, Fall 2014. If the videos appeal to you, and you are willing to put up with bugs then I feel comfortable recommending this game now. As of 11/2015 the primary issues I have with the game are bugs. Many are fixed weekly, but I still can't quite build what I want or I have to game the AI to keep whem working.  If the developers deliver on everything it should be considerably better.This game has a lot of potential, and I respect the developers for being very open with the community. They communicate through their blog weekly, and often push a non-stable build weekly or every other week. This game has not been abandoned like some other early access titles. Pros:Responsive Dev TeamOpen for ModsGreat visual styleFun personality in the writing Extensive replayability (no two games the same)Building interface has great potentialCons: Buggy... it's alphaLong dev cycleMany features that give the game legs are not in yet (MP,Co-Op, more factions)I purchased this because I wanted to support the developers, and I'm glad to see they are still going strong. This little game has a lot of charm, and potential. As it stands right now I check the game once a month or so just to see all the new stuff they've put in. I hit a few show-stopping bugs on my town and leave it for another month. Looking forward to full release.  "

								I've spent so much time in this game already and it's not even finished.Stonehearth is a voxel based city builder game that scratches the same kind of itch as the millenaire mod for Minecraft.The studio is also really good with their communication and transparency.  They are always in touch with the people who kickstarted the game, and take the time to respond to people who arrived a little later like myself.  Development is even interactive through a Trillo Board and through the official forum.In terms of modding there is an active community and a really well supported forum if you find theres something you want but the game currently lacks.If you're looking for a city builder or building game and want something a little different, then I highly reccomend this game.

								Stonehearth is a very nice and pretty looking game with a big potential. It's an excellent game for players like myself, who would like to play Dwarf Fortress, but find the whole thing too imidating. Then graphical style might not be for everyone but I like the cute voxel people working the land and doing their tasks in a cute voxel world with their cute voxel tools. The game is getting better and more complex after every update and the UI let's you do all kinds of neat stuff that isn't possible in other games of this genre.The biggest problem though is the bug that makes workers building a building idle before the construction is finnished. This bug has been pretty persistent and been there since the earliest versions. It is quite nasty and makes the game allmost unplayable, since it's hard to find a workaround that would help in this situation. It's not so nice to have a village with a load of unfinished buildings...But the game is still in alpha and, as I said before, improving nicely. I am certain that the team will be able to squash also these major and difficult bugs.So but yeah, thumbs up for Stonehearth.			"

								Berry nice game, I must admit. Tickles my fancy in more than one way.You will like it if you've ever played and liked:- Minecraft- Settlers- Banished- Dwarf Fortress (albeit you might find it a tad less complicated)It is a mixture of town building, resource management and roleplaying. The player is tasked with founding a new settlement with only seven settlers and limited equipment. One will have to provide means of getting resources and food and train your specialists to improve the quality of your settlers' lives and to keep your town safe from baddies that share the ground with the Hearthlings (albeit this could be turned off). If the town is doing well, it will attract new immigrants, which can be pressed into new roles. There is also an rpg-esque quest line (I believe one or two so far - more is promised), for which you will need to train and outfit a team of adventurers militia.I particularly like the building system: - building templates for quick placement. Your workers will queue required components automatically;- every building can be customized to your liking and built to exact specs (ie. 'carpenter's house' template can be easily re-purposed for stonemason's workshop);- each construction is built brick-by-brick, complete with wooden scaffoldings, which are de-constructed after the job's finished;- multi-storey buildings are a thing.Clichés and subtle jokes run throughout the gameplay. Couple it with cute 3D pixel art and the result is rather refreshing.Yup,it is still in EA, it is still buggy, it is still incomplete. But nevertheless, so far, it is a lot of fun!Just don't take it too seriously.			"

								This game has pro and cons... I wish it didn't have cons but it does have SERIOUS Cons.This game has a great idea and story, starting off with your civilians or ""Hearthlings"" as the game calls them trying to survive in the world. Very inviting and always bringing you back to the game and continue to play more. There are a few faults that make you skratch your head and question ""Why isn't this fixed already?""Pros  this game brings you back to it. Always replayable even, randomized events, world  and characters.  A very elaborate building designer. Elaborate in ways and not in others, but this game does allow you to build your own buildings, design them from scratch.  Constantly being changed by the dev team, updated and fixed.Cons Has probelms with building, and some bugs that well frankly, shouldn't be there still. Quite basic stuff that should be done. Been in development for quite sometime and I would say, Not Done. Things that need to be fixed are show everywhere. Even to the point you can save and the game may not realize you did and your hours of work that you did is now gone. The game doesn't auto save as frequent as it should.Overall this game is still one of my favorite games. I would give it a total 7/10. I recommend the game as long as you are willing to have a few problems and watching the game develop more.  "

								Honestly? It will be the best game in its genre, toppling its many predecessors (Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, etc.). However, it's currently lacking late game content, as well as needing a lot more FLESH to the game itself. Mechanics are pretty flawless, but it also experiences some minor progression ""obstacles"" and balance issues. I only encountered one bug, which left a permanent ""cloud"" in an area, which doesn't even bother me, signalling that this game is MOSTLY bug free. Some settlers might get trapped, and mining/tunneling needs some changes, but other than that and the lack of FLESHING OUT? Perfection.It it's current state, it's an amazing game. I played nonstop for hours, over multiple days. It's fantastic. It's an amazing game, so much so that I felt compelled to write this HONEST review.In a year, it will be even better. These guys know what they're doing.(If a dev is reading this, please add a lizard race, faster structure building, and combat magic, pls and ty. love you.)			"

								Finally! i've had this since the pre alpha (when you could barely have them build anything and then again when you had to tell trappers how to do their job)  Even when it became purchaseable on steam i thought it was way too early. I finally fired this up today, and my usual hour-max play time before crashing out was epic... They have changed a great deal of things to either make them automated, slightly more intuitive and overall a joy to play. The profession and task mechanics have come a long way while still retaining everything i liked about them initially, there feels to be some real meat on the bones of this and while there are a few more things that take a little practice, it has just come leaps and bounds ahead of where it was seeming to be stagnating.I very much recommend this for anyone wanting a DF-lite with graphics. It's not going to replace your dwarven stronghold any time soon, but it will give you your money's worth in game play. I strongly recommend giving this one a shot. and while you're at it probably throw a few bucks toward the toady one, keep him inspiring developers of this calibur.Overall i am extremely happy with my original decision to back this project and am looking forward to what it will become.

								This game is amazing. Despite it being an Early Access alpha build, it's still really enjoyable to play. When you read ""Early Access Game"" in those big bold letters on the store page, and you buy that game and complain that it has bugs, you're an idiot if you're surprised it has bugs. Despite this game's bugs, it's still extremely enjoyable and is consistently updated almost two or three times a month, I never am without information on what is going on and I am handed the next build in a timely manner, bug fixes are put out rapidly and the developers have a pretty clear idea on what they want this game to be but they also listen to the community and as such, the community's opinions are highly impactful on the design and construction of this game, and the devs manage to do this without sacrificing their own ideas and causing stalls with game design. 10/10 I love these devs and this game and I know it's bound for success. It's worth every penny.			"

								Ok so I played it for several hours. First, Ill start with the fact that the game is amazing. I realy like games where you build a city but in this game you have freedom to build the city as you like. Starting from editing the houses and buildings to naming each member of the city.Now, I think the game is a bit too buggy. For example, I ordered one of the crafters to craft 3 weapons, and he built only one and then he forgot his job and just wasted my time.I realy recommend this game for anyone who like games like SimCity, Banished, ZooTycoon, or Dwarfs. This game has so much to it and its only an alpha. This Is one of the few games which worth more than twenty bucks. And if multiplayer system comes out its gonna be the BEST GAME EVER.			"

								   Although it is still buggy in its early stages, this game has a certain potential that few games seem to achieve. Such games include StarBound, Dirty Bomb, and of course, this game. You should get it now to experience the growth of the game as it develops.   This game is tons of fun and really in-depth. All they need to fix is the inevidable bugs, and this game would be one of the greats. I reccomend this to anyone and everyone looking to create something.   Another neat feature that some games fail to achieve is having your structures that you build have a purpose, and they do. You can have a dining hall, sleeping quaters, a workshop building for your hearthlings, and more. This game greatly influences meaning in your buildings. I am willing to bet you will love this game!                                                                                                                                                  -9/10			"

								Okay I love this game. like hands down best content. A city builder, but you have to protect yourself. you  must adapt to the challange. This differs this game largely to other games like banished and sim city. the content is amazing. i havent even got through the whole campaign and yes there is one. Its killing a bunch of different goblins and then killing bosses and mobs. the classes are awesome. once you get abunch of people you can really do stuff in this game, design whole cities, make each class a house and workshop, build up the overall town look of your city. Also your defence must adapt. walls,better doors and other enemy deturing devices. the content is awesome. try it. I dont like how you can only have so much inventory per citizen. Even if you have free storage your people wont pick up the items. which i hope will be patched out. hopefully. !!DEVELOPERS!! read this pleaseeeeeeee. why have a cap on storage? it makes no sense. if i want to stock pile 40000 potatoes like in banished, i should have that rightBUTTTTTTTTTT Sorry to sound critical this is a factor of the game. still love the game buttttt_____all i see is buggs buggs buggs. I bought this game after seeing it played. and so the whole time i played i had someone to converse with about the game and things i knew he didnt etc, so whenever i tell you there is buggs?  My brother had 9 farmers. everyone of them idle. wont work. reset the UI they said. didnt work. the game is kinda buggy. people will sit on top of large decratative and complex buildings and just sit on top. you some times have to build ladders to get your people down. by time you get the ladder up they just come down how they came up. people will idle. group control doesnt always work is finnicy. The biggest one is the slowing down once you get a certain size of people. just because the game cant handle it. people not working benches because they are indoors. nothing is blocking their path, the buildng is huge and empty. 6 doors. but they wont work it inside. so you put it outside ikr but still. gaurds will attack people when you tell them to cancel. then they go right back to it. but only that one person goes. so he basically kommikazii himself towards a hoard of goblins and wolfves. or beetles. people will NOT PICKUP LOOT EVER. ive only gotten them to loot things like the hats. and they will walk past everything. i turned auto loot on. nothing it just ques it up. and even if you cancel all the loot tasks and loot indiviual items it wont work. as stated later, its in its alpha, its implied. They usually fix things like this in the beta. and im really excited to see it come out. I would sooooooo pay the developers money for what they have done like a go fund me? the time i can see they have put into this (mainly because i went to their site, Which is aweosme, mainly because i can see the progress and how they have came from nothing and put every step open to the public. you can watch them patch and deveolp on tuesday and thursday. look on their site. the site also tells about the multiplayer which im suuuuuper stoked about.  The game is godsend. a real challenge and fun to experience how every single thing can be orangized and absoutly defined in every way by the player. The city can have walkways. you can design alot of collumn buildings. or modernistic concrete looking structres. they really let the player take hold of the game. and honestly i recomend the game but its in its alpha. the bugs are not bad in this game. their implied. they arent done yet. but their so plucky and strong they dont care about making it three years from now. they want people to see what they are doing and want to stick with it. and i applaud them. Great game. ive recommended it to several people. and have bought it for a few. I love the game. but ive gotten the fullest effect. ive played to about 30 citizens and the game starts to slow down. and even if you turn everything down it slows down. and i have a great processor, and a 390 gpu. its not me. i expect them to get to the point they add a driver for it. and im sure they will. but Im gonna play the second campaign, the dessert faction, do a few quick stars just to get good but id really like to see this game blossom. id beta this game so hard. 4.6/5 Even with the bugs. i kiss the ground the devolpers walk on. keep working you guys!!!!

								Re-revised review:I've been back and forth on this game, lots of bugs fixed, but there are still game stopping bugs that ruin your experience, and until these are fixed, I will keep the review as not recommended.  They've had plenty of time to fix these game stoppers but updates have been few and far between and don't fix much.Revised review:The performance issues and glitches where items weren't being picked up were corrected.  Another bug that seems to be fixed is a building never getting completed.  So I am changing to a thumbs up.Old review:I really want to like this game but there are game stopping bugs that can ruin everything pretty quickly.  You're sitting here trying to fend of goblins and your guys can't even pick up tables.  The game also runs really badly when you start getting a large village.  I have a beastly rig that can run Fallout 4 on all high NP, so this is annoying.			"

With constant updates, the money you spend now will help the game develop, and every time they update, its like getting free DLC. Don't wait, buy now!! You won't regret it.			"

								A very nicely re-imagined version of dwarf fortress, albeit with quite a few changes to the dwarf fortress model. One such change would be very sharp and well-done character and environment models. The developers have chosen an interesting art style and it works quite well for the game, allowing the game to be well polished and graphically sound while retaining an art style that works well with lower end machine. Sure there are bugs but the game is still in alpha stages and these bugs aren't, usually, game-breaking, overall the game has a lot of interesting mechanics and is quite fun for something that is sitll in alpha. 9/10			"

								Have been following this game since kick starter ( so a f**king Long♥♥♥♥♥time ). Radiant has done awesome things with stonehearth so far, considering the first release you werent even able to build roofs :'). The game still has ways to go but at its current state you can easily get 15-20 hours out of it.And for those people who dread indie early access games like day-z  or cube world (wollay why :( !!!!!!!!)  for not updating alot, or hell even communicating with the community (wollay) then your insecurities will be non exsistant when it comes to stonehearth, as Radiantm bare minimun gives an update on progress of the game every week. With a new alpha coming out usually once every 1-2 months.Give stonehearth a go, and even if you put it down for awhile you will atleast know next time you pick it up there will be some sort of new content to explore.

								Was a Kickstarter backer of this back when it was first conceived, and have played it periodically as they have made improvements on it.The game still has a ways to go to reach the goal state, but they have been doing a fantastic job along the way.  The game has been fun to tinker with since day one, and has only been getting more rewarding as they improve and add to it.  The devs are absurdly transparent about how things are going, and have been both honest and cooperative with the fans.I prefer reviewing games as-is rather than how they may someday become, so I would say this game is currently a decent buy.  Not fantastic yet, but fun.  That said, if you are willing to make the investment, I strongly believe this game will improve to the point of being amazing by the time the devs are done.The game supports both peaceful, and combat senarios, though you will still find plenty of tranquil and peaceful days on the combat side.  The mechanics are intuitive and fun to use, and you will quickly find yourself enamored with your village as it grows from a group of misfits around a camp fire into a teaming hamlet.  The devs provide fantastic support, and the community is welcoming and pleasant.I solidly recommend this game to fans of the genre.			"

Its so easy to create your own villages and items to import into the game using vox or 3D software!It has taken some time for them to get to where they are now, but they where such a small team to begin with, and also, there project plan was realistic and they have stayed on target and been delivering.This game is so much fun! worth my time to review for sure!

The devs are active all the time leaving updates on the their website and stream on twitch. Don't be decieved by the 60 hours it shows because I have probably played this game a solid 200 hours. This game has a wonderful combat, building, and crafting system. This game in the long run will have so much content for you to spend hours of your life in enjoyment. I can honestly say even though this game was released to early access today, it is one of the best early access games that doesnt have developers quit on you or content is just getting old. This game will always have new challenges and new fun things to do. I highly recommend you get it.If you don't get it I will come to your house and murder you while you sleep.			"

								Meh.  It's cute; like you might think you are going to get something like minecraft but it's really not.  You can dig blocks out of the dirt but that's just to harvest randomly placed ores.  And, you have to be really attentive to how you give your dig instructions or they will dig a hole they can't get out of... and starve without warning.  Beyond that it's kind of like any other crafting game; you have to have your tradespeople level up before they can build certain things, or unlock more types of trades/specialties. What you cannot do is control any of the villagers.  The only controls you have are your build queue, you can designate areas for mining, loot collection, you can set up zones for farming plants, animals, trapping, (much like Sim City)  and you can order an 'alert' where all the villagers run to your designated safe-zone, marked by a flag.  You can relocate the flag as your village changes.  The only villagers you can slightly control are the footmen, which have 3 or 4 basic instructions that really all amount to the same thing... ""move here and fight any threats"".  The threats are nothing too severe... the occasional zombie, golem etc that wants to steal your stuff or kill your villagers.  Oh, and don't forget to cancel your footmen's orders when the fighting is done or they will stick to their new post, and starve without comment.The pace is ponderous... it has 2 speeds, neither of which is fast enough to make the time go by, but the accelerated speed is too fast to be able to react well to some of the hostiles that show up.  It'd be nice if it had instad of 1x/2x, it had 5x/10x and option to drop to normal speed when a zombie alert shows up.So... it looks like a good game for younger kids but I think the crafting system and build-requirements are just a touch too complex for them.  Anyone else may enjoy it until they come to the realization... this is really all there is.			"

								10/10This game is great and is totally worth your money. I played it for a while now and I just can't get enough of this game! The developers are very close with the community and bring updates about the game every single week (on tuesday). I really think they care about us gamers.I like to compare this game with, The Sims, Simcity (or cities: skylines) and a little bit of Age of Empires. It is a citybuilder with a lot of micromanagement and sometimes you get attacked by scary monsters, that you need to kill with your small army of footmen (hope to see archers soon! They will be there!).The game is, ofcourse, because it is early access, somewhat buggy. But since the last update (alpha 14) a lot of them are fixed and great new content was added. My Pro's-Great micromanaging-citybuilder.-Lovely graphics, lightning effects and looks.-Perfect music (would love to hear more!)-Fun enemies and encounters.-Cool development team.-Roles you can assign to your hearthlings.-Easy to use building greator, but you can make it as impressive as you want. (block for block)-Great landscaping, water physics.My Cons-Bugs (duh! but I assume this will be temporary)-Only 1 combat musictrack, gets annoying after a while.-Some performance issues but I am sure they will be fixed. :)I am really looking forward to the Dwarves as a playable race, the winter biome aaaannddd.... MULTIPLAYER! I know it will be there eventually!This game is very promising and super fun!			"

								To say the least, this is a great game and I would suggest it to any city-builder fan. My only problem is the bugs; but that is to be expected from an early alpha game. Most of the time, my Hearthlings stand around doing nothing until they either starve to death or are put out of misery by some other force, but for the 40 or so pecent chance they DO follow orders, it's a great game. I hope the devs continue to work on this. It's a great game with great potential; just need to fix the experience ruining bugs.7/10			"

Early Access Review
								Ooof. First off I'd like to say I play a lot of early access games so I know to expect bugs and issues. You'll need that mind set for Stonehearth. For time's sake I'll just say there are ALOT of bugs still, some rather serious. There is almost zero in game help on how to do even the most basic game functions, thats ok it is a alpha stage game after all, but here's the next issue that finally made me have to turn the game off and write this review. When you look online how to do the super basic ABCs its old outdated infomation that no longer has any bearing with the current game. Assuming very few readers made it through all that complaining I'd like to end the review on this note, its still pretty fun (when you aren't pulling your hair out) and while the developers aren't pumping out updates like crazy they do seem to be plugging away at steadly which is more than you can say about a lot of early access.P.S. Bottem line is Stonehearth has a ton of potential and I'm glad I could support the developers. I just hope they keep working hard to make the game more stable to play.			"

								This is one of the only games that is an amazing product before release. In its current state, it obviously has bugs. However almost all of these bugs can be fixed by saving and restarting the game. With the recent updates allowing buildings to be created so much easier, it is so much more fun to let you build a town that looks good and functions amazingly. It is a perfect game to play if you are looking for a relaxing game. This game truly is amazing and I love seeing the new updates role out to give me something new to play with. You should really pick this game up if you are looking for a relaxed, single player experience.			"

								Fun game. Already feel like it has delivered more on this premise than Towns or Gnomoria. Pretty stable for Early Access too. Few bugs and every bug I've gotten was fixed by a reload (I recommend enabling auto saves for this reason). The developer has a clear road map, and seem pretty classy to boot. If you want a fantasy city builder I highly recommend it. It's totally worth buying/wishlisting depending on your tolerance of bugs/alpha sillyness.			"

								Its a great game! But it can have some really frustrating bugs! There is a bug where your workers won't continue/finish building a house you made, people dont know what causes this bug yet, but its really annoying. Thats like the only bug i have experienced so far. But its a good game.			"

								A very good game.  This ALPHA stage is more stable than many of the BETA stage games that I play. True there are many problems with crashing, glitches, and other things but the Developers are puting out fixes for most if not all the major problems within 48 hours of finding these problems which is faster than any other game I have BETA or ALPHA tested except maybe Minecraft.  The Developers are constantly asking for player input on new aspects and not only listen to suggestions but make counter suggestion when something isn't possible because of how the game is programmed.  For all of you out there who want a game that has no bugs at all I suggest waiting until after the BETA test has finished which at the current pace will be probably 2019 or 2020 depending on how much more the Developers decide to implement and how long it takes to debug multiplayer when they finaly add it in.  If you like Sandbox City or Civilization Builders this is a game that you will greatly enjoy.			"

								Even when it points out it is alpha and missing things I still find myself enthrawled by gameplay alike to others like the Kefling games from Xbox. Simply put you control settlers and try to compel them through indirect management. If you've played dwarf fortress this is almost exactly like that.All in all even how it is, I'd say a definate buy.			"

								I like this game and I am excited to see where it will in the future. While this remains in early access, I would like to point out that there are a dozen or more games exactly like this on Steam and other platforms. For me to keep playing, I need to know how this game will be distinct amongst the others. How will this game be it's own thing and not just another one of these games.			"

								It's not a complete game yet, but it's playable and a great deal of fun. There's a lot of satisfaction in building a thriving community and keeping it running smoothly in the face of golems, orcs, lizards and the odd wandering necromancer. Every update it gets a little better and a little less buggy.Well worth a try.			"
