												Ah, Universal Combat.  Somehow I hoped we had seen the last of Derek Smart.  Don't get me wrong, I don't despise the man, but his snarky, combative attitude in the face of the overwhelming evidence regarding his shortcomings as a developer have left me hoping for the day when he retires from public life; that, and I was one of the foolish who purchased Universal Combat when it came out only to discover it was broken and buggy even after several patches and any attempts to challenge this was met by scorn and insult by Derek Smart himself.This is not a good game.  It will not be a good game no matter how many times he changes the name.  It IS a very ambitious game, however.  To his credit, Derek Smart tried to make a game that pushed hardware and design boundaries.  The sad reality is that he failed, but rather than accept this and work with critics to address the problems he chose to attack whatever fanbase he had for pointing out the shortcomings of the game,.  Now it is on steam (for free, no less) and that is supposed to diminish your ability to criticise this product, but for those of us who purchased the game when it first came out it just brings back visions of falling through surfaces, user interfaces better suited to spreadsheet software than a game and terrible, game destroying bugs.I won't address the visuals, which for the time were not bad.  I bought the game originally because of the promise of fps and ship based exploration and combat, and what I ended up with were two halves that never really seemed to fit together or work even on their own.  Attempting to hold the two halves together is an interface that is poorly thought out (see how long it takes you to figure out how quit for a start) and overcomplicated with fields and windows of redundant settings best handled with a single button or accessible from a quick bar.It's unfortunate (but not surprising) to see that time has not changed Derek at all; looking at the comments on steam he continues to attack naysayers with the same eagerness he did on his own forums once, and that is a shame.  I would have hoped that the years had brought him some wisdom about dealing with critics and fans alike, and that rather than insult their intelligence and rebuff their concerns with snarky comments he would have hired a PR representative who has less of an irrational response to criticism.  You will likely play Universal Combat regardless of my review, and I invite you to do so.  You will also discover that the game has some nebulous design decisions and unresolved bugs that will hamper your enjoyment.  Just do not expect your feedback or criticism to be well received or heeded at all by the game's designer as he has great difficulty accepting flaws in his work, though he will gladly take all of your praise.

												""This scenario is completely free form and is designed to be role played using your imagination.""Sounds good! Lets see....what am i going to play....?I think i will be a terran paramedic! That sounds fun, doesnt it?Ok, what to do? There are no orders. There is no fleet. There is a whole lot of nothing and me in an unarmed ship. Oooh wait there actually is a ship in distress. Thats a job for us mateys! We approach! All men to their stations! We are going to doooo... -nothing. Thats right. There is no action we could take to actually help the distressed fellow.Can that truly be? Lets check the discussion board. Some other guys also wondered what the purpose of that career might be.Aha, thats interesting. Everyone should be glad that the developer gave us so many different possibilities to play the game and we are such dumb idiots that we cant use our imagination to play the game properly. Yes thats right! Its all in our imagination! Sit in your bathtub and you are the captain of a nuclear submarine on its mission to save earth. Imagination YAAAAYYYYY!!! So much fun!!!Well, lets try something different then. A military carreer seems more appropriate for the game setting. What to do, what to do? Ok i figured it out a little. I embarked on a planet, i ran around, i even shot something. I dont know exactly what  i did it for. The planet was marked as hostile. Hurray for imagination! I shoot at the enemy base with my spaceship destroying some cardboard building like thingies - supposed to be a military installation. And nothing else happens.Lets have a look at the forum again. Do my actions have any impact? Not really. Bases rebuild themselfes after you destroy them. Spaceships spawn randomly. Everything resets, if you just wait long enough.You have a huge galaxy filled with meaningless balls (planets) and ships and no purpose at all.--> ImaginationProblem is: With an empty sheet and a pencil you could truly use your imagination. With this game your possibilities to actually interact with anything are very limited. You can fly to it, you can land/dock or shoot it. Thats about it then. And whatever you do, it does not matter in the slightest.People, dont get fooled. This game is not complex, it is just poorly designed. You can fly your ship using the cursor keys. There is no huge background mechanic that wants to be figured out. It was hollow, it is hollow and it will be hollow in all future releases (please let it be the last one...it is just an unsatisfying waste of time).If you want something complicated and fun, try dwarf fortress. Thats a game to love!I bought the Battlecruiser Millenium Edition back then...i was so incredibly disappointed and furious. When i lingered in the shop and spotted someone who grabbed the game box i would go and talk them out of buying the game. I hope i saved some folks a little money and the huge dissapointment of this franchise.RIP--------------------------EDIT: 29.07.2015With the ""DLC - The Lyrus Conflict"" it gets even more ridiculous. This developer is selling his idea for a game (in my opinion it has never been complete) in a new coat over and over and over.Derek Smart, 24.07.2015: ""Yeah, the DLC (Lyrus Conflict) is basically lot of refinements, and graphics overhaul. No new features. That's for Universal Combat Advanced which is full blown sequel.""http://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/613957600540266427/#p7Derek Smart, 07.02.2015: ""But basically, if I do end up doing it as planned (Universal Combat Advanced), it will have the same gameplay features as this 2015 remastering of UCCE v2.0 but with a complete graphics overhaul...""http://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/606068060825246172/How people still dont see through this charade is beyond my grasp. He is doing it since 20 years.I know, i know, we are all waiting for that capital ship simulator since we seen Battlestar Galactica / Star Wars. We got to wait some more. This game series is not it and never will be. Dont support the shady business of false advertising.			"

												So.....this game.Putting aside any personal isssues with Derek Smart (and let's be honest, a lot of people have issues with him), let's try to be as objective as possible in this review...What exactly is UC and does it live up to its claims?It's a 'do anything in space' simulator. You want to command a battlecruiser? Check. You want to be a Marine on a planet shooting stuff? Check. You want to fly from a planet to space and dock with that carrier you see over there? Check.The problem is...well....the problems are...One: Excessive micro management: Why for instance, should the commander of a large ship have to manually set power levels? Why can't....say....the crrew AI do that for you and if you want to then alter it, you can? By default, there isnt't enough power to go around and you have to go in and manually set it. Or, say you want to send....I don't know, four Marines and a tank and a pilot to a planet. You have to tell each individual what to do. There's no group option.Two: HUD issues. The HUD itself isn't intuitive at all, the three MFDs at the bottom of the screen don't easily tell you what they are, the radar is 2d, not 3D and that is confusing as well as you got no clue if the enemy target is above or blow you.Three: Questionable vehicle physics. Why should a shuttle be able to stop on a dime in space? I can understand tanks or ATVs stopping quickly on a planet, that makes sense, however...a shuttle, in space, you cut the power and it instantly stops? Really? Yes, I'm aware it's explained away as some technical stuff but that's an easy and cheap way to get around the issue.So what are the good points then given I've laid out some issues with it?One: You can literally go anywhere and do anything you want to. For instance in a free roaming scenario, I have taken a battlecruiser from Ear to the Moon, landed troops, done exercises, got picked up by the shuttle and flown back, all without cutscenes or scripting.Two: It's seamless once it loads. Yep that's a big, big plus. You want to go from planet to space? Get above a certain height and push a button, then confirm it (again....micro management issues but....), there's a few seconds worth of animation and you're in space. Same for going to a planet.s, get close, it'll ask establish planetfall, say yes,a nd sit back.It's pretty. Oh yes it is, it's some of the most atmospheric graphics in a space game....and you feel as if you can actually go to that nebula, or that planet....or even that base and dock thereYou are not the hero. Okay, this is  astrange one but....most games are all about the player, right? Well, UC, CE isn't. There's an entire universe going on, things happen regardless of you being around or not. You can be in a system and go off for a few days, come back and find that station you were docked at got attacked and changed hands, or there's a war on a planet that broke out while you were going there.However....I personally wouldn't recommend it unless you want to spend a LOT of time reading and learning. It's not a simple pick up and play game in the least, it takes time, dedication and (sadly) figuring things out on your own so you don't have to deal with Derek Smart to enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, once you like it, it's definitely good but I do feel many, many people will be put off by Derek Smart and won't even look at it.If UC was made by somebody else and released on Steam for free, it would get a much, much better reception, I can absolutely say that for certain.Either way, although this has not recommended at  the top, try try it out. Make up your own mind and be prepared for a lot of reading and learning too.			"

												""Don't Alt+Tab"" - Derek Smart, developer of Universal Combat CE.You know there is a serious problem with the game when even the developer tells you not to alt+tab, even in the collector's edition. I alt+tabbed anyway and it crashed the game which is a real shame because I had to read through the 93-page PDF Game Manual just to find out how to move my ship forward.Universal Combat CE is just another renamed, slightly updated version of Derek Smart's Battlecruiser 3000AD series from 1996. Much like its NINE predecessors (that's right, there are 9 previous versions of this same game), Universal Combat is horribly plagued by gamebreaking bugs, poor interface and design, horrendously glitchy gameplay, extremely boring and poorly written storyline, no tutorial and lack of explanation for basically everything in the game. The controls and ship GUI are so confusing, it will leave you scratching your head at pretty much everything.I wouldn't even pay a dollar for this game. It is garbage.			"

												Ohhhhhhh nostalgia..... how I hate you. You Make me play a game I thought was epic as a young gamer, and then you go and beat me over the head with it years later.....When I saw UC was free on steam I downloaded it almost instantly. ""MY CHILDHOOD NEEDS THIS"" said my brain, not knowing what horrors were to come. Oh the bugs.... Oh the nonexistant story..... Oh the wtf moments. I played the game for about 20 minutes, and of that 20 minutes, 15 was recovering from game breaking crashes, first at the video options screen trying to change resolutions, then after trying to make planetfall on some red thing I found in a random spot on the map. Then it crashed on the startup. You know, I think it was telling me to leave it alone, to spare the fond memories of me actually playing the game. You know what, thank you UC:CE, you spaired my childhood memories from having to be corrected by crashing before I could actually play.0/10 would not collect this edition.			"

												I own a hard copy of the original CD release.  I bought it because the description and pictures on the box appealed to me.  Little did I know the headache I was in for.Unnecessarily complicated and poorly-mapped controls, obscure acronyms defined only in the error-filled and insulting manual, and a developer who won't and doesn't hesitate to badger and fight with prospective customers make this a very difficult game to recommend.  In fact, the only reason I would recommend even downloading it is because it's free.  As the saying goes, anything free is worth what it costs, and in this case, it is quite literally true.And don't buy the ""bug-free"" claim.  Many people experience crashes - but according to the developer, that's the player's fault for not having compatible hardware (which is often not the case), not his fault for failing to account for such possibilities.  Oh, and you can't Alt-Tab or it crashes - and again, nothing there but excuses from the developer.			"

												This game is as broken as the first day it was released. It has a premise with potential, but it is ruined by the consistent freeze that happens on the first FPS mission. The resolution is hideous and the graphics are still gag-inducing. I'll put in as much effort into this review as Derek Smart (the creator) put into this game: little.Couldn't get through the first mission due to game-breaking bug. 0/10. F for effort. I came in excited, then came out absolutely disgusted. It's almost as big of a failure as 3000AD. I'd rather play Takedown: Red Sabre; that's how broken this is.			"

												I downloaded this free game half an hour ago, played it for 27 minutes according to Steam and in that time it crash hard to the desktop 8 times. EIGHT TIMES IN 27 MINUTES!That's not enough time between 2 crashes to figure out the cryptic menu system you need to use to command anything. Usability was clearly not part of the development plan of this game. It's probably an engineer's wet dream, but it's a gamer's nightmare (unless you like to hurt yourself).I guess the graphics were okayish for a game of the 90s, but the gameplay is a pain in the neck, it's just horrid. It's simply not rewarding nor enjoyable.Since I don't feel like reading the 100+ pages of what looks like an accounting manual to figure out how to fix this game or what to do, I'll just uninstall it right now. I have a lot of ""old"" games that work just fine so I don't need crappy crashy ones even if free. (oh, a $27 DLC??? yeah right)			"

												Great idea, Great Potential, Very Poor execution.The game is far too complex for most players to grasp, which is good and bad in and of itself. It desperately needs a comprehensive tutorial.There are several bugs, such as the infamous ALT+TAB crash.there are also some developer oversights mostly dealing with ground ops, for example:when driving an armored vehicle such as a wildcat, the camera should be relative to the turret, not the chassis, also the turret controls should operate independant of the movement controls. I should be able to aim upwards without moving forward. another issue i noticed is that when deploying ground troops from a vehicle, it is difficult to recover personnel because when they are ordered to return to base, they don't move close enough to the vehicle to actually board it.simply put, it's a great premise, but needs a lot of work.I would recommend a team of developers to do a full remake on a more modern game engine.I would not recommend this for most gamers.

No human being should be subjected to this... I mean are we sure it's presence on steam doesn't violate the geneva convention? I'm not saying Derek smart should be put on trial for warcrimes, but crimes against humanity seems like it should be an option at this point. It would be one thing to commit such atrocity and be done with it but to wrench open the wounds of the survivors anew by constantly trying to re-release it..... OH THE HUMANITY!			"

												BE AWARE if you want to play this game, you NEED to read the 93 page manual before you start. You can also download the 6 page key command reference to help you along while in game. If you need further help, and you will, don't look for an in game tutorial - follow along to a 97 page written walkthrough. There is also a page of cheat codes, tons of lore, countless reams of information about items in the game and much more. Links can all be found in the FORUMS.Why wasn't this all included in the game that was ""remastered in 2015 exclusively for Steam""? Hell if I know. Damned if I care. I'm not playing this game. EVE Online was simpler to figure out than this. In fact, there are countless games created during the same time period that are easier to figure out than this game. But it's all in the documentation so don't ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.If that sounds like fun to you, give her hell. This is right up your ally. Don't take my word for it. I'm just some dumb redneck that can't read. Hell, I don't even ""have two brain cells that  can rub together to make a fire"", whatever that means. Dumb me, I just use a fire starter or matches/a lighter to start my fires.I'm bored of this review already. I'm going to continue to read ""11/22/63"" by Stephen King now. It's a hell of a lot better than playing this game, in my idiotic opinion.OLD 'INACCURATE"" REVIEWYou can't even call this a game.On the surface it looks like some hardcore science fiction simulation - like Battlestar Galactica or something - but it is just one solid mess.- There isn't a tutorial... at least, I didn't find one.- There's no way to know what you are suppose to do. Yeah, there's a commlink that tells you what your mission is (if playing a campaign) but what do you actually do? Nobody knows. In free roam... just fly, I guess?- There are so many buttons and command trees that you get lost just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fly to a target or attack. Or figure out what to do.- There's a 93 page manual you absolutely have to read if you want to figure anything out, and that's exactly what the Dev wants you to do (""You should already be familiar with the lore..."" blah blah blah)- The sound fx / music will drive you insane.- There's no way to exit the game? Escape leads to a different menu. I pressed ""alt + tab"" to find out how, but that glitched the game out. I was then able to right click and close window though, so I guess that did work.That's pretty much it. This sucks. Waste of time unless you like frustration and impossible puzzles, maybe. "

												IMPORTANT TIPIf you jump into this game without reading the manual (you roguish maniac you!) and you’re stuck press either Ctrl+H, Alt+H or Shift+H which will both pause the game and call up the manual or control bindings.Press Ctrl+H to exit the documents.Well…I usually don’t bother writing Steam reviews as I often trust in the overall consensus of those that have already done so (what difference would my 2 cents make?).However this is probably the first time I have found myself in a situation where a game I hold in high regard is otherwise very divided in opinion.I suppose this is the very essence of what it is to be a “niche” game so the first thing I should probably say in this review is that “Universal Combat” (UC) is not for everyone.You will come out of it either loving it or hating it, but very unlikely anything in between.Now much has been said about the need to read the manual before playing and I can appreciate that many gamers nowadays (particularly the younger generation) would consider this requirement (at best) rather quaint in 2015.Indeed with there being so many free games and demos right there at your fingertips, I can see how the investment of time would be a deal breaker for some.As such the best I can do is tell you what 3 aspects of UC appeal to me the most, and should you be intrigued, perhaps you might be willing to preserver though the trials of learning how to play it.* Scale:The 3D environments for both space and planet side are mind-bogglingly vast and I am not aware of any other space sim that can match it (at least outside of an MMO).Capital ships dwarf the size of their occupants (you’ll notice this if you decided to go on a space walk outside your ship) and these ships in turn are tiny compared to the celestial scale of the planets & moons within this universe.If find that UC conveys the enormity of space exceptionally well.It is a very humbling experience to fly to a plant and watch as it fills up the entirety of the view screen.*Planetary landings:Like the space environment, the planet surface is massive (it takes 5 hours in real time to fly around the Earth in a shuttle) and they all have a day/night cycle (some even have weather effects).But what really sets this apart from every other space sim I’ve known is that it lets you land on any moon or planet you come across and explore it in first person (even a gas giant if you don’t mind dying).Any on top of that you can land anywhere you like on the planet’s surface rather than being restricted to predefined zones.However I will admit that the price for this vastness is a great deal of emptiness as the areas outside the city & base zones are pretty much uninhabited.Nevertheless I feel that the procedural generation works well mixing up the terrain features so it’s not like the surface is uniform and everywhere looks the same (the exception of course being barren moonscapes which are supposed to look samey).* A.II’m the kind of guy that is fascinated by A.I in gaming.I find it as much fun observing what an A.I does in various situations as I do playing the game.And Universal Combat has a pretty interesting A.I to observe.Even as you go about your business in the game there is a hell of a lot going on behind the scenes.Trade ships are randomly generated which proceed to each star station along a route buying & selling goods. This will affect the inventory a station has to sell as well as the economy in general.Next you have raiders which are also randomly generated.They will try to attack the aforementioned trade ships and thus their success/failure also affects inventory & economy of the stations.You have :               - Criminals being generated, with police being generated to pursue them.               - Diplomats appearing and assassins dispatched to attack them.               - Colonists & workers headed to uninhabited planets to build cities               - Paramedics looking for the distress signalsAnd of course rival military forces clashing in as chance encounters or as retaliation for some other transgression for which the player never witnessed.While you're docked in a station getting repairs a whole dammed war could be going on outside and given enough time nations that were allies in the beginning of the game can sometimes become enemies just by one incident that the player may have nothing to do with.*Overall:To me Universal Combat is something very special: A vast simulation experiment with a game thrown in.I have been watching this game’s predecessor (the Battlecruiser series) since 1998 and in all that time I have seen nothing which comes close to it in terms of scope & scale.UC is a vast improvement on the old Battlecruiser series in every conceivable way and yet here it is being offered for FREE!?...Unbelievable.However as I said before it is not for everyone.

												Calling this game a ""collector's edition"" is like calling a used red solo cup a ""goblet fit for only a king's mouth"". Imagine a big disgusting bag of trash, and then dumping that into a septic tank and taking a long bath in there. That's basically what you're going to get with this abomination of a video game. The following two segments illustrates my first two playthroughs:1. Spawned as the chestical soldier on Earth (elite combat marine with two gigantic chest pads no matter what gender) and some alpha guys that looked like me and were friendly started running up to me shooting. Infantry controls don't work with the ""fully supported"" xbox controller (but do with vehicles) so I switched to mouse and keyboard for this despite configuring it beforehand for the controller. Aiming with the mouse is a challenge considering the mouse is inverted by default for some reason. I killed one of them, sprinted towards the nearest building, clipped through it and was instantly killed. 2. Spawned as the chestical soldier again and, after slogging through the awful manual, figured out how to enter and drive a SUV with a machine gun ontop around the base. The controls are overly sensitive and incredibily awful. You have to directly target things if your vehicle has a free moving turret, instead of pivoting your mouse or something similar to manuver them around. I tried running people over but they just collect on your hood and get moved around. I shot at a giant yet noiseless patrolling tank a few times, with no reaction, then shot off into the desert by holding the ""Down"" direction on the left analog stick. The same stick the steering is controlled with, yeah, smart. The main developer, Derek Smart, didn't want anyone to see the truly awful level design outside of this base on Earth that also had truly awful level design, so the base defenses automatically started firing rockets at me as I drove far away from it. I drove over a lake, then into an ocean with my open-air car, and didn't drown even upon exiting. Since I had no idea where to go after spending about 10 minutes or more letting the car drive effortlessly over the oceanfloor, I quit the game and didn't bother looking at the rest of the game until the next day.I have never dealt with a more needlessly complicated system of learning how to do anything. Even tabletop games, which can be fairly complicated, are more readily available to learn than this ""turn to page XYZ to even sort of understand what I'm talking about"" nonsense. This might fly in the days of Wing Commander and such, but the draw of certain ""old school"" style game elements just doesn't exist anymore unless you're playing an enthusiast level flight simulator or something. Seriously, page 4 of the tutorial throws every single blinking light at you at once, gives it a dumb 3 letter combination, and says to pause the game and just stare at the UI for awhile. How is that intuitive, or learning anything as you're doing it? By comparison, Elite Dangerous has a similarly complicated UI, with a lot going on in front of you, as well as the need to access the computers on the right and left sides of you at times, but the tutorials are broken down into small scenarios focusing on the basics before anything complicated. Slapping together a couple integrated Word docs that tells you how to play is just lazy, plain and simple. Telling me ""go here, fly around the target craft at half speed because I said so, then shoot at it but DON'T KILL IT OR YOU LOSE"" is not intuitive. Wouldn't ""Collector's Edition"" imply you made some improvements to these clearly outdated systems? Or is this part of the code that was only touched in one day, as detailed on Twitter? How does telling us the equivalent of ""only the commander really works"" in the game description on Steam, then giving us a bad experience in that one single class, tell us that the full upcoming game will not be completely bad as well? I'm wearing headphones as I play this, and the crew randomly babbling things as soon as I jump into a ship makes me think this game is turning me into a schizophrenic. Is this the lost souls of those who played the game calling for me to join them in the underworld?The controls are awful, and I'd like to re-emphasize that here. For example. instead of using the escape key to pause the game and display relevant background information like saving and such, there's 5 million different uses for Alt+*whatever key* instead. There's nothing in the key bindings of this game that screams ""intuitive"" or ""well thought out"". In fact, everything about this game's control scheme seems to indicate that it was designed to be played in the Eighth Circle of the underworld from Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"", alongside being whipped and having your body immersed in a lake of boiling pitch.There may be some improvements I'm not aware of compared to the base game it originates from, but would you eat a turd if it has pink frosting and sprinkles on it? To me, and likely many others, this is just another failure of many attached to Derek Smart.			"

												There's nothing on the main menu that clearly means ""start the single-player campaign,"" so I clicked ""resume."" That took me to the ""create a profile"" screen, so I did that and loaded up the ""tutorial"" scenario. Next I saw a ""briefing"" screen that gave me no direction other than ""rtfm to learn how to play."" Already I'm not thrilled with this ""update."" Next I got dropped into what feels like a cockpit with some pretty familiar-looking HUD elements. Since I recall (from the game's original incarnation) that the tutorial began with a ground mission, I assumed that I'm somehow meant to get myself down to the big red planet that's nearby.Before too long, I get a message that says ""urgent message received."" Okay. Where's the message? Let's figure out which one of these buttons leads me to a place where I can read the urgent message. The only thing that seemed remotely useful to that end was ""comms,"" which was within the ""command"" menu. But the comms screen is really just a log of what messages have already flashed up on screen. So all I see there is ""urgent message received.""Okay, whatever that urgent message is will have to wait; I need to get down to this planet. Oh look! A button marked ""Shuttles."" Surely, that will allow me to command my shuttles. Nope. It just opens a branching menu that lets me load the shuttle with... personnel I guess. I'm not sure, since there was nothing selectable anywhere in the tree. Okay, let's go back to the ""command"" menu tree. Hey look! Shuttles again! Let's launch a shuttle! Tell it to go to that planet!Wait. There's nobody on the shuttle because there's nothing to select in the ""shuttles"" menu.Then my PC rebooted (which is in no way related to the game).So... In my experience, a tutorial is something that's meant to teach you how to use something. This doesn't do that. Apparently, this is the scenario that's meant to accompany the 90-something-page tutorial novella.Okay. All done. Thanks Derek Smart for making me remember that your games are totally counter-intuitive and inaccessible, even to a guy who lives for complicated games that don't suffer from Monkey Syndrome. Admittedly, this game does not. It suffers from the reverse. Everything in this game seems to defy convention, seemingly for no reason but the defiance of convention.I confess myself pretty disappointed. I was really excited about this game when it was first released in 2004; back when I had the patience to pull it apart and figure it out. Even then I had a hard time with it. I was hoping that a ""Collector's Edition"" would at least have added a proper tutorial. Pretty disappointed.If you played this game ten years ago and still remember how it works, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed with this new version. It seems like a really cool game; it's just entirely unapproachable. If you don't feel like reading a 90-something-page tutorial, don't bother with this one.It's also nice to see Derek Smart is still totally uninsterested in what anyone thinks of his games. He made it for himself, so why should he care if anybody else can figure it out?			"

												Tried this game out for some minutes. Its scope is vast but it lacks any sort of modern user interface or guidance. Flight mechanics are primitive and most time seems to be spend in menus. Because of the limited development team, the vastness of space is appearing rather empty, a problem, that Elite:Dangerous also faces. If I'd have to give any advice to the creators, it'd be to reduce the scope of the project or massively increase the dev team size.If you enjoy tactical space games and dont value graphical fidelity too highly, this one may be for you, especially because its f2p. All others should stay away and maybe try ED or SC (when released).			"

												This game is the perfect example of why the term K.I.S.S. is important. Masivly over complicated, it takes 30 mins just to find out you can't access the main menu once you've loaded a playthrough. The controls and functions are so complicated it will take you at least 30 pages of the manual and tons of WTF moments to even work out how to not dock yet....I have to confess, I only played this and the old ones for an exploration into the mind and methods of one of the biggest game dev screwups of all time. So don't get the game, but maybe do look up the history of Derek Smarts. I found that far more entertaining than the game.			"

												Checked it out because it was on free week. Extremely confusing, poorly structed titles, I no idea how to get started with this game. The controls are incredibly counter intuitive, and typical keys for escaping or getting to main menus dont work. The only reason I played this for 9 minutes is because I couldnt figure out how to get out of the game. had to CTRL+ALT+Delete but didnt even have to force quit because the game crashed.So, try it for free, maybe its for you. Don't buy it.			"

												Well for the cost of nothing I was able to select a shuttle craft and go on a virtual tour of our very own solar system and then finish with a jump to Alpha Centauri. Space tourism at its best. I think people need to give the dev a break and look at this with fresh eyes. Yes there's tons of buttons/options, but if you fiddle about enough, who needs a manual? I didn't have any problem finding the save and quit feature.EditStargazer 23 Jun @ 1:37pm  you liked this game so much you played less than one hour since february... nofred56 12 Feb @ 5:17am  Hey, There are planets and Moons Out There, With Unusual Flora and Fauna!

That game has all the above in that review plus hundreds more.Infact I'll add this to the review and change it to a thumbs down. That do ya?P.S. 3.

												I had bought Battlecruser 3000AD when it came out in 96 and thought  this Derek Smart had the right idea and figured I would go with it even though the flying, walking, talking was really bad. His  way  of control and ideas for the ships are great. I had a real hard time getting into it due to the stiff stick type flying so I put it away. Then he came out  with Universal Combat and I figured he had smartened up and made the movement  more realistic so I bought it and found out that this is the same product with a different design but the same stiff movement so I shelved that. Well I figured as this is 2015 he was going to do something right. WRONG. Same style and movement. The idea of the ship controls for all vessels as well as  weapons,etc are all good  but the 2D view turns me off.			"

												I downloaded this game about a year and a half ago, back when it was free (I think when it first came out). And for the past year and a half, i've tried to play this game. But I noticed a ""few"" issues. 1. There is no tutorial, so in this uber complicated game you are bassicly f**ked. 2. A PDF exisits somewhere on the internet on how to play this game ( I could not find a direct link to the PDF.). 3. Even when/ IF you DO figure out the controls from the PDF, The controls are garbage sound quality is sh*t, Graphics are ok for a remastered 90's game. This game was not worth the money I didnt have to spend. It certainly isnt worth 9.99.			"

												I can totally understand the negative reviews  -  this is a hard game to like...in fact its a hard game period!I had some crashing issues on first release on Steam but they seem to have been resolved now.The game itsself, looks pretty much like your typical space sim/shooter - but its much more than that. Your are not some agile little FTL fighter - you are a battlecruiser / a capital ship / a mothership. If you scratch the surface you can micro manage just about everything onboard your ship...including sending agile little fighters out.I dont want to go into epic detail and make this review stupidly long, but suffice to say the learning curve is massive. I played this as a kid and i loved it! I still do - however i also loved hardcore Flight Simulators when i was a kid...and i think it is a similar kind of pleasure i get from this game.Dont play this game because you want to shoot spaceships - play it because you want to spend a week learning to pilot a starship (and manage its crew!) ...then wage some war  >=)Its free afterall!It'll only cost you time - but it will take you longer than a day before your playing like a Battlecruiser captain.FYI - You will probably have to go looking for your own fun too - there's a whole galaxy to explore, but no sign posts along the way ;)Basically, IMO, Its a totally flawed masterpiece!

												There is a reason this game has mostly negative reviews, it has terrible dev.  This game is the reason for the death of space games prior to 2012. It does everything wrongFurther the dev has solicted postive reviews. Some of which are for features to be added to the game, others are from his own dev team.  If you bring any of this into on the forums expect to be banned, and have your post hidden.  Pro(s):the game has some neat ideasit has a robust manualCon(s):You will see a lot of crashes, and it isn't the kind in which your ship is hitting something.  What looks like the crash reporter also fails.The manual is an exercise in getting berated by the dev for reading said manual.The controls don't always work.The only way I found to use the controls well was to print up a cheat sheet.The user interface is terrible for the late 90s, lots of jpegs instead of actual fedback.The graphics belong in the 90s as well.  if you want bug fixes, and updated graphics to the early 2000s then you need to spend $30 on a patch. From what I can tell it is also a buggy mess.(With solicited positive reviews)Most of the ideas are barely fleshed out, and just work poorly(if they work at all)You might get the save function to work.Sometimes just getting the quick combat to work can take a bit as the menus don't always respond.The ships are all the same internally, and I couldn't tell the difference between them either during flight.I have to question if it even has a flight model, and not a genertic physics model for positioing, and movement.It wasn't fun to try to enter atmosphere, in fact I got sick from the ship shaking like it reached a boundary, and bounced around.Have a comment on making the game better, expect to get banned from the steam forums.I find it hard that anyone can play more than a few hours of this program.  It just crashes to the desktop too often.It really lives up to its parentage of BattleCruiser 3000AD, which was a flaming mess of a program(Don't belive me, then look it up).Just check youtube for let's plays of universal combat, you'll see what I mean.  Realistically, this is such a buggy mess that it shouldn't even be on steam. There are actual games that have been pulled for less. "

												Well, going inside a game and don't know what to do or what you can do without reading all the docs, a total of 193 pages. It's not ""player friendly"". Even myself, who like to read manuals before or when playing a video-game, am not motivated to read as many pages to play it, especially when seeing the negative returns of steam players. An ingame and well built tutorial is always more appealing than a tutorial scenario where you still need the user manual to learn the commands.No motivation = Not playing, whatever the potential it can have.

												UNIVERSAL COMBAT COLLECTORS’ EDITION v2.0 is a capital ship combat simulator, that is a very hard core space combat sim.  This is a Derek Smart game, so it has a steep Learning curve and odd UI system.  Need to read 3 pdf manuals to figure out how to play this.  It worked, looks ok, sounded ok, played hard.  Is very Buggy.  Has a bunch of instant action senarios.  Has older graphics.  Also have some FPS combat missions.  Released in 2004.  UI and Menus are less than intuitive.  Tutorial is the Quick Reference PDF manual on store page and links to 2 manuals there too, nothing in-game.  If you like hard core spaceship simulators, you might like to try this game.I got this game for free, but at time of review this game is listed as 9.99 dollars, i don't recommend paying money for this game.  For Free, it might be worth playing around with if you are bored and like this sort of game.  For more info:

												This game is pretty terrible. I first decided I wanted to be a pilot, commanding a carrier, but the controls are rediculous, nothing makes any kind of sense in terms of usability. This games seems like it was made by someone who really wants to make a game, but has no idea how to begin, what to do, or what people like to see in their games.So after flying around a bit, and shooting nothing as a commander. I restarted as a marine, thinking it would be fun to run around with a unit and kill enemies. Well enjoy the low low low res textures on the planets, everything is made from triangles, again, controls make no sense, I started off with inverted controls on the FPS portion, even the help screen which tells you controls doesn't seem to be comprehensive, is difficults to navigate, and exit the screen. The game is just terribly made, overly ambitious, delivering on almost nothing from a gamers perspective.When clicking on roam, about 1/4 of the time the game would immediately crash on me. I was unable to set the name of my ship, as clicking didn't seem to register on the Asset category. I can only shake my head at steam as I wonder who let this pile of crap go through. I also shake my head at Derek Smart, for being unable to make an actualy game ever.			"

												All right, let's get the obvious out of the way. Derek Smart is an unsufferable (insert your favorite expletive here). That being said, UC is a piece of work of the depth that has only been attempted to be matched in X. Note, I didn't say quality. X is a much more *polished* game. But for sheer variety of things to do, you absolutely cannot beat UC. Are the controls absolutely alien? Sure. Is the manual thick enough to be used as a doorstop for the front doors of Cambridge? You bet. But this was a computer game made for a day when the average user's attention span lasted longer than a game of Flappy Bird, and that speaks volumes more about today's *users* than it does about Derek Smart or any of his games. To anybody who reads this review, I'd like to point something out to you: The users who are panning this game are doing so on one of two things. Derek Smart, of which I will not disagree, and the clunky interface. I don't disagree that the interface is unintuitive, but if you can't figure it out, then the problem is with you, not the game.To edit, now that I've got 15 hours in the game (and roughly thirty hours from before, when I stumbled across a demo version pre-Steam), I stand by my initial statements and say that Elite and Star Citizen (and hell, even X, which is my favorite space sandbox) could stand to learn a lot from this game. There's no game that succeeds at this scale--not even Star Citizen, which is going to restrict you to one ship that you buy, and the rest are behind exponentially-higher paywalls. How does that make for a sustainable business model? Translation, it doesn't. I may even walk back the statements I said that Derek Smart fully-deserved his title. If you had been subject to the hatred of a thousand suns simply for making a game you enjoyed that was then wrenched from your hands by a publisher that gave no whits about what you thought, I'd be surprised if you handled yourself with the aplomb Derek has. I'm sure you'll call me a shill now, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love UC, simple as that.			"

												This game (if you can even call it that) is garbage plain and simple. While being free i still feel like i've been ripped off. Various bugs from blue screens of death to constant crashes, leads me to believe this was just some cash grab when it was released, gameplay is clunky. AI non existant, Gameplay rubbish. Save your self some time and don't waste your time downloading this junk.Pros:- Erasing this pile of garbage from your hard drive.Cons:- Feeling ripped off even though it was free, what a massive pile of garbage.- Downloading it- Playing it (More on this below)- OH LOOK 99pg manual (Derek smart, apparently spent more time writing that than actually working on the game)- Bugs bugs and bugs (LIke bugs? Add this as a pro then)- Crashes all the time (Surprise blue screen of death time)- Graphics (Terrible, think of the pictures 5yr olds draw and imagine it being smear'd all over you wall)- Gameplay (Watching your screen saver fade to black and white is better than the gameplay in this)- AI (Does not exist)- Everything... While i would like to say something nice about this, there's just nothing nice about it. It is complete garbage that is not worth the download....

												Eng/EspWhen I saw this game free on Steam I knew nothing had changed, I download it in order to see by myself if my feelings were true and sadly I was correct, ten years after my last session with this game nothing has changed, all bugs, graphics and poor gameplay are the same. I'll uninstall it after send this analysis.Cuando vi este juego gratis en Steam supe que nada había cambiado, lo descargué para ver por mí mismo si mi impresión era cierta y tristemente lo fue, diez años después de la última vez que lo jugué y nada ha cambiado, los bugs, gráficos y jugabilidad son los mismos. Lo desinstalaré después de enviar este análisis.			"

												Yes, yes I know .8 hours played, I downloaded the free version years ago and it has to be said, when the game works and you understand what's going on, the game is great... that happens .8% of the time, I've been playing games since I was about 4, I've even gone so far as to learn game development and programming so I know a bit about what goes into making a game. That being said, this Steam updated version of Universal Combat is a downgrade. It ran once and even then it crashed after about 20-30 minutes, the rest of my .8 of an hor was spent trying to get the game to work, don't get me wrong I love the premise of the game, I have fond memories of playing this around the time it originally came out (presteam) but as it stand I wouldn't but this game. I wouldn't but the Lyrius Conflict either if it uses the same engine (which reading some of the reviews, it must) To Mr. Smart, I respect you, I really do, you have vision and a drive to create an experience that hasn't been seen before but you must, at some point, be willing to admit you messed up. I understand getting offended when someone inults your baby that you've spent years creating, but you should NEVER call potential customers idiots, cause even an idiot will buy a game and if its not good, if it's not up to par, or content has been left out, eventually they will work out who bamboozled them.

												For the quick one sentence summary, skip to the ""VERDICT"" section.NOTE: This review was based on a very brief first impression, but that impression was enough to tell me that I have no interest in ever looking at this game again, nevermind trying to play it. FIRST IMPRESSION For a game released (or rather, remastered) in 2015, this game severely lacks polish. The first thing you will see is an intro card with the developer's name (3000AD) in a very oddly shaped window (There's black bars at the top and bottom of the intro card). Then the game pops into fullscreen at the default resolution of... 1024x768... okay... I really don't know why so many games default to 4:3 resolutions when 16:9 is much more common, but whatever. Naturally, my next step was to find the options menu and change my resolution to something more palatable. The options menu itself is extremely awkward and disorganized (the audio options are directly beside the graphics options with no separation). After glaring at it for a minute or two (and noticing that there's no way to change key bindings or play in windowed mode), I finally find the resolution, click the right arrow affiliated with it several times until I got to 1920x1080. I maxed out all the rest of the graphics options, pressed save (nothing happened), then exited the options menu and... the game crashed.Take two, launch the game, watch the intro card again (since I'm not aware of a way to skip it), and at least the game saved my settings. Now, I can finally try to play the game. After looking through the menus for a bit, I find the tutorial scene, boot it up, and... well... the game started, I guess. I was provided with absolutely no information as to how to play the game or what I was supposed to be doing. I think the arrow keys change what direction your ship is going, or maybe just the direction you're facing, but I don't know. I tried messing around with it for a few minutes and couldn't figure out how to do anything. I couldn't even figure out how to quit the game (aside from tabbing out and forcing it to crash).From what I gathered, it's highly recommended that you read through the 90 page manual before you even run the damn game. Um... no. I have way better things to do with my time than read a rather lengthy manual on how to play a video game that so far has given me absolutely no reason to want to play it, especially if the tutorial document is going to insult my intelligence every step of the way. VERDICT The game's mechanics, gameplay, menus, UI design and tutorial (AKA the manual) are extremely archaic and don't hold up to modern standards of video games.Also, apparently the developer stopped updating the free version of the game due to the negative reviews, so that's cool.

												(I've played this game long before it came on steam, hence the very low playtime on record)I'd love to recommend this game. I really would. I actually really enjoy it. I can't, though. I think there's something to be said about the hivemind downrating the living hell out of this game. It really boils down to poor explanation and implementation. The idea behind the game is fantastic, moreso that Smart actually more or less accomplished the scope of the game. Its the ultimate space adventure - command a super carrier complete with awesome offensive weaponry, crew, fighter pilots, and marines. Launch invasions of planetary bases from orbit, or make planetfall and glass the damn thing yourself.When you get to the knitty gritty, though, that's what things start to fall apart. How the hell do I fly this thing? Alright, lemme dig up this 99 page manual... which, lets be real - I love a game with depth but I'm not in school and I'm not here to read a fat♥♥♥♥♥manual. Not everybody is like me, either, and won't spend hours of frustration learning it the 'fun' way. They'll just give up, instead. Which they do. I think a proper tutorial would go a long way to explaining to the player what they need to know.The controls feel awfully stiff, too. Spacecraft don't really fly like spacecraft... or aircraft, for that matter. Rolling in atmosphere doesn't change your heading at all, and your yaw authority is waaay higher than it should. Add in a fudged up sense of scale (good luck hitting something moving that fast) and atmospheric combat is nigh impossible except between capital ships.I won't even get into the ground combat. It certainly has it. What little I've experienced of it is enough for me to know I can't review it without sounding scathing.Its a shame. I want to give this a thumbs up. I've actually had fun learning how to play it, and if it were just the learning curve I'd say don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and go right in. Sadly, its more than that, and for that I have to give Smart a failing grade.			"

												Okay First I have to say that this review is fairly neutral however i have to rate it so I am rating it based on my experience. Let me start off with saying that this game looks awesome when you get in. The potentail fun you can have looks pretty endless. My main problem with this game however was the fact it froze up on me often the most I actaully played was a handful of minutes. This may have just been my computer not having enough processing power or high enought specs to run this game which is a real possiblilty. Overall This review is just to say It looks great however If you cant play it after alot of tries I suggest you either change your computer or move on. This game did not appear to have many people with this problem as when i searched for any forum or information board with a solution I could'nt find much. Great looking game however if you cant really play it I dont recommend it.Kinda obvious but thats my two cents.Please keep in mind this doesn't mean its a bad or good game I just can't judge the gameplay much yet.This is a addition to this review: the game has recorded me playing it for 40+ hours and I know for a fact I have not played that much.

												It's everything it ever was.  Impenetrable, impossibly difficult, buggy, and awesome.  Despite the quirks, the game is extremely deep.  The negative reviews of the game come largely from people who didn't play it.  You do have to invest some time in the game to get something out of it, but it's rewarding when you discover new things.  Unfortunately, the game's ambitious grasp has always exceeded its technical reach, and there are still some crashes and bugs.  Saving early and often is key to avoiding frustration.  If you put the time into it, read and re-read the manual, and don't expect a hand-held tutorial, UC can be a deeply rewarding experience.			"

												This was my expereience with my very first 3000ad title.- Installed Universal Combat CE- Started it up - crashed after 3000ad logo- Started up a 2nd time - crashed again after the logo- Started it up 3rd time! Guess Third times the charm.- Changed screen resolution from 1024 x 768 (who the hell uses THAT anymore??) - crashed- Started up for the 4th time, seems it saved my screen res, but there was no 1920x1200, has to go with 1920x1080 :(- Made a character and decided to do some free roam, check it out.The graphics on this game are extremely dated, I understand it came out in 2004, but BF2142 came out in 2006 and BLOWS this game away in terms of graphics. I would think for a ""remastered collection"" the dev would put a little time and money into updating the graphics. Seeing how this is the ""spiritual successor to the infamous Battlecruiser series "" I would not doubt at all if this uses the same engine and graphical assets. Figure after 10 years the dev would have solved the CTD after their logo....UI is clunky and in the end utter garbage. Controls make ZERO sense. Figured WASD would control the ship, nope. Had to use the arrow keys, but left and right only rolled the ship, had to use the Q and E keys to turn the shipr ather than roll it... Played for about 10 min, Alt+Tabbed to find this infamous Manual that comes with the game, only to have it crash on me. Loaded back in, tried to play more to give it a fair chance, the space was SO empty, I couldn't get over what looks like 8 bit graphics on the planets, with clouds that are whipping over entire continents in seconds, must be 25,000 mph winds on the surface. Claims to be a 3D space game, this is nothing but a lousy 2D UI over vaste empty space, total cheating. little or nothing 3D here.Couldn't find an easy way to access a menu, so I hit Alt+F4, To myn surprise that enabled mouse controled flight.. Who knew?? In the end, I felt I couldn't handle it, the graphics literally hurt my eyes. Still couldn't find a menu, ctrl+alt+delete... wtf, this is game is using 76% of my i7 at 3.6 gHz, and 6 gb of my ram....In the end, I give this a 0/10, release a 10 year old game onto Steam as F2P then annouce $40 DLC for it... Seems like a pretty shady way around Steams EA rules of needing SOMETHING.Blatant money grab by the dev, don't even bother. "

												I came from playing Battlecruiser Millenium Gold, and I found that most of the changes to Universal Combat seem to be cosmetic with improved graphics and a slightly modified interface, although there may be more substantial improvements internally as well such as support for modern joysticks. Regardless, it plays essentially the same with only a few keystroke command changes, and in my view it is still a fantastic game. Let me start by stating the obvious: this game is not for everyone, not by a long shot. First off, you need to read the extensive manual. There are just no shortcuts here to be had as you have to invest the time to learn the commands and various interfaces, preferably while having the game running in front of you so you can try out what you learn. And even then you will likely frequently refer back to the manual for the more esoteric stuff. It is a complex game with a steep learning curve, but for a reason, which is that you get to control every facet of your ship and its assets, down to the location of each crew member and their various assignments. You are truly the captain of your ship, and the better you know her the more enjoyment you will get out of the game. On top of that, there are a lot of addtional things you can do like first person piloting of a fighter, shuttle, or rover, or even walk on the surface of a planet and engage in exploration or combat. You can  create concerted attacks on planetary bases by marines on the ground with close air support from fighters and tactical bombing from orbit. You can mine planets to collect valuable minerals for trading in space ports. Or you can just roam the galaxy on a 5 year mission to explore new worlds and new civilizations :) To put it another way, a vivid imagination is a pre-requisite as well as a willingness to immerse yourself in the experience. With time, you will develop a fondness for your crew and an attachment to your ship, the hallmark of a true captain... Now for the detractors out there, this game plays just as advertised. I have yet to experience a serious bug with it and it delivers what it promises. The impression I get from reading many of the negative reviews is that either the reviewers have not taken the time to really learn the game because of its apparent initial complexity or were more suited for different types of games such as Elite Dangerous or its ilk. Universal Combat (and its predecessors) is a monumetal achievement that has no equal in its breadth and capabilities, and for under $10 it is a total steal. Nonetheless, if you prefer to try the game first, then Battlecruiser Millenium Gold is available as freeware and will run perfectly under Win 7 to Win 10 as long as it is set to Win 98 compatibility. And if you are still hesitant, consider reading the Starcarrier SF series from Ian Douglas, as it will give a real feel of what this game is all about.			"

												This....is a TRUE Derek Smart game. It downloaded and installed pretty quickly. Started out just fine, except for the window the game was in and graphics settings. Go in to settings to change the resolution to 1920x1080, hit save, and crashes to desktop.Start the game again, and it starts in same small window, with the same initial resolution. Screen goes black. I'm thinking it's going to crash again, but after 15 seconds, game pops up at 1920x1080. At least it saved that part before it crashed. Start the ROAM mode to do the tutorial. Start the tutorial, and everything starts ok. Leave the computer for a few minutes to help one of the kids with homework. I come back to the computer to find myself looking at the desktop. In the short time I was gone, the game crashed again. Next step, uninstall.I'd like to be able to talk about the gameplay, but didn't really get to experience any. I'm not sure what part of this game was remastered, but it wasn't the graphics. They just look....old. The sound was ok, but I could see how the music could aggravate some people.I know I'm going to be told it's not the game, it's my setup, but my computer is well above what it recommends, and I don't have any problems like this with any other Steam games.Overall, I would suggest avoiding this ""game.""

												Do not get this game.Nothing is explained to youControls are confusingWhat is even happeningFine, maybe I lack the fine taste in games of this lucicrous complexity, having been spoiled by brilliantly made adventures that only use six buttons, but seriously?Apparently this is supposed to bring new players into this genre. Problem is, this game can almost be classified as user hostile. I had Starbound running alongside this, and for whatever reason, this game tried to force Starbound and its 2D 16bitesque engine to load the 3D character I was working on in this game.How do you even do that?Now, call me an uncultured swine or whatever, but knowing nothing of this universe or the species that inhabit it, I chose everything based off how cool it looked. The scenerio initially given explained jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I instantly felt lost.Wasn't this game released in 2009?I'm sorry, these graphics just scream budget N64/PS1 game to me. I actually have several N64 games that look better than this, no, my ENTIRE N64 collection looks better than this. I do not think I own a single game on PC or any console that looks worse than this. It should also be noted that I possess several games designed for 8 and 16 bit systems, but at least they look nice, given hardware limitations.As for the sound, what sound?Allow me to end this review with an abridged version of all that:When you can't quite figure out how to move forwards, you know something is wrong.This game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥br>This game plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥br>GOOD LORD HOW MANY PAGES OF INSTRUCTIONSOVER 200 YOU SAYNO THANK YOUGOODBYEDO NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPER			"

												Worst game i've ever played. Its over complex without reason, crashes at every given oppertunity, extremely limited and repetative gameplay despite the vastly useless array of controls. Traveling from point to point on a planet is ridiculously slow and space travel is utterly disgraceful.  I frankly find the fact this game is released on Steam an utter disgrace, after some research about the game i found there are versions sold for 25$?! Who on earth would ever pay to play this monstrosity. I would advise anyone reading this not to waste their time in downloading it. Secondly, i call for this game to be removed from Steam. Its an absolute disgrace.			"

												I have never played any of the games in this series so I came into Universal Combat: CE fresh. Quite enjoyable so far! Has a brick wall learning curve, but I love the fact that there are so many interesting game mechanics that work together brilliantly. Its fun working through the tutorial and game manual to work out all the systems and how to use them efficiently. The amount of gameplay options available to the player is absolutely incredible! Universal Combat: CE is free so theres no reason not to try it (just make sure you read the manuals :))			"

												This game offers bucket loads of space command ship immersion. You are a commander on a large spaceship complete with fighter ships, shuttle craft and a crew that you have to manage. The game interface and controls are hard to learn and you'll need to read the manual but for a game like this it is great that it has so much depth. You'll probably get lost on your first play but it's worth sticking with. As this is an old game re-released the graphics are dated now but still they are still good enough to enjoy the game. I recommend giving this game a try if you like space games, just be patient with the initial learning curve.			"

												I recommend this game with a 'but'. The problem most people have is obviously accessibility. You must read the manual, at least, if not a mysterious 90 page tutorial that I've yet to locate. Also the missions take a while to play through and some of the menus are less than intuitive. On the upside, it's a pretty space combat simulator. I stress the words: Combat Simulator.			"

												Ok, i don't like reading and i have an attention span the size of a pencil tip...... so needless to say i don't like this game. I know i know, I haven't even played it for 45 min. Like i said, you have to read ALOT of stuff and memorize alot of commands. So why am i recommending this game? I may not like it but i don't hate on a game just cause i don't like it. I can tell alot of effort was put into this game and the realisim is actually there. Think if you will, you just take command of a ship. Your not going to know immediately how the hell to work everything, so you have to read the manual. It's not like most space games where you fly to a planet and you immediately request docking clearence then get accepted and dock all in a few min. You yourself have to request clearence then wait for a response and if you're cleared then you can land. The shields aren't always magically on, you have to turn them on. Basically this game has zero hand holding when it comes to the controls. You have to sit there and read them then try them out and memorize them. Don't be like me, i made the mistake of turning of my ships main reactor and everyone died :(  (still can't believe i did that). The point is this  is an actual space simulation game and i gotta applaude the creator for this. Most realistic space sim ever. But just not for me. So if you want, yes you have to WANT, to sit through a long manual and memorize the controls this is the game for you. If you want to actually be in command of your own ship where you must do everything yourself, this is the game for you. If you want a true space sim game, this is definetly the game for you. Damn fine work on this game.			"

												I've played all of the battlecrusier games for many years. After the learning curve, the game is very engaging. It is now mid 2016 and I have YET to find a game with this much depth and freedom. This is a game where you have to think in order to suirvive. With all the 4x space games out there now, and all the FPS out there now, this is the one game where you can create your own playstyle. You can go from taking over a starstation to invading a planetary defense system. You can steal enemy craft and even use their own air defense against them. You can be a sniper or have a crew of snipers watch your back as you lead a team of 40 marines into battle. Of course you have close air support knocking down everyting in the sky or any tanks on land that are a threat. And I'm just scratching the surface. You captain a capital ship with up to 8 fighters at your disposal. These fighters increase their skills as they fly missions. Then of course there's shuttles that your AI can take to either drop off mining drones to mine valuable minerals on planets or sent them to tow abandoned or damaged ships including your cap ship. OR you can cripple an enemy ship and send your crew out to tow it to the nearest friendly starport for a nice reward and experience points.  And I'm just scratching the surface.You can leave your command chair and hop in one of your fighters to get in the fray while your flight officer, combat officer, and other staff will continue to pilot the cap ship and keep her on course to her destination. You can have up to 7 AI fighters as your wingmen to help you attack several enemy targets. Or you can have your cap ship engage in multiple targets with powerful beam weapons or fire and forget missles to engage multiple hostile fighters. Or you can command a fleet of cap ships as a supreme commander to completely overwhelm any opposing forces. And I'm just scratching the surface.You can have your cap ship orbit a planet and target a military base below. You can then lauch a space to surface missle to destroy sensitive installations or destroy an entire base... all while you're on the planet watching the mushroom plum from miles away. Or you can setup a strike teamy, just outside their early warning system, order a couple of fighters to 'soften' the targets. take out the early warning system, knock out their barracks and air to surface units... then come in with your best marines, tanks and ATV's take over the base... and of course, you can pilot any of the vehicles, or just sit on a distant hill and watch it all unfold through powerful binoculars. You can even take a reserve crew and have one of your shuttles drop them quietly behind enemy lines for a sneak attack while the ememy is focused on your main attack. And if you ever find yourself stranded on a planet or somewhere in space, you can always call for one of your shuttles to come and tow you back to your cap. OR if you're near a friendly base, 'borrow' one of their shuttles and fly back home. AND I'M JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE.I didn't even mention the management, repair and upgrades of your vehicles, the leveling up of troops, dealing with intruders attempting to sabotage or steal your assets, trading, hiring.... the list goes on.Now, if anyone can find a game, past present or future that is able to pull this off, I'll gladly pay top dollar to add it to my library. But I must warn you. You will be hard pressed to find such a Gem.I own many games from  Sins of a solar empire, Elite Dangerous, Distant worlds, Xcom, Stardrive (1 and 2), X3 Terran conflict, X Rebirth, Horizon, Space Empires V... but I always end up going right back to Universal combat. I have invested many, MANY hours into this game and will continue to do so until someone can come out with a game that comes close... perhaps star citizen?? (I sincerly doubt it... not for the price)Believe me, I check often. I wait for the day the dev comes out with a new facelift to this wonderful addiction.			"

												The best spaceSHIP simulator I know of.Yeah, I played Freespace and X series, not to mention Wing Commander (Privateer spinoff).  They all are fine but there you always command what is effectively a fighter.  And if you came to UC with the same assumption you will, you were, sorely disappointed.The UC is not for everyone.  First off, you *have* to Read That F*ing Manual, period.  Otherwise you will not know not just how to do what you are supposed to do, but even what you are supposed to do in first place.  And you are supposed to no less than to take care of your SHIP, a spaceship.  With her crew, equipment, armament, subsystems and so on, all while cruising through the emptiness of space.  It's not like it's SpaceCimCity.  It's more like being in shoes of Captains Kirk, Picard or Janeway.  The level of micromanagement is overwhelming at the beginning but in time I found it lands in my personal sweet spot where it is enough of it to keep the game engaging and not enough of it to be bogged down.If you prefer quick fast paced action you may want to stay away from this game, that's fine.  Though if you want to have the feeling of being actual captain, give it a chance despite the learning curve.  Besides, every skip' had to learn his ropes, and it always took time.P.S. I have clocked so little here just because nowdays I don't have that much time to play this game.  But I had spent my deal playing earlier versions starting from BC3K, through BCM and ending on non-Steam UC.  I wish I could play it more but alas, priorioties and obligations IRL.			"

												I bought the DLC with the added fixes and campaigns, but this applies to the free version as well since they are fairly similar (well for the moment).I used to play Battlecruiser Millennium a few years ago yet I still needed to refresh my memory - the interface and controls are not intuitive, but after reading the manual and tutorial, and playing for a few hours, they become functional. Once past that stage, the game can be truly appreciated for its massive scope and the freedom it gives the player as a captain of a huge spaceship. The sense of scale is exceptional  - I sometimes land my 1 km carrier at a planet only to go outside and walk besides it, or go for an EVA near a huge star station and zoom out. This is awesome stuff  (yes even if the first person mode is less than stellar. But then this is mostly a space sim and a unique one at that).I must say I actually find this game pretty. It is dated, but the lighting, textures and models are very nice and atmospheric (see my screenshots). The design of the ships looks realistic with visible launch bays, bridge, etc. Being mostly a hard core flight simmer I like these small touches.In the Captain career, being able to manage the crew, the ships resources and smaller crafts (fighters and shuttles) appeals to me a lot and I don't think it can be done at this level in other games. There is plenty of stuff to do in the huge galaxy in roam mode - trading, space combat, mining, planet ops...I can also say stability has improved since the initial Steam release and it is not an issue anymore. And I have been playing quite a lot lately.If you like space sims and aren't afraid complex games ignore the bashing and give it a try. Truly highly recommended.(PS I'm looking forward to the added features of the DLC, especially the 3D bridge - that sounds like a blast).			"

												Don't mind the whiners. This game will appeal to those who want the REAL experience.  This game is a simulator. And it's an ambitious one. It's a space civilization simulator, a universe warfare simulator, a complete capital ship simulator (think Picard in command of the Enterprise), a weapon and tactical simulator, a weather system simulator, a planet environment simulator, and MUCH MUCH MORE. The scale of this game is amazing. It's horrendous that it's received such unfair reviews. You name it, IT IS HERE. If you want to live in an alternative universe and be a starship captain, where whole alien empires clash, then THIS IS IT. The people who claim that the game is a ""failure"", are the ones who were too lazy to spend the hours needed to read and learn the manual, because if you don't do that, you probably will be going nowhere fast. You need to be committed, you need to want to really be the captain of a large starship, and you need to really want to be in charge of all the systems it would have to offer. This isn't Star Trek Online for kiddies. This is the real deal. There are no second chances, and there is no easy dumbed down mode for the whimpy. You either know what you are doing or you are caput. Can't be afraid to start over. This is Dwarf Fortress for starship captains.			"

												Dsmart i have to give a review to all the idiots posting a review and to any new guys looking at this.   First off check the amount of time played by the bone heads giving a negative review,  Now look at the guys giving a postive review and what there game time is... .  Here is ur sign    Guys who fail to follow directions are complete idiots and get lost in about five seconds of playing, get frustrated give up and then go talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game...  guys who know how to read... unlike so many on here...  it says read the friken directions this game is complex and very indepth, if you dont have the time to read the manuel, then you dont have the time to play this game.   This game is for serious players who actually want an indepth capital ship command game, not a point click and shoot first person shooter that most these young babies are used to.    Im a huge fan of this style of video game and glade Dsmart is trying to bring it back to life,   If the babies on this review could take the time and actually read what the game is about and learn how to actually play the game then there tears would stop and they might find themselves addicted with the regular hard core players,   DO NOT GIVE A REVEW IF UR NOT GOING TO EVEN TRY TO PLAY THE GAME.

												This game is amazing, so immersive and fun! You are given a ship and a mission to handle how you please, whether you like flying a stealth approach to kill your target or go in guns blazing. Patience and planning is rewarded when you have a fleet at your disposal to siege enemy space stations to capture them or blast them to dust. You can lead troops on the ground in an assault on an enemy base, fly air support in a fighter jet or level the site from orbit with Orbit to Surface missiles. Fighting too much for you? You can always grab a trade ship and make your fortune in the space lanes hoping to outrun or hide from raiders who would steal your stuff. Or be the raider and just attack everything in hopes of scoring it rich! You play how you like and make your own story.			"

												In a nutshell, this is a sandbox, free-roam, STARSHIP simulator.You can do scenarios/missions, if that is your cup of tea.But you can go off and do whatever you want and that freedom the game offers can feel overwhelming.KEEP in mind, this IS AN OLD GAME. Another point: this game is an indie game. No big studio behind it, but as an indie game, like many indie games, it tries to do something original and outside the ""generic"" genre of games we have to pick from all too often. But this game, specifically, *to-date*, there are very few games that yet to come anywhere close to what it has accomplished.Did I mention this is an old game? It's also a very complicated game. There is a very helpful tutorial and manual.I put a lot of emphasis on the word SIMULATOR. This is not Wing Commander or Freelancer.This is like Jane's F-15 or Falcon 3.0 type overly-complicated simulator games back in the day.Any fan of the prior games will feel at home if they had mastered the controls.The controls take getting used to, but the GUI/mouse interface let's you do most things from the HUD alone now.You can mouse to the shields to raise lower, or partially, or mouse to the MFD displays and toggle various modes if you don't want to use the Hot-Keys. What do you do this in this game? Whatever you want. Pick a ""career type"" which pretty much establishes what ships you can opt to start out with and where and who your enemies will be; and then launch into space.You micromanage your crew, ship, supplies, but once you get the hang of the controls, you'll appreciate it, there is a lot you can do and a lot of you can keep track of and you might be surprised.Remember in Star Trek, the captain might want to take a shuttle down to a planet to explore and take some bridge crew or officers or whoever with him? YOU CAN DO THAT. You can make personnel report to a shuttle, leave your mothership, fly to some planet way over HERE or THERE, actually fly down to the surface. From there, you can deploy a mining drone, or go take one of your combat vehicles for a spin, or get out and go for a stroll. What to do on the planet? Not much, mining is important and useful. OR, you can go to a city or base and blow it up. The sheer fact you can do this in the game is great. The game doesn't have a fancy polish and I'm sure some will be offput by the execution of some of the features. This an old game, complicated, indie title, so it might feel clunky, shoddy, but it works (no CTDs for me so far). Some people will think going to planets is boring, seems desolate, but I don't know any other game where that is different (take Evochron: Mercenary for example which is quite bare-bones gameplay wise).Once you launch your ship for the first time, you might say: UH OK, now what. This is no X, this is no Elite:Dangerous, but let's you still do a hell of alot more, and as such, the game leaves a lot open to the imagination.PROS:-Familiar controls for those fans of the series-Good ship designs-Lots of things to do, manage crew, track their movements, keep your ship supplied, managed craft-Tons of interface screens, TACOPS lets you play in a sort of RTS style (can't control mouse/seemless zoom style, its a bit different but useful); when in doubt, use the TACOPS feature, it will become your friend.-Land on planets, deploy vehicles, run around like an idiot shooting everything (fun)-Not much to do on planets except mine and shoot everything (lol) or just explore it (cuz it's there!)-Very detailed HUD, MFD's, if you are micromanager and want to know everything, this is it.-Non-NPC spawning mode so newbies can tinker around with the game who otherwise might get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out the door for the first time-Improved graphics-Space Combat feels streamlined, and its rewarding when your starship goes up against another and you blow them and their support ships to pieces-The HUD display with MFDs you can pull up in FPS mode is awesome, can scan for all sorts of targets. This is the kind of detail I like in games.-I found the AI more responsive in this incarnation. I ejected from my starship and my ship flew off. Went to TACOPS, ordered it me, and to halt. It responded very well. In maybe BC3K v1.0 or 2.0 it might ignore me and fly 1,000,000,000,000,000 km away (my bad for not preparing the AI a/p mode in advance, oops LOL).-You can control just about everything with your mouse through the HUD because it is interactve (so you don't have to rely on hot-keys)-As an older game, graphics performance is good even on lower end computers these days-You'll have lots of great and sometimes stories to tell others about your adventures/events that happen in the game (shut down launch bay power due to intruders on board, assigned marines to guard shuttles, intruder managed to fight them, steal a shuttle with injured marine on board I had to go chase after lol)-IT'S FREE! (*update*: not anymore, but it's low-price, and still worth it).CONS:-Can't re-bind keys-You'll need to study the controls and features, require some patience-Control customization is limited-Controls will take non-veterans of the series sometime to master (not that hard ones you get used to it)-I miss from BC:M being able to walk on the hull of any space object (Star Trek: First Contact-style)-Intruders beaming aboard with shields up still a random nusiance.-BIGGEST GRIPE: Jumping to a target, especially star bases, leaves you too far away, ships fly too slow, and there is no afterburner/turbo boost mode like in the past versions of the game---sorely needed so you don't spend seemlingly forever trying to cover that last stretch like a turtle. Not too bad with enemy ships but mostly with stations. There is a cheat option that lets you go beyond your ship's limits and can be used as a quasi-afterburner mode though.-It shows its age, not really a problem for me, but the planet graphics seemed to be the weak link, had to fly almost touching the ground just to start seeing trees, horizon looks messed up, and didn't see any graphics options to increase view distance-FPS was rather glitchy when near 3D objects, some areas lack polish (not Polish)-This game will fry the brain of anyone with ADD. LOL.Remember, this game is very detailed and complicated. It's sort of like a combination of Evochron:Mercenary and X, but not nearly as polished and feels more complicated, the trade off being you can do a 100x more things. Ultimately, those games still don't come close to the same versatile free-form gameplay or possessing so many options. There is a trade-off and with UC:CE because it tries to do it all and give the players greater control/options.I expect a good number of people will say ""this let's you do SO MUCH but I only wish it was implemented better"".It is an ACQUIRED TASTE. Like when you have your first beer or wine, or shot of liquor, you're like ""ewww, so bitter! why do people even drink this?!"" but before you know it, you become a connoisseur.The developer had a great vision and it's too bad some people have expections like this is Call of Duty in Space or some crap. The game is fairly unique, it has been around a long time for that reason and it has a supportive fanbase through the years; the developer still works to support his vision of this franchise and build upon it after all these years, and that is appreciated.

												This is the only game i have ever seen that allows you to command a starship. Not just fly a starship, and shoot its guns. but Command a Vessel, it's Crew and its assets.Giving you full command of every aspect of your vessel, from the vessels logistics and power use (Can't just have your shields running all the time.. its costing you resources!) To How many tanks should I send down to the surface where I just lost a mining drone.. And should I go down too to better coordinate my teams?Your crew learns to work together, they get stronger, and they must eat.. sleep. rest. Keep them Alive as you travel the stars.Send Probes ahead, Launch escort missions. Away Missions, Mine, Trade, attack space stations, raid cargo vessels, operate tanks, fighters, naval vessels, jetpacks, the choice is yours.  Or send the Evacuation signal and abandon ship.You are in charge, and your life (and your crews) is in your hands.I Love it, If you ever wanted to sit in the captains chair on the bridge of a starship, This is the game.A Great Game! only limited by your imagination.

												I had this game years ago and when it went free on Steam, I had to add it to my library.  Universal Combat lets you do so many things such as ship to ship battles, landing on planets, etc.  It has missions you can do, of if you just want to make a name for yourself, you can do that in ROAM.Be aware though, this is not some easy-to-learn arcade game.  It is a complicated game, but if you invest the time and read the documents, it will be a fulfilling game.			"

It's 02:38 and we are four jumps deep in to Gammulan space. Already we have taken out two enemy cargo ships and an insurgent light cruiser. But when we ran up against an Engstrom, it was all our Warhammer could do to hold off their fighters and get past their laser system to catch up and make the kill.We have damage on all decks, intruders on board, and a third of our marines are dead with more headed to sick bay. We are attempting to land on a moon for repairs and to lay low for a bit. Don't worry; we'll be back.Universal Combat is something of a trip in to the past, and anyone playing it needs to realize that. When I first played this way-back-when, it was probably the most absolutely complicated game I had ever attempted to play, and 14-year-old me really liked having to figure everything out as I went along and really learn how to play this thing. And frankly, that's where the satisfaction is. Universal Combat hails from a time when games really didn't tell you how good you were doing. There were no 'atta-boys. The satisfaction came from realizing that you had figured the game out and were getting good at it.I suggest giving this a try and playing it for at least 6 hours before deciding if you like it or not. I personally enjoy the challenge of not just moment-to-moment ship management, but of the long term planning you can really get in to when determining either a brief patrol of border space or an extended campaign in to enemy territory. What spare parts should I take? Where should I deploy mining drones for resupply? Where can I park for repairs? And I do mean park for repairs; if you make poor choices and take damage, you realistically could be down for hours. It's brutal. But coming through several of those limp-home-and-pray adventures is what builds the narrative in your head and really helps you get in to the game, I think. I might not be able to follow my marine security detail around while they hunt down saboteurs, but damn if I don't stare at the PERSCAN screen and yell obscenities at them anyways. It's not polished, it's not perfect. You'll have complaints. But if you give it a real chance and keep an open mind, you'll probably never forget playing it, and you'll have a totally different sort of fun with it than you do with Planetside 2 or Smite. And hopefully you'll stick around for Derek's next project, because I have a feeling it should be pretty cool.			"

												Lets start with the bottom line.  This game is awesome.  It does have a learning curve, it can get confusing, and if you're afraid of a little light reading, it's probably not for you.  Don't expect to be able to jump in and fumble your way through figuring out what button does what, and be blasting ships out of the cosmos in five minutes.  This isn't Halo.  It's a simulator, and the effort and energy went into allowing you to control and actively manage a huge spaceship, it's crew, and to play with the most dynamic and brilliantly crafted AI I've ever seen.  The graphics and sound effects are not as pretty as others, like Evochron, but despite that, the immersion and enjoyment I personally experience from this game rivals that of GTA 5.  It's an open universe, and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  And though it's not as pretty, there is a lot more of this game to experience than any of it's ""competition"" in the space sim genre.  If you intend to try this game, which I recommend you do, judge it after you complete the tutorial, and realize that this game is an iceburg.			"

												Looking over the game at face value it has some very deep depth if one puts some time into it. I will be following this one for tools, developement and progression. I am from a niche in the space sim combat games. I along with many dev's and beta testers of another game has gone down the road  where they abondoned what worked. Universal Combat CE has some serious depth wanted with many fans I work with. If this available to mod I can see this game getting a large fans base to put lots of time into it by many.Sure it may not be the latest graphics, but it takes a real gamer to see past that at first to what it can become. but that is what a fan base is for! a following and group of people to enhance it IF allowed!!!Look at all the lastest games typical giving up the game creation foundation to look and feel like the compeditor games. after awhile they all look the same, play the same, and no real defining point to stand out. IMHO UC seems to hold on to its original fundamental game base it came from. Now what would it be with some enhancemnt!!!			"

												Very interesting near real time space simulation.   The possibilities seem endless in ROAM where you can follow your imagination.  The game Ai is always creating situations to which I need to address.  I can tailor the game to my imagination.  It gets even more interesting once I gain enough experience to command a fleet.   Those pesky intruders can be annoying especially when there are 20 or more of them running around the ship.   I make It a habit to escort every diplomat that shows up in my zone.  I swear those assassins just wait around cloaked.  They  must all be wearing radiation suits.  I like to hang around NAV jump locations and pick off enemy vessels. "

Posted: July 5, 2015
												I will preface by saying firstly that I am a fan and have been of this game and Battlecruiser 3000 A.D. for years.I purchased the last version of 3000 A.D. then when I saw UC  I had to get it.Back then, I thought it was great.  It barely ran on my laptop but I digged it.The new laptop I have today runs this version pretty well, better than I ever dreamed.I have not run into the old bugs yet, but having identified them in the past it's easy to dodge them until they are fixed.I have been looking for a space sim like this one but they are always too advanced for the hardware that I currently have.BUT not this one.Ender's Game was an excellently written book.  The author started saying it is he who writes and I who fills the void with the imagination and every reader gets a different story in their minds but it is a story crafted along with the author.  I get that a lot with UC.Take a battlecruiser mk. 3 -- a magnificent looking vessel -- and engage any ship you want.  Be anyone you want to be.Even the boring people.It was a vast game with lots of complexities that Starpoint Gemini 2 only barely scrapes the surface of with its ship captures and boardings.  This game, long before SG2, had all that and more.   No, this game is not as ""user friendly"" as SG2 (and that was also a complicated game -- WITH GRINDING), but this game has no grinding.  You get whatever you want and roll with it from the get go.It's like a gigantic permadeth rogue-like space sim, and it was awesome.Yes there are the bugs, but the game was epic so I endured.People hate it because, I am guessing, it was too much work for them to read Derrek Smart's highly entertaining manuals-- where else would you get someone joking about political correctness in a game manual?  Most people want to dive right in, and subsequently when they are overwhelmed they bug out and complain because that is natural for self-entitled people these days (millions of them) to do.Once you master the game, what is there to do?Well, whatever you want to be honest.Is there any story, any girl to rescue?  A sex scene like in the movies?Well, there is a story if you chose one.  There are women in the game.  But if I wanted to watch awesome sex scenes I'd break out some porn or surf the web. Destroying ships or fighters and running to live another day like a good old pirate is awesome enough for me, especially because I do not have to GRIND for my Battlecruiser mk.3!The game is unforgiving but it always had potential and I am surprised and glad to see D.Smart is still at it with this game and I hope he keeps at it.Haters are going to hate.Let them, they are missing out on a great gem here.

												Single-player simulation of military spaceship operations, where the player takes the role of commander on the bridge of a big cruiser or carrier in space. Core features are:1)capital ship command simulator, with complex equipment, AI onboard crew, and AI or player-controlled fighters and vehicles.2)the dynamic world, a big sandbox galaxy with seamless 3D space and planetside warfare.A very good thing about this game is there's no initial grind, because you don't start with a useless piece of junk for a ship like in most other spacesims!But be advised: this is not a shooter/""ww2 fighters in space"" type of game. It's complex, more similar to Eve Online or to a naval sim.  There's a lot to learn that's not presented to you nor obvious.  So if you are into hardcore military sims and have time to put into it, universal combat might be well worth your time.You can begin your military career either with a mission-based tour of duty('acm'), or start in 'roam' mode where you are free to do whatever you wish in the open world.Numerous instant action scenarios are also present.Roam mode especially should be used in a roleplay mindset, so reading the game lore will greatly enhance the experience.Other than fighting your faction enemies and completing acm missions, your might also venture in the usual trading/mining/salvaging/bountyhunt/pirating businesses.You'll be able to capture enemy bases in both space and planets, give orders to fleets of AIs, and your own crew AI will improve making them more effective in their duties.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED READING:-manual appendix (linked at http://steamcommunity.com/app/345580/discussions/0/606068060824451693/ ), which contains descriptions of all ingame items and places, and essential game lore.-battlecruiser faq http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/566167-battlecruiser-3000-ad-20/faqs/24935It's an old faq but still applies, and it has an essential walkthrough of the first campaign.

												An underrated indie gem. Derek Smart deserves credit for sticking to his guns, and sticking with this game. Universal Combat isn't pretty, easy or intuitive. But it's still an unmatched capital ship simulator with an unforgiving '90s-style attitude.This game will not hold your hand (tip: read the manual) or tuck you into bed at night. It's definitely not for everybody. It's about outer space and it wants to kill you. It's a sandbox with the complexity of hardcore naval sims such as Silent Hunter.It's about logistics, space battles, crew management, reactor meltdowns and nuking cities from orbit. You will be boarded, ransacked and the perpetrators will escape in a stolen shuttlecraft.Your ship will be set adrift while on fire.Why Universal Combat MattersI didn't discover this game until recently. I've known about Smart since the early 2000s, but dismissed him and didn't give him a chance. He was a joke, a crank, his games were bad. That's what I thought, but in reality I didn't understand him. Now I do ... I think.Smart is foremost an engineer, as this game reflects an engineer's mindset. It's about spaceships, but it's really about complex systems, taking things apart and figuring out how they work. This has its downsides: Engineers are not celebrated for their empathy and they don't make for great artists. But engineers do make great systems.			"

												It's beautifulIt's stunningIt's realistic...butWHATS THE KEY COMBINATION TO EXIT THE GAME???Did I mention it has worse controls than Octodad? While using the Jetpack outside of your vessel, F goes up and Z goes down.. ESC is to command a target to do something, Alt+F4 switches between the mouse and shooting.I want to have fun but has a very steep learning curve. A couple of videos on Youtube can help but they assume you know what all the abbreviated systems do.There's a program called BCStudio that allows you to view all of the models in UC and Battlecruiser Millenium. It has other features but I've only used it to look at the models.			"

												Bought BC3000 when it first came out and was delighted and frustrated by it in equal measure, so when I saw this on Steam I had to give it a download. I'm not disappointed and will (taking into account the comments below) definitely recommend.Make no mistake, its a complicated and somewhat unforgiving sim that for those new to the franchise can be daunting and difficult to get to grips with. However, underneath those dated graphics lies what is probably still one of the best 'space capital ship sim' games to date...ok, with most space sims being of the more fighter/small ship variety the capital ship sim is a rather niche genre but if the sound of it appeals to you give it a try - it's free, so you really have nothing to lose save a little time and if you're willing to get to grips with its systems you could be pleasantly surprised!

												I like this game. I think it could be better, but I find it very entertaining, It has a high learning curve and the abiltity to micromanage everrything from fighter commands to personnel movments appeals to me. I would like to see ship interiors implemented, I recall Derek stating that it woudl be too much work to implement a few years ago, but I no longer buy that excuse. as I have seen other games implement it. I think that would really add to the game. That said, I realize this game is not for everyone, and from the other reviews I suppose it is not for most people. However, once you have learned all the various commands I think it is very fun.			"

												Let's get this out right now, this game is complex, definitely NOT for the casual space shooter fan. You may see reviews on here saying there is no tutorial, well there is a tutorial free roam scenario designed to be played along with a written tutorial document included. This is a game from the days when you had to read a whacking great manual and tackle a learning curve that was very steep. Once it is learned, however, it opens up a whole galaxy to explore and a myriad of options and things to do. Want to fly around the galaxy looking for a fight? It's here. Want to land troops on a planet with tanks and fighter planes to assault an enemy stronghold? That's here too. Want to take control of those vehicles on the planet surface and get stuck in yourself? Yep you can! You can even land your huge capital ship on any planet/moon and get out for a stroll around taking in the sights. There's trading and mining here as well as salvage from destroyed ships, towing ships in distress to a star station for help, real time movement of crew around the ship, full control of power distribution to all systems on your ship, teleporter to transport men/cargo down to a planet surface, and evac them from the planet and so much more.This game has it all from capital ship command to slugging it out on planets or even the hull of your ship in first person mode, naval vessels and space fighters which can also be flown in the planet's atmosphere to support your ground troops. All this from an indie dev team in the early noughties! The version here on Steam is an overhauled and remastered version of the original 2009 Collectors Edition and to have it here for free is nothing short of amazing. What have you got to lose? Download it now, you won't regret it!!			"

												I play this series since the Battlecruiser Millenium, and love it!I did not play much of this particular release yet, so I cannot say how stable it is. It does not support Alt-Tab, and windowed mode is available but not really supported.UPDATE 11 hours in: The game is very stable. Crashed only once and I could not replicate conditions.As for the game, it is not self contained, meaning that you must read the manual and possibly do the tutorial. This game is an acquired taste and involves a lot of knowledge and study.This game is not really about you dogfighting, even if you can take a planetary defense fighter and pilot it. The meat of the game is the capital ship. Crew management (it simulates where each crew member is and what they are doing, even if you can't walk inside the ship) and other internal management of a capital ship, including a fighter squadron. You can be boarded, coordinate ground operations, pilot shuttles or fighters of your carrier, use orbital missiles, take over enemy space stations and explore a universe that, while not as large as Elite: Dangerous, will take you a long time to explore.Multiple races and occupations will change the game dynamic. There are military carriers, science vessels, trade ships, small fighters and more!As for the Campaign, I never had much interest in it. I rather take a Battlecruiser MK3 and roam around the universe with a reduced risk of court martial.I always had a lot of fun with this game. Maybe this is the one game that inspired me to become a game developer, even if not the best game I ever played. I understand it is not for everyone, but it was for me and I must recommend.			"

tl;dr: One of the best games ever made, in a fresh version, for absoluteley no cost!Universal Combat CE is the latest version of that huge monster of tactical space simulation Derek Smart started with Battlecruiser 3000 A.D. (well known as BC3k). It is the most complex game I have played in my almost 30 years of gaming, so please don't give a warm handfull about those complaining 0.1-hour-kiddies. You have to give it a chance, if space sims are your thing, especially when you prefer to command your own battlecruiser. There's a whole lot to learn, you have to check your fuels and care for your crew, but the possibilities are endless, and so is the fun you can have with this game! And this for as free as free can be!Trust me, I've fired up tons of hours with BC3k and Battlecruiser Millennium back then, and I already love this one! Can't wait for Universal Combat Advanced!Edit: There's a really frightening lack of games like this nowadays, and all you useless premature hater-zombies will never see gamerheaven! :P			"

												I've been playing flight sims since the '80s. Probably that's why I don't find this game as unfriendly as many other players out there. As it was usual in the '80s flight sims, this game requires some work from you. It won't hold your hand throughout the learning process. There is no interactive tutorial and I must say the graphics are not next gen. You have to read the manual and try some times before you understand everything. That's how old farts like me grew accostumed to play computer games in the time where 8 bits were enough for us.So, if you don't like this game, probably it's because it's not aimed at you. I must say this game's been in my hard drive for years now starting from the BC MIllennium version. Everytime I play this game I feel fully immersed in my Battlecruiser command deck. It's hard to learn all the acronyms and how to make it work but, once you learn it, it's a great game.As a bottom line: If you're ready for some work in order to get your reward, give it a try. If you just want immediate satisfaction, there many other options out there.			"

												This game brings back memories.  Yes, it had a troubled release back in 1996 but blame Gametek for that one.  There's not another game in existence that creates this kind of immersive world in a fully modeled futuristic starship along with planetary surfaces, planetary bases, space stations, and moons.  I can land my ship, or take a shuttle, or beam down the surface for a leisurely stroll across a beach or I can drop in with my Marines for a full blown assault on an enemy base. Or I can just hang out on my bridge and ""nuke the site from orbit.""  And that's the endless possibilities of free roam.  I haven't touched on the scripted campaign which can be tough as nails but incredibly fun and rewarding.  The massive space stations that will blow you to pieces with a burst of their weapons, the fact that I can hop into a fighter and duke it out while my capital ship supports me.  Oh, there's also fleet command and control, trading, capturing starstations, ship to ship combat, trading, mining, powerful artifacts that can turn your ship from kick-butt to kick♥♥♥♥♥♥and-take-names-without-breaking-a-sweat style. This game is complex and it requires some time investment to learn the concepts and the systems.  If it helps, think of this game as ""Falcon 4.0"" in space only you aren't flying an F-16 but a half mile long starship with fighters, shuttles, marines, landing craft.  There's a plethora of resources from a well-written manual, tutorial videos, and in game help but make no mistake this is a game that will require some learning but its oh so rewarding.  Don't let my steam playtime fool you, I started playing this game in 1998 with the release of BC3K 2.0 and I can safely say that in the past 17 years no other game has come close to doing what this one does.  If you want to be in command of a futuristic starship (don't think Captain Kirk....this ain't no wimpy Enterprise...more like William Adama) with entire fleets to command and stations to blow up and planetary surfaces to fight on then this game is for you.

												Very excited that this game is released for free on Steam. This is one of my favorite game series of all time. It gets a lot of hate as it is not as polished as it could but that is to be expected from any indie game developer like 3000AD. This game will allow you a level of sand box play that you cannot find any where else. You can leave your ship for any planet surface leading your fighters and tanks into land combat, attack even carriers and fighters in space or in the air, assault a ground base WITH your assault ships, attack space stations, lead entire fleets of ships, the list goes on and on and on. The game tracks the location of every single one of your crew members inside your ship so you know exactly who is where (And sometimes intruders will attack your ship and storm you bridge, killing your commander or other important crew) You can take command of any asset in the game as the commander and is the ultimate mode, with ACM being the hardest but most rewarding version of the roam mode. You can also do a ton of missions to get used to the different controls and get a taste for life as various prats of your fighting force. Yes the game isn't perfect, but there is no other game out there that allows you to do the things you can do in this game, trust me!			"

												The *only* game of its kind.Captain a space carrier, a space cruiser, or a simple trading vessel.  Travel the universe.  Fly fighters if you wish or take part in a ground assault.  Fly to distant planets in other solar systems, exit your ship, and go swim in an ocean.Repel boarders from your ship.  Attack enemy ground bases with a combined force of aircraft, marines, and ground vehicles.  Gain experience for yourself and your crew so that you can assemble and control a fleet of starships.Play ""instant action"" scenarios, such as being the squad leader of a marine section whose transport just crashed near an enemy base who must escape the area.  Or become a sniper with the task of taking out an important enemy leader before he leaves the planet.  Lead a small fleet to capture an enemy orbiting station.There are campaign scenarios to test your mettle as well as a ""do whatever you want"" free-form game where the computer's AI will attempt to kill you and your crew.You will have to actually read the manual to enjoy the game.

												I played this for awhile years ago, and was earlier (At the time of writing) looking around for this on the internet. I couldnt remember the name, but imagine my suprise to find it for free on steam released on the exact same game. Yeah, this still has the good ol' list of bugs and problems. And the list can be extensive for some. But c'mon, I've yet to find a game that allows you to have two fleets duking it out in orbit, while ground, air, and naval units fight for control of the surface.And of course, this grand scale of things is not without its drawbacks. Before you even start playing you better be prepared for almost two hundred pages of reading. It's very confusing at first, and even when you get the hang of things bugs and problems lurk around every corner. But all in all this is a great game for its time.Now, when the advanced edition and the MMO come out sometime in the next two or so years, those are lookig very, very good.			"

												Universal Combat seems like a decent game. Really I bet its a great game for all the people who take the time to learn it. See its one most crippling feature is at least in most part the fact that it has a really terrible tutorial. The tutorial is all in text and from what I can see pretty hard to grasp with a quick once over. Universal Combat seems to be pretty complicated. If you do intend on playing my best advice is for you to read over the giant text tutorial, not once, but twice. Be prepared to go back to it many times when you forget a keyboard shortcut ot command or something. Other than that, try to have fun. its not often we get a game as detailed/ complicated as this released for free on Steam.			"

												This game is so advanced, it doesnt even have the escape key bound! Theres so much to do, even exiting the game is it's own mini game! Wana open up the in game tutorial? Guess which key combo you have to press. Want to close it? Good luck, because it's a different key combo! No need for common sense here or context sensitivity, we had that in 1998... We've obviously moved on. Key features:-Overly complicated controls!-FPS vertical mouse controls inverted by default!-No way to change that in game!-Mediocre graphics (even for its time!)-Punishes those Alt Tabbers by breaking the game, and locking up the rest of their computer! No one will be using those pesky PDF's the game doesnt give you any hint of while playing the game that you need to play the game! -Escape key doesnt bring up the escape menu! Or do anything!-Infact, there's no escape menu at all as far as anyone can tell!-Like tutorials? You'll love Universal Combat's 97 page tutorial!-In game tutorial is just a document that's blurry so you cant even read! You didnt need it anyway, right? Usable tutorials are so soft core these days.-Reconfigurable keys? That's so yester millenia!-Uses your imagination! Nothing is contextualized, pretend that your doing whatever it is your doing!-Universal Combat is a HARDCORE space sim! Fully featured with terrible controls and unintuitive UI! You'll struggle to remember how to perform even basic functions!Dont miss out, you'll want to experience this master piece in full. And for the low low price of absolutely nothing, you can!			"

												I will say this is one of those ""Complicated Games"" even after skimming through the 97 pages of the index that you reach with control-H and is pretty much the excuse for a tutorial it was difficult to understand. However i enjoyed trying to figure out the controls and i loved how complicated it was. Honestly for a 2004 game its pretty dam good, though the lack of tutorial makes it difficult.  I found it amusing for a while, Maybe ill look at this game later on when the new version with good graphics is out, Hopefully still free, Because honestly it would be a waste of money to buy a game like this unless your willing to spend time to learn how to play it. Pros-Advanced ControlsOpen World TypeProbably one of the best space simulators ive seenCons-Graphics are pretty terrible, but it is a 2004 game97 Page Manual is not fun to readThe Controls are a bit wacky, I mean holding shift to go up and down? I would rather use the shifts for changing speed. Neutrals/RecommendationsI suggest some kind of spaceship builder when the new game is coded, Itll appeal to more peopleKeep the new game free, It would be better to gain reputation off a game like this then moneyAdd more scenariosAdd a dam tutorialMake the 97 page manual a bit smaller with only 1 keybind to get to it.Lets admit its pretty bad, But it has good potentional, Good coding behind it, and of course the lovely advanceness			"

												This game is easy, anyone who thinks it's hard to play is a total moron and the kind of person who would have trouble playing Tetris.Wanna jump someone? Click where and press shift-9. Ohh so difficult. Morons.For those with less brain cells than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ goldfish you can always just alt-H and read the manual.With that said, this game is so unbelievably fun. It shows its age, sure. But I'd take gameplay over graphics. [Edited out the AI remark, as this remastered version that problem seems to have been fixed)It'd be fun if you could communicate with other ships in your sector too, or in roam mode if they had random events like a ship calling an SOS or picking up a VIP etc.But as a space capital ship combat simulator, this is top dog #1, when you do actually find an enemy ship that wants to attack you it can be intense. Especially since your crew members' AI improves and grows overtime, as you also improve nad grow your commander skills. This makes the fights even more intense.Remember not to engage enemies more smarter than your crew, your pilots, marines etc, they all need to grow their AI skills overtime.I bought this in 2009 when it came out but just downloaded this remastered version out of curiosity, I'm going to go play it now.For people who say it's buggy etc they're all lying. I've only seen ONE bug in this game, and that's when you click on a stargate or ship sometimes it 'unclicks' and you have to click on it again and that can get pretty annoying but it's hardly gamebreaking. Never had it crash on me or anything.Some tips for newbies:-Disable flight launch if you aren't launching. If you get intruders on board they'll run off with your cargo.. and shuttles/fighters!-Use perscan when you have marines on board, and assign them accordingly. ALways PREP FOR COMBAT.-Upgrade your REACTOR before you upgrade your engine.-Buy at GALCOM and sell at MAJORIS-Deploy mining drones on seperate moons/planets. Not only does this make it easier for you to keep track of which shuttle is picking up which drone, but also you get a wider variety of minerals. (Sell at Majoris)-If you see static on your HUD.. CLOAK AND RUN. If you don't have cloak then EMD AND RUN. It's a cloaked enemy ship, possibly fleet, and if they're cloaking it means their AI is probably higher than your crews AI so they WILL get on board or open fire if you don't get out of there. It'll be days, possibly even weeks, before your crew has the skills to take on such an enemy.-Don't attack starbases without a fleet or without friendly nearby ships also attacking.-Regularly stock up on RADINE, PLUTONIUM, NUTRIPAKS-Keep your turrets at 60%, guns at 30% and shields at 25% to conserve energy. Raise shields when enemy is around. Guns should be fine unless you're outnumbered, they're pretty powerful even at those %'s.-Regularly send out a shuttle with the ""Cargosweep"" order. They'll sweep your current & surrounding sectors for ejected cargo pods full of goodies. Be careful though, some pods are booby trapped.-Beam Resnig down onto the most volanic, vile planet you can find.-Keep playing. This is not a fast-paced game. To see any real progress it will take days, not hours.			"

												I really like this game and highly recommend it to anyone who likes old school PC games and simulations. If you ever dreamed of being in command of a space battleship then you should give this game a try. I spent many nights flying through the galaxy role playing as Captain Julian Augustus, Battlecruiser Commander and I can't wait to get a free weekend or three to give it another go. This game is very complex and and takes a while to learn to play it. This game is originally from a time when PC games came in a box and included a detailed and lengthy manual. These manuals were often a treat and included background information, cool artwork, a written tutorial, list of commands, etc. I miss those types of manuals. The tutorial is a PDF file that you print out or read on a tablet while you play through the tutorial scenarios.  I'd recommend doing that. And print out the command reference as well or keep it open on a tablet. The main thing to understand is that this game is deliberately complex. It is designed for someone who wants to feel like they are commanding a real battleship. To get the most out of this game you have to learn to play it and you have to use your imagination and really get into the role playing and the simulation. If you treat it like an arcade style game you're going to get frustrated.			"
