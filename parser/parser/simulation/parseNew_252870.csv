Early Access Review
IntroductionThink FTL but in first person, with other people!Pulsar: Lost Colony is a space combat/exploration game that recently entered early access. In Pulsar you take control of a spacecraft with a crew of five humans/bots and with this spacecraft you explore a huge galaxy filled with danger. As you take on, and hopefully destroy, enemies you’ll be awarded with credits which can be spent on upgrades for your craft to make it far more effective. Pulsar also allows you to send away teams onto planets to search for items, lifeforms and everything in-between.I won’t explain what the different classes in the game do but I will talk about them in my review so if you wish to know more about the classes look at the Overview in the Manual: http://www.pulsarthegame.com/manual/PresentationFirst up, the overall appearance of the game; it’s by no means the best looking game going but the graphical style definitely fits with the game, particularly for the ships, so I can’t fault it here. The ships themselves look absolutely fantastic, both inside and out. The character models and a few of the textures on the planets are a leaning towards the not so great side of things but this can be forgiven since you don’t spend too much time looking at either since most of the time in game is spent keeping the ship working during combat. The main menu is simple and gets the job done, not much to say here. Apart from the chat window there’s not really a UI in the game but the space craft’s ship displays are the equivalent here. The displays are what you spend most of your time looking at if you play as an engineer or a scientist but they’re also important to the other classes. They’re all done very well as they’re simple and easy to use. The one for engineering is particularly good as it’s just sliders and toggle buttons and engineers need to change things quickly.GameplayPulsar lets you choose from one of five (currently) ships, each with its own stats, advantages, disadvantages etc. Once you’ve selected your ship and you’ve assembled your crew you can either take and complete missions or you can just go off exploring in the randomly generated galaxy. I spent most of my time just travelling around the galaxy randomly, i.e. without trying to complete missions, and it felt rather similar to FTL. The Captain of your ship sets a course for you and then the pilot (human or AI) has to line the ship up with the system you’re travelling to so the engineer can trigger a jump to that system. Arriving in a system can lead to any of the following situations: combat with one or more basic enemies, combat with a ‘boss’, the discovery of a trading post/repair depot, the discovery of a planet which can be explored or the discovery of empty space. More often than not you find yourself in the first situation so I’ll go ahead and explain how combat works. Depending on which ship you choose you’ll have a number of different weapons available to you, all of which can either be controlled by different players or can be controlled by the WeaponBot. Your weapons can only be used a certain number of times before needing to recharge, how long this recharge time is depends on what weapon it is and how much power you’ve diverted to weaponry. The recharge times are generally rather long and this is my first major issue with the gameplay since it makes combat feel rather slow whereas, in my opinion, it should be much faster paced. Enemy ships can also be boarded once a certain amount of their shields have gone down, boarding a ship allows you to kill its crew and then take over the ship or just destroy its systems.AIPulsar: Lost Colony is meant to be played by five real people and it shows in the quality of the currently implemented bots. Firstly, due to the nature of the bots, it’s almost impossible to run a ship with only one human player so if you’re planning to get the game, make sure you find some people to play with. However, it is possible to play with 2+ players quite comfortably, having a captain and engineer as humans and the rest as bots is effective without overworking the humans. The reason I suggest this setup is because the weapon and pilot bots seem to be as good if not better than human players at those jobs as they’re easier to automate. The devs do plan to improve the bots later in development so hopefully things while improve.PhysicsPulsar has several issues with physics in the game, I don’t know how realistic the devs want this game to be so perhaps these issues are in fact not issues at all but I’ll list them anyway. Of course I don’t expect them to have super realistic physics in the game but something less non-realistic would be nice.Once you stop firing the ship’s thrusters it gradually comes to a stop, since space is a vacuum there’s no resistance hence you should remain at the same speed as when you stopped firing the thrusters.Planets have no gravitational pull on your ship.Some of the larger ship guns, have ridiculously large amounts of recoil, obviously there should be some force coming back from the shot (Newton’s Third Law if you’re interested) but significantly spinning the ship is over the top.MiscellaneousThe audio is great in the game, the sounds that the ship makes are particularly goodThere are already a few customisation options for you character including gender, hair style, hair colour and eye colour etc.Personally I think the asking price is a little steep for Early Access but if you’re willing to pay a little extra than you’d expect and you know people to play with then I’d say it’s still worth it.The devs seem very proactive when it comes to fixing bugs which are reported in the forum which is really good to see for an Early Access game.It’s not beginner friendly at all, the manual doesn’t go into too much detail and it doesn’t really tell you how to actually operate the ship, Pulsar would definitely benefit from a proper tutorial.VerdictWorth Purchasing.Pulsar: Lost Colony is a great co-op space combat game with a vast, randomly generated galaxy, several ships to choose from and fun, if not a little slow, combat. If you’ve always wanted a  co-op version of FTL, or if you’re just looking to scratch a space game itch, Pulsar may just be the game for you.Review Copy Provided.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			"

And while you're manning the pilot seat or adjusting sliders you know that there are other people also trying their best to keep the ship alive. At the moment, to my knowledge, you don't fight other players but if that could be an addition to the game It would make it 100x better!Though lacking of content, performing tasks is so satisfying that I don't even pay much attention to everything else. If you like FTL, Coop games or Space Exploration games then BUY THIS GAME NOW. You will not regret it.			"

								Even though this game is lacking a bunch of content, the updates are frequent and I have yet to find a game breaking bug. What surprised me the most was how complacent you can get. There you are with your friends just chillin' like villains after raiding a repair yard to get some free Hull repairs then you all decided to Warp to the next area. With 2:30 to kill, we play a bit of fire extinguisher tag in the lounge while somebody threatens to eject the core for funsies. As we approach our destination, we all man our stations. We warp into an area with 2 ships that each have an automated Drone to assist them offensively. ""SCIENCE! GET US OUT OF HERE! EMERGENCY WARP CHARGE NOW!"" I screeched. But to the entire crew's disapproval, we have not yet charged our instant jump program and are now forced to fly the unfriendly skies. We made for an asteroid to use it's caverns as cover amidst the laser barrages while we try and figure out a game plan. ""2 Minutes until jump"" my engineering officer yells. Knowing we can't survive for that long, I have everybody suit up as I give orders to the Pilot. ""Ramming speed! Get us close!...as we anxiously watch the teleporter screen eek closer and closer to teleportation range. The ships groans and moans with discontent as I place every last XP point into Crew pistol damage and Health. Just as the reactor sends out a red alert notifying us it has reached temperautres that can nearly fuse Hydrogen into Helium, we teleport onto the enemy ship. The real battle has just begun...these enemies are on my new ship, they just don't know it yet.			"

								Pulsar: Lost Colony is a cooperative 1-5 player starship simulator, where you can pick up quests, battle enemy ships, explore planets and engage in hostile ground fights, beam aboard other ships and take them over or sabatage it.The BasicsThere are 5 roles available to choose from they are; Captain; Give orders to your crew, modify your ship and manage your credits Pilot; Fly the ship, collect scrap Align to warp nodes, evasive manouvering. Engineer; Power Management; ensure the ship does not overheat, and when it does use coolant appropriatly Scientist; Infect enemy ships with deadly virus' that can help turn the fate of the battle whilst keeping your cybersecurity online.Weapons Specialist; In this role you'll be responsible for dealing the most damage to the enemy. You'll have use of the main turret right away which stock deals a ton of damage. You'll also help out on your ship to help repel invasions.ReviewI've been playing PULSAR since Alpha dropped and it has gone from strength to strength, I've met some good crew mates who have become good friends since. The game captures the feeling of being aboard a starship superbly.Of course this game is even more fun when You and your crew start to roleplay. I've lost count of how many times i've been yelling orders to my crew desperately trying to outplay the enemy startships. In my total play time i've had nothing but fun and I would honstly reccomend this game to any space fan.One of my fondest memories so far was being in a fight against one of the sector commanders, it was a very long fight our ship was no way at all prepared for it but we all agreed to go hard or go home. After an exhausting battle and an extremely close call (We had around 30 hull left) we basked in the new found glory that we were truly unstoppable (After all, we killed one of the hardest Enemies in the game). Thats when poo started to hit the fan. We figured it was best to navigate to the nearest repair depot which was only 4 Warp jumps away (Close amirite?). So off we went, ""Engineer, prepare the warp core for activation"" I said. ""Helmsman, Align us to SE 42"" I continued, barking orders. After which we left the battleground and was on our way travelling at warp speed along our journey. The first 3 stops were quiet, a planet to beam down to and explore, scavanged a few items and we were on our way. When we got to SE 17 they were there. Waiting. I quickly changed the alert code to defend the ship, but I was too late. All three enemy ships had started to fire, our shields taking massive strain, our engineer was trying his best to allocate power accordingly but in the end it didn't matter, we weren't going to win this one. I knew that, and I believe my crew did too. We were overheating at a great pace and we were all out of coolant. Only one thing left to do I thought. ""If we're going down then we are going to take them with us."" I ordered our Engineer to disengage the reactor safety switch so we could eject the reactor. We did just that and managed to take two of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with us in the explosion that followed.Of course no game is without its bugs but even the ones present here get hammered down very quickly thanks to Leafy Games' super quick hotfixes.11/10 would try outsmart AI and blow up again			"

								What a breath of fresh air! I haven't had this much fun playing a co-op game with people online in years.My first time trying it  out I was on a small ship with one guy, neither of us having a clue what we were doing but we figured some things out enough to get somewhat comfortable with the basics of a couple of positions. Piloting the ship was straight-forward enough and so was manning the turrets. Time to look for a game with more people.Next game I hopped in I was the pilot. Whenever I didn't know what to do the captain was kind enough to explain, and things were simple enough to learn. I played and learned with that full crew of 5 for about an hour.Next game I was the gunner, also very simple to learn if you ever played any games in your life before, and I felt good being an important part of why we made it through fights with drones and other ships.Engineer took a bit more of friendly people explaining what things did, but I found I didn't always have a lot to do so I continued asking questions so I would have some understanding of science and captain positions.The next night I played a game as scientist and the crew had to explain a good number of things to me, but within an hour I had a full understanding of my duties and we played for 5 hours straight.That's right. I played a co-op game with 4 strangers for 5 hours straight.We explored planets, completed missions, applied talent points to improve or characters, collected scrap and upgrades and sold things we found to buy better ship components, and eventually boarded and stole a more powerful enemy ship by sheer planning, strategy, and team work.I definitely got a strong Star Trek feel from the game, which was very much a good thing in my opinion, and in 2 days I felt like the game by far earned its price of admission, something so many early access games these games never do even up to completion.The only downside was that the graphics are pretty dull overall even on highest settings.9.5/10 for a teamwork based space co-op online game that is still in beta.

								I've never really written a review but this game really deserves one. (I hope it doesn't suck)I bought this game last night and jumped on to captain my first ship! I was really excited hadn't done any research on anything just jumped straight in, As a warning this game has no tutorial [Yet]. Within the first 20 minutes I had a full crew. We all jumped on teamspeak and I meet a couple of great guys that I could enjoy this game with.We were excited and ready to go! We warped we Landed, we died. Very quickly. In fact this happened several times. We weren't annoyed at our death, we talked to each other about what went wrong and what we could do to improve. We got excited to get out and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ (Finally). By the time we started to win the action heated quickly and we where all having a blast. Each role has their own tasks and they're very interesting and require intricate cooperation so you don't die a horrible fiery death. Within the first few hours of playing we'd explored planets, completed missions and killed lots of bad guys (Without dying!!!). We upgraded our ship, shields, Core, Guns, engines everything. The upgrading of the ships is unreal and one of my favourite things to do as captain. After the 4 hour mark the games difficulty started to sky rocket, we could barely kill anyone, we where getting wrecked almost every time. At this point the science guy was finally able to start his role. Running programs to keep us alive and to stop the enemy ship from moving and or keeping  shields running. We finally started to do well again and then, they attacked. the enemy bored our ship and killed us from within!!! So now we have to run a ship and fend of pirates,♥♥♥♥♥♥yeah! We also discovered we could do this, send on two crew to get inside and shut down their reactor bail and kill them with ease. This is the limit of what I've done so far, so I'll go on to points about good and bad.Pros: To sum everything up nicely.- Pulsar is very cooperative, in fact working as a team is REQUIRED! Makes every player feel needed even if they're not blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up.- Pulsar has one of the best atmospheres ever. Sounds, shacking and lighting. It really sucks you into the action even though you're in a dark room with no windows, You know when you've been shot and you're in an epic space battle!!!-  Ship upgrades add more depth and keep in interesting.Cons: Please note this is a beta (Early Access review)- The balancing needs work. The game is either too hard or too easy.- Content, Yes I've played this game for 8 hours and I'm not bored. But this game needs some content, more ships, more exploration and more missions! We've done all the missions and making credits is getting harder...- First person content, is fast paced and exciting. But is currently VERY limited and feels bland compared to space combat.- An enemies feel and move like robots.Some idea I had, thought I could share.- Further ship upgrades, Shield resistance modifiers. Science already has one, but upgrades for that would be sweet.- Drones! Little tiny helper ships of death, win/win if you ask me.Hull Breach, You're standing in a room that has hole and got sucked into space, too bad. Not only would it be epic but it would make the room useless. increasing difficulty.- Bombarding planets. You have big space guns? Why not take out enemies on the ground.- Capturing enemy ships for parts. It should be harder to capture a ship, but the rewards should be greater too.- More differences in ships, I should be able to have 10 guns on my ship! on 2 on my other ship. Or more main guns etc. OR even missile boats. So just missiles with bonuses to storage ect.- Tractor beam, to get items from a distance.- EVA, I should be able to go out of my ship in space to conduct repairs and attack the enemy head on!- Upgrade to computers to include a library of viruses. You could load and unload programs, You keep the current max, But you can swap them out in battle to change your load out. It would need to have a load time like, It will take 2 minutes to transfer this program or something.- Crew needing sleep and food, More RP like game play?I think this sums it up nicely, Hope I make sense. This game has a bright future ahead. I won't say buy it now, But I've definitely felt like it was money well spent!Keep up the work devs! You're making a one of a kind game that personally I've been waiting for!!!			"

								>> For a TL:DR read, check the Conclusion section.PULSAR is best described as a mix between Guns of Icarus and FTL in a open-world, and on a more sandboxy setting.It's basically a very-light-starship-simulator where players take different roles. There's The Captain, The Pilot, The Scientist, The Engineer and The Weapons Specialist. So 5 players per session.It sits on a very nice spot of ""not hardcore"" and ""not casual"". So you can easily read the compact manual about a certain role, take on a game, and most captains will be really helpful if you're a new player (in my experience). For future reference, the game doesn't seem to be intended to be a hardcore sim.Regarding content, there's not enough to warrant the current price tag. It really is an Early Access project.However, there's enough fun stuff to get an idea of what's coming:General Features:- Crew levels up, which grant talent points that the players can assign to become more efficient. Each role have general and specific traits to pick.- Quest system in place that gives good amounts of money, experience and helps slow down 'Chaos' build-up (more about that later).- Inventory and Locker system. Different guns are available, and improved tools (+3 Fire Extinguisher, etc). There's also a Scanner that helps to detect enemies and loot on planetside missions. The Captain can access and move items between crew members.- Every class has its station. Pilots have the helm, Scientists deal with computer programs and viruses (like heals, buffs and debuffs), scanners, and also have passive area healing, Engineers deal with the power system and warp drive, Weapons Specialist with the main guns, missiles and nuclear devices. Captain have talents that benefit the whole crew, and he'll probably be too busy coordinating missions, routes and checking fuel/components/cargo/equipment/crew request to do anything else - but generally he can do whatever he wants.- Captain can add money to a shared crew account (""allowance"") which crew can use to buy better personal equipment. He can also, of course, withdraw money from there so a new player don't spend the last 12k on a gun that someone already have in their locker.- Ship can be upgraded and slightly customized (component-wise, at the moment).- There are AI bots if you decide to play singleplayer (or if nobody joins on multiplayer). They are not ideal, but it enables you to learn the game, and they perform well enough on their roles. However, as soon as you jump into a good session with a real crew (even on public games), you'll not want to play with AI. I already added around 10 good people in 2 days.- There's a save system, so you can revert if things go badly or if someone griefs you. I believe there are options like an ""Ironman mode"", and probably more difficulty options are planned.Combat Features:- Space battles that could have catastrophic results if your engineer decides to overheat your ship and eject your core, or if your scientist is drunk and refuses to set the shields properly or activate the Emergency Shields program. - You can already board and capture enemy ships, which include bosses that have the best ships and gear on the game. Or you can tell one of your crew members to take a walk in an enemy ship, disable their shields, destroy their Engineering Subsystem and come back.- Subsystems can be destroyed and repaired. They can also be set on fire, which can spread around the ship if no one looks at the Ship Status screen.Exploration Features:- Planets that require the team to beam down and engage different enemies, find loot (including some good finds that might make the whole crew yell in excitement), and have everyone hug the Scientist and his passive healing when evil robots start firing everywhere.- Minefields with scrap, different systems with different features, black holes, cool sights.Chaos:Chaos is the difficulty meter of the game. It raises little by little the more you play, and the more ""evil"" things you do.It also raises the speed by which civilized systems become ""Infected"" systems - which are really difficult to fight in. There is something of a plot and NPCs on stations tells you some stories, but everything plot-related is probably planned for a later date.Conclusion:PULSAR: Lost Colony can be VERY fun if you play with friends or people that want to go through a game properly.If you enjoy cooperative multiplayer games, and like space games enough to support them early on development, by all means, join up.However, for most audiences, there's not enough content to warrant a buy at the moment. So, at least, wishlist/follow it!If you are really on the fence, I suggest you watch some gameplay videos. I did that, and ended up buying the game.See you in space, probably dying in glorious battle against a Small Drone. :)			"

								How best to describe this? It's like FTL: Faster than Light, except you're playing as one of the crew and instead of running from rebels, you're running from giant killer space mushrooms. Other than that, incredibly similar while at the same time being entirely unique.If you plan on playing this game alone; don't.There are AI bots a captain can spawn in, but at the time I write this they're derpy and hard to control, and you'll feel the difficulty curve with every new warp jump. If you go it alone, you're gonna have a bad time.Where this game really shines is in playing multiplayer with friends. No matter which role you take you'll find yourself both loving and hating them, making for a wonderful party or hangout game.As a captain you might find yourself making your weapons specialist happy because you allocated mission funds for him to get a shiny new pistol, then have the engineer angry you won't get her a better repair gun right up until you tell her you were saving up for the new low-power-demand shield generator you're installing.As a pilot you might find yourself hating that engineer because she syphoned power from your engines for a few moments until you find out she was doing it so the scientist could prepare a program for the ship's computer to double engine output for the next three minutes.As a weapons specialist you'll appreciate every perfect broadside that pilot lines up and every asteroid he puts between you and the enemy while your weapons are recharging.As a Scientist you'll be keeping that weapon specialist happy when you research a new Talent he can level into which gives a permenant damage buff to any gun he uses, or maybe you'll level into your own Bridge Medic talent, keeping everybody alive when ship hits the fan and you've got boarding teams arriving.And as an engineer, you'll be spending most of your time down in the core of the ship, keeping the reactor running smooth, only popping out to save everyone's behind for the fifth time when you bound from terminal to terminal, putting out fires and repairing consoles with all the speed of a caffinated kerbal.---In closing, PULSAR: Lost Colony is best played with friends, and it will either cement your friendships with them forever or make you realize just how selfish the captain is when he spends 10,000 credits on a sidearm he'll never use since he never leaves the bridge.

								Started as a completely fresh faced newbie playing alone, another newbie jumped on.We continued to die a dozen times before slowly learning the ropes, and we passed what we learned onto our friends. Then some veterans came online and taught us all the heavy stuff, and before I knew it I was six hours in launching viruses and juggling a not-quite critical reactor core.This game is amazing. Just buy it.			"

								This game is like playing as the crew members of an FTL game. Difficultly increases over time.  Each person has a role to play with their own responsibilities. Anyone can assume the responsibilies of another role, but there are perks and bonuses only available if you are playing a certain role. Bots are available for single player or when you can't fill all the roles. AI for bots is quite lacking yet, so it is best played with other people.Updates are slow, but consistent and meaningful. I enjoy it thoughly and look forward to each update.			"

								The immersion in this game is phenomenal.First game, we were chased by these things called Infected.We were chased through a minefield, I was tasked with shooting down their projectiles while the pilot navigated our crippled ship to warp-range for our escape.We took enough hits to eventually bring us to imminent death, I held the line. One by one, the projectiles were precisely shot down using the last of our momentum, and we escaped to warp-range.Cheers and praise from every crew member came about; Things like ""DID YOU SEE ME DODGE THAT MINE WHILE YOU REROUTED TO POWER, AND HE SHOT DOWN THAT MINE BEFORE I RAMMED IT ACCIDENTALLY!?""So much comradery, in such a simple and fun aspect of Gaming. Brilliant.And it's even more fun with Friends.			"

								Day 1 Captains Log:I have put together a small crew and we finally embark on our inter-stellar journey. We came underattack by many security drones who engaged us on site. They were easy prey and yielded much needed scrap that eventually sold. The crew seemed pleased. No troubles hereDay 5 Cpatians Log: We found a planet. It appears to be a molten planet inhabited by strange Lava creatures. I gave the order to exterminate them. No creature like that can ever be useful, or friendly. Of course, I would have sent a larger exploration force to the planet had I known there were lifeforms on the surface, but my science officer a man by the name of SCIBOT was more interested in the strange alien pumpkin that resides on the bridge than any of his duties. As soon as we dock at the nearest station He Fired. As for my Engineering officer he seems more focused exploring the vast expanse of the galaxy, or finding enemies to kill than manning his post twice now we nearly had to jettison the core due to overheating. And for the life of me i dont understand how he cant keep our engines online in a fight. My Tactical Officer doesnt want to use her missles and is often times facing the worng direction when we come into a fight. I swear this cannot be the same person i hired 4 days ago. Had i the techincal know how to operate the main cannon i would. I am also beginng to suspect her of an Atrium Healing pad addicition. Perhaps i could replace her and make her the new science officer she cant be any worse than SCIBOT. My pilot has to be the only truely competant member of my crew he's always at his post. He's always vigilant and always ready to react to any situation. Day 5 Chief Engineers Log: How did i get here? Everything was perfect when I first signed up for this gig, but now its all gone to hell. That Science Officer is worthless. I mean sure he knows his craft, but the guy is more interested in those damend pumpkins all over the ship thna he is with anything else. I'm pretty sure the Captain is going to shoot him pretty soon. Oh and the Captain is a moron. If you push the ship too hard your going to risk a core meltdown. But noooo, every fight he has to have all systems at max power and the ship at full burn FLank speed. Any first year officer would know that with running a ship like that you're going to run a core overheat. Our weapons officer is kinda flakey too I think she just fires the main cannon to watch the pretty light more times than not I jumped on a turret just to kill the enemy. Anyway I should probably get back to fixing the engines. I almost forgot about them. Day 5 Tactical Officers Log: Wow I've never been on a real spaceship before. Everyone here is super cool and really nice. I mean the Captian can get yelly sometimes, but he means the best. We must be like the best at our jobs because we keep getting in fights and winning. I get to fire the big shiny gun. It reminds me of the 4th of July. Anyway I'll see you later mom. Day 5 Science Officers Log:Pumpkin. Space Pumpkin. Space Pumkin with sparkles? Space SParkle Pumpkin. Tell me your secrets sPace Sparkle Pumpkin. Day 5 Pilots Log:Were all going to die.  "

								It's kind of hard to explain exactly what this game is. It's like a mix of Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator, FTL, Guns of Icarus, and a few episodes of various space-based sci-fi series. It plays out primarily in first-person view (the pilot can get a third-person external view of the ship when piloting, however), and each player fills one of 5 roles - Captain, Pilot, Engineer, Scientist, Weapons officer. Every role has a few specialities which they'll be useful to have on board to help with.In space combat, each player has a station to attend, which provides them with a selection of tools useful for enhancing the ship's performance in many ways. They also have the very high probability of panicking when something gets set on fire and completely losing track of what they're meant to be doing, which is AWESOME.When doing away missions, everyone's job is to basically shoot everything that moves, and pick up anything that isn't bolted down. So... maybe there's a bit of Elder Scrolls or something in the mix too?Anyway, the point is, you run around on your ship, repairing damage and manning various systems in fights, and you run around on other ships and planets shooting enemies/aliens/robots/anything else that catches your eye. And it's all co-op, played with a crew of up to 5 friends, with each of you playing a different role on board the ship. If you're missing any job, you can stick an AI in that slot to work with you, and it's possible (though not usually easy) to run a ship with only one human player. The game is obviously not intended to be played solo, however, and while the AI has a very flexible customisation system to make them behave pretty much exactly how you need them to, they're just not as entertaining as human crewmates. Even with only 2 people, the AI filling the other slots will be sufficient to provide a pretty good time, but it really shines when you have 3 or more on board the ship, working together (or at least TRYING to).While I recommend the game, I do so with the caveat that it IS an early access title, and it isn't a finished product by any means. The content already in the game is great, and shows a lot of promise for future additions, but it isn't going to live up to everyone's hopes and dreams in its current state. If you're unsure, I recommend checking out a few YouTube videos before you buy.			"

								This review will be in english and in french. I'll start with the english one.Cette évaluation sera en anglais et en français. Je commence par l'anglais.GraphicsThis game is very far from what we are used to in recent or upcoming games like Mad Max, Fallout, or Star Citizen (if we want to stay in the same game spirit). You should not expect some amazing visuals in this game. However, the design of the ships, of the HUBs, and of structures on planets can easily make you forget the flaws if you like space operas like I do.And even if you don't, there is something else that can get your attention : the possibilities in the gameplay.GameplayI only played for about 7h at the time I'm writing this. However, I also spent a lot of time reading the manual for every role (quite useful for anyone who wants to be Captain, as you can learn all you need to know to give correct orders to your crew).But I was absolutely amazed by how good the game system is. It's both complex and really simple. Complex because you need a slightly capable crew and a good captain in command to push your ship to its limits and discover all the possibilities the game offers. And simple because every panel speaks for itself and is understandable to anyone with at least 80 I.Q. The difficult part is to coordinate everyone.Because it really is a coop game. With your friends or with stranger, you will need a good communication if you don't want to see your core explode your ship because your engineer forgot to apply the coolant liquid in the middle of a furious fight with a drone. Yeah, that can happen, trust me.There is the possibility to play alone, with AI Bots in place of the different roles, but it's really not the same. And the Bots are still a work in progress and are not always responding as you'd expect. A good thing is, there's a small but nice community of players and an ""official"" teamspeak if you want to quickly find a crew and easily communicate with them.What's in the game yet ?Right now, you have several missions available, 5 different ships with differents components, weapons and internal configuration, a trade system for your ship at every station, few merchants in the main HUB to purchase better weapons or tools, the possibility to explore some planets, 5 very specific roles to control your ship and even more ...Remember this is still an early access, but it already has a buttload of stuff to do and discover.All of that in two sentences ?It's a better Star Trek game than any Star Trek game. It's really about managing your ship and going on an adventure, half simulation, half adventure game. The devs take care of the bugs as soon as they know there are some, there is already tons of content and even more scheduled in the next year, and if you like space opera and have some friends, this is what you need.Graphics : 6/10Gameplay : 9.5/10 (It's awesome, but nothing is perfect)Content already in game : 8/10Content scheduled : 9/10Devs communication and reactivity + update frequency : 9/10Overall quality : 8.5/10 But I expect it to go at 9.5 after a fiew more updates.Bien, passons maintenant à la review française.GraphismesCe jeu est très très loin de la qualité graphique que l'on trouve dans des jeux actuels ou à venir tels que Mad Max, Fallout ou encore Star Citizen (puisqu'on est dans le space opera).Ne vous attendez donc pas à des graphismes d'une qualité hallucinante. Cependant, le design des vaisseaux, des stations et même des structures planétaires permet d'oublier tout ça, en particulier si vous aimez le genre.Et même si ce n'est pas le cas, vous pourrez être séduit par les possibilités laissées par le gameplay.GameplayAu moment où j'écris, je n'ai que 7 heures de jeu derrière moi. Cependant, j'ai passé un certain temps à étudier les sytèmes et à lire l'intégralité des manuels présents sur le site (très utile si vous incarnez le Capitaine et voulez connaitre les systèmes à votre disposition).Et j'ai été très impressionné de la qualité globale du système de jeu. A la fois complexe et simple d'accès. D'abord complexe parce que vous aurez besoin d'un équipage réactif et d'un capitaine compétent pour pouvoir pousser votre vaisseau à ses limites et découvrir tout ce qu'il a à offrir. Et en même temps simple car chaque panneau de contrôle est relativement clair et peut être compris par n'importe qui. La vraie difficulté est de coordonner l'équipage.Car c'est bel et bien un jeu de coopération. Que ce soit avec des amis ou avec des inconnus, vous aurez besoin d'un bonne communication si vous ne voulez pas que votre réacteur surchauffe et vous explose dans les mains parce que votre ingénieur n'avais pas appliqué le liquide de refroidissement. Oui, ça arrive, croyez moi.Il y a la possibilité de jouer tout seul, en plaçant des bots aux différents postes, mais l'expérience n'est pas du tout la même. D'autant plus que les bots ne sont pas encore complètement au point et ne font pas toujours ce que vous attendez d'eux.Vous pourrez voir qu'il y a déjà une petite communauté sympathique, ainsi qu'un teamspeak plus ou moins officiel qui permet de trouver rapidement un équipage et de communiquer efficacement.Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire dans le jeu pour l'instant ?A l'heure acutelle, il y a plusieurs missions disponibles, 5 vaisseaux très différents au niveau des composants, de l'armement et de la configuration interne, un système de commerce pour le vaisseau à chaque station, plusieurs marchands dans le HUB principal permettant d'ameliorer vos blasters et outils de réparation, 5 rôles différents et complémentaires, la possibilité d'explorer quelques planètes, et encore bien d'autres choses surprenantes ...Souvenez vous qu'il s'agit d'un accès anticipé, mais qu'il y a déjà beaucoup à faire et à découvrir.Tout ça résumé en trois mots ?C'est un meilleur jeu Star Trek que n'importe quel jeu Star Trek. Vous gérez vraiment votre vaisseau, à mi-chemin entre la simulation et l'aventure.Les développeurs sont très réactifs concernant les bugs, et en plus du large contenu déjà présent, encore plus est prévu au cours de l'année à venir.Si vous aimez les space operas et que vous avez quelques amis partants, ce jeu est fait pour vous.Graphismes : 6/10Gameplay : 9.5/10Contenu déjà présent : 8/10Contenu prévu : 9/10Réactivité et communication des développeurs + fréquence des updates : 9/10Qualité générale : 8.5/10 Mais je monterai certainement à 9.5 après quelques updates.

I am a huge fan of space exploration games and this in my opinion up there with one of my personal favorites, Elite: Dangerous. The mutiplayer seem very stable and we as a full crew (consists of five) had no problems except for when my friend pulled out a gun and it looked like a star: it went away after about 34 seconds. The subtle references embedded in the game are well placed and made the crew smile. The (as we tagged them)""Away missions"" are fun from asking people on space stations for jobs to beeming down to a planets surface and fighting huge ant mosters! Overall I recommend anyone who likes Space, Roleplay, Teamwork, Space Teamwork to buy and support this fantastic game and It's developers.Nominated for The “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award.9/10 - ""This boldly goes where some games have gone before""			"

								This game is as good as everyone says...My very first playthrough, one eight hour session:I joined my first game as a new player, as the captain of course!Team of Russian crewmen joined including wepan specializt, eengineer, and pilet. Taught me to speak Russian including ""jump!"" (pizhot!) and ""fire!"" (ogon!). European scientist joined who helped teach the crew valuable German through recital of ""Du Hast"".We proceeded to traverse the galaxy under my command, which was eventually inspired by the hardy Russian crew to be aided by the use of !!VODKA!! At this point my direction became more steadfast than ever, and our vessel became a deadly warship of destruction. As our journey came to end we decided it was time for us to use our nuclear warhead (which failed!) while facing our most formiddable foe: the Grim Cutlass.Without spoiling the outcome of our grand comrade voyage, let me just finish by saying that in Pulsar: Lost Colony, adventure awaits you, if you choose to accept your mission!

								Just got it tonight, and the first ship I get into is Captained by a very cordial Aussie. Took 10-15 minutes explaining things around the ship, and then my role in particular(Tactical). I knew some of it from watching Youtube, but I wanted to see how things were. We were already in space, and apparently our first goal was to board and take over the enemy ship. It was a rough battle, having to respawn multiple times before I realize we had taken out life support on the other ship, meaning there was no Oxygen...So after donning an environmental suit, I went over, neutralized the remaining crew and we took over the much more impressive ship.Our next few warps brought us to a derelict ship, layered with mines. After clearing the field with our turrets, scrap was ours for the gathering. We then stopped off at a space port. We repaired, sold our scrap and headed back off. We had a few other officers join and leave, but Captain Rider and myself eventually met up with a particularly resilant ship. After taking twice as long to strip the shields, the captain decided we would take that ship. We stormed it, and with better training than before, easily destroyed the critical systems for their defense and claimed the ship. Victory is sweet.			"

								This game deserves my taking time to write a review, even in it's early access phases. I see a lot of potential in this game. As-is, in early access release, there are some quirks, and have even had my server crash while playing with some pals. But, despite that, I'd still recommend playing this game. I was so excited by the initial play that I went out, and bought copies for buddies to get them on-board. Not meaning to steal thunder from this game, it does remind me of a slightly different variation on ""Artemis - Bridge Simulator"". Different game styles, as Artemis is designed for the group to be in the same room, and the console is the console of the bridge, rather than you controlling an avatar operating a console, the spirit of the game is the same. A grand social design to get players working together towards operating the same ship, with well defined roles.Granted, there are some things still not working in the game yet, and some odd ball quirks for getting around the galaxy, such as the missing waypoints when the captain issues orders by the starmap, it's very easily overcome. I don't mind asking for each sector to be the next jump alignment to get us going. It gives the captain a little more to do when there isn't fights, and fires, and away team missions.In the end, this is a seriously fantastic game for those who want to work cooperatively with a group in control of their respective components of a ship. Very well done. Dear dev's, PLEASE keep the work going on this. You have a life-time player, and advocate of your work from me.10/10, would boldy go again! "

Early Access Review
								Captain's Log, Stardate 3142017.5.After spending many hours in various Starfleet simulators, including the illustrious Bridge Command simulations - I must say PULSAR:  Lost Colony has proven the most immersive.  Still, this ""Lost Colony"" is not without flaws.  Below, I shall leave a detailed manifesto of my feedback regarding PULSAR.(Let me just say, I love this game a lots.  And I wanna see it succeed.  If anything sounds harsh, it's only 'cause I consider this game family and I believe in tough love.)THE VESSEL(S):The strongest aspect of this game is truly within the confines of the ships.  Customizing the parts, the simulated touch screens, the mostly detailed interiors help quite a lot with the immersion.  Although there are different ships to choose from, each with their own interior layout, you'll find yourself customizing the specifications to your crews needs.  Being unable to jump/jetpack inside of the ship is a bit strange.There are some rooms that are strictly cosmetic, like the lounge, that I wish served more of a purpose.  If I could spend credits, or pick up crawler legs to cook in these rooms it would truly add to the immersion and give my ""at ease"" crew passive work and encourage them to use other rooms.  It would also be neat to be able to leave actual entries in my ship log so my crew knows what was done in my ship's last voyage.Aside from my nitpicks, I must say the ships keep me coming back to the game.THE CREW:The Captain:  This is the least intuitive station on the whole ship.  As someone who has played Bridge Commander and other Trek sims, you'd think the Captain would work somewhat similar to PULSAR's predecessors.  The Captain shoulders a lot of responsibility, but as it stands right now - it is a very boring position with a lot of power and not a lot of hands-on gameplay.  The ""Z"" menu is great for ""general"" commands like the alert statuses and crew statuses.  However, I feel this screen should also tell me where my crew is in relation to me, and I should be able to ""spectate"" them so we can better coach them.I also think the alert statuses should be able to override engineering settings, ex:  Green Alert lowers power to weapons and shields, almost completely.  Yellow Alert raises shields, and Red Alert raises shields and weapons.When the Captain sits in his chair, issuing commands should be a breeze.  I feel as though 'overview' displays for each station should be closely visible and allow the Captain to queue up commands for a more tactical approach.  EX:  On the Science overview, I can command my Scientist to run the Thruster Booster program and when my Scientist deems it appropriate, or is available - they run the program.  Of course suggestions for Shields and comm control would be here too.  On the Engineering overview, I can monitor core temperature and suggest distress calls as well as coolant usage.  On the Weapons overview, I can put in nuclear commands or call for ceasefire/attack/defensive/etc.  On the Pilots overview, I should be able to issue directional commands as well as override ship controls (in the case of a fire or 'all hands on deck' repairs).This anchoring to the Captain's Chair would make it that much more devastating when the Captain has to leave his chair to man a turret, or put out a fire - it makes the crew work without their head.The Engineer:  My man should be able to beam people back up to the ship, give it a warmup like the warp drive.  The Engineer is definitely one of the strongest stations to play.  It's hectic, and tons of fun.  I do wish the Engineer could get a talent for swapping out parts we find along the way.  Maybe it destroys the piece you're replacing?  Maybe the engineer can use scrap/other hulls to repair the hull for emergencies?Not a lot of feedback, but if there were a way to make this role more active in the narrative.  If some missions have broken ships, rather than relaying supplies - can the engineer just board the ship and repair it?  It'd also allow for a bit of drama, where the engineer could be locked on the ship after repairing a ship's shields.The Scientist:  There is a lot of potential for this station beyond the scanning aspect.  The programs and viruses are great, but if hacking were more hands on I think ship-to-ship fights would be more rewarding for the Scientist.  A simple timed puzzle would work when trying to run a virus on an enemy ship, or when trying to repel one.  I'd also like to see the respawn mechanic depend on the Scientist more.  Often we found ourselves committing suicide to get back on the ship faster.  Maybe on planets and other stationary areas, the Scientist has to 'resurrect' you - otherwise, the Engineer needs to beam your corpse back up to the ship?  For ship-to-ship invasion, the rematerializer could still be used as those fights are more active and time-sensitive.  The search system/database is great in theory, but it doesn't offer enough information on certain sectors.  I wish the active scans/exploring sectors would update the database like a pokedex.  For Comms, I think the Scientist should have to again play a puzzle to ""decode"" messages or even translate them.  The Atomizer isn't very intuitive, maybe the Scientist can see more information on items before placing them in it, so we know what we're getting?The Pilot:  Please rehaul the controls, Space Engineers has a great flying system.  I'd also like to see the Pilot get some sort of remote control talent that allows him to fly the ship from anywhere.  This'll allow the unattended ship to be open for attack, and allow the pilot to take evasive maneuvers.  I think he should be able to engage warpdrive after it's been warmed up and lined up.The Weapons Specialist:  In general, I feel like the Weapons Specialist should be able to switch between Modulate and Static shield.  I found myself timing their laser attacks and physical attacks by watching them through the turret, and running back and forth to protect against the appropriate attack.  Ifthe Weapons Specialist had this ability, it'd be very intuitive.I wish it were a bit more rewarding and easier to attack specific systems of enemy ships.  If the Captain issues the command to target their engineering, the Weapons Specialist should be able to see it clearly highlighted on display.  Exploration:  It's a big star system, which is great.  I love how it scrambles with each playthrough.It would be interesting to put on an exosuit and teleport to asteroids for minerals/research points.  More random abandoned ships and floating wreckage for exploration would be great, extra points if the engineer can get a ship up and running to claim.The planets are huge, more nooks and crannies and abandoned outposts outside of quest areas would be super rewarding to explore, especially if there's random logs left around.  Enemy ships and abandoned ships would greatly benefit from ship logs to read.Distress calls are great, way more of those.Just more ruins on unrelated to storyline planets would be dope.  ""Unexplored sectors"" that give us a chance to make first contact with at least a few new races?We love choices as gamers, and as long as you emulate games like Fallout with this backdrop, you'll continue to succeed.  More people to meet, more races to befriend or make enemies of, etc.  I don't mind loose ends and moral conundrums, that's what this is all about, right?GAMEPLAY: Considering how awesome this game is, it's hard to come down on y'all.  The AI is a little wonky, and they move really fast.  It's hard to explain but - there's no recoil.  There's no snare when you get hit or hit something.  There's no crouch or jump.  If you can get as close to Half-life 1 as you can, you're good to go.  It doesn't need to be anything crazy, just simple gameplay like that and this game becomesinfinitely better.The AI doesn't use cover or anything.			"

								Ever wanted taking the captains chair on a spaceship? Being a part of a five brave man manned crew, everybody equipped with special abilities on the journey of infinite space adventure? Want to take your EVA suit on and loot out enemy forces in ancient alien buildings on planets no one has ever gone before? Then this game is for you. Kinda repetetive sometimes but still addicting and challenging as well. Level up the ship, level up your crew and lead everybody on board the way home, unharmed.Complete missions, go for new ones, repeat, and face the dangers of endless space.  Between ground fighting, space battles and survival on an almost broken ship, everything goes for you and your team. For now theres some content's missing but with a few friends and the EA stat in mind this is a reason for a weekend to spend on your very own ship, with your very own adventure. A need for space adventurers and definitely worth the money.This game is gonna be a big one.			"

								I usually don't write reviews, but I think this game is very worth mentioning.What is PULSAR: Lost Colony?I would describe it as a 3D multiplayer FTL. The player, with up to 4 other crewmates, travels by the galaxy in a spaceship. Every person will be asigned to a role, being these the Captain, the Pilot, the Engineer, the Scientist, and the Weapons Specialist. Cooperation of all crew members will be needed to survive each threat they will encounter(mostly, enemy vessels or drones in space, aliens in planets).I recommend to the person insterested in the game to watch some videos, because it really gives the sensation of being part of a vessel crew, giving a lot of tense situations, with the pilot running away from enemy shots, the captain giving orders, the WS trying to hit the enemy vessel and, when everything seems lost, the engineer screaming ""WARP DRIVE CHARGED AND READY, WE'RE ♥♥♥♥ING GOING OUTTA HERE"" and jumping to hyperspace after an eternal time lapse where the drive took forever to charge.Perfect for playing with friends. It needs more content, but game gets updated every month with new features. I'm really looking forward for this game to be completed.			"

								My friend and I were playing random games together, very bored. He had had this game for a while, and he said it was really good, and told me to get it. I got it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon that day, and played until midnight. Incredibly addictive. Lacking some substance, due to few missions and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PVE while on the ground, but fun nonetheless. Really gives you a feeling of being on a spaceship. For example, one situation we encountered: We were on the WD faction, and ran into a group of CU drones. They attacked us and 👌👈 us up. We were about to die so I, as the captain, initiated an emergency blind jump. We warped for a minute or so and when we came out of warp, half our screen was dominated by a huge blue object. The surface was fluctuating. We stared at it in bewilderment for a minute before realizing it was a star.♥♥♥♥♥♥ The ship suddenly began bursting into flames here and there, so we made another blind jump. We ended up in an abandoned system. We ran through the ship with fire extinguishers, our oxygen supply dwindling as we put out fire after fire. Fire in the mess hall, fire in life support, fire in engineering, fire everywhere. 9/10, for what it offers at the moment.			"

								This is game is amazing. I can't put it any other way. The first time playing it is the most fun, and even then, it's still fun trying to faguely cooperate on not dieing with the rest of your crew. I'm mostly going to explain each of the positions main roles, because I can't reveiw right now.Captain: You are the Captain. You pretty much tell everyone what to do, and preferably help during battles by shooting one of the smaller guns. A bad captain with a fantastic crew could do worse than a good captain with a bad crew. Don't let them down.Weapon Specialist: As the Weapon Specialist, or Wep Spec for people who can't say more than 1 syllabyll at a time, you fire the ships biggest gun. You also get extra damage resistance later on for when you warp to other ships, or the surface of planets. Keep your aim steady and try not to miss.Pilot: The Pilot flys the ship. Allign for the next destination, wait for the warp to end, and DEAR GOD THERE IS A ROCK INFRONT OF US WHERE IS THE BREAKS?!?!Scientist: As a 100% normal Scientist who is not mad, I swear, your job is the run viruses and programs to tilt the dogfight in your favor, be it one that stops the opposition in it's tracks, or a simple boost to your shields, as well as scaning planets for hostiles before beaming down. Engineer: Engineer, you have 1 job, see that glowing ball? Do NOT let it overheat. You can also, on Scientists request preferably, refuel the Programs and Viruses by sacraficing a Fuel Cell, but make sure you keep enough to get to the next station. This one can be quite difficult early game, but grows easier as your group gets better Reactors for the ship.Some people might prefer one over another, but all 5 are needed to keep the ship running smoothly. So, ready for the space adventure of multiple lifetimes, known as ""Pulsar: Lost Colony""? W...what do you mean no?			"

								Well, Let me say (big Star Trek / Star Wars Fan) This game Is what Star Trek online should have been, That said there is room for tweaks.. I know still in development, Hope Dev Team is reading, would love to see better animations for FPS sections feels a bit clunky and walk animations are out right hard to look at. The textures in the game are low res and are very boring to look at (not every where mind you) some places look good. That said let me say I LOVE THIS FREAKING GAME!! Got the game around 2pm did not stop playing until 3am My eyes where red and I was on my 3rd cup of coffee , IT was that good, When I did go to bed , could not stop thinking of the game I was hooked. slept for about 4 hours and was back looking for a New crew to join.]Its not a looker but the core gameplay is on point, oh the turrets stations on the ship those are spot on good sound and lighting like fireing true laser cannon from star trek. I would and have recommended to my pals on teamspeak, Buy the game and I think you will see what I said was true.Keep the updates coming DEV team this game IS a winner in my book, (JUST FIX THE TEXTURES PLEASE LOOKS LIKE MINECRAFT<<< WOULD ME NICE WITH BETTER TEXTURES) ok sorry my only CON .

								TAVelcro, Captain Velcro to be exact. I am the C.O in charge of the C.U Carrier Class ""Paper Airplane"" so cleverly nicknamed by Admiral Hill. My crew is of five members to whom I own my life and vice versa. On weapons is Justin who has the best record of shot to hit in the entire galaxy. On engineer is Sabakyo, a veteren in the fleet and second to none when it comes to reactor management. Rey is our pilot, he is new to the crew but quickly became close friends with everyone. Bovice on science, outstanding record from the academy graduating top of his class 4 years running. Our usual missions are that of scrap gathering.  We do, however, receive a few agressive missions like defending a mining base, or collecting rouge scout drones by any means nessasary. But last week, everything changed. There is word of an Intrepid class ship who has stolen weapons from the fleet and using them to extort civilian ships and trading outposts all across the galaxy. They are very clever and have thus been unable to be located before they strike and dissappear. We have recieved orders from CU Command that they have recently tried to sell children for credits at a trading station on the outskirts of Mineus Thrive not 5 Warps from our usual gathering spot. We have been ordered to investigate the incident report and find out why the trading depot has been radio silent.After a short briefing, we quickly begin preperations and head out to the trading depot. The journey was quite uneventful though I can tell the crew is a bit nervous. Hell, I am myself. ""Captain, we are dropping out of warp in 10 minutes."" My science officer announces to me through comms. Leaving my quarters, I head towards the bridge. Shortly after we drop out of warp to see the wreckage of the trading depot we were tasked to locate. It was horrible, debris everywhere. If not for the quick reaction time of our pilot, we may have had a collision. ""Science, see if there is anywhere safe to teleport to and perhaps their computer has information as to what happened here, also do a scan for any lifeforms. Pilot give us some breathing room, i'd prefer not to have a hole in our hull before we face our true objective."" I calmly order towards my crew.""No lifeforms sir, but there is a few blast doors that seal off near their comms array we may be able to get into, I'm sure if it's anything like the depots back home, they'll have at the very least audio logs of the events leading up to their destruction. Permission to beam abord?"" Science hastly says after a few beeps from his station. ""Granted, take weapons with you, I'm sure Colonel Justin would like to stretch his legs"" I say.The boarding party went quite fast and sure enough, Bovice was able to return with information as he anticipated. It would seem the depot refused a deal from a recent ship who ported at the depot, calling themselves the Grim Cutlass. Out of anger they opened fire on the depot, according to these logs though, they only fired once. The devistation from just one shot from this weapon was unfathomable. This in no way helped with the nerves of my crew and I was unsure of how to reasure them that this wouldn't be us if we arent careful with how we approach the AWOL ship. With little delay, we warp in the direction of the last warp trail left behind assuming it must be our culprit.My Scientist Bovice warns me our odds of survival are increibly low. I order Engineering and Science to turn off everything and then ordered the crew into our Exo-suits. We have yet to be detected by the Grim Cutlass so we have the element of suprise. After a few moments of debate about how well our shields and hull would stand against this weapon the enemy ship has onboard, It is clear the best corse of action is to unload as much fire power we can into them before they can react. The hopes is to disable their weapons and then perhaps get them to surrender. Without their main turret active, they should crumble with fear. We drop out of warp and our scanners confirm it is the signature for our foe, the AWOL CU ship self named ""Grim Cutlass"". My report from CU Command says the weapon they stole when they went AWOL is a prototype weapon called the CU Long Range. We've seen it's power solely from the rubble it left behind.""Justin, charge main cannon, load shield piercers and fire at their weapons. Science, load our barrage program, Pilot, face the enemy and be prepared to dodge whatever return fire you can. Engineer, dont let us blow up"" I command. ""No pressure Sabakyo"" Science snickers. Like clockwork, weapons locks on with shield piercer missles and charges our main turret, engineer like conducting flight of the bumblebee works at redirecting power as needed while maintaining a low core temp. Pilot ties what appeared to be a rambo bandana across his forehead and cracks his knuckles. Science was sciencing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of his station.Our missle flies at almost same time the main cannon hits their shields, our auto turrets fire a few rounds of railgun ammo as our missle hits dead on. ""Captain! Their weapons are disabled."" Science shouts ""Hail them!"" I sayOn screen was the captain of the Grim Cutlass, eye patch, exotic fur coat. Suprisingly it was a female, but more now a pirate than an ex-CU Captain. ""Cowards play! she screems ""How dare you fire upon an unprepared opponent! But if you leave now then i'll give you a head start before burning this sector alive to hunt you down. and KILL YOU SLOWLY"" The crude space pirate sneers. ""This is Captain Velcro of the Colonial Union. You are to hereby surrender yourself and your ill gotten ship to us immideatly or face destrustion."" I say extremely proud that our sneak attack worked. ""I refuse, but I find it absolutely hilarious that you are so arrogant that you think you've won."" She barks then closes comms. ""Sir! They are firing their main cannon!"" Science screams. ""But how?"" I ask. In a blink of an eye, a large pulse of energy streaks across space towards our ship. This is it, our end i think to myself as our pilot barely manages to roll the ship out of its way. ""Captain! Our engines and shields are down!"" Science proclaims after taking a moment to see we are still alive. ""It would seem their main turrent is on a seperate power source.""""Load the nuke..."" I barely can believe i said aloud knowing that we should only use it in dire situations and admitting we needed to use it was admitting this was most likely our last rodeo. ""Sir! If we do at this range, well be hit by our own explosion!"" my Weapon's Specialist exclaims. ""He is correct, sir."" My Scientist says. ""Captain, I could fire full reverse thrusters and put some space between us"" The Pilot states. ""Doing so will require me to give more power engines and our reactor cant handle it, not after the effects of that blast we took.."" Our faithful Engineer adds.""You heard me crew!"" I shout. ""Our window of opprotunity will be very short. If they get another shot at us we are finished. I want Science to load all our shield recharge programs, Engines alot all power to science and weapons. Once the nuke is launched, full power to engines and full reverse. I will detonate the warhead manually."" I command with absolute confidence in my crew. ""Science get on a railgun and shoot any missles they send our way once programs are executed.""Sitting there with my hand over the detonate button, my crew scrambles between their roles as the Grim Cutlass and ourselves send volley after volley of lasers and missles at eachother. I can see the damage to our systems on my screen before me piling up. Everything is going quiet around me despite the carnage. I can faintly hear Bovice saying they are firing the weapon again. Our nuke was now in range, but so were we. I close my eyes and exhale.The Grim Cutlass is no more, but nor are we.10/10 would totally Martyr my crew again.			"

								Cannot reccomend this yet if you want to actually play the game now.   There is very little actual game content in yet.  That said however it seems alot of fun, especially if you are a StarTrek fan.  I would highly reccomend revisiting this game closer to completion.  I intend to update my review then.Update:Not many people found my review useful, so I thought I should add some detail.Some of the graphics are quite nice, others are a little simple but overall I think its probably a good balance of playable graphics, to support 5-player multiplayer and reasonably low-end systems.The game play is very much team-work based, you really need at least 3 players to play effectively and the larger ships would work better with a full compliment.AI Bots can be used to fill in any position... as long as you dont mind if they suck.  The role you play as - Captain, Pilot, Wepons etc, mostly affects your stats.  So for example a Pilot can boost their ship manuvering ability, but any other player will only be as good as a level 1 pilot.  Anybody can get a scanner, but only the science officer can later gain an ability to use the scanner to find loot.Multiplayer there are some small but very annoying bugs.  For example if the ship is warping from A-B the captain can skip the 5-6 minute wait.  I have found that this is very reliable for 1-2 players but as soon as I add a 3rd player its 50:50 if the skip option will work or not.However after all of that, the real reason I cannot reccomend this game however is the content is only about 10% done, you will run out of main-line game play very very quickly at present.Not only that but because I think this game will be awesome, and so much story is only partially implemented, I worry that playing now might lessen experience on release - admittedly a risk with almost any early access game.I with the developers were a bit more communicative with development progession, however updates are reasonably regular and the team seem very competant.If you see this game on a heavy sale, I would say buy it as a future investment but if you want a game to play now I wouldnt get it yet.

								Ahh Pulsar... A refreshing gem hidden under the heaps of small-time developers, early access garbage games that seem to plague steam these days.I honestly believe that I've never played anything quite like it, which is why I am so drawn to it at random times throughout the day... It scratches a certain itch that I never knew I had.Esentially you are tasked to keep a ship (yours or another captains) from being blown to smithereens by space pirates, faction security drones, Deathseekers, civilian ships, sentinals, Infected Carriers, and space police all while exploring a vast galaxy in search of fame and fortune.Sounds bad♥♥♥♥♥right? The only catch is that there are multiple crew positions on the ship! And each are fairly vital to the success of said ship.For instance, the pilot who flys the ship and lines it up for the next warp. The weapons specialist who mans the ship's turrets and leads boarding parties to other enemy ships. The scientist who is in charge of comms between the other vessels you come across, along with running viruses targetted at enemy vessels and quick-fix/boosting programs to aid whichever ship you find youself on, as well as planetary scans to see what lies on the surface of that sketchy looking rock your crew is about to beam down to. The engineer is in charge of power distribution among the ships systems in an attempt to keep the ship from overheating (and exploding) during battles. Last but not least, someone will have to bring together this rag-tag group of space turds and help them function like a proper unit; The Captain. The captain plots the course through the galaxy (which is always randomly generated) and decides where to loot, who to murder, and how much money you'll get to buy space booze and shiny new weapons via a crew allowance!As it stands currently, beta 9.5 I believe, the game is really damn fun - at times...I'd say about half of the community is willing to help out newcomers with pleasure and give them the lo-down on how the ships work and function.The other half though... Will probably be some (irl) morbidly obese 15-16 year old captain yelling that everyone is doing everything wrong while the ship is on fire and he sits in his chair eating twinkies and contributing nothing to the rest of the crew or his ship.With all that being said, when a crew comes together, magic begins to happen. You find yourself becoming part of the bigger picture. A truly renown Captain can issue orders from his chair for what he thinks the rest of the crew should be doing... ""Full power to all systems!"" , ""Block their long range comms and prepare to engage!!"" , and my personal favorite... ""♥♥♥♥ IT! ARM THE NUKES AND PREPARE TO FIRE!!"" All while the crew scramble around the ship ensuring that we all don't die in space.IMO - A ship is only as good as its captain and crew. Make friends with the people you know and trust to do good work, and you will conquer the stars.My only ♥♥♥♥♥ about the game is that the player base is fairly small. On a good day at the right time, you'll see about 1-2 dozen games for you to hop in and out of. Or you can become your own captain and try it from the management/order-giving side of the game. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports to forward, or lame♥♥♥♥♥matchmaking, just pick a ship, and your server name and see who shows up!If you find only a few players to join, the rest of the crew can be filled with AI specific to their roles in the crew. You might want to edit how they act in the TAB menu though, because they can get a little goofy from time to time. We mainly use them to put out fires and repair the ship, but hey.. Beats trying to do it alone!There is actually a lot more content and game mechanics I could go over, but there no exploration in that!I have high hopes for this game! I recommend it at a 7/10 since it's still in beta.			"

								This game is very impressive. I thought it would be another bad early access game as soon as I looked at the trailers. Much to my delight, I was wrong about this game. As soon as I jumped in I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and went around and started flipping switches. This all would've made sense if I had just read the manual which is actually very useful.As of right now, this game has a decent amount of content for being Alpha. There are also not that many bugs and apparently this is because the dev team actually want to focus on the bugs and roll out content in Alpha. The framework is strong so I think that the content will come fairly quickly and consistently once they reach that stage. Multiplayer works amazingly. The Teamspeak integration allows players to enjoy the best in-game voice chat that I have ever used. Voice comes through crystal clear and doesn't have any real problems.  There are not really any major bugs that I have encountered so far which is one of the reasons I decided to pay for this game and not pirate it.The dev team also does not plan on raising the price in the future so if you don't want to jump on board the early access train, you can certainly wait. With that being said, I hope everyone purchases this as soon as possible so that the developers have more money to work with because they have an early access project that is actually worth funding and seeing through.As of right now, I would give this game an  8/10. Performance could probably be improved a litte bit and the AI is a bit wonky. Combat is also a little frustrating right now but I know that it will be improved as time goes on. I really can't wait to see what all Leafy Games has in store and I know that once they reach release, this will definitely be a 10/10 game. No doubt about it.			"

								Basically FTL:Faster than light, as a first person multiplayer game.Quick rundown:-Up to 5 player space treking multiplayer game with some great mechanics.-5 roles, all important for different reasons, and feel completely different to play.-Random encounters and a rearranged galaxy make for a different playthrough each time.-Planets are precrafted, but there's a fair number of them so each is hand crafted and interesting.-When things go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ they REALLY go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ a mix of thrill and panic set in when your ship catches fire mid way through a fight in your weapons room so firstly you can't fire back and secondly you have to wait for your jump drive to charge before you're even able to escape.Things that'll make this game great for you:-Having or being a good captain.(Talkative[with mic], involving, and willing to act like a damn captain)-Reading the manual for your role, cause sometimes you don't choose the weapons officer and you might have to do something more complicated than shoot a thing.-Not be afraid to kick someone or ask to have someone kicked if they're not working well with the established crew.-Being ok with a bug or two. It's early access.Final note:BUY THIS DAMN GAME ALREADY!!!(Or put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale cause its regular price is a bit harsh...)			"

								Awesome idea but still very very barebones. Multicrew experience in space, finally. but:Graphics are pretty bad (who cares but still..)Content is practically non existant, game is still in development. It gets repetitive and pretty bland after around 3 hours, at least for me and my friends (see above). So, definitely has potential, and maybe the only early access/beta/wait for it its' gonna be awesome game I'm willing to invest in. But do take in consideraton that buying this game now is to support the devs and invest in something for the future. We aren't there yet.			"

								I love this game. Yes, it's in beta. Yes, it has bugs. Yes, it's an indie title and it has a a small development team of two, but the developers fix them rapidly. The game has big potential as a fun co-op space exploration sim. Still lots of work to be done to get it where it should ultimately be, but even now it's quite playable and entertaining. It does get repetitive after a several hours of play though, but I believe that will change as the developers add more quests and content.			"

Early Access Review
								TL/DR, Tl/DR: Game is fun with friends, buy it. I forsee a great future in this game.If your story is like mine, and you're tired of the same old Early Access story and you're looking for a make it or break it review, this is the one for you.Overview:I'd like to start off this review by mentioning that I've gotten tired of ""Early-Access"" games.  I'm all too sick of the same old story: early access game hits the market, promising many innovative ideas and it either fails to deliver or simply stays in early access forever (looking at you, Space Engineers and 7days). My friends encouraged me to buy this game just to have the fun of trying something fresh and new. With 16 hours under my belt (seems like so little time, spent), I can say that I've fully explored the game. I'll go over the different roles and what they do, as well as the basic gameplay aspects, concluding with a pro's and con's list. Finally, this is definitely a team-based game, which is much better with a set of friends to BS with, so keep that in mind as you read and come to your decision on the game.(Class roles)To start with: the game is fairly simplistic and throws you into a ship of your captains choosing. However, that's the end of it. There is no tutorial to teach you what to do, and most of what you *actually* do is fairly simplistic. If you're a pilot, you fly the ship. If you're weapons, you shoot things, if you're captain, you plot courses and choose what to buy, and if you're science or engineer, well, buckle up cause it's a *little* more in-depth than the other 3 positions.  Fortunately, even that is fairly straight forward, with a simple GUI to guide the players in doing what they need to accomplish. Overall, the positions are all fairly balanced to make everyone feel like they're accomplishing something for the average gameplay. However, that's about as far as it goes. In my opinion, there is not enough for each of the positions to do. After a while, piloting just becomes flying in a straight line, science becomes spamming all the programs, weapons becomes a matter of target practice, and engineer becomes meaningless because the reactors simply become too powerful to even need adjustments to power levels. However, that's not to say that the different positions are not fun when done with other players.---TL/DR: Game is simple as it stands, and offers maybe 10 or so hours of actual content.Gameplay (Space-side): The missions themselves are very straightforward and not too fleshed out, yet.  After a while, the game starts to feel like a shoot n' loot, which is not what I think the dev's had in mind, HOWEVER, to get to this point, you need to invest quite a few hours in exploration and fighting. Which leads me into the next part of gameplay: your ship consists of multiple parts that can be upgraded and changed with your credits earned from salvage, missions, and exploration. These items include a warp drive, shields, a hull, a reactor, programs that can be ran to accomplish a multitude of things, and processors that upgrade other ship systems. This is, by far, my favorite part about the game. You can choose to either go for the big ship with lots of weapons or the quiet ship that stealths everywhere. Unfortunately, stealth is not so much a feature yet, and just something planned. Also, there are nowhere near enough items of variable description to make it feel like an adequate upgrade path.  All in all, what they have so far makes me extremelly optimistic for what they can add in the future: a list of endless items to upgrade to, multiple new weapons and shields, etc. However, as the it stands, the upgrade path is extremely linear and quite simplistic.---TL/DR: Ships can be upgraded (kinda), and missions are there, but need work.Gameplay (planet-side):Your crew can actually leave your space ship and go down to planets for a variety of reasons.  There could be a distress beacon, you could want to explore the planet for salvage or items, or simply because a mission sent you there. Most of the planets are very small and very straight forward, but this does not stop my crew from wanting to explore every single planet for what we call ""lickable♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; which is a *research* item used to get special bonuses for the crew. Here comes the caveat, the ""lickable♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is quite rare and very hard to find. Some planets extend to a radius that doesn't really suit what you can do on them, so you find yourself using your very limited stamina bar to sprint into nothingness for what can seem like hours. In reality, it only takes ten or so minutes, but the time adds up when you're doing it with every planet. ---TL/DR: Planets are very interesting to explore, but can become monotonous.Finally, I'll sum everything up with a Pro/Con list that will hopefully convince or deter anyone still on the edge of getting this gamePros:Fun to play with friendsFun to play aloneIn early access, so the dev team is active and working with their communityDev team is fast to react to community-voiced problems (hackers)AI are capable of running the ship without other playersExploration is new (kind of) a new concept, without being over usedUpgradeable shipsBoardable shipsCons:Game DOES have bugsNot too fleshed outUpgrades are linearAI handles the ship TOO well on their own (looking at YOU engi-bot)Many new features are visible, but not implemeted (scans, for one)Questline is short and repetitiveDifferent positions can get boring if you don't have a group of friends to mix things upUpdates appear to be monthly, which is a downer after Space EngineersGame doesn't have a forum yet (from what I've seen) so it's hard to communicate with the devs.			"

								Before I bought this game I watched a good old YouTuber/Streamer play it, Coestar. The game's unique way of controlling a ship with players that are the crew members of one ship made it look really interesting and in need of strategies and tactics. It's especially fun with friends, even if they are derpy or serious. Though this game is Early Access it quickly became the best game I played of all time out of all the 100+ games I have and have played. The combat, the space battles, the exploration and the quests are really fun, especially the... well... I'm sure people wouldn't want a spoiler about what the yellow flux is on some of the sectors.As I said. It's early access, maybe because it doesn't actually have way too much to explore it's still very fun to play. Outside of how it looks, the gameplay is what's worth it. Not much to explore, they constantly add patches and updates, minimum every week or so? There aren't too many planets to explore, well sure there's a fair amount but there's not a lot of planets with a variation, you can meet the same one multiple times in one play through. They even have a Forum for the game, and for being just two people making this game they're really quick at answering questions, they even have a devlog on YouTube. I really see high potentional for this game, really, really high potentional. I can already imagine how the game is going to look if they keep working on it. Its my favourite game, but based on content its a 7/10.			"

								Warped into sector with black hole.Captain stands in place repeatedly asking ""Are we dead?""10/10 Would suffer lack of leadership again.In all seriousness ""Pulsar Lost Colony"" has probably became one of my favorite games after only a week or so of me playing it. As someone who has loved Star Trek all my life and has always wanted a game that would simulate running a ship simular to the enterprise. I can say that Pulsar is an exquisite game. There are several diffrent ships ranging from the small ""Stargazer"" class stealth transport. To the ""Roland"" class cruiser which is so huge that it could probably fit several other ships in the game inside it. Each of the ship choices are unique and have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, one ship could have signifigantly better armor but its thrusters can't reverse. There are also some less stat based diffrences such as the engineering room being placed closer or farther to the bridge. The ship systems also go above and beyond those of other similar games. In no other game have I ever felt so proud to know the proper procedures that it requires to reboot a ships OS. The classes all feel unique however it does sometimes feel as if you may not be needed as anyone on the ship can do anyone's job with the right knowledge and talents. The game is surprisingly in depth. me and my friends decided to beam down to a seemingly empty planet only for our science officer to report that the scanner was picking up a nearby teleporter, this lead us to a secret weapons shop. Their are three playable factions in game right now, and as to not bother explaining them I will sum them up by naming them what they basicly are: Star Fleet, Semi-evil corporation, and space criminals. Each use two out of the six playable ships which are sadly restricted to their respective factions (However personally I feel it adds realism) In terms of the missions in the game, they each feel like an episode of star trek ""DUDE THIS IS LIKE AN EPISODE OF STAR TREK"" -My friend. The missions will have you find crews encased in cocoons, Crashed ships whose lone survivor wishes for you not to report that he survived so that he can stay with his ship, and abandoned stations full of uncontained beasts for extermination (On that particular misson a scan from our ship showed a humonoid aboard the station which we could never find, Creepy)In conclusion this is probably my new favorite game for a long time. 10/10			"

								A year ago when I first bought my copy off of the developer's website I knew I had something that could potentionally be amazing. I described it to my friends as ""Guns of Icarus meets Artemis Bridge Simulator"" and my crew and I have played every build that's been released. Maybe 3D co-op FTL is more apt? Anyway: you and your crew set out in an open galaxy where you can fight, explore, trade, etc. It's definitely not perfect, but it's fun and the updates are fairly regular. It'll scratch that multicrew Star Citizen/Elite Dangerous itch, though with far less fidelity. The developer's say they want to make something special, and I think they're going to. The first time I donned my EV suit and teleported down to a hazardous planet with my friends, or teleported to the enemy ship and murdered their crew I knew I'd be playing this game for years to come.

								This game is an hidden gem. You progress as a team of 5, going through missions or wandering around the galaxy, with a sophisticated ship. However it clearly lack a good artistic direction. If you can get over the bad graphics, you will find a new way to play, as you will collaborate with your team to make your ship work. It's fairly easy to start, and the game is deep enough for you to learn new things after 10 hours. Usually my evening just vanishes when playing Pulsar.It still lack some contents, like missions, and it's doing poorly to explain things, but once you're in, it's hard to get out.Surprisingly it's not too hard to find players on pub, and most of them are pretty welcoming. You can also play with bots, which are doing the job.			"

								Holy god this game is a winner. You've probably seen all the other reviews saying this game is like FTl, but in 3D. Well, that's exactly true. I'll add that the way you control all of the systems is by going up to a display and simply clicking on the buttons you want to select, no pressing an 'interact button' first or anything; it certainly adds an extra level of realism. This game seems as close as you could come to playing as a member of the crew on the starship enterprise, sprinting around and managing the ship's sytems.I WILL say that in the current state (Nov. 5th, 2015), the universe is a little shallow, a few mechanics haven't been fully flushed out, and some of the player models and environment models still need a lot of work. But the game's foundations are strong. Some tender love from the devs could turn this into a staple game for all those space-sim lovers out there.			"

								Hello dear astronauts!When I saw the trailer of this game I was sold. It had all the good stuff! Space exploration, space ships, space battles, space ants/spiders/robots, and it had space itself. I started playing it, and I just couldn't stop. Started out joining a random game where someone taught me all the basics. And hell, there are a lot of basics! Learning the game is pretty overwhelming at first. Untill you have played all 4 support roles it is hard to be the captain. Thus, the day after the basics I decided to dedicate my day comandeering the U.S.S. Flying dutchman. I found some people, put them on a teamspeak and we played for about 8 hours straight. The experience was amazing! I lead us to planets, bandits, dronespaceships, and all there is to do. Everyone was immersed in their role, and achieving the goals I set for them. The one main problem we found out though was this. After 8 hours of playing the game, we had seen it all. We had beaten both bosses, seen the infected ( which you cant actually kill yet.), been to all exotic shops, upgraded all the gear on the ship untill there was no proper match for us anymore. It was lacking content, but I kept longing for more. Tl;Dr?Pro's: -Awesome gameplay. You are free to do w/e you want.-Game really promotes player interaction. You have to function as a team. No soloing here.-It is very immersive. You get into your role and stick with it almost naturally. Cons:-Some minor bugs. Server list not reloading, mines not blowing up, laser targetting messing up etc. -Severe lack of content though this will most probably be worked on by the dev team!-The game will take you and make you play it till theres nothing left to play. (might actually be a good thing)-Game is quite boring without actual voice chat. (might be different for you)Final verdict: Buy this! But if you're patient enough, wait for a couple of months untill there is more content.			"

								I wish there was a ""mostly recommend"" option, because I recommend it, but with a warning. Only get this game if you have  2+ friends to play with. While joining random games can be entertaining, this game functions incredibly well as something akin to a bar game; you're mostly there to hang out with people you like while sometimes something serious happens to keep conversation light. Easily the best Star Trek simulator out there, but without a solid group it's still a bar game, but with strangers which is sometimes a great night, but other times results in you wishing you had just stayed home.The game updates fequently, and new content is still being added so it's an Early Access/Kickstarter success story so far, but I'd find a couple of friends to play this with you before you take the plunge.

Early Access Review
								I've been playing the Early Access version of PULSAR and I have to say I'm impressed. I normally avoid early access after being burned by Dean Hall and DayZ but this game had me hooked within an hour.The sense of exploration and adventure is really the focal point of this game, and they're things that a lot of games set out to achieve. The problem with most games out there is that their goals are attainable by just about anyone who picks them up. Challenges are set by the player themselves, and gaming (even in many multiplayer games) can feel like a very solitary experience.PULSAR requires coordination with players (I really don't recommend this game unless you have at LEAST 3 other people to play it with) and that coordination is what drives this game. Suddenly it isn't the individual that chooses the difficulty and the challenge, it's everyone. You all work together and stand aside one another in the face of adversity--be it brutal enemy starship fights or exploration of labyrinthine caverns on distant worlds.The devs have taken a very simple idea and made it into something very fresh and inspiring. It's hard to adequately describe the rush of emotions you get when winning your first starship fights as a team...or exploring sectors and sending away teams on investigations. This is one of the few TRULY ""cooperative"" games out there in recent years. I strongly recommend that fans of co-op games and sci fi/space games keep a close eye on this. If you aren't an early access type of person, add this to your wishlist and track it in its development.			"

Early Access Review
								I really love this game!  That being said I'll start with the negatives. The game itself can become a little repetative and there is an akwardness in joining quiet or dead games especially when only one person has a mic and is talking the entire time, or you join two friends who are just going to make inside jokes all game. The difficulty level can be steep for new players figuring out the mechanics which I don't see as a negative but a maybe a roadblock for players who don't play many RNG type games. As far as the repetition goes I found that the planets began to feel very confined and cookie cutter. You'll see a cave planet, ice planet, desert planet, lava planet but each planet takes about under 10minutes to see all there is. There are some pretty cool artifacts and other ancient alien type structures to explore but as of my last game they seemed pretty empty other than for having that first time experience they became something just to move on from during gameplay. Which brings me to combat... the combat actually requires the crew to work together to do well. This is where games can go dead if one or more players is either too inexperienced or do not have mics to work as fluidly with the other roles. This is another issue that I think makes the game fun but can also make it hard to find players and a working crew during certain hours. I found that during off hours the AI bots did better than many players and farming by myself actually seemed to be a better option. I liked this feature from the sense of being able to farm scrap but quickly noticed how empty/shallow the game started to feel. When I started playing with players again it became a mix of either being too impatient to teach the game again and again or felt impartial when playing with experienced players who just wanted to teach you again and again.On the flipside I would also find over about 65% of my games really pushed me into the simulation of having to pull things together on the fly and with other players I definitely made a good amount of new steam friends. The best games were the ones where everyone just started naturally roleplaying to complete the tasks at hand but it was also hard for the subconcious indoctrination of space TV dramas to not make their way onto stage. Throughout all this the need to maintain fires and subsystems while adapating to attack patterns cohesively became very addictive.  I would highly recommend this game especially to sci-fi / spacesim / co-op fans who enjoy casual/moderate core gaming. If this game had pvp I would probably having all my gamer friends playing it. In the meantime as someone who is a huge FTL fan this has been like a dream come true. I look forward revisiting this game with a friend or after a major update... l			"

								I assemble a crew of the finest men the galaxy has to offer.None of us are qualified to operate anything more advanced than a toaster.We board the U.S.S Planet Smasher.Straight to the space port to buy fuel for our adventures.Through the warp gate we go to begin our journey.A mission is close by on an alien planet, sounds good!The robot raiders are scum, we eradicate them with no mercy.We found the artifact, ""beam me up boys"".Scientist tells me about a neutral ship close by.We pay it a ""friendly"" visit.Our cannons pound the ship into submission and we board them.All crew members are killed and the ship is stripped for parts and cargo.Once again we jump into lightspeed.I eat biscuits from my locker.I steal gear from my crew's lockers.We drop out of lightspeed.Immediately hostile ships attack and we get into a major confrontation.Not a problem.Pilot lines up the weapons platform to fire.Weapon expert mows them down with ease.We celebrate with cheers and the crew engages in small arms lazer fire on the main deck.I give a 10 minute lecture on the health and safety issues of firing small arms inside a spacecraft and then I hand out disciplinaries.We jump back into lightspeed.The pilot mentions that we can make moonshine out of engine fuel...I immediately yell to ""Stop the ship""The fuel tank is emptied and transformed into alcohol.We party.After drinking all the fuel we are wasted and decide to eject the core into space.Then we slowly turn on eachother as we wait for death inside our now immobile ship.The U.S.S Planet Smasher enjoyed 56 glorious minute's of flight and adventure before being obliterated by space pirates.The crew commends their captain on his decisions as the game over screen engulfs us all.10/10You will meet some of the most pleasant people on steam and then bumble around trying and failing to operate a space craft together before your inevitable doom.

								This is a review for Beta 12.2, and the game is most definitely not done yet, though it's quite playable and fun. If you're wondering if you should play it, I would answer ""yes, probably later"".A brief list of things not done yet:Any VR supportA victory conditionFinal balanceMost of the science scansNon-trivial progression (I hope this is intended to be added, but not sure)There's probably 10-20 hours of gameplay in this thing, unless you like doing the same stuff over and over.Now for the real review. This is a game about being the crew of one spaceship going about the galaxy doing stuff. It supports up to 5 players, though any role but Captain can be taken over by bots. You're the only player ship; there is no multiplayer except for the rest of your crew. There are 5 roles: Captain, Engineer, Scientist, Pilot, Weapons Specialist. The captain basically just sets objectives, controls purchasing, and yells at people. He also can authorize a couple drastic measures, like Emergency Blind Warp. The pilot flies the ship and aligns warps. That's it. The gunner fires the guns. That's also it. The engineer manages power allocation, fixes the ship, charges the warp drive, puts out fires, and reboots the ship, if necessary. The scientist toggles between 2 shield modes, scans other ships and planets for lifeforms, their ship components, and to determine if the environment is safe. They also conduct cyber warfare against enemy ships, and do research.These are just the default roles; most players can do most things, as they're not locked to a class. Nothing prevents you from wandering over to the engineer's station to recharge your viruses as the scientist, except the fact it's easier to ask him to do it himself. Even the powerful main gun can be fired by anyone taking the right talent (it costs 1 point, and you get 2 per level). Further, manning guns, fighting fires, doing repairs, and going on away missions are all things that are really shared responsibilities. The pilot can't run off and man a gun in the middle of combat (unless he's replaced at the helm by another crew member), but the engineer, scientist, and/or captain could easily decide their talents would be best used in the weapons bay, depending on the particular combat in question.Captain - This role depends entirely on your own communication skills, and if your crew is a box of awfuls or not. In an experienced crew, you may find yourself with little to do beyond picking the objectives and going on away missions.Gunner - Sit in a gun, shoot it every time it's charged and you have a clean shot. Also the most easily botted role.Pilot - As piloting plus gunning is enough to have a game, I feel like this is one of the most engaging roles.Scientist - Cyber warfare is disappointing, because there's no real way to scale it. You can buff your cyber defenses with firewalls, but your offense starts as good as it ever gets. That means your impact on fights is minimal, and you're better off manning a gun most of the time.Engineer - Engineers dump coolant, and hope nothing breaks. That's about it.Lets talk about away missions briefly. Most are bad. You beam down to a mission, you fight somewhere between 0 and 50 enemies, most of whom just charge in to melee you and you shoot them while backpedaling. Then you look around for science items and ship parts. Eventually the scientist gets upgrades to make this procedure a lot easier, in the form of a neat scanner that tells him where stuff is. The actual FPS combat feels like they bought it off the shelf and implemented it as-is. It feels worse than Merchant Marine. That said, there are some handcrafted missions/encounters that just feel awesome. If you ever beam down and find yourself on a train, you're in for a good time.Finally, I'll talk about pacing a bit. I expect they'll stretch it out a bit as they near release; games are usually a lot easier to progress through in Early Access so you can find bugs and/or the good parts faster. For each kind of ship component, there are roughly 2 viable choices, and 3 or so bad ones. Sometimes less. For instance, there's a jump drive that charges quickly, one with a tiny EM signature making you harder to sense, a slower, longer range one, and a standard one. The answer, of course, is pick the longest range one and then pump up your charge time with talents and jump processors. You can also upgrade your ship by boarding an enemy and taking over. This is awesome, but not too exciting from a progression standpoint. The strongest combat ship is the game is one of the starter ships. You can buy the best cyber warfare programs at the beginning of the game, or start with them. Currently the basic path of the game goes: begin, do a few missions for credits and upgrades, then go grind science for a long time or until you have all the talents you want. Then fight the unique ""boss"" ships, steal their special parts, and declare victory.And a bonus pet peeve: something called the infection spreads across the galaxy. You may be able to stop it by fighting, but you definitely can't handle it in any other way. The requirements for fighting it are extremely high. This means that your endgame is a warship or a warship, or having necessarily few choices and opportunities than a warship would.Overall though, it's an awesome game because you get a persistant universe, and a ship you crew with up to 4 of your closest friends (except that guy in engineering, he's a jerk and he never gives you enough power). The idea is so, so good and the core of the game is so good that in spite of all my whining above, and all the polish the game still needs to reach version 1.0, I highly recommend it. Just maybe not quite yet.			"

								Although I can't recommend this game in its current state to the general public, still being in Alpha, I very much adore this game. Those who enjoyed playing Artemis, or who love Star Trek and playing Escape Velocity back in the day will similarly enjoy this game even as is. The future looks very bright indeed. My only real critique is the pricing for the current state of the game; it should be lower. Nonetheless, $25 or so for this project will be well worth it down the road. I'm very picky with games but this is something a lot of people will enjoy.Pros:-Fun and imaginitive gameplay-Star Trek lovers will appreciate for sure-Not too complicated, and yet has some depth-Good co-op teamwork required-Some of the visuals look great already-Great sound design for the ship-Successful implementation of a game type rarely achieved-Merges smoothly different genres of gaming togetherCons:-Still needs more time to develop into a fuller game (it is in Alpha obviously) For example: More content, more polish, more sounds, more of well, everything...-Could still use more stability (Alpha)-Still quite buggy (Alpha)-Overpriced for its current state-Not enough creativity in terms of ship customization or ship types-Still a little clunky with its gameplay mechanic of first person shooter and ""point and click on panels"" (although there is every indicaton that this will improve)-Still missing a bit of clarity in terms of what needs to be done by certain classes			"

								 Pulsar has really managed to capture that ""Star Trek,"" feeling in a way that many games have tried but failed.  My friends and I  have all been really pleased at the depth of the various ship positions and roles that have kept us all busy.  It is also important to specifically mention the away missions that, while short, have been interesting and varied, full of cool things to see and do in an ever expanding universe.Now the part that blew me away:At 11:09 I sent the developer a bug report via email.  At 11:35 I recived a reply from one of the developers!  I was extremely impressed with the prompt response and comforted.  Most of us have been burned by early access games and this intereaction conviced me that this team is active, involved, and interested in the players and what they have to say.  "

								Although my computer reacts very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this one (15-30 FPS, which has something bound to resolution), i must DEFINITLY recommend this game. Core of the game You start off in a ship of choice (A cruiser, a stealth cruiser, frigate, etc.), and you must work together with each other to ""find the Lost Colony"". Although im not sure this is implemented yet, the goal of the game through my experience, says we need to repel the ""infected"", a organic apocalypse growing through space (and very lethal!). This may only be accomplished by  buying nukes in exotic shops , or if youre a tactical genius, you may just find another way. In any case, teamwork is definitly a thing here, and tactics on what to upgrade, since the game has a ""FTL-ish"" styled increasing curve in difficulity, known as the ""chaos level"". This increases each time you jump, and you cannot counter the increase of the chaos level. Also, besides from being inside your ship, you can explore planets (which currently are static locations), board enemy ships (Better get a better gun first...), which really extends the potential of the game. I can't wait to see what the future of this game will bring. But please fix the resolution problem, if this has something to do with the technical difficulities of PULSAR: LC. "

								Now as I've played this game for around 40 hours, I think that I'm ready to review this game.If you ever watched Star Trek, I'm sure you always loved how the bridge crew communicated and worked together in combat. It seems so EPIC and as i saw and bought this game, that was the experience i wanted. Did i get it? For the most.If you find a proper crew which uses a microphone, you can really achieve this epic communication and cooperation between the players. It actually happens often and this game turns really immersive and engaging. What is the problem then? I would love each role to achieve greater complexity. Scientist barely do stuff when in combat, weapons specialist only does something when in combat. It all turns out as a wait for your role to have any responsibility. When it is your turn, though, it is REALLY fun.5 Pros and consPros:- A decent mission-system, making the crew have a goal in mind.- Very nice mechanics when it comes to interacting with displays etc.- Very immersive when together with a proper crew- EVAs- A great varity of different ships and components which each behave very differently and you really feel that you can make your ship your own.Cons:- Poor FPS combat- Planets are small and generally not very interesting- Can sometimes be hard to find a proper game of your liking.- Poor player physics- Poor graphicsI'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the Star Trek bridge scenes. This game has a large potion of hours in it already and the game has great potential.			"

								Pulsar Lost Colony has a strong foundation but is generally empty and shallow compared to what they're claiming should be in the game at this point.Now don't get wrong, it's not a terrible game - but it's definitely at this point not worth the 25.00 you pay for it.The AI is completely broken still, you're incapable of capturing multiple ships and there's a LOT of bugs with creatures/npc's/stations/bases.As well the game is extremely repetitive and the majority of planets you visit are copy pasted. In the three hours I played I visited 4 desert planets and 3 frozen planets - all of which with repeated terrain and base layouts.The combat is also the same each and every fight - you circle your opponent and shoot them until one of you dies. Boarding is pointless - since you cant have multiple ships there's really no point to ever going onto the enemy ship. Upgrades are fairly easy to get within the first hour of the game, so that is also an issue.Overall it's not a great game - I'd give it a 5 - as of right now it needs a lot of work and I would not suggest buying it for 25 dollars.Sorry!

								Well worth the investment. As a captain, bonding with your crew and watching their teamwork and efficiency increase over time is extremely rewarding. My play style tends to involve capturing and salvaging ships for profit. My only concern is the viability of ""Stealth"" based strategy. Me and my crew tried for hours, carefully maintaining 0.0 - 0.3 EM Emissions on the Stargazer and Intrepid, it works to a degree, but not enough to embrace the A.O.G cunning of the lore. Being able to siphon credits above 6.0km for instance without the target gaining divine awareness of you once infected... Also, being able to remain stealth and make use of Gentlemen's Welcome with reasonable range and efficiency.That would truly send the game over the top for me!Timex			"

								A very interesting crew / space sim where you play with 4 bots / other human players as crew of any of 5 spaceship designs.Start the game up, join / create a game and take on the role of the captain, pilot, science officer, engineer or weapons officer and assist your colleagues in survival and completing quests by navigating through the galaxy, combat enemies in space, board enemy vessels and take them over, be part of away teams to investigate structures on the surface of numerous planets and upgrade your own and your ships stats along the way.A very interesting concept, building on the idea of games like Artemis Bridge Simulator and adding a more RPG or personal touch. Run around your ship, that of your enemy, space stations, planet surfaces whilst assisting through the role you pick and excelling in performing in it.The graphics are reasonably, but not excessively realistic. In a game like this I find graphics not as important as the mechanics and environments that provide the actual immersion. The game mechanics are such that the different roles one can assume really rely on eachother, but there are some things that could be improved in that department.The sound effects are good, but again, in my opinion not as important as the game mechanics and the roles people fill with their characters.There are still some bugs, and most environments tend to become a little dull after a while, but that's all work in progress. I would also love to see even more involvement of certain roles. The Pilot role for instance doesn't seem as important at times, and the available options for the other roles also seem a bit limited and could do with some expansion.With the addition of in-game voicechat (which to be honest, I haven't tested yet myself, but I will later tonight) I think this game and its developers are going in the right direction, and I have high hopes for this title.It is already well worth its price, well executed and incredibly addictive to play. Keep it up dev! ;-)			"

								This is, by far, one of the most UNDERRATED games on Steam. I think part of it is how hard it is to pilot a ship by yourself. Perhaps also the perception of a steep learning curve (it's not that hard, really!).. There are things missing still, like the distinct lack of Cargo Trading runs (at least, that i can find so far).But this game has nearly everything I always want in a space flight sim! Political Intrigue, Crew Dynamics, ships to explore, a variety of planet surfaces and away missions, ship parts galore, inventory items galore, roasted Ants, it has everything!While there seems to be little to do in a system once you jump in, that could be a matter addressed by the frequent and ongoing content additions the developers are constantly providing. It is a shame this game seems so overlooked. It is an amazing space game, you're really missing out. Especially for Linux0rz, where the presence of awesomely amazing space games like this are distinctly lacking.			"

								PULSAR: Lost Colony is actually a very well done game by a small indie developer, and it's about you serving and/or captaining a starship and going on a journey through space.Been with the game since Beta 3, and I can assure to anyone thinking of buying this game that tons of progress has been made since then. The most recent major update in Beta 8 allowed you to hail other ships, instead of just flat out fight them the second you see them. It really adds to the immersion of the whole game.With any game there's bugs, but none are overwhelmingly large enough to be game breaking and most are minor, for now. The devs have done a good job in QA testing their game and each update. Whenever they see a bug they usually do their best to fix it ASAP. Sometimes a bugfix will come in a patch version big enough to actually introduce a few tidbits of new content too. Always a good thing.Some things are actually still missing, for instance; there's some key elements to the lore that are implied but not written in stone or shown in the game just yet. Updates have done their best to bring in more lore based content alongside meaningful core mechanics to the game. It should be made clear the devs are focusing on getting all core mechanics down first, before focusing on any big time content. Regardless, the game is still a bit vast in these initial stages.Some people on the forums on the dev's website have suggested removing warp times and simply allowing a Captain to choose when to skip a warp. This would likely be a very good idea; if your ship has been damaged heavily in a firefight, being in that warp gives you the time to do what you can to get it battle ready, despite whatever shape it's in. Furthermore, let's say your crew is RPing? It would be perfect for RPing crews to use that time inbetween warps to socialize amongst crew and advance their own story. Despite these reasons, the devs have yet to make any adjustments let alone make any comments about this (to my knowledge). This so far, in my view, the only major con.Pulsar: LC is a well done game. There are things that need to be done, but for what it is right now, it is a well done game.			"

Early Access Review
								So... How to put this...This is a freakin, AMAZING GAME.Shall I simplify?Nah I don't have to.But I should.Because it's awesome and you should know why if you haven't bought it already.Which you should have.Because its awesome.Aaaaaaaanyway.The graphics aren't great, but.. hey who cares? The gameplay rocks!You have to work as a team or your ship will die, it has a very 'firefly, star trek, galaxy quest' style of gameplay where you all choose roles etc. I was the weapons specialist and my job was to fire big guns and be the away team, so essentially what you'd call a red shirt.I always died.The cons:Well, it's beta, so there are a few bugs, and the diversity of equipment is low.But that's all I found to gripe about.In my first two hours, I:Beamed down onto a lava planet in my exosuit with the crew and killed a bunch of slugs in some caves.Went to numerous desert planets and icy planets.Saw my Captain get swollowed up by some giant worm like thing.Got eaten by a bunch of large ants whilst exploring some old ruins.Blew up an enemy ship whilst my captain was aboard.Got shot by some robot thingy.And developed an unnatural fondness with the nuke we had on board the ship.What a misfit crew we made.So.... Essentially this game has been one of the most enjoyable games I have played of late; having found myself bored with games and desperately looking for some relief... This, this is the game. And in the first two hours I have done so much, bonded with the crew. It truly is one of the best games on steam, and is very worth the amount of money it costs. The development team listens closely to it's fans and is very active. I was following their youtube channel for a year keeping up with the dev logs.Basically, buy it. If you like team based, explorative sci fi games that have the potential to create fun stories and scenarios, this is the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
								A really good spaceship crew simulator. Very similar in crew roles and responsibilities to Artemis: Spaceship bridge simulator (also reccommended) with the added ability to go on away missions and added RPG elements to crew members and abilities.Basically, become the crew of your preferred sci-fi universe and run the ship as though you were Captain Kirk/Mr. Spock.Play as the Captain, Science officer, Engineer, Weapons officer or Pilot, each having their own roles, responsibilites, strengths and weaknesses for each situation you come across.Not for people who want pretty, pretty graphics but if you like solid - if obviously incomplete gameplay, you'll love this. Crew stations and other mechanics need to be explained better but the game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. One thing that I think really needs to be added is the ability to have multiple crews - the galaxy is just massive and it'd take forever for a single crew to explore the whole thing. Teaming up (hell, even a head-to head mode) with other players would make this game incredible.			"

								Pulsar is probably one of the best early access games out there on steam at the moment. This game does infact have alot of potential, and just needs more frequent updates to get small bugs fixed.One thing i think would be good for this game is, Make your own custom ship. This will add a lot more freedom for players and will be great for people who want to make massive battle ships. Of course this is easier said than done, but i still beleive its possible. You could make it so the way you get parts for your ship is by collecting them from, say other ships when you destroy them etc. The game also needs alot more planets and freedom to walk around them. I find myself stuck in one little part of the planet blocked off by invisible walls.   Another idea would be if you could be able to make your own weaponry for players and for your ship if you have enough crew members.All in all the game is great for early access. It may not be worth 25 USD just yet but i beleive if the team sticks to the game and has frequent updates, this game can be really amazing. "

								4 hours of game time during Early Access as of this review.There aren't many games that offer space action, planetary adventure, sandbox freedom, and the intimacy of small player groups in sprawling game worlds. The team at Leafy Games have managed to bring these concepts together into this game.It must be stated again that this is currently an Early Access game that does have it's share of bugs to stamp out, and content to develop. I'm eager to see what Leafy Games can do to make this a fully fledged release title.Bugs that were encountered were few and far between as of this review. Only two came up during my time thus far:-Attempted to transport to Outpost 448 after travelling for awhile and ended up teleported out into space. A quick relog fixed the issue.-Helm control seems to give out unexpectedly. Unsure if this is a lag/network issue.The concept is there. Bring me more!			"

								When my friend initially told me about Pulsar I thought that it would not be enjoyable for me, I primarily play first person shooters and role playing games. but after 25 hours I can safely say that it has been a ton of fun for me to play. Pulsar is meant to be played as a coop game but can be played with one player and 4 bots I would suggest that you play with at least two players if not just for the beginning when you're trying to understand the game mechanics. In the current version as of this review (Beta 9.5) You don't have a set goal, you can get missions from your faction over long range comms or from finding quest givers scattered throughout the galaxy. Throughout the galaxy which is randomly generated from a seed every play through it will spawn planets, trade and repair stations, exotic shops, and other things that I will not spoil for you. Even in this games very early state it has more than enough content for me to justify dropping 25 dollars which on normal early access games, because of how most developers seem to handle early access. Luckily Leafy games seem to be on the right track with this game, they post updates to their YouTube channel often with what they are working on. After this lengthy intro, here's a list of pros and cons.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keep in mind as this is a beta these can and most likely will change.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros -Intresting mechanics for each class to learn and utilize-Varied classes that have important roles-Better than average space games combat-Immerive gameplay and exploration-Quite a lot of planets to explore with your crew-Unique starting ships -Extensive ship customization-Charecter talent tree-Extremely fun with freinds during combat sections and planet exploration.Cons -Poor graphics -Very bad optimization-Weapon choice is very similar for player-Many of the ships you can use are not useful-Poor sound design-Little variaty in planet enviroments and little area to explore on planets-Certain enemies unfun to fight (Shock drones) -Enemy variety-Faction reputation can decrease for being attacked by drones even though they attack on sight to people not with their factionWhile this list of cons is lengthy they are things that I believe the dev team will (eventually) fix. If you're going to buy a co-op game this is one you should strongly consider.			"

								Pulsar is incredibly impressive considering the small dev team and their HUGE ambitions.  After years and years of competitive PvP and shooters its nice to have a game that forces players to work together.  Every team member has a special and crucial skillset.  In almost every encounter each member of the team will need to act quickly and coordinate their actions with each other.  Within a few warps and after a couple battles your teamspeak will inevitably start to sound like an episode of Star Trek.  The learning curve is a bit steep but rewarding.  I've played for 25 hours and still have encounters that surprise me, although the main weakness this game has is lack of content.  It can get boring fighting one security drone after another.  The team is adding more and more content and we get updates every week or two.  They are very responsive and professional.DEVS IF YOU ARE LISTENING... here are a few suggestions...-More varied alien creatures (humanoid, insectoid, reptillian, greys, etc)-Special encounters with new species of life (a giant space squid that feeds off shield power for example) -Ability for team members to become INFECTED by alien organisms that can break out of their bodies and infect other crew members...-A medical officer position (and sick bay)Anyway thats it for me, I love this game!!

Early Access Review
								TL:DR at bottomFirst I'd like to say, I applaud the developers. This game is pretty damn amazing, even being in early access. It is definitely a game for fans of shows/games like Star Trek that have multiple distinct roles for people to fill. The gameplay and content just in this early access is phenomenal. With that said, I'll give you a list of my pros and cons! I will be assuming a five player crew in most of the points with a few exceptions that I'll point out.--Pros--1] First off are the positions that you can take on the ship. Taking a class is truly defining what you do and actually see in the game. Each of the roles is specific and has talent points that enhance their ability to perform their station. During the game, as you go to planets you can pick up research materials lying around that will allow you to research additional bonuses that your crew can spend talent points one. Note, not all research is for the entire crew, some are role specific, but can offer bigger bonuses compared to the all around researchable skills.2] Next is the universe. . . It's pretty huge tbh. Now, a lot of people are going to say that the stars and whatnot get reused occasionally and honestly, they'd be right. Honestly though, out of the near 20 hours I've been playing, it has never ceased to amaze me with how beautiful space is.3] The space battles. These are pretty cool, especially some of the tougher fights where you're fighting 3 or more opponents. There are different types of lasers that also have a noticably different color and it makes a spectacular light show that is just amazing to watch. Not to mention you can just feel the ship rumble when the man turret fires lighting your enemy into a bright explosion of debris.----Neutral----I wasn't sure if I was going to add this to the list but there are a couple that I had though about that were a little hit or miss for me.1] Lighting is a little odd. Now the hull of the ship when lasers are flying by or the star is gently glinting off the ship, all of that looks phenomenal. But at the same time, there is a little problem with the interior lighting that sometimes bugs me. There are places on the ship that even if you have the interior lights turned on, are WAY too dark to see, even using the flashlight. I find these a little troubling because when I think of space age ships, I'm thinking of REALLY brightly lit ships so you can actually see where you're going or if you have a helmet, it outlines the edges of the ship so you know exactly where objects are.2] Planets are a little small for how big they look out the viewport. I do understand that the developers want to keep you near where stuff actually is on the planet. But the way the developers keep you from just wandering into some crazy wilderness is either by a radiation wall which, if you pass it, will slowly kill you unless you return. Or by having a giant sand critter pop out of the ground to instant nibble on your gibblets. The flipside though, is that the planets themselves look fairly well made. They may need a bit of polish to be sure, but this is early access.3] The faction system is a nice idea, but i feel at the moment it's a bit to sensitive as well as unused for the most part. I think the only thing that has happened by screwing rep up is giving me a reason to avoid going to ship investigation sites.--Cons--1] First up here is the price. At the moment I would recommend waiting for either a sale or something similar before purchasing a copy as I feel, atm 25 dollars is too high. While it may be a great price for it when it goes and releases, atm it's a bit too steep with unfinished content. (Yes I know i received it for free)2] Next are the bots. At the moment, the npcs (usually the ones with weapons not the little bug things) are exceptionally accurate, yours AND the enemies. This makes trying to either take a ship or clear a facility on a planet just a little bit frustrating. You'll eventually get it done, but it might take you 2-4 tries just to knock out all the enemies because of the pinpoint accuracy.3] Last is honestly the textures for the characters themselves. To be honest to is just a minor gripe but I feel as if the developers decided to wait before they update the models. I definitely love the feel of the game, and playing it with 4 other friends is just an amazing experience. There are also a good amount of games that are on the list that are doing roleplay sessions which I can't help but imagine they're amazing.Overall, I'd rate this game a 7.5/10 AT THIS MOMENT. The game definitely has potential, and is a definite must buy if it's during a sale. Otherwise, keep an eye on the game as it develops and offer these developers as much support as possible.TL:DR; 7.5/10, great potential, buy during sale, or if you have 4 other friends to jump into the game with you.

Early Access Review
								This game is insanely fun to play with friends, and the devs are awesome. It's basically Star Trek Bridge Simulator, just with a smaller crew. You can select one of many ships, each with different interiors and starting equipment. In this game, you take command of a ship with up to 4 friends (Making 5 people, including you). You must explore the galaxy, jumping between Star Systems, taking on quests, avoiding or fighting pirates, and exploring planets.There are 5 different roles, each of which (except captain) can be filled in by bots. The bots are highly customizable and a very well made.Captain: In charge of the ship, commands the crew and will generally help out with weapons.Pilot: A good pilot is they key to winning any combat situation. The pilot must work with the weapon's specialist to maneuver the ship during combat and avoid enemy fire. The pilot is also in charge of alligning the ship for warp.Engineer: A good engineer is essential for any vessel. The Engineer is in charge of managing power and coolant so that the ship's core does not overheat, and charging the warp drive. The engineer must allocate power to different systems according to the situation, such as lowering the engine power to supply more to shields.Weapon's Specialist: In charge of manning the guns of the ship for combat.Scientist: The support of the ship. The Scientist is in charge of applying buffs to your ship and debuffs to enemy vessels through the usage of viruses and programs.- Best played with 3-5 People (Solo and 2-Player is doable, but not as fun).- Devs are actively updating the game, systems are improving.- UI and Ground Combat need some work, but it's still playable.- Occasional gamebreaking bug/minor issue, but it's an Early Access game so it's expected.- Not very many main quests, I imagine this will be worked on in the future.

								      I found that this game is surprisingly enjoyable.  The separation of duties of piloting a spacecraft made for a very quick imersion into the game.       I have yet to play all five roles that are available, each holds value and importance during you game play.  The five roles are as follows: Pilot, controls the actual flying of your vessel.  Scientist, handles tweeking of computer systems and cyber warfare to other spacecraft.  Engineer, runs the engine room and the over all power to the ship.  Weapons Officer, FIRE THE MISSLES!!!!!  Finally, the Captian, controls the navigation course and overall Captian duties.     You can travel from star system to star system, enjoying all the sights that space has to offer.  If you come across a planet you can go down and explore it.  There are deleric ships and spacestations that you can explore as well.  While star jumping/warp drving, some points can be inside terrain structures.  This terrian structures is one thing that caught me off guard, suddenly you are floating around inside a massive cave with crystals.        If you like star jumping, phaser blasting, space exploring scifi adventure, then this game is up your alley.			"

								Really fun space simulation game, just like Star Trek. Take the roll of Captain, Engineer, Scientist, Weapons Specialist or Pilot. (Up to 5 players, with possible bots).I've been playing this lately with a friend and we love it a lot. It's really fun to jump between different star systems, destroying ships and exploring planets. There is also a handful of quests that are avaliable to complete too. Overall seems like quite a nice game, It's only in beta so I assume there is still lots more to come - and I can't wait! :)I'm looking forward to some diplomatic options to make things more interesting, and would love to see different alien species that you can play as instead of just human-like people. :)			"

								First review, so bare with me ;)PULSAR: Lost Colony is a great game I am enjoying to explore.The game It about you as a crewmember of a space ship.There are 5 members that on absence of a human player can be filled with a BOT.5 Tasks that make your ship run good or bad, depends on how disciplined people are to act as a crew.Captain = The boss, he orders other 4 crewmembers. His commands must be straigh forward and usefull, if not BOOM !Weapon Specialist = The gunner of the ship. Has outside view and shoots when ordered to by the captain.Science = The Spock of the ship. Inserts virus in to enemies ships in battle, checks other ships, planets, etc.Engineer = Controls ships energy flow, reactor temperature and keeps others from glowing in the dark.Pilot = Stears the ship, keeps the ship aligned to jump and keeps the gunner in view of targets.Once you joined a ship (Server) you must select witch available job you wish to take on you.Before selecting there is possible chat or voice chat with the crew also in the server.The missions are diverse, from finding a ship to locate something on planets, teleport to it and make the mission succesfull. On the long run I suspect the missions are repetetive dough ^^On succes you can make your character grow with talent points, have are perosnal while others are ship/crew improvements.The more you poke around in the universe the more chaos you inflict (difficulty).Graphics are not the best we are used to these days.

								A common way to describe this game is FTL in first person which is quite accurate but instead of constant BOTS/NPC for each class you can have friends or strangers joining your crew or you can join theirs and jump into a class. If you want to go solo add bots in and have fun!I love the idea of a team work insertellar  space openworld games where if you have a broken team you won't go far and if you have one member not doing their job it will affect others as-well as a good team will go far.  PROS: Classes have their roles which can be replaced by bots Open world so you can go anywhere you wanteasy to learn controls on each roleexplore planets, space stations and shipsgun fightsgreat for star trek fans as-well as starship trooper fans and other space films and tv programs.customise your characterkick option to kick out bad behaviour crew members (Captain only)upgradeable ship upgradeable crew/classes.Save optionsdeath = game over and retry from start or reload from last save.Cons: Connections depends on host but sometimes hosts are losing their own connection somehow (minor)            Some bugs/glithces are there but not ruining the game so easily to ignore.            Customise menu could be cleaner to see your character            Everyone running speed is too fast and causes players to be nauctious  (spelt wrong i think) Over all on the game current state on 23/09/15  this is an awesome game and i have not doubted getting it even when I was not too sure.  Almost got eaten by a blackhole and a monster in the sand so 8/10 until some fixes are done which is due to early stages of the game. Well done devs, keep it up I will be looking forward to update this review on launch.			"

								Wow. Man, where do I even start?So I had recently built myself a new rig, skipped a good 3 generations from Windows XP right to a Windows 10 gaming beast. This is the first game I bought and tried with it, and what a game to start with. I'm always very wary of Early Access titles because many end up not being updated after mere months, abandoned... and many many more end up being scams. This has just been awesome to play! If you're looking for Star Trek Simulator to play with friends (max 5 players), you have found it. There's planets both interesting and sometimes even dangerous, ships that could be friend or foe but often you only have split seconds to act, and the mechanics of the roles you play on the ship are complex enough to give you purpose, but simple enough to learn with a run-through of the in-game manual for that role. I have to say that the manual is definitely your friend and makes it much easier to understand what you have to do.I'm still having fun with this game, and the geek-out moments you'll have firing up the warp drive, getting a course laid-in, and getting in to ship battles that require tight coordination by in-game voice are excellent. I definitely recommend this, and if you're looking for an inexperienced but trained engineer, contact me! (I can fill in other roles as needed, but I shine the best in Engineering I think. A good close second would be Science.)			"

								- This review was written as of Beta 2, during Early Access -PULSAR: Lost Colony is a game similar to Artemis or Quintet, where you and your friends take command of a single starship and do battle with enemies. However, instead of flying around a single sector, there's an entire galaxy out there to explore with factions, hostile aliens, and several missions to give you and your buddies some direction. Choose between one of five ships, and if you don't happen to like one, go ahead and board a ship of another type and take it for yourself! Upgrade your ship from parts of destroyed vessels or go on an away mission to a planet and look for salvage. There's something out there though, as my buddies and I explored we noticed some kind of infection sweeping over the galaxy and taking over as the literal chaos level increased. We haven't actually encountered it yet, but I read about alien monstrosities burrowing through the hull and attacking us from within.It's Early Access Beta, and while the majority of the content isn't in the game yet, most of the core of the game is complete. Visit and walk around on space stations! Board enemy ships and capture them! Go planetside and search for relics, aliens, and clues to the titular Lost Colony! Go up in flames as your ship burns! Load the Nukes and pay them back with your dying breath! Boldly go wherever the hell you want with your only guide being how many credits you have left to gas up your tank, and your four buddies who might want to see what's JUST around the next bend - to blast it, analyze it, or turn it's leftover clink into some drink at the bar.Early Access, yeah, I'm familiar with it. But I don't regret a thing this time, and I don't think you will either. This is the first best chance for a cooperative starship simulator in... ever. Throw some money at it, fund development, and get you some. And hey, if you don't see any potential in it after you've had a look - steam refunds exist, so I say grab your friends and give it a shot.RECOMMENDED.			"

								I have never raved so hard about a title before, especially a Early Access Game. I felt like I was either Jim Kirk or Jean Luc Picard, playing as Captain in this game. I cannot recommend this one enough. After I got dissappointed with No Man's Sky and bought this game... My nerd gasm meter peaked so much that I nutted like 20 times in One Minute.If you love Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica, you gotta get this game. Best $25 I ever spent on any Early Access title. What even gets more more excited is what may be added to the game. This is seriously my new favorite game that I will spill so many hours into and will tell all of my friends about. I will even buy it for them!Why are you still reading this along with other reviews? BUY IT NOW before I summon my Klingon Warrior cousin and disembowel you in half! (I know, that was lame. Sue me.)			"

								Very good next step to anyone who loved star trek and wanted artemis to have a multiplayer lobby. I do not regret this purchase***Pros***- Multiplayer client that makes matchmaking easy- Integrated voice/PTT works really well!- FPS version of space combat is awesome. Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous could take notes from you on raw game mechanic.***Cons***- Steep learning curve (admittedly if you read the manual, it does a great job of explaining)- Not for everyone (except ST fans, any sci fi fan really)- Graphics could be better but the game mechanics make up for itOverall, I think this is a jewel that has a lot of potential and is still great for being in Beta. The devs seem quite passionate and engaged and I cannot wait to see what they bring out next! Plenty of growing room on this engine I think. I REALLY hope it is mod friendly though. It is worth the cost and a steal on sale.			"

								Great experience. A little overwhelming in first place, but once you manage to overlook keys and how-to use things, it's pure fun...especially in coop mode.First you choose a ship out of a bunch offered. Then (singleplayer) you take commanders place, order your (bot) crew and fly out into space where no man has ever gone before.... BTW, try not to shoot on your own faction's facilities...it'll help. ^^Range of duties are clearly seperated, but you also could use basics of your other crew members. Key officer is commander, who chooses route, missions and salary for your crew. Simple rescue and return missions might take a while, till you manage to coordiante all jobs. So far I encountered after 5 hours, there are plenty of upgrades for the ship...besides every crew member could upgrade skills. I even only scratched all posibilities and looking forward to dive deep into.			"

								We’ve all played games where we control a starship – smaller ships that could be manned by as small as a 1 man crew or some that needed thousands of hands. But in any case, we’ve always controlled that craft with simple mouse clicks, controls and joysticks. Well this is a breath of fresh air: this is what it would really be like to control a ship with a crew of five, each officer responsible for his station and ensuring mission success and survival. Does this new approach herald a great game, or does it fall short?Check out my very in-depth review here:http://bandofothersgaming.com/pc-gaming/preview-pulsar-lost-colony/2016/04 "

								I'm skeptical about this game. It's in early access, which never really fills me with hope. However, from what I've seen so far, it shows a great deal of promise (which could be said for other games, really) and the developers are working tirelessly with the playerbase to stabilise and improve the game.The game itself is an interesting concept. 5 players, each with their own role, working together in order to complete missions. Already it sounds like a number of games, but the way that Pulsar does this is not quite what you'd expect (unless you happen to expect something along the lines of guns of spacearus). Bots are available, but I'm writing this review with a Co-op impression in mind. These 5 players are given a Spaceship and a role aboard it. Then, they're left to their own devices. The Galaxy is open to them from T minus 0, and there's quite a wealth of things to do. I recommend finding out firsthand. The game doesn't ease the player in very much. They are briefed on their role, but I learned quickly when I had someone talk me over the ship in a couple of minutes. Of course, there is some reading material that you could make use of.The game doesn't hold your hand. The further out you go, the harder things are going to get. Work with your team and you can overcome all. Surely, this game has a thing for improving communication and building cohesion, However, I recommend a clear medium of communication, such as a Vent, person-person proximity, Teamspeak, and so on. As far as I am aware, there is no in-game VoIP. The options aren't great, and you may have an issue running the game. It's on Unity, I think.I wish I could rate things out of 10 easily, but I don't really think that way. I think you could describe the entire game, so far, as Guns of Spacearus Online, the PVE sandpaign.			"

Early Access Review
Update for Beta 1.5For original review, see below.Half a year since I first played the game, I can say I'm largely disappointed. There have been 5 updates, of which 2 were advertised as 'major'. None of them addressed the issues that have been pointed by the community. The idea is still there, and there certainly have been improvements- however the game still fails to provide enough value for its' cost.A good indicator of how PULSAR fails to keep people interested, even those that were initially excited about it, is the average playtime of the reviewers. Its' bad retention rate can also be assumed from the very low number of average and peak concurrent players (http://steamcharts.com/app/252870#All)I'll certainly keep an eye on it, and hope it will sometime fulfill its' potential, but at its' current state, price and rate of improvement, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.Beta 1.2 previewPulsar: Lost Colony is a very unique game. It draws heavy inspiration from genre-defining classics such as Star Trek and Firefly, and tries to provide a similar gaming experience, better than any game has so far managed to do. Its' mechanics might seem overly complex or even chaotic at first (and the lack of a tutorial doesn't help), but it doesn't take that long before getting used to how everything works.  GameplayA large portion of the gameplay consists of operating your ship through the use of monitors, flips and switches, controlling functions such as energy flow, offensive/defensive software, core temperature etc. Even though the UI can look archaic and out-of-place for an intergalactic spaceship, these monitors succeed in creating immersive and sometimes even frantic gameplay that rewards fast decision-making and combat awareness. Another imporant aspect of Pulsar's gameplay is the ability to leave your spaceship, either to board enemy ships (for a manlier offensive approach) or to explore planets and outposts. Even though the concept is there, the excitement you get from visiting planets is doomed to be on a progressive decline immediately after the first few expeditions, since the ecosystems and architectures available are extremely limited at this point, and most planets' explorable zones are far too small and generic to be jaw-dropping. One can assume, though, that this is an issue that's going to be adressed sooner or later, as more content is being added, resulting in more randomly generated variations and hopefully more non-random, unique planets and outposts. Boarding enemy ships is also quite enjoyable, and allows you to steal initially unavailable spaceships.Other parts of the experience Pulsar has to offer include piloting, manning turrets, trading parts to upgrade your ship, using public restrooms, turning interior lights on and off (for a superb rave party experience), isolating yourself in the captain's cabin as well as a currently lackluster quest system.ClassesRole assignment is handled through five classes, each with its' own perks (available through leveling-up). The Captain controls the flow of the game and commands the crew, the Pilot steers the ship, the Engineer is responsible for the energy management, the Scientist ..uses software and the Weapons guy mans the turrets. Roles are fluid and can dynamically change during engagements, thus requiring effective communication between crew members, as is always the case with these kind of games. Even though the classes themselves are on spot, each one's gameplay isn't as deep or rewarding as the other's (with the Pilot and especially the Scientist suffering the most, as they have limited impact and almost no unique presence in the game). Class talents are also in certain need of rework, as some are completely must-have whereas others fall into the meh/useless category, resulting in practically no choice over which talents to level and when. Their number is also limited- class talents can be maxed out after just a couple of hours.TechnicalGraphics are definitely not state-of-the-art. They certainly don't fail to convey the eeriness of space, but there's room for improvement, especially on characters and animations. Sound is decent. The soundtrack could be more ambient and trippy- I feel the current background music is rather blant but I guess that's personal taste. The sound effects are especially well-made and convincing, and there's at least one for every major event (warping, taking hull damage, being set on fire, being shot in the face by a space-robot-bandit etc.)Performance was flawless on a system just below the recommended specs, and I was even able to run it decently on a dated laptop just above the minimum specs.Bugs do occur once in a while, and they can sometimes force you to quit and reload, but that's rather rare (2 forced reloads in 14 hours).TL;DR+Great potential+Fun, unique concept+Well implemented mechanics+Obviously made with love and passion-Graphics aren't really great-Limited content-Classes and talents need work-Game wouldn't let us warp away and leave our bossy captain behind in a desolate desert planetOverall, the game is already super fun to play with friends, especially if you're into sci-fi. If you don't mind the occasional bugs (of which there really aren't thaaat many), the slight class balance issues, the limited content, the rather high price, and can look past the non-realistic graphics, I recommend buying this game. Otherwise, you may want to wait a bit for some polishing to get done and some extra content to be added.			"

Leafy Games have always been active on the froums taking suggestions from the testers and acting according to any bugs that may crop up which are very few and far between. I would recomend this game for any who want to support an up and comming indie dev studio. Very enjoyable on multiplayer with a deep and rich back story you can experiance with your friends or alone. Leafy games keep up the good work and remember to impliment my idea about the plant specimens :-)			"

								THIS GAME IS AWESOME!I have had to force myself to quit playing the game after several hours of playing it straight through. The graphics aren't the best but the gameplay is so very enjoyable. You always wanted to play Captain, maybe you always wanted to be the engineer.  This game is for you. Each position plays a role during each mission or combat that is critical for the crews survival. I can't wait to see what more they add to the game to make each role more challenging and more content and rewards even greater! This game is well worth the money I paid for it. (I did get it on sale but honestly having played it I would have paid full price I enjoyed it that much. Don't believe, I would happily live broadcast the game for you to show you! it's that much fun!I have a Pirate Game where we board ships and claim them, then salavge what we can, don't care what faction!

								I've had this for a while, but it took quite some time before it got into a state that I would call worth to play. Now however, this is definitely something you should pick up if running your own starship sounds intriguing to you. Get some friends together and explore, trade and fight.The new mission system is great, it gives you cool objectives like finding out why a ship stopped responding, only to find them dead in space and infested with... something... :)Movement is stiff, the gunplay is very basic - but there's enough dials, switches and screens to play with to make this fun top play nonetheless. You can play this alone with bots, or use AI to supplement your human crewmates. Hopping into a multiplayer game is super easy, even hosting a game behind NAT works without any manual configuration. Voicechat is built in, which is a giant plus. There's definitely a lot of polish still needed, but the last patches have added a lot of that, as well as major new features. It's not finished, but definitely worth the price of admission. Get it on Humblebundle so you get a DRM free copy as well as a Steam key.			"

								The Greatest game I have ever played. I wanted a space sim to replace No Mans Sky. Found this. Was 5 times better. up to five player multiplayer, land on planets, find things to upgrade and use for sciences, then find cargo, sell it and upgrade your ship. Be a space pirate, or a explorer. Find loads of new planets, each different. And find the lost colony. The best game ive ever played. Plus you get to fly the ship. Any role can do whatever they want on the ship. HAVE FUN I have met so many friends on this!			"

								I am so glad that I used my No Mans Sky refund money for this early access masterpiece. I have had several of my most exciting and fun multiplayer experiences of all time in this game. While the game may seem a bit complex at first, it ends up being quite simple if you have a good crew to play it with. I can only imagine how much fun this game would be with a group of 5 close friends, but ive only played with random players. It is difficult to describe the kinds of bonds you will feel with your crewmates, even if they are just random players. Everyone has a distinct role, and during battle, some amazing cooperation and teamwork can occur. I look forward to the intensity that this game will have when the developers add 5v5 PVP elements.10/10 ""I'm gonna ram that civilian ship."" "

								Quite a price to pay for the full experience with friends. However, if you are able to get a full group (5 people) of friends it creates a great experience. I've played a few bridge simulators and there are none better than this. There are 5 different roles and you cannot only travel around a 3D huge scaled ship, you can board other AI ships to take them over, land on planets and loot, and shop in local shops. Team work is required!I would not recommend this title if you are playing solo since it is hard to find other teams to play with (especially if you do not have a mic!). The AI for your crew is not that great (but better than no one) and would again, would not recommend playing solo especially for a single player experience. Playing with random crew members can be hit and miss, especially since there are quite a number of players that feel the need to just wreak havoc to your ship just for fun.Otherwise, if you can get a group, I highly recommend this title. Perhaps $25 is not the best price though. If this game was $10-$15 it would be perfect.			"

								OK, so I've had this game for a bit now, and have some time in it. Holy Crap is it fun! A little bit sim, a little bit FPS, a little bit strategy, it has it all. nd it is *WAY* better with live people rather than the bots you can do single player with, The process of raiding areas, doing missions, upgrading your ship... all accounts for quite the gameplay. Nothing beats sending the bots out to be the 'red shirts'! LOL And if it gets a little bit easy after a few upgraes, well there are ways to fix that. Just hit up on of the '!' sectors... you'll see if your gear is good enough. And boaring better ships to claim them? Hell yeah!! I'm thinking it's a mix of Star Trek, Star Wars, Galaxy Quest, Firefly and Space 1999. A couple of drinks, some good friends and a few hours to kill... you can't do much better,			"

								If I had the money, I'd give the devs a couple million dollars to turn this into a AAA multiplayer coop game. The concept is spot on.Pros: - Real Star Trek like experience in multiplayer. It's amazing. It really is. If you don't believe it watch a Let's Play on youtube. - Incredible immersion. You are on your post. In a battle you have your job to do. You need to trust your captain to maintain a grip on the overall situation, because you sure can't, as you have to keep the reactor from exploding etc. - Runs smoothly at 2K on my gaming rig.Cons:The nice way to say it is: It needs polish. Looks like a game of the very early 2000s.Even though it looks like it is from the past, it runs terribly on integrated graphics. Couldn't get any playable performance on my Broadwell laptop with Intel GPU even with every setting at the minimum and resolution at 1024x768.Little actual content in the way of missions or anything else at this point, but the devs are on it.It's less fun if you play with AI bots instead of a real crew of people.Verdict: If you have a couple of friends and you love Star Trek-like SciFi, go for it.Suggestions for the devs:The shop could directly compare what's available to what's installed in your ship. Alternatively, give the engineer a nice one page overview of the ship components.A ""stop all thrusters"" button would be nice for the pilot, so would be piloting via gamepad.I would welcome more realistic physics for piloting: The ship doesn't decelerate on its own, keeps spinning unless you stop it with thrusters. To compensate for the complexity, you could add ""stabilize"" which automatically stops any rotation. The uptick of all this would be pretty cool space maneuvering a la battlestar galactica. "

""I can't doooet captayn, I dun't have the power""Scientist: Can infect enemy ships with viruses, put up antivirus for our ship, bring up comms with other ships, scan the area for ships, and use a scanner, on a planet, to scan for lifeforms, which was very useful when were all were attacked by ♥♥♥♥ing giant ants....Weapons: Can use main gun turret, manages power to each, fires missiles, and can use the nuclear device only when told so.Pilot: If you need to be told what the pilot does, you shouldn't be a pilot.Every experience makes it different, and that's the funnest thing about it, imagine a really pretty first person advanced version of FTL. Except real time, and you got real people telling you what the guck to do. "

								While this game does not look as impressive as other games of these days, including the fact that this game is in early access, it's still lots of fun. Players who have played FTL: Faster Than Light will see lots of similarities between the games. Even the damage system is similar.The game has a wide galaxy to explore and tons of room for roleplay. Sadly, the planets don't have much variety yet, but the sectors/systems are lots of fun to explore. Some have black holes, some have empty ships, some have large cruisers as big as your ship and some have drones. Every ship is well done and suits different playstyles, such as stealth and kill on sight piracy. The UI is not beautiful but easy to navigate.So far, I am quite happy with the community.  On some occasions though, trolls might join the game, disable your ship and leave instantly, which is quite an inconvenience.This game does not have a tutorial yet, only a large manual and a noticeable learning curve.

								Hey,So it's PULSAR now.This game according to me, Is one of the funnest space sims I've actually every played.It gives you that oppertunity to RP in real life, while your crew is operating the ship in the same server or you could RP with random people you find online.I have never gotten bored during my time into this game. It's keeps you and your crew occupied, there's lots of planets to explore, lot's of things to kill, Lot's of oppertunity for fun.One thing I have hated and always will is the borthix crystals mission in-game :3Basically, what this mission is.In the galaxy, you'll have to find a specific type of planet and search it to find these crystals. but the planets are all randomized right, so even if you save it randomizes the planets. so this will indeed♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and take alot of time.with that being said, go for it.

								I do recommend this game, just not yet. This game is a wonderful concept, and quite frankly is the game I have been searching for on steam recently, and open-world, first person space sim-them up. And for an early access game, it has some great core mechanics in place and runs very smoothly on my R9 270. But it is just that, an early access game, and it doesn't quite have enough to warrant that £18.99 price tag. I don't particularly like the art style (personal preference) and would like to see it take a turn to the more realistic side. My point is this:- It is an early access game, if you like to bug report and are really hyped for this game, then buy it.- If you want to jump into a space sim game in the deep end with no tutorial (at the moment), then buy it.- If none of the above apply to you, than wait. This will be an amazing game judging by what I have seen on steam and on the website. What they have planned for this is great. But at the moment, it doesn't have enough of the core mechanics in place. At least not for me. So what I'm doing and I recommend, is waiting until it is at a later build, or when it is fully released and buying it as a full game. It has great potential. Just lakes a few essentials for me at the moment.(I know I didn't play much but it was enough for me)I don't know how many people are working on and developing this. But keep going. You have a great concept and for and early access, a great game.			"

The community is amazing. They're friendly, welcoming, and accepting, and the developers, unlike many early access developers, keep in close touch to the community. This is one of, if not the best, space sims ever.The game has a bit of a steep learning curve, but with the helpful community, new players can learn quickly. On your first play through, you'll find yourself putting several hours in without even noticing. This is one of those games that you can just sit, and play without stop.I really think that this is a worthwhile game to buy, even in its present form.- Happy Voyaging! "

								As with most co-op games, its better with friends you know.  Content is still fairly light and unpolished, but the gameplay is solid.  Ship combat is hectic and requires reliable teamwork.  Upgrading your ship bit by bit is also very rewarding.  Every class is essential and interesting, though it is also all about what your gameplay preference is.  Personally I enjoy engineer and science officer the least, but I have had friends who enjoy them the most.Also, the addition of the infected (swarm that starts taking over the galaxy) adds an interesting time limit to each game, though I kinda wish it was optional.Overall, if you are looking for a new experience for you and 3-4 friends, this would be a good pick.  If they keep adding content at a decent pace, it can easily become a must-buy.			"

								I've played this game since it was a wee lad, about 2 months shy of nothing at all. Even then I was completely mesmerized. I'll state right off that I may be bias as this was the only game me and my brother could play together for several weeks running and I would certianly recommend playing w/ a friend(s) or expect to play online. Thats not to say there isnt an acceptable bot system in the game allowing you to play offline, but it just doesnt quite cut it honestly. This game isnt A+ but it is one of my favorite games. The scope of the gameplay is pretty amazing and with it's replayability factor, your gametime is only limited by your imagination. If you want some polished beautifully designed UI with top of the line graphics this may not be your thing but if you've ever watched Star Trek and wished you could somehow partake, this is about as close as it gets. Imagine, you can get your own star ship to roam around the somewhat depressingly doomed galaxy with a crew of your buddies. Take on your foes in adrenalizing firefights, cannons blasting away at your enemy's shield and hull as your reactor begins to heat up, all the while your men blaze away against an enemy boarding action in the lower decks. At the same time the enemy captain opens up comms and demands your immediate surrender. Just before he and his ship blow into a thousand pieces and you get to loot the remains and sell it for personal profit..			"

								Just a heads up, this game is not really a solo play game yet.  AI isn't all that great, and players will infuriate you.  That being said, its one of my current favorite games, and I want everyone to understand that in its current state, you need to play with others.To get the very best experience, I recommend you finding a friend that knows what they are doing and have them teach you  a role, or look for a friendly player when you join.  After you get the basics down, to get the very most out of this game, get a headset and join a game where everyone has a headset.  Communication is big in this game, and being a typer will hurt you in combat.Some big tips to the new players, when you join for some reason the UI doesn't show and voice chat isn't enabled.  You have to go to game settings (there are two options in the menu, edit game settings and game settings.  Go to just 'game settings') and enable both.  Go to the controls tab in options and set your push to talk key, which is on the third page on the left hand side.  It is defaulted to mouse 3 and T I believe to start, but if you are like me caps lock or pretty much anything is better than mouse 3. VR users, I've heard poor reviews about VR, and if you are looking for a good VR experience, I recommend looking elsewhere.  I could be wrong, I havn't tried it.  I want everyone to support the game, but a lot of negative reviews on this game is about the VR and lack of singleplayer due to poor ai. Here is a quick breakdown of the game:Graphics are mediocre at best. Sound is mediocre.Gameplay is amazing.Tutorial is poor.Combat is smashingContent is low for how many systems are in the gameRight now for a Beta or alpha, I'm going to give this game a thumbs up since it hits a unique take on working with a team.  I hope the devs reach the mark they are aiming for with this game, because if they do I think it will be a game that will be a shining example of space combat for big titles to have to follow.			"

								One of the funnest space games i have played.  When you get a descent group it's pretty amazing.  Engineer managing power, warp, and coolant.  Pilot aligning to warp point, or manuevering around in combat.  Scientist doing science things(uploading viruses, scanning the system or a particular ship).  Weapon specialist manning the guns, firing on enemy ships or shooting down missiles.  Captain barking orders, negotiating or intimidating the enemy, upgrading ship, setting crew member allowance for small arms, and setting the course for your adventure.  All of this while maintaining life support systems, your engine, weapon systems, while they take fire from enemy ships or catch on fire from being damaged.  You can also play with AI to kinda learn the controls and general layout of a ship, but it's not the same.That being said, there are a lot of reviews saying everyone is helpfull, and works together.  There are some, but with online games you will find trolls.  Usually they do their mischeif before you really embark on an adventure, so it really doesn't ruin a 4 hour run or anything - and hey, for a little bit - that is fun too.Totally worth the $24 for it - but if its on sale, snag this puppy.  I mean come on, who hasn't wanted to be scotty yellin, ""i'm givin her all i got captain,"" while Kirk looks dramatically past the camera, while spock is telling him the unfortunate odds.			"

								With each new space game (3D, exploration-based, simulation game) improvement seems incremental, and Pulsar Lost Colony looks to be one of those increments, although it is a little early in it's life.  I have high hopes for this give what is already here.			"

								I have to say having backed this game during its Kickstarter and having played very little of it, I have spent a long part of this weekend playing with a group of friends. My first impression was poor, and I really didn't think I would play it ever again.   However, this weekend has shown me how much fun it is, the graphics are simple and plain, the gameplay is fun, whether your crew is taking out enemy ships, or boarding the enemy vessel to take out the crew, or on a ground mission, the game is fun. Still feels a little empty in places, with planets seeming to have 1 or 2 buildings for the mission you're on, limited interactions, but it doesn't dent the fun factor.  Content can always be added, the difficulty is tough, but it is addictive.. Must have for groups of friends, its just good plain old fun, complex in places and satisfying once you crack it. I am very happy to report my initial impression was horrificly wrong, and I now will be a huge promoter of this game. I know we added 5 more players this weekend, and MORE will come.. I am so glad I backed this during Kickstarter.. "

								I highly recommend Pulsar, It has provided hours of fun and has somewhat become a bonding experience for the crew I fly with. We stream our adventures for Patch Gaming. The best explanation of Pulsar is through the videos linked below, they show how the game work and how much fun can be had playing it. They also show some of the things wrong with it. Make sure to read the most recent Patch Notes from Leafy Games, Beta 7 added so much content. The price may be high, but it is very much worth it.Here is a playlist of edited videos of our adventures.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRty_83nuBtqKbYzX8DtOI_o54o8nC6bkHere is a playlist of unedited videos of our adventures.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRty_83nuBtoI-pJTuFXhYqaEzk5WYOF8 "

You can always fill empty positions with bots, that are ok-ish at this point. Will update review in a couple of month...			"

Pulsar: Lost Colony is one of the best cooperative games I have ever playedThe graphics aren't that good, but noone really cares, because this game is awesome!The atmosphere and style is great, and the sound design is very nice.Everyone is dependant one one another. If one fails, everyone fails. And it's nice, because you can't be really good at this game, and just run the show all by yourself - you need other people.The gameplay is simple, but engaging - you manage your screens/tools, and follow the captain's orders.There are some simple shooting mechanics, and you can talk with all the npc's, and some of them have something genuinely interesting to say.With the constant updates, and attention to detail, the developers show, that this game is something they really want.It's nice to see that for once, and that they don't just take your money and run. (*cough* 'Ark: Survival Evolved' *cough*)The end game is where this game doesn't really shine that bright, given it is in early access. But that will eventually be solved.Overall, this game is great, but i suggest you buy it with at least 3 of your friends - it's going to be a lot more fun.Final Verdict: 8 / 10A great overall experience, that needs some polish and more content "

								Overall a great game in active development, especially if you wanted to command or operate your own ship with a team or friends. More fun with up to 5 real people that can run a ship, explore, blow stuff up, do away missions and more. Each person has a role, Captain, Science, Engineering, Weapons, and Pilot that requires everyone to work together to compliment each other's roles. Gain XP by exploring and doing missions/quests and advance your character. Board enemy ships (tricky with AI), and take them over for your command. It's still a work in progress but gets updates pretty regularly. AI has gotten a big improvement, quests are showing up, and the ships all feel very different and unique.Would definitely recommend this actively supported Work in Progress if you wanted to ever command or fly your own ship.

								Have you ever wanted to go on a space adventure with your friends? Does the idea of yelling over coms while you and your crew desperately try to survive entice you? Do you just want a good game to socialize in? If so, this is the game for you.You and your crew take on the galaxy in an attempt to get rich, pimp out your ship, and slaughter everything in your path. You will find yourself engaging in space battles, exploring planets, and completing missions in order to amass lots and lots of cash. Your travels will take you to many places, like desolate planets, abandoned ships, and the public toilets in a trade hub. This trek across the galaxy can be done by either friends or strangers you meet on the internet. The game is good as a social game since it requires you to actually communicate if you want any chance of getting anywhere in the game. Theres currently enough content in the game to give you a few 8-10 hour adventures. Each instance of a game generates a randomly laid out galaxy that is different from the ones you played before and the ones you will play in the future. Devs are pretty good about updating the game. Overall, definitely get. Great fun.			"

PULSAR: Lost Colony is a cooperative game in a futuristic space faring setting.  Up to five players collaborate to tackle exploration and combat objectives.  Each player assumes a role in a small starship crew: Captain, Scientist, Pilot, Engineer, or Weapons Specialist.  Working together, the crew travels across a randomized galaxy to overcome various obstacles.  Exploration missions task the crew with travelling to remote locations to retrieve items or investigate an area.  Combat includes ship-to-ship battles as well as gunfights between individual players and opposing NPCs.  Enemy ships may be boarded and seized, or destroyed for scrap.Each player has specific responsibilities.  The Scientist operates the ship's sensors, shield configuration, and opens communications with other vessels.  The Engineer manages the ship's power systems to ensure various parts of the craft are able to operate, without overheating the reactor.  The Pilot flies the craft and acts as the crew's ""eyes"" - identifying hazards or items of interest that do not appear on sensors.  The Weapons Specialist mans the ship's turrets and acts as the craft's security officer.  Finally, the Captain (the player hosting the game) is the crew's decision maker - managing missions, diplomacy over comms, and overseeing the crew's finances.Simply put, PULSAR: Lost Colony is a great game.  For a better understanding of the game (without playing it), check out this gameplay video.

								PULSAR: Lost Colony is an ealy access space exploration game (kind of like Star Trek). Overall the game is good and has great potencial but we will live and see how it will evolve.As most of the Early access games it isn't finished and i recomend you to find some friends to play with in order to really enjoy the game. The AI of the bot crew is almost inexistent and most of the time will get you killed if you don't have a look on the consoles that they man with the exception of the Weapons specialist bot that is quite good at shooting stuff.From when it was launched till now a lot of bugs where repaired and they added more ships but is still misses some textures here and there and some areas seems unfinished and unpolished but they will be added eventualy.As of now i recomend the game and support the devs cause till now they showed that they care about the game and eventualy it could become an really good space exploration game.

								BUY WITH WILLING FRIENDS!!What is it: FTL with Friends!This game is actually super cool! The whole idea and concept is honest just a dream game if you want to be running LANs or just want a good game for you and the buds!The basic idea is this, You and your friends are in charge of running a spaceship, so you'll need a pilot, a weapon specialist, a scientist, an engineer and of course, a captain. then you just go exploring the depths of space! completing missions and the like!PROS:Decent multiplayer! didn't have much trouble connecting, making a server, and the server lag wasn't ever a problem.Gameplay seems solid! the controls and weapons all seem to function well! the weapons aren't too exciting yet though.Pilot and run your own spaceship with your friends! This all works awesome! the piloting controls, and the whole UI is great if you are changing things in the menus and various panels found throughout your craft.Jobs are actually fun! the jobs are surprising all filled with interesting things to do at almost every moment of gameplay, no real down time or dull moments for anyone! though admittedly, Pilot and Engineer have the most to do, and the most responsibility.Go to planets! You can actually go to a variety of planets and fight monsters, aliens, robots or the general populace for the loot found about the place!You can level up and upgrade your character! You can actually pick from a decent selection of perks that improve your job efficiency, and get a variety of armours and weapons along the way!CONS:Shooting isn't so great yet: With the exception of spaceship shooting, the FPS gameplay is weak, but functional. with work, this will be much better in time I imagine!Planets can be dull: Some planets can be strange, or seem very.... glitchy. This part definitely feels the most unpolished, but I'm confident it will improve with time.Navigation can be awkward: Too often we got a mission at a such-n-such location, and we had no clue how to get there. I think some work needs to be done in this area.Progression is Minimal: The character progression is fine, but the ship progression seems non-existent. to my knowledge, you cannot upgrade your ship to another ship, merely attach upgrades to certain parts of the ship. This is all well and good, but once you start making coin, it would be cool to be able to buy a new spacecraft to use in game. THINGS THEY SHOULD INCLUDE IN THIS (AWESOME) GAME-Campaign Mode: A full story to experience with your friends spanning a good 6 hours or so! with firefights, exploration, science stuff, and diplomacy! I would love that kind of experience, making the tough decisions as captain, putting controversial decisions to a vote for your crew, or possibly facing Reaper-ish foes! It would be fantastic!-Custom-Made Missions: This would fit into the campaign side of things, but A mission builder type of system would be awesome! You could make entire missions or campaigns to then play with friends or share online, with the option of including voiced dialogue and tree-style story elements!-Launchable Starfighters: It would be awesome if in the event of a large battle, a launchable craft could be made available to aid the mothership in violent incursions! This could also open the door to additional exploration options!In closing, this game is freaking great! It is missing a little shine and polish, but is very reminiscent of the ""Mount and Blade"" series, which is definitely a good thing! just add a bit more scope, and some more cool doo-dads here and there, we have a true classic!

								Really fun game with friends. Note: Key Words WITH FRIENDS. The game isn't very polished but it has a lot of charm. The planets are not very large but are pretty diverse in their settings. Which is something I really appreciated.Space combat can either be very dragged out or very quick depending on the two ships. It's not that fun as there's not much skill required. It's just pretty much who has the better weapons/hull/shield. The programs can save you in times of dire need but I haven't had much success in using the offensive programs.Great game with friends. Had a ton of fun after learning who to trade salvaged cargo and got decent enough weapons to kill bandits with. Definitely needs polish though. And I'll say it, the game has a lot of potential. (Early access cliche but I feel this game could actually be great. Dev is very responsive and helpful)P.S. I only have 0.1 hours on record because I had to directly launch from .exe due to a problem with my undedicated nvidia gpu.			"

								PULSAR: Lost Colony is a great game, even with only 1/10 of the intended content included so far. For all its roughness (being an early-access game) I have had a ton of fun with it so far and it is well worth the money even in its current state. The game feels very grand--moving from space station to ship to planet gives the impression that the universe is a huge place with many things to see and explore. I haven't tried all the crew positions yet; can confirm that Captain and Pilot are both very fun.If you have at least one friend, buy this game. You won't be disappointed, and it'll only get better from here.			"

								Played this game a lots with friends, and some without. Did many game with all ship and did all research possible and mission. And my opinion on the thing is kinda mixed up, more on the positive side tho. So from what i've experienced, i could say that sometime you find a game with people that want to play the game seriously, maybe sometime too much, but i think that fine. I play most simulation game in a serious manner, to immerse me in the experience. Really, if you can get some friends (at least one, but i suggest two) you can do a lots in this game. The AI on your ship is really bad, but its getting better with the modification to the crew panel priority. If you play with a friend, get it to be gunner and as captain you can pilot easily. The enemy AI is a little over reactive, but unless you just board everything, you shouldn't notice it that much. After a while, when you know about the game, you can easily upgrade your ship with the best main turret, without needing to have a strong ship, etc, so i find that having more cargo space is more valuable than having firepower at start. The game is definitivly not for everyone, but for the public its targeting, well its great.The Dev keep upgrading the game from time to time, its not really fast, but at least they do it. What i would like to see in this game:- Scientist hacking mini-game, because right now it pretty non-interactive. Click, its send the virus, now wait. Scientist has nothing more to do most of the time.- Engineer salvage mini-game as well, why not. I mean, its fine to have an arbitrary % of getting something, but i feel like giving the chance to the player to do something for the salvage would be cool, with scaling difficulty for end-tier system.- I don't have anymore idea for right now.

								This game gets better and better every time I play it.  It can be a challenging game right from the get go.  Often my ship only lasts about a half-hour, but this last time I've gone on several missions of increasing difficulty without any hiccups/explosions.  The AI is still farily derpy, and I would love to see my friendly bots follow me to surfaces (with or without EVA suits).  But overall it's a great game that offers each class some interesting unique mechanics.  It'll be interesting to see where this game goes with it all and I look forward to lots more gameplay.			"

								Great space team simulator with some awkward game systems, but absolutely still full of wonder.

If you're looking for a game where everyone has individual roles and strange adventures a la Star Trek, this is your game. Space Battles are hectic and thrilling, and planet exploring is tense.

								So, Pulsar Lost Colony... What I have found is that the game usually goes in this order.You start a new game and become captain of your new ship, oh how amazing this ship is, some of your friends start joining and begin polluting your soundwaves with the sounds of their fire extingushers and the sound of the blasters as they start drawing profound images all over your ship. Next comes the unknown online players (if you have the game set to private) who, if your lucky, will not instantly try to sabotage your ship and then eject your core.Once your crew is settled in and you spend the next 20 minutes gathering the missions from the station and purchasing the upgrades you want from the store you warp to the next sector to begin actually playing the game. However once you arrive you find an enemy ship and then it proceeds to one shot you, destroying your ship instantly...Then you restart the game and it all repeats :D10/10 would repeat the cycle again			"

								I spent the first hour running amok in the starting ship. Every screen displays real updates about your ship. Every control panel functions. There is a six-step process to rebooting your ship which involves monster circuit breakers and touch screens nestled behind the warp core.On my second multiplayer stint, we contacted a smuggler in the back alley of a space station, escaped the clutches of corporate drone gunships and jetpacked through a vast ancient planetary ruin so cold our EVA suit glass frosted over. This is apparently just one mission in a randomized, constantly-evolving galaxy.The only successful missions I have flown required teamwork. Pilot has to orient the ship so that the weapons officer can see the enemy. Engineer has to juggle power between the engines, weapons, and the power-hungry jump drive. Captain has to order the crew to stop firing phase pistols at viewscreens during critical operations.Bottom line: this game is packed with detail, takes place in a changing universe, and requires multiplayer cooperation. If your dream is for you and your friends to take a starship and explore the dangers of deep space, this is your game. If that is not your dream, you are lying.			"

								SOLID  8.5/10 To me these devs have focused more effort into good gameplay and man it shows! The exciting part is that this game can and will become much more detailed and in depth. The ships are cool and interaction is great with a good team.  Every character roll has a great amount of depth for an Early access game.  The game could use many improvements but for the stage this game is in I will live and so will you.Knowing the game will improve I want to say to the Devs a few things.Make the game more lively , example : around repair depots add NPC ships going about chores and maybe another station where people live.Aboard station add more NPCs moving around. Id love to see more civilians both in space and on stations to make the game less devoid of life. Please add more ships , maybe make ships customizable and allow players to really tweak the ship from furniture to colors to interior textures etc really allow for independent ships! 100% change the way characters and NPCS look its kind of unsettlingly ugly but the gameplay pushes that aside for now.

Little did I know (when I got my new computer) It was amazing! It combined all my favorite movies (Star Trek, Star Wars) and FTL and made it into a super game! This game isn't just fun, it's breathtaking! You should defiently get it!			"

								I like. This is the co op no mans sky should live up to. Admitedly early access so a lot of the game you feel should be there isn't but theres still a lot you can do and learn. Good for roleplay and stuff as it's very much a co op game. Difficult with only 2 people but 3 is a good amount, any more and it's difficult to handle but with friends that can behave themselves very very fun. I got it in a sale because I'm poor and I would recommend getting it on sale because it's early access but personally I would've paid full price for it if I had the money.Travel space because space is fun. Help people out or screw them over why not. "

								I spent the first hour running amok in the starting ship. Every screen displays real updates about your ship. Every control panel functions. There is a six-step process to rebooting your ship which involves monster circuit breakers and touch screens nestled behind the warp core.On my second multiplayer stint, we contacted a smuggler in the back alley of a space station, escaped the clutches of corporate drone gunships and jetpacked through a vast ancient planetary ruin so cold our EVA suit glass frosted over. This is apparently just one mission in a randomized, constantly-evolving galaxy.The only successful missions I have flown required teamwork. Pilot has to orient the ship so that the weapons officer can see the enemy. Engineer has to juggle power between the engines, weapons, and the power-hungry jump drive. Captain has to order the crew to stop firing phase pistols at viewscreens during critical operations.Bottom line: this game is packed with detail, takes place in a changing universe, and requires multiplayer cooperation. If your dream is for you and your friends to take a starship and explore the dangers of deep space, this is your game. If that is not your dream, you are lying.			"

								Artemis Bridge Simualtor was a great little multiplayer bridge simulator, Pulsar takes this idea and evolves if further.Pulsar is a multi-crew ship bridge simulator & space 'endurance' survival game(no real ending, see how long you can last).The game has five roles to choose from:Command your crew and bark orders as the Captain, ram asteroids and space stations as the Pilot, make things blow up as the Weapons Tech, Scan the crap out of things and conduct cyber warfare as the Science Officer, Overload the reactor and talk like a vertically challenged scottish bloke as the Engineer.Playable with 2-5 players(can play solo but AI is DAF) explore the galaxy, send away teams to hijack repair stations for free repairs, raid alien planets over run by hostile robots, shoot other ships and or take on quests to earn extra credits from space stations.In a nutshell, the game is a simple skill point based item hunting game where currently your main object to survive is to gear up your ship and know when to run or fight.It is a simple game at its core that is fun to play with friends and well worth checking out if you like the idea of crewing a spaceship with your friends.

								A great game for fullfilling any Star Trek fantasizes you may have left in your life. The captain is the captain, the gunner does gunner things, the engineer is micromanaging, the pilot flies the ship, and the glorious science officer is the medic and Electronic warfare operator. As the best (And only) Medic my crew has ever had we did a decent job at preforming our scouting missions and destroying the pirates. Unfortunately our pilot had no close quarters skills, the captain didnt use the chair (which i often stole :3) and the red shirt (Gunner) really did die in every engagement while i spent most of my time staring at a space ipad and healing, while on the ship i usually just ran comms and argued with the engineer over our use of power on certain systems, which did nearly cause us to crash into the side of a space station because we managed to turn off all of the power to the ship during a warp. A glorious game that just needs more content but is pretty great as it is.			"

								First review ever on my account with over 300 games because this one blew me away. Basically Faster Than Light redesigned as an online coop first person game. All PvE. You can even board other ships with your crew and steal them and extract some of the gear from your old one. There are some glitches here and there but they seem far from game breaking, but they could maybe become more aparant when I learn more about the game and be captain of my own ship. For example, the computer often says a system has no planet, but we go there and it does. But the bugs seem pretty minor and not too common from having played mostly as crew members for 20 hours now.			"

								Obviously the game is still currently in beta and will bugs and other problems.Pros:- Unique interface with each role- 5 tasks that come together to stay alive (Engineer, Captain, Scientist, Weapons Specialist, Pilot)- Customization of ship (also part of the cons...)- Customizable bots (although still annoying at times)- Missions and what looks like hints towards certain things that could become a bigger storyline- Cross-platform- Planetary exploration- Ship boarding (to be improved hopefully)-Still better then no mans sky :/Cons: - Small amount of ships to choose from- Customization needs a lot of improvement and expansion- no campaign or large story- Infection screws you over time :/- Unrefined ships with questionable room placement (Ex. Carrier, scientist locker room is next to weapons room and weapons locker room is next to science lab)- 2nd day playing the game my lobby got hit by 2 trolls joining with different names for an hour removing fuel and screwing the ship (PLEASE ADD A STEAM ID SYSTEM)			"

								If you have been thinking about buying this game, I have two words for you. DO IT. This is a great cooperative multiplayer space game. You must work together in order to pilot the ship and survive. There are a number of planets and outposts to explore. The actual stars on the map are always the same, but the planets and the outposts move around with each new game. Keep in mind, it is only two guys making this awesome game. That being said, they have done a phenominal job. I very highly recommend this game.			"

								The game is fairly light on hardware, but packs a lot more underneath. At the moment, the game has a few recycled textures which allows it to run fast. The ships at the moment are limited. However with the introduction of the Roland-class, we can see a potential for larger ships and perhaps hybrid AI/Human crew. Each ship has their own unique traits or abilities which allow for different styles of play. However the end game items overshadows these abilities which results in the same endgame play. Ship systems as of Beta 1 are moderately balanced however with AI controlled turrets, the main turret becomes less of a priority to man since the AI can hit it's target most of the time when you have a good pilot.The ground combat at the moment is a good step in the right direction. Variable landscape that change how the player has to adapt. The new environmental suits allow you to travel to dangerous locations without harm and the weapons are based on a tried and true trade-off method (one shoots fast but weak, one shoots slow but fast, etc.). At the moment, the gameplay requires players to dodge gun fire or melee attacks. Requires every little tactical movement when shooting back so players can easily duck behind cover to protect themselves. Player customization is fairly fixed on implants and tattoos, but allow for colour changes. Otherwise the customization is vast on hairstyles, facial and colour options. Like to see more in the future from Leafy Games, but I would deem this a playable Early Access and recommendable to anyone who enjoyed Star Trek: Elite Force with a mix of Artemis Ship Simulator.(Psst, my YouTube Channel if anyone wants a peak of all the things that have progressed in game: https://www.youtube.com/user/nawkcire) "

								PROS: Very cool concept(would love to see more of this style of game). Good devs. Lots of potential. It is funny how easily random people who join your crew can get into their roles both in terms of mechanics and role playing. The Captain is usually treated as the Captain and so on. There is a large galaxy to explore. Upgrading your ship and crew skills adds some sense of progression.CONS: The content in the game is quite limited at the moment(though there is enough to sink your teeth into). The graphics are basic but it still has a decent aesthetic.I look forward to the eventual fleshing out of ship's systems, crew abilities, AI interactions, missions, and planetary exploration. Like I said there is a lot of potential and a lot of features that can be added.At around 17 hours I feel I have gotten my money's worth so anything extra is just icing on the cake.			"

								It's an all around great experience. While the graphics leave much to be desired compared to modern games, if you're going to judge games based on graphics then you will miss out on some series gold.This game makes players work together, otherwise you won't get very far. You can do pretty much anything, from exploring ruins and crashes, to fighting against impossible odds against enemies stronger than you. The universe to explore is much larger than what you'd expect, and with the constant updates there is no shortage of new content being added to the game.It is a great game, the only thing they need to do is add ships for smaller crews. I don't have enough friends who are interested in the game to fill a whole crew, it's mainly just me and a single friend. If they could release some ships for 2-4 man crews it would compelte the game.			"

								5 Players team up to pilot a starship to adventure. What can go wrong?This can be an extremely fun game to play if you get a good dynamic crew. Captain matters most. Thus far I have only been Pilot and Captain, but I got us into some serious adventures as Captain. Ive been under the command of other Captains that were kind of dry and not so exciting - you need a Captain willing to do some crazy sh. You will also need to really learn your roles. Captain is a decision maker and really only needs knowledge of how to pilot and man a gun. But if youre Science Officer or Engineer, you need to know what youre doing. A good Science Officer and Enginneer are crucial to getting you OUT of situations the Captain gets you in to. This game seems very deep and involved after you start learning it. Its pretty much everything No Mans Sky should have been. This game is one of the most promising and exciting EA titles Ive ever played. There are a few cons though. The graphics look like something from 2000, which is fine - but with a graphical overhaul, this game woiuld be utterly amazing. The space graphics are fine - its the the FPS environments that are old-school. The gameplay more than makles up for this though. Recommended? Absolutely.One of my first real adventures found me as a new Captain. Our Weapons Officer had a lot of experience and was somehow assigned to our ship, crewed by newbies. We encountered a very tough and very well armed friendly ship. The weapons officer spied something he wanted - that ship's cannon. Well, we cant fight this ship, because it has a cannon that can obliterate us in short order in direct combat. However, we formulated a plan to take the ship.. Two of us had to beam over after we hit it with our main cannon one time, just enough to drop its shields. The pilot had to keep us under it so it cant hit us with that dreaded cannon. We hit it hard, beamed over, and got intp a firefight with its crew. Our Engineer got to their Engineering deck single handedly while I held the remaining crewman at bay in the teleport room, and shut the ship down. The rest of our crew beamed over and helped us slay the remaining crewmen. The ship was now ours. I claimed our new pride and joy amid cheering of our ragtag crew. Then the news came from Weapons Officer Barbosa: We were now marked as Pirates.			"

								I cant say enough great things about this game.  The developers are true gamers, they seemed to add in everything you could of ever wanted to a co-op space sim. It is still early but the game shows a huge amount of promise.  Dont go in expecting next generation graphics like ARK or flawless AI, go in looking for something orginal and well thought out.  Pros: Unique play style.  Nothing really like this out thereEveryone has a job to do.It really is epic.  They have a cool piloting mode that lets you fly the ship with wasd and the mouse. You just have to experience it.Quest...check.  Huge random open world...check.   RPG elements...check.  Random encouters...check.  Ship to ship combat...check.  Board enemy ships or get boarded...check.  Beam down to planets...check.  Fly in wrecked stations for loot...check. Cons:AI helpers are ok at best.  They pilot like crap and barely do anything more than take fire when you are boarded.  The developers are working on that.Character graphics are just plain bad.  Doesn't really bother me but some people might have a problem.  It is about game play and it is in beta.You need friends.  Get on reddit or look at forums plenty of people out there who want to fly if you dont have any buds.Wood panels on the floors in spaceships.  Dont know how I feel about that.Final thoughts:Pulsar brings a lot to the table and in a very early version is more than playable for many many hours.  If the big boys like Elite, SC or STO every figured out how to implement this level of co-op into thier games we would have a tough time figuring out what to play.  This is what STO should of been and what Elite and SC could have to make them true winners. "

								This is a brilliant game, you are part of a crew of 5 on a space ship, you can play with real players or with bots. When you're playing you're not just pressing E (or in this case R) on a console and that automatically cools the core, you need to lower that power usage or turn on the coolant (or both). Are the programs out of charge? Get your butt in engineering, load that fuel cell, and pull that lever. Want to know what that enemy ship has, scan it and see its power usage, components, status, and what type of ship it is.You play as one of five roles, The Captain, The Pilot, The Weapons Specialist, The Engineer, and The Scientist.The Captain is self-explanatory, they orders the crew around, and is in charge of trading, diplomacy, that sort of stuff.The Pilot is also obvious, they pilot the ship, evade, align the ship, and give weapons a clear shot.The Weapons Specialist is usually controlling a massive super cannon, which is fires powerful lasers and missiles.The Engineer keeps the ship cool while at the same time giving everyone else enough power to work with.The Scientist will perform research, cyber warfare, scanning, and is generally the go to guy for getting to know what's going on.You explore though space, teleporting onto stations, exploring planets, and trying to find the Lost Colony.The website probably explains it better than so here Link to website[www.pulsarthegame.com]tl;dr version: Starship simulator when those buttons actually have a purpose.

								[DISCLAIMER]: Everything I say here is of MY opinion. Don't get all mad because it doesn't allign with your opinion.I have been following this game since it first came out on greenlight. This was around the time I still played Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator and what this game promised was that game, but ten billion times better. First person ship bridge simulator is exactly what I wanted and I'm happy to say, this game delivers like there is no tomorrow.The game like I said is a first person multiplayer spaceship exploration/combat simulator. I first got the game when it was in early alpha and even though it was very rough, the game still had tons of features and charm. You and perferably 4 other friends begin their journey on one of the five ships avaible (ATM) each with its own personal style of play and interior/exterior looks. One of the things I was really looking for in this kind of game was ship system interaction. By this I mean as a player I control the ship in anyway I want. Its not just go forward and back, shoot weapons, and so on, I can control where the power goes around the ship, I can scan the sector for enemies, I can use programs that boost stats or viruses that infect enemy computer, I can tweak what subsystem need power from lights to atmospherics. The goal of the game is go through this procedurally generated galaxy and kill enemies for scrap. Once you do so you buy upgrades at shops and equip them on your ship. After this you will eventually be powerful enough to take on the galaxy boss and claim victory. On the way to this main goal there is so much to do and see so lets go over some of that.Things to do:1. Kill enemies.2. Loot abondoned space stations and structures for scrap all while avoiding dangerous mines.3. Find a high class enemy ship and prepare to board!4. Kill everything last thing on this enemy ship and hack is subsystems to take control of it!5. Use your new sexy ship to fly to a planet.6. Use your teleporter and beam down to the surface.7. Don't forget your space suit because humans need oxygen.8. Explore abondoned strucutes on the surface for food, weapons, collectables, and more!9. Tell your friend to walk out into the desert by himself/herself but DONT tell him/her about the evil sand worm.10. Find sector 0 and enter the famous Colonial Hub and meet new people and accept quests!11. Get lost in the Colonial Hub12. Fly into a sector with either a high level enemy or many enemies13. Panic because you shields are down14. REALLY panic because your ship is blaring its sirens and there are lots of red lights and evERYTHING IS SHAKING OH GOD15. Die16. Return more motivated than ever.16. Pay taxes to use the Long Range Warp Station to move around faster.17. Spend skill points to make yourself and your kick♥♥♥♥♥crew even better!18. Customize your apperance.19. Try to overthrow the captain.20. Fail at mutany21. Get ingrossed in something and forget about the heat level of your reactor.22. Panic AGAIN because all your system turned off due to emergency cooling.23. Wonder what this switch does and eject your loving core out into space (What did it ever do to you!?)24. Run out of fuel and have to open up your emergency broadcast beacon.25. Pray to the space whales that someone nice will come to your aid.26. Die from someone not so nice.27. Get determined to win the game (or at least progress as far as you can in the games current state)28. Do the process all again but not die29. Get hype for you epic finale boss.30. Pump your epic music so that your parents get annoyed.31. Shoot the crap out of the boss using your skills and that handy dandy nuke you forgot about.32. Revel in your victory and attempt to self destruct the ship.33. Die34. Give this game a thumbs up on Steam because of how awesome it is!What I covered about is not all that you can do. Its an open world space game so you can make up stories, role play, and gather your buddies for a awesome LAN party thats not actually LAN because the game doesn't have that feature yet BUT it will. Anyways this game is great on almost all sides. I didn't even mention it but the art style is very clean but detailed and easy to look at. All in all I can give this game tons of my love and I think you should too! If your reading this and you know you could even slightly enjoy this game then you should really click that buy button. Lastly the devs to this game are super open about their development and are awesome dudes. They would love to help you with problems and so would the Pulsar community. The devs even have had polling sessions to vote on content that will be in the game! So buy the game or don't, if you don't your missing out on the best open world spaceship bridge simulator to date.If you would like to see more I have a series of the game where me and some friend try our best to plow to the final boss. I will put a link to the first episode if you want to watch it. If not then don't, this isn't ment to be some plug or whatever but if you must think that it is, then i'm shamless about it :) Take care.

								Omg How do i explain this game ,properlly well i dont know if i can. The potential is just WOW imagine FTL ,Fire Fly ,Star Trek,Space Engineers and maybe Planet Side all went to a party and said lets make a game.(I only played Weapon specialist )logged on tried  solo play (Private) tried to get a jist for the game added bots as other roles  (i was Captain),out of warp we came,PewPewpewpew ...boom,I was now an expirenced captain(not at all)The true adventure had begun as i connected to some random Noob/any one welcome server and met my new crew one of which had knowledge and shared basics on our roles and what to do in certain Emergency Situations,I took None in point me too a red Box please BEEEEP..... hes hostile sir ,er um FIRE and so i did  shields where low  half ish health ,They started diverting power and stuff,we made it but barely some crew left some crew stayed  as we repaired up, a new Guy  piloting crashed around and muddled in engineering before a witty officer suggest to kick the little devil and so a vote was tossed and into the vacum of space i assume he went.time went by planets where scaned and  missions where planned . Then a number rang in my head $40000 for some pistol the crew had been raving about money,money where can i ahem check that (bottom right )ah i was tabbed and and the bottom was covered by my start menu due to how i usually move my games, some Real immersion was setting in so i change to full screen (No more Music I was In)more battles took place as a Bond formed, we where a brother hood -Cept for that Little Devil who ejected our coolant,kept raming the repair staion,tossed our fuel And Manipulated Flow charts on MY Acuracy in the heat of battle.No i take that back He to is a brotherHow do i Say Thank You .

								As of this writing, the game is currently on version 0.9.2A very fun co-op experience that's a little light on endgame content at the moment.The general description of the game is a five player co-op game where each player takes a specific officer role aboard a starship. These five players working together allow the ship to be run at prime efficiency as they explore uncharted star systems and engage enemy combatants on the ground and in space. Five people are not needed to play this game. I think 3 is a perfect minimum to make things run smoothly. The Captain would also play the role of pilot while two others were Engineer and Science Officer. You could then set two bots (Weapons Bot and Pilot Bot) to man the guns.A more in-depth description follows:PULSAR allows up to five friends to take on the role of a starship crew. While any player in any role can do any job, each role has specific perks that make them perform their role more effectively.The first role is Captain. The captain is in charge of the ship. He plots the course that the ship will take, manages ship finances and upgrades, gives an allowance to the other members of the crew for personal purchases, decide when to charge up the warp engine and initiate warp as well as how to respond to other vessels. He can take a diplomatic approach, militarisic approach or even extort other ships over the communications system. His skills are based on speech as well as allowing other players to move more quickly.The second role is Engineer. The engineer is the one who keeps the ship running. He manages the reactor which supplies power to the entire ship, juggling systems by diverting power to and from ones in need and making sure it does not overheat, charging the warp drive as well as actually initiating the jump upon the captain's order. His skills are designed to make his job easier by making reactor coolant more effective, allowing ship critical systems to begin self repairs, reducing the likelihood of fires during combat and increasing the chances of successfully obtaining working salvage from destroyed ships.The third role is Science Officer. The science officer has two primary roles aboard the ship plus a handful of secondary roles. His most important one is managing the cyberwarfare suite during combat. Managing computer viruses designed to perform actions such as kill an enemy's engines, stop their shields from recharging, siphoning credits and blocking long range distress communications as well as running anti-virus programs when his ship is the target of cyber warfare. His second role is research and developement. When research materials are brought aboard, the science officer can study them in order to learn new skills that can affect the crew in a myriad of ways such as faster weapon cooldowns, being able to run while encumbered and more efficient jetpack fuel. Other roles involve scanning ships and planets for lifesigns, EM, radiation and abnormal/dangerous weather conditions. His skills are designed around making shields more efficient, reducing the ship's signature to make detection more difficult and healing nearby crew members.The fourth role is Weapons Officer. The weapons officer's primary role is to man the ship's weaponry, including turrets, the main gun, missiles and nuclear armament. He is also responsible for leading the away team when boarding enemy ships or teleporting down to a planet. His skills revolve around making ship weaponry more efficient by reducing cooldowns.The last role is Pilot. The pilot's job is to fly the ship, primarily during combat, but also to align the ship with the target sector prior to engaging the warp engines. He is also responsible for getting the ship close enough to gather scrap off of destroyed ships and maneuvering into repair doks. His skills are designed to make the engines more efficient.			"

								One of my friends really hyped this up to me, and told me all the fantastic sounding stories, so I purchased it.  Kinda wishing I hadn't as it's boring, at least to me.  The conept is nice and I might c ome back to it in a year, maybe.  but for now, it's off my computer.Good:Nice conceptThe roles of the crewNeutralGraphics aren't pleasing but definetly not a reason to stop playing.Apparently has Xbox One controller supprt, but I couldn't get it to work.  Could be a fault on my end though.Bad:I found the game boring.Seems like the first 30 mins of every game I played with my friend are running around and setting up AIs to do things...Needs adapting to have more players.  There are 5 ""Officer"" roles but I think it could eb better with some additional players just being plain crew members once the 5 officers are set up.I'm not saying this is a bad game (I'd give it a neutral recomendation if I could), but it doesn't work for me.  Like I say, I might come back to it in a year or so.  That's more generous then some games I've played...			"

								Pulsar is basically a Star Trek simulator: There are different positions on the ship and each player takes on one of the roles.Technically, you can play it alone just with bots (especially after the AI update), but I recommend you get at least one or two other players to play with you, because it's a lot more fun and sometimes easier.

If you love sci-fi shows, you're going to love this. break out your mic and make sure nobody non-nerdy is listening and you'll have a blast. The game is missing some mid to high level content, and the universe feels a bit sparse and repetitive, but these are all normal things to be expected from a game that's allowed early access. It's a ton of fun now, and looks to be perhaps one of the most solid sci-fi experiences of all time with a little bit of future content.			"

								Ever watch Star Trek and say ""I'd like to be one of the members on that ship""?Well, this game will allow you the opportunity to do just that!!!I have played thousands of games in my lifetime and I honestly can't say that I've enjoyed a game as much as this one in MANY years. I know the graphics look quite dated and it is true. This is not a game where you can expect to have everything glorified like you see in most new games out on the market. In a typical game you can start off pretty nice and relaxing at the controls and after a quick jump through space, your entire crew including yourself is thrown into a panic to man the guns and adjust power throughout the ship in order to ensure its survival. If you are a fan of star trek or have ever wanted to be part of that crew, do yourself a favor and get this game!!!If you enjoy coop games where everyone on the crew has a specific job to take care of, get this game.Cons to this game:-dated graphics, -Some games will have too many chiefs and not enough indians which makes gameplay really not enjoyable.All in all, find yourself a decent group of friends who are willing to teach you your job and let you at the controls no matter how often you may fail. This game is seriously under rated!!!!			"

								A very impressive game. 5 players get a spaceship, and adventure around the galaxy doing anything they like. The classes are all well designed, though the Scientist and Engineer could do with a few more responsibilities. The ships and their class-related functions are easy to learn how to use - after my first ""game"" (30 minutes of gameplay, ""Game Over,"" everyone left) I had mastered a role and learned quite a lot about another two. The enemies (generally) aren't over- or under-powered, unless there are more than about 3 of them, in which case one should leave. Quickly.  One of my largest problems was the character model quality. While it doesn't affect gameplay, I'm very fussy when it comes to graphics quality. Also, there could be a bit more variety in terms of the ships (not the components, the ships themselves).I do think that the price was a bit too high, however. Personally, I would have been more willing to pay around £15, rather than £18.99. Alas, not many things are perfect - but this game isn't too bad.Rating:Concept: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Ships (Aesthetics & Stats): 9/10Story: N/AMap & World: 8/10Overall: 8.3/10			"

								An intriguing little game with lots of ambition. It aims to be a glorious mashup of Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Sim, FTL, Guns of Icarus, and Star Trek: Away Team, and while it is admittedly a little light on content at the moment, it does a great job of capturing the essential components and atmospheres of all these games.Players get to choose between four different ships to fly in, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and five classes to play as: captain, pilot, weapons, engineering, and science, each with their own disticnt roles and RPG-style progression trees. At present, you start at The Hub, an expansive space station from which you can purchase items, weapons, and ship components, and also pick up various missions that drive progression in the game. Gameplay involves FTL-esque flight between randomized sectors, replete with derelict ships, crazed security bots, and enemy capital ships. There's also Away Team segments, where you can teleport down to nearby planets to fight the aliens de jour and search for your mission objectives. There are some neat metagame mechanics at work too: factions, reputation, and a Galactic Chaos system that ramps up the difficulty of enemies as you play. Apparently there are also some other surprises in store further out in the galaxy, but I haven't made it far enough out without getting vapourized to encounter them.All in all, it's a super promising little title with great atmosphere and ambition that's just a little short on polish and content at time of writing, but is still a blast to play. Best played with friends! You can yell at each other to charge the warp core as you are torn apart by AI bots. Overal Verdict: Pre-Beard Riker -- full of potential, and just waiting to fill out into a space-age icon.			"

								This game is reminicent of FTL, but does plenty to differentiate itself from FTL.  It's in 3D and has 5 man online co-op featuring 5 unique roles: a Captain, a Scientist, an Engineer, a Pilot, and a Weapon's Specialist! Each role has it's own bonuses, a rudimentary skill tree, and different things to do such as steering the ship, hacking/scanning, manning turrets, fixing the ship or bossing people around. I've had some great moments in this game. As the engineer, there's nothing quite like pulling off Scotty like miracle work and saving the ship with last second engine repairs and then punching the button that jumps you all to safety. Similarly when there's a virus in the computer, rebooting the computer involves some Jurassic Park style flipping of big switches that always makes me chuckle to myself every time I see them! They're great. As the pilot I got to show off my piloting skills while gingerly easing the ship through the tight passages of an ancient wrecked structure and navigating around dangerous mines as we tried to salvage some loot. As the weapons specialist there was a moment when we bit off more than we could chew, with our ship blazing, and our weapons knocked offline I made a snap decision to board the enemy ship at the last second and managed to destroy their weapons, haulting incoming damage just long enough for my crewmates to jump the ship to safety. As the captain the first adventure was a blast, with me totally clueless but leading a crew of seasoned veterans, and they just rolled with it, bless them. It was a disaster, but everyone had fun. The scientist is the most underapreciated role, but they have their uses such as scanning for lifeforms and modulating shields. Although underappreciated, I take secret pleasure in joining a game as the scientist. I've heard rumours that there will be some form of scientific research added at a later date to flesh out the role a little more, and I do hope so.You can do some similar things in Pulsar that you can do in FTL such as boarding enemy ships, targetting their subsystems, hacking, shutting off their oxygen (or your own), causing/putting out fires, shopping, and upgrading your ship. There are some things you can do in pulsar that you can't do in FTL such as beaming down to planets, visiting space stations, comandeering enemy ships. There are some really nice touches, such as when you grab cargo, that stuff starts appearing on cargo pads in your ship. So when your ship fills up with cargo, it literally does fill up with cargo. Really adds to the immersion.The galaxy is open world which to me is a huge plus, so there's a lot of freedom to roam the galaxy as your captain pleases. The open world doesn't extend to planets, with surface areas being small areas around the teleporter pad, more akin to dungeons than planet surfaces. But they are certainly functional enough for their purpose.If you're lookng for something to play at the weekends with friends then there is definitely a lot of fun to be found here. Get 4 friends wth you and hilarity ensues. It was watching a live steam of people playing this that made me instantly buy it!If you're looking for an FTL-like game you can follow the development of and play occasionally when patches come out then this is a good buy. Judging from their past dev-videos, new content comes approximately on a monthly basis with bugfixes and tweaks more regularly. If you like the concept and are willing to support a dev on the potential of their game alone then you will probably not be disappointed, Personally, I played pulsar for 2 days solid, and stopped playing it, only because I don't want to play it to death at this early stage. I know there is still a lot of content needs to be added and so it's better to only dabble in it for now. So now I just play it for a bit when patches some out.  The base game is complete, and all the core mechanics have been fleshed out to where it's a fully fledged game. There is a large galaxy to explore and missions you can play through. All that is lacking is a decent variety of content to keep things interesting in the long run. To be sure if you're looking for something that you can play all day long, every day, and never run out of content, then this is not the game for you--at least not yet. But if you're looking for something to dabble in until the developer has a chance to flesh it out more then I heartilly recommend.As with all Early Access games there's no guarentee it will ever be finished, So really it comes down to whether you're willing to support the developer on the merit of what they have right now and on the future potential. Keep in mind your idea of ""fleshed out"" might differ from the developers. I've been burned before, *cough* Elite Dangerous *cough*. But I still see it as worth the risk to support smaller devs such as this when they have something that really appeals to me. If you're not sure then check out youtube, or better yet wait till release and you'll know for sure.			"

								We beamed down to a planet in search of a lost research team doing science on a planet. Found research team in a pile of bodies surrounded by ferocious ant like creatures. Proceded to kill all life forms and steal research in the betterment of the ship. Pulsar Lost Colony? more like Be Invading Alien Simulator.Honestly though, if you want probably the best coop, mult-crew experience on the market right now, find four others and prepare for a experience thats truly unique.

								Quite an amazing game from the looks of it so far. The developers have no chill and when they release an update it's as good as it gets! If you're into Star Trek-esque Space Exploration games, then this is definitely for you. This game has a great combat system, AI bots if your crew is not maxed, and many planets to explore! I love this game, and I do not regret purchasing it back in late 2013. 10/10 - Keep up the good work developers!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fantastic.  It boldly goes where no game has gone before: it places you in a crew of 5 other players each having their own responsibilities and when the crew works together you can accomplish almost anything.   That gives you a great sense of achievement both technically and socially that I haven't seen in any other game.  Communication is key so if your the silent type, it's probably not for you.  You HAVE to be engaged with your crew because the ships you crew simply won't function well without it.  The payoff is huge, you really feel like a member of a starship.  Another fantastic element is roleplay and gameplay are one and the same.  Your captain is your leader and speaking to him in true roleplay talk or just plain talk really makes no difference because it's really all the same thing.There's a lot to learn in this game, but not overwhelming.  There's even a manual in the options menu if you need to read up on something.  Most of the game revolves around hanging with your crew as you visit planets and do away missions or space battles where you must fill a role whether it be piloting, managing the power systems, scanning for lifeforms, manning a turret, or what not. Graphics as some have said, are not best of the best, but hardly bad actually I think they are very, very nice with plenty of fancy surface and lighting details.The music has nothing on games like FTL, but again it is very good for it's purpose, and I suspect they will expand the soundtrack a lot more in the future.The community is mostly great.  There are some greifers here and there, I find it's best to say hello when you join is a good way to know what kind of people you are going to play with.It is still early access, but the devs are very active so lots of content pours in frequently.Being EA, the planets you can visit are a bit limited in that you will find yourself visiting the same areas frequently until they add more locations.  However the galaxy map is huge and generated new in every new game and some things such as loot and enemies and backgrounds are generated differently with each planet, plus there's no limit to how many new planets the devs can create.  There's really no limit to the vast amount of possibilities this game has going for it.The community is a bit small right now but there's never a shortage of games you can find to join, just make sure to warm up to the captain for best results. (He is the only one that can kick players)Price is a bit high for EA, but it is a fully multiplayer game and the base game is already very solid.Overall this game is really the experience I've been looking for for a long time: a game where you team up as a crew of players and have endless adventures aboard a totally huge randomly generated galaxy.8.9/10 EA score,  10/10 if they get everything right in the official release.

								If you ever wanted a game that simulates the experience of a Star Trek bridge look no further. There are space battles, there is boarding, there are away missions, and it is all very fun and addicting; especially if you happen to join a good crew.For those worried about early access: the game is very stable, in 27 hours the only hiccup I've had is one disconnect. There are latency issues to be expected if you are in Europe and connecting to a game on the US west coast, but game breaking bugs are almost entirely non-existent. The game's core elements are completely in place and it does not leave you feeling like major aspects of the game are missing.There is not currently a very high amount of content in the game. After a few planets and a few battles you will definitely get the sense that you have ""Been there, done that"",  but the rogue-like elements and the ever increasing difficulty of the enemies as your journey goes on will keep you wanting to see what's at the end of your next jump, or whats for sale at the shop over in sector 1751. There are currently a few missions available in the game from NPC's that can give your adventures a sense of purpose, but there is no real story as of the time of this review.The price is definitely the biggest drawback to this game. In its current state it feels like something that would fit the $10-$15 price range. That being said: having made the $25 commitment, I have no regrets. If you are an impatient gamer who wants non-stop action this game is probably not for you. It is intense action followed by periods of discussing plans, or debating which piece of gear to buy next, etc... If you are easily bored this may be a problem.And if you find yourself on a desert world, don't listen to the guy who tells you to follow him out into the sands away from the rest of the crew.			"

Early Access Review
								I tried this game tonight, and had to force my bloodshot eyes to turn away after nearly 6 hours of non stop adventure.  This game is a breath of fresh air, this game is exactly what the space Genre needs.  This game has the foundation of possibly the most accessable, but also DEEP space sim games I have played in decades. I am not going to lie, the game is a bit rough around the edges, the AI, the clunky animations, the tired generic models.  But even this sort of adds to the charm, it gives it a retro quality, and the simplicity of the interfaces make it instantly accessable!At first the ugly nature of the graphics can be unsettling. However it all comes together in just the right way so that your imagination, and your interaction with your friends and the universe around you fills in the gaps, and smoothes the edges.  The game strikes the perfect balance of creating a sandbox with stuff to do, but letting your imagination fill in the gaps.  We picked a stealthy ship.  Thinking - hey, were newb, lets avoid trouble, and attack only when we have the advantage!  It took us a half hour or so to figure out the controls well enough to go to warp and not blow ourselves up.  On the first planet we discovered, We had to wear our space suits to walk around as it was a hot lava planet.  We ran a surface scan, and found 11 life forms.  It took a while but when we found them, it was funny as can be, we had no idea of the aliens would be friendly, or what.  I stood their, pointing my gun at them, asking my engineer for his advice, backing away as these lava slimes appraoched.  they didn't shoot or hurt lava or anything, so I decided to stand my ground. A split second later I was in agony, my health below 40%!  These aren't friendly aliens at all!  Open fire!My engineer dutifully helped me slay all 11 of them, and we went on to explore the rest of the planet and got a few bits of loot for our trouble, including a nice new shield generator. In another instance we spawned in and were attacked by an enemy ship, not an easy little drone like we had gotten used to so far, but a full power ship.  Thinking it would be a pushover, we engaged, the jolly roger unfurled!   Within seconds we learned (the hard way) how important the science officers role could be, as our upgraded and powerful shields vanished in the first volley!  We needed to modulate the shields and hit em with programs!Our ship was on fire!  And so my engineer friend dropped what he was doing and put out the fires. While I modulated the shields and tried to figure out what programs would help.  Whatever I Was doing it helped, the enemy's shots stopped destroying our shields, and our shots started penetrating. The battle was white knuckle, with our systems overheating and exhausted, we lost main engine power, and sat toe to toe trading blows.  When it was over, we won by the skin of our teeth, our ship was below 20% hull, almost no armor left... Our ship was full of holes, and we limped to Sector Zero (the main outpost space station with NPC's you can talk to, to get repairs.  It took me a minute to figure out how to drop the shields to get repaired, but it was nice to be fully repaired and ready to go.  Plus we had some missions to do next time we play!If you have even the slightest bit of love for the captains chair, science officers station, running the guts of a starship, piloting it, or working the guns,  you owe it to yourself to at least give this game a try.  Return it if you don't like it!  I simply cannot believe that this game isn't being watched as closely as it should be. Tonight, I jumped in with a friend, he chose engineer, and I of course had to be captain. From the first moments to the last moments, we were laughing, arguing, cursing, sweating, and cheering. I didn't even mind the lack of a tutorial, figuring out the ship and controls wasn't too steep of a learning curve, indeed, learning to properly configure the AI was the hardest part, and if you play with real people you won't have that issue as much. I would say this game loses a lot of it's charm if you try to play it solo.  I would say play it with 2 people at a minimum the first time you try it, and one should be captain, and one should be pilot.  The captain should run all the stations, while the pilot pilots.  The captain can functionally operate every station, just not as well.  But it's enough that you can have fun and get things done. With a full group, cooperating and having a good attitude, the game is a total utter gem. I can't wait to see the finished product with all the features complete and a universe full of sandbox content to explore... TRY THIS GAME! "

								This is a great first-person starship simulator online. There are five classes. Scientist, weapons specialists, engineer, pilot and captian. When you join a game online you join a new crew each time usually, with new people, and possibly new ship. When you start your own ship, you save it and get a different crew each time when people join. Every part of the crew usually makes the decisions on where to go, what missions to take, what things you need, etc. If you are looking for a little bit of info on what you can do, here it is:Weapons Specialist (WS): You man the weapons in the weapons bay. When on missions you are usually the one with more health and attck from talent points (TP) your crew gets from leveling up. Fighting monsters on planets and shooting and boarding enemy ships is what you do. Scientist: You work in the lab, do all scans, run the shields, do research, and work with programs and viruses. The lab work is done when you stuff random goo and research materials into the 'atomizer' and if gives you research material. When you do research you use those things to give your crew upgrades. When you run the sheilds you set them for physical or energy weapons that you find out about when you scan their ship. When you scan the ship of the A.I. you scan for weapons, components, etc, and it is usuallu important to know your ship's component so you figure out if there is anything you need on the A.I. ship you could get. And with virus and programs you use programs to disable or take things from the enemy ship and stop virusses the enemy ship may puts on you. You also usually get to yell at the engineer to get you fuel capsules.Engineer: You work all the engineering stuff and systems. There are so many systems to explain that it would take me a while and a lot of time to explain it so I am just gonna leave it to: You get to learn a top to know what to press, when to press it, and how things work. There.Pilot: Pretty straightforward. Not much I can say other than the fact that you pilot the ship.Captian: Again, self-explainatory. CAPTIAN.As always there is aton more things to all of these things than I explained and said, and there is so much fun to have testing and learning how to use everything.This is a great game, with real-time voice chat, so it feels like you are actually on a crew. That is a very short overview of Pulsar: Really great game. "

								This game is basicly ftl. the more i explain it the more it sounds like ftl.i like this more than ftl becuase of the role system and to co op play. the planets while not being very big have great detail. The ships are a good size and have more detail than i would of expected. you pay for what you get in this game.it is early in its life so there are lots of bugs and can use some upgrades. i am more than happy to put my money into this type of game.

								PULSAR: Lost Colony even in early access is already a great investment and feels pretty complete despite some bugs. This is the first time I've ever said that about an early access game and hopefully it won't be the last. There is absolutely no story so I won't be covering that. Gameplay  In a nutshell, imagine what you would do aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. For those who don't know the ship specifically, imagine what is done onboard  the famous spaceship in Star Trek. You have 5 classes; each with their own upgrades that contribute to other crew members and the ship itself. Captain, scientist, pilot, engineer and gunner. I'll list these off individually to make it easier to take in. Captain The captain chooses what to do, where to go and what to buy. He or she is also the one who gives you a limit on what you can spend as the money you receive goes towards everyone. Scientist The scientist is responsible for buffing and debuffing ships and scanning for enemies and mines both on the ship and on foot. He can also decide whether to sacrifice shields for a more stealthy approach or keep the shields strong. He's basically the 'support' class of the crew. Pilot  The pilot is self explanatory. They're responsible for maneuvering the ship to align with the current and future destinations and help to either engage or retreat from enemy ships. Engineer The engineer is probably the most hectic job of all. As the engineer you're responsible for warp ignition and preparation, keeping the core cool, making sure that the right systems are on and the wrong ones off, repairing damaged systems, turning the shields off and on for ship repairs and making sure to send fuel cores up so that the scientist can continue to use his/her buffs and debuffs to keep the ship from exploding.  Gunner The gunner is the most simple job. Your job is to be ready to shoot at hostiles when given the order or when you've received fire.While some jobs are more complicated than others, every crew member is valuable and that is what I love about this game. If you're only interested in singleplayer then this is not the game for you. The A.I. isn't too bright and will end up getting you killed.  Graphics and Sound Both the graphics and the sound are pretty outdated but once you play you definitely won't care. It's a very innovative and interactive game. The pictures on the store page shows you exactly how it will look.I absolutely recommend this game without a doubt. The community is very friendly and helpful and the adventure no matter if you're starting a new game or helping someone with theirs is always different. I think that the $25 price for an early access game is a bit steep but still worth every penny. If this game is developed further and goes out of early access I have no doubt in my mind that it could end up as one of the greatest and most memorable games ever made. That is how fun this is and how confident I am about it with the direction it's in. This game doesn't require a mic to play but it is strongly recommended as constant communication is key to staying alive in the heat of battle.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, however performance is quite poor on the big ships, especially on the interior. Overall, the game is great if you enjoy working as a team to defeat enemy space ships, completing missions, and visiting different planets each with new things to discover! This is sort of what No mans sky should've been, even though this games map is a lot smaller, it feels much better as you can actually make meaningful upgrades to your crew, and ship. For example, you can buy nuclear warheads for your weapons expert to launch at enemy vessles, or you can increase your ships coolant capacity or engine power etc. Space combat feels great on this game, and its very satisfying when you and your crew take out a gigantic enemy space ship which attempted to raid you, and loot the remains of their ship! You can sell scrap which you can obtain from enemy ships, and buy new equipment for your own ship instead to become stronger! Your crew is made up of a Captain who is in charge of your ship, a Pilot who pilots your ship at the captains will, a weapons expert who is responsible for maintaining weapons and engaging the enemy, an engineer who is in charge of maintaining the ships health, core temp, power etc. And also a scientist who researches new things which you can find on planets! Each crew member has a very unique, yet important role, and having a whole crew co-operating together and making the ship run feels great, it's honestly a very good co-op experience if done right.The graphics could be a little better, especially the interiors of the ships, however the skybox, and the planets look great! One drawback of this game however, is that sometimes when on the bigger ships, you tend to get around 30-40 FPS on a pretty decent PC like mine, even though I run games like Arma 3 at around 60 FPS. However it's not unplayable, and doesn't ruin the experience for me.The devs do bring out regular updates, and they recently added jetpacks to the game, allowing you to jump multiple times in the air. Positives of the game: Very fun with friends Feels great when you operate such a big ship with your friends Lots of stars/planets to explore Random NPC missions such as exploring lost ships, engaging in combat, etc. Unique roles for each crew member Upgrades to shipsNegatives:  Graphics aren't the best Sometimes performance is a little low "

								This game is amazing considering there are only two devs right now. I would highly recomend this game its tons of fun, working with your crew mates you have to navigate through the galaxy avoiding or seeking conflict. You can smuggle, you can be pirates, you can be a destroyer, or even just a friendly explorer. The gameplay is highly enhanced when you play with friends, though the servers are always a great place to meet new people and expand your knowledge base of the game. It takes some getting used to, but I have a feeling that this already amazing game is only going to get better.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a great first-person starship simulator online. There are five classes. Scientist, weapons specialists, engineer, pilot and captian. When you join a game online you join a new crew each time usually, with new people, and possibly new ship. When you start your own ship, you save it and get a different crew each time when people join. Every part of the crew usually makes the decisions on where to go, what missions to take, what things you need, etc. If you are looking for a little bit of info on what you can do, here it is:Weapons Specialist (WS): You man the weapons in the weapons bay. When on missions you are usually the one with more health and attck from talent points (TP) your crew gets from leveling up. Fighting monsters on planets and shooting and boarding enemy ships is what you do. Scientist: You work in the lab, do all scans, run the shields, do research, and work with programs and viruses. The lab work is done when you stuff random goo and research materials into the 'atomizer' and if gives you research material. When you do research you use those things to give your crew upgrades. When you run the sheilds you set them for physical or energy weapons that you find out about when you scan their ship. When you scan the ship of the A.I. you scan for weapons, components, etc, and it is usuallu important to know your ship's component so you figure out if there is anything you need on the A.I. ship you could get. And with virus and programs you use programs to disable or take things from the enemy ship and stop virusses the enemy ship may puts on you. You also usually get to yell at the engineer to get you fuel capsules.Engineer: You work all the engineering stuff and systems. There are so many systems to explain that it would take me a while and a lot of time to explain it so I am just gonna leave it to: You get to learn a top to know what to press, when to press it, and how things work. There.Pilot: Pretty straightforward. Not much I can say other than the fact that you pilot the ship.Captian: Again, self-explainatory. CAPTIAN.As always there is aton more things to all of these things than I explained and said, and there is so much fun to have testing and learning how to use everything.This is a great game, with real-time voice chat, so it feels like you are actually on a crew. That is a very short overview of Pulsar: Really great game. "

								I can understand where some of the frustration of the VR haters comes from. I don't fully agree with it, But i understand it. I can understand you putting VR into the game to make it more atractive and thus increasing your sales. Solid tactic. Nothing wrong with that. What i do have a problem with is that the game's biggest flaw at the moment, The lack of content, Is not beeing adressed at all. A couple of new planets and 1 ship in over 1.5 years of development is just not enough. That is a valid point of critique on the developers's end. To add on top of that the AI system STILL does not function. It's basically impossible to play this game single player because in order to run an effective ship, You need to punch in fuel cells manually in order to reload shields, programs etc. This would have been no problem if you could just assign your damm egineering bot to do that for you, allas, That STILL does not work. I know the focus is on multiplayer, But beeing able to play single player every now and again might be fun,. Conclusion is, It's not the fact that VR is beeing put in the game that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people of. It's the fact that a lot of promisses are beeing broken in order to focus more on VR desgin. It's another pre alpha game where the developers break there prommise over and over and over. This game might be some day enjoyable, If it get's a massive injection of new content. For now, Don't buy it. Or at least wait till it's on sale			"

								An excellent space simulator! I've heard this is in the same vein as Artemis Bridge Simulator. I joined on with a number of friends as the engineer. After about 30-60 minutes, I'd gotten the basics down well enough. It seems that each player has enough to do that all are busy, especially during combat.I absolutely love the tension as you warp into a new sector, with potentially hostile ships - everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the scan to come back with their fingers ready at their battlestations. Exquisite!So far I have only played in a pre-assembled group, so I do not have experience with how jumping into a public game goes. I will say that being in a group with voice chat amplifies the experience greatly. There's something magical about hearing ""Weapons are down! Give me weapons!"" or ""Refill my shield charges ASAP; we're getting hammered!"" in the heat of battle. A really fantastically crafted experience.The game provides a really engaging opportunity to run not only your own ship, but various kinds of ships. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking to have a crack at running their own spaceship!For those who'd like to see how the game actually plays, feel free to scope out our misadventures here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZD1JcBH-MIqSwPt6sZztMEjUFf7VdwZor here on steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/morjax/videos/?appid=252870 "

								I do not recommend this game based on current amount of content. Some of the most annoying things that I've come across are:-Planets are mostly empty, you run , run, run , radiation -> dead . Not much exploration you can do since you'll probably find only a abandoned/manned station, ship....-If you board a enemy ship you can't do much except destroy/turn off generator so turn off shields and destroy the ship... Destroying life support has no meaning since the AI will keep re-spawning regardless-Most of the systems are completely empty, with nothing to do in it-Enemy AI keeps 'teleporing' ,like it is lagging...you can barely shoot them with a gun... Game was fun only because i played it with a couple of friends. Probably wouldn't have touched it otherwise. 23€ for this amount of content is simply not worth it at this moment. Probably the single interesting mechanic (except being co-op) is being able to provide more energy to shields while cutting life support and stuff like that...			"

								So firstly the Dev's of this game are insanely detected about this.Open-world Space & Planet exploration game, 5 player co-op, you'd think that'd require a huge development team.Nope, not only have the guys at Leafy Dev's done this on their own but they've done it well!Still in Beta and there's already a ton of stories me and my friends are able to share back and fourth about our exploits, which are often made even more special because we experienced this together, and together having to essentialy synchronize as a team, so when we earned something we damn well earned it!If you want a game where you and up to 4 other friends can take a space ship and just explore the Galaxy like they do in Star Trek this is by far the best game that let's you do it in a fun, engaging and memorable way. With five distinct classes of Captain, Weapons, Science, Engineering and Pilot. If you're a space exploration fan, have some friends and want a truly engaging experience this is *the* game in my opinion. The only thing I feel the need to pre-warn is that being in Beta the Dev's are still working out the Balancing of the game, so you might get stages where it seems a bit too easy or (my preference) a bit too hard.Keep up the great work Leafy Devs! :) "

								After buying the game, and after the rest of the afternoon disappeared...Wow, that was a fun 2 hours. I looked at the screenshots, and read the reviews, but nothing really prepared me for the expirience. Logging into a multiplayer game was easy, learning my way around the ship was easy, even the ships control system were intuitive and easy to learn. but keeping your ship level and unharmed when enemies are hurling missiles at you and the weapons guy is a real noob on deflection shooting and keeps shouting for you to hold the ship still for a second while flying through an asteroid, that's hardAfter a couple of missions and visiting mabe 4-5 different crews, I created a single player game, so I could learn how to actually controll the ship. The smallest flies like a dream, and the biggest I've flown so far had more guns than my Grandpaw and drove like his Ford Galaxie 500			"

								This game is one of a kind.  The closest thing I know of is artemis bridge simulator but that is more of a lan rpg.  This is my dream game.  A 5 player co-op first person version of FTL.  I'm surprised it took such a small indie studio to even attempt such a thing and yet it is coming along at a remarkable pace.  I was an original backer and played the game since its barely functioning alpha release February of 2014.  At this point in development there is definitely enough content to have a blast with 4 other friends.  The story and mission content is still forthcoming and furthere changes will likely be made to the existing 5 classes but I would definitely recommend picking this game up if you can convince a few friends to join you.  Pick up groups with randoms can also be fun.  I would only warn against playing alone with bots since the AI is not fully implemented.			"

								My friend introduced me to this game months ago and ever since we were waiting for the game's release. I thought that it was a bit expensive at first but with only 4 hours played I can already say it was worth the money. Yes the graphics are meh in todays standards but if you want a fun, exciting exploration game with seemingly endless possibilities, then this is definitely for you. So far I have only played the multiplayer, and I have experienced very little playing with bots, but I know that the co-op in this game is well done, fun and overall amazing. Me and my friends could seemingly play endlessly (which is helpful since we make progress so slowly) and overall I think this is one of the best games i've played all year. I look forward to exploring the universe even more. I strongly urge you to check out some gameplay of this game, and if you're interested ive just uploaded the first video of many in a Pulsar funny moments series. I'd really appreciate if you could leave feedback as this is my first video, but even if you don't, i recommend you watch a vdeo of some kind. My video is extremely edited down however, so I recommend you also watch some full gameplay footage. Thanks and enjoy the game!

								I have to say I've been waiting for this game for a very long time. it is every bit as incredible as i thought it would be. It is especially fun if you have friends to play with, the bots do not currently give this game credit. There is something extremely gratifying about warping throughout the galaxy and giving orders to your crew, and then being efficient...or in my case, dying a lot. The developers take in a lot of feedback, and the community is very friendly. If you're not too sure if you want this game, you can check out this video to see if the game is for you. The video shows off some of the gameplay (primarily from the captains point of view) as well as the visuals and just what the game can do.

								Five astronauts! One spaceship. Infinite possibilities?  If you ever wanted to control a spaceship together with 4 other real players, this might be the game for you. The flight controls, engines and subsystems are all operated from computer terminals, located on the bridge and other places inside the ship. Players must coordinate their actions to effectively repel enemies or even jump from one sector to the next. While it's the Captains job to take over this coordination (and drink coffee), the Pilot controls the movement, the Weapon Specialist operates the gun turrents, the Scientist the ships software and scanners and the Engineer watches over the energy usage and temperature of the core.   Gameplay example: If you need your weapons to reload faster, the Engineer can switch of systems like internal lights and air conditioning to reroute more power to the weapons or he may switch of shields to have even more power available. The Scientist can temporally boost certain systems with his programs or he can try to hack the enemy ships systems. Of course you can't use all systems on full power at all times, since your ships core will heat up dangerously. Gameplay is often described as Faster Than Light in 3D and Coop.  You can board enemy ships and fight AI crews, explore planets, loot candy and go shopping in space stations. On your travels you will find scrap to sell or ship parts to instal. It's important to plan a route that passes by repair stations to repair the hull or upgrade with new parts. Also you want to stock up on fuel, missiles and coolant fluid used to cool the core in the heat of battle. At the moment there are 5 ships to choose from, all different in size and layout. They all have beautiful lounges to relax and one even has a bar. 10/10 points for that alone.  In the end of the day it's a very fun coop-experience, you want to share with a group of good friends OR the very nice community.  In future I would love to see more things to do onboard except operation the ship. How about some mini games to pass the idle time (btw: there is no idle time, if you don't want. You can jump into action in less than a minute) or enable Roleplay.			"

								This game is amazing! It's a multi palyer crew spaceship sim. Basically what Star citizen is going to be jsut on a lower graphical scale.Currently it's in alpha and feels like it. A good portian of the mechanices are still not implemented and there is no tutorial. The only way to learn how to play and what's in and what's not is to open the menu and click View manual.Basically when you first join the server you pick your role: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Weapons Specialist and EngineerThe Capt. Pulls all the info from everyone together and tells everyone what to do (this person should know how to play, they should be ableto guide the others) The capt also buys and sell stuff and is more or less in control of the money.The Pilot, moves the ship. To warp he has to line up up the ship and the engineeer has to press a button. The pilot doesn't.The Weapons Sepc. Shoots the gun (and main gun).The scientist has the best job in my opinion. They send viruses to enamy ships, they clean the system of viruses, they scan everything, the look up info on verious stuff and run good programs to boost shields give more thrusters ect.The Engineer has the hardest job and in my opinion the 2nd best job. They have to prep for ward, balance the power core temp, turn the power on and off, and provide a boost to the scientist. You may not THINK thats a lot but when everone else uses there stuff it messes with your temp.There are diffrent parts ofthe ship that can be damaged and needs repaired to keep that part going.It feels a lot like guns of icurus but in space.Like i said before; currently there is a lot missing of the game. but from whats not working, this game is going to be awesome!

								Mission Log.... uh... One!Inherited a ship from my grandfather, rust bucket called The Long Night.  Took it out for a test jump, ended up in orbit around a green star. Ship seemed allergic to the heat and radiation, oxygen generator decided to have a nap.  Blind jumped to a rock formation for repairs, coaxed the O2 generator into wakefulness, said Hi to a passerby. Passerby seemed allergic to the Long Night, gave gifts of red beams and fireworks, delivery mechanism needed work, as hull got hit, and caved in.  Waiting in line at the Pearly gates for a reincarnation, so no further log entries expected.			"

								This is a very fun game i do have to reccomend it i don't think it is really worth $30-$25 (or lower) depending on your location due to the fact it does get a little boring after awhile and if your not captain and its not a crew full of friends then you really don't decide on where you want to go.This game is absoloutley amazingIf you a questioning on whether to buy itBUY IT Also i warped into this area with these random dudes we saw 3 drones They 1 shot usThe server didn't come back online			"

								PULSAR is an interesting game, but somewhat lacks originality and is reminiscent of many games in the space/adventure genre. It is a great game to have a laugh with friends and explore new worlds, however the gameplay gets boring quickly due to there being extremely limited goals or missions to complete. Most of these are very bland and offer no unique reward to the player. The different ships available are detailed both graphically and functionally, and this game really brings a new meaning to teamwork, as the ship systems require a near-full crew to operate efficiently. The concept of the game is fun, but is unlikely to be a game that you will come back to later down the line. The planets aren't particularly detailed and lack in many areas, including map size and places of interest.Overall, I rate PULSAR: Lost Colony a 6/10 due to the bland characteristics, but enjoyable gameplay with friends.

								This game is great, even though its lag is pretty bad. The game has many great quality from its game. You start out as a normal aircraft of a faction (Colonial Union, WD Corporation, Aliance of Gentlemen and etc). You take  missions from your faction and you can destroy other faction's ships or cause mutiny and destroy your own faction's ships and create a reputation system. This game is mostly about teamwork, this game is most fun when played with multiple people you may be in contact with, so if you have a few friends and some dollars to spare get this game with your friends and go blow up some ships and explore some planets in space!

								Five people on a spaceship try not to explode.You've got the Captain, who tells everyone what to do so nothing explodes. Little effort required.There's the Scientist, who does research and manages programs and scanning so nothing explodes. Their systems are a little complex, so a little effort required.The Engineer micromanages systems, warping, and most technical stuff in a fruitless effort to make nothing explode. Their systems are relatively complicated as you have to respond to captains' orders as well as making sure  everyone else has power. Hard.The Pilot is in charge of unsuccessfully dodging attacks and responding to countless requests of ""Align ship to jump!"" Easy once you learn the controls. Can't do much to not explode.Last and kinda least, the Combat Specialist is in charge of manning guns and other weapons. Aim, shoot, and hope you don't die. Relatively easy. Shoot the things that are making you explode.11/10 would completely fail to not explode again. "

								Five people on a spaceship try not to explode.You've got the Captain, who tells everyone what to do so nothing explodes. Little effort required.There's the Scientist, who does research and manages programs and scanning so nothing explodes. Their systems are a little complex, so a little effort required.The Engineer micromanages systems, warping, and most technical stuff in a fruitless effort to make nothing explode. Their systems are relatively complicated as you have to respond to captains' orders as well as making sure  everyone else has power. Hard.The Pilot is in charge of unsuccessfully dodging attacks and responding to countless requests of ""Align ship to jump!"" Easy once you learn the controls. Can't do much to not explode.Last and kinda least, the Combat Specialist is in charge of manning guns and other weapons. Aim, shoot, and hope you don't die. Relatively easy. Shoot the things that are making you explode.11/10 would completely fail to not explode again. "

								I stopped playing for a year to see if it's been fixed in any way.  Came back today and it;s still the same old buggy piece of garbage with horrible controls, graphics. Awesome concept but novice programmers...Can't tell a difference at all from a year ago. Same graphics, same repetative missions, and same bugs. What's the point buying and playing this with Star Trek Bridge crew coming out in May....don't waste your money.			"

								Picked this up to play on the HTC vive. VR support is currently not very good. Some menus would get stuck open and stuff. Also they probably should have a teleport system implemented because the current locomotion system feels uncomfortable. The game itself would probably be fun if you have large blocks of time and friends to play it with. Otherwise you might just have trolls join your crew and shut down the power constantly on your ship.I don't recommend this game, but note this is a VR review.			"

								So buggy this shouldn't of been released, even in early access.  The game is built for a respawning system, but it doesn't work.  If you die, it's just straight up game over, you never come back.  This is frustrating because enemies move like they're flash on cocaine, and you have a single fire pistol with like one shot per 20 seconds fire rate, but enemies will rapid fire you down with pinpoint accuracy instantly.And while the space combat is fun, it's annoying as hell that LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT ISN'T YOUR FACTION IS HOSTILE TO YOU.  There's no such thing as neutral, or civillians, or what have you.  As soon as you're in range, everything that spots you will fire upon you. AND THEN YOU LOSE REPUTATION WITH THEM EVEN IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.  It's ♥♥♥♥ing straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

								In this competitive 5 man team game, you take on the role of space CT's or space T's in a dynamic and free roam space version of dustii.Put together your team with a proper strat caller,awper, support, and always have a good lurk to catch the rotates in repair/warp stations.On a scale of cobblestone to dustii this game is a solid mirage, and if it continues to be developed and fleshed out has all the potential to be as good as dustii.

								This game started me off in a bear cave and i had to fight my way out using my bare hands. Once i left the cave i had to deal with the natives.. One was nice enough to help smuggle me to the river in a basket. I swam downstream til i got to this huge waterfall. Of course when i got to the shore, there was a nest of vipers. Needless to say.. YES buy this game. It is worth it.. and if they keep it going it'll be even more fantastic.			"

								I'm on the edge with this game. Personally, I believe this game is amazing. It's very fun and immersive, you seldom feel useless in your crew of 5.The problem I have with this game is how it lacks any goal. The main quest is currently in development so there's not much going on there.The quests you have currently are mostly all the same (They're definitely not the main attraction of the game). You find yourself saying ""I guess I'll just go there"" instead of going somewhere because you're certain that's where you want to go. You're just left wandering this empty space for long periods of time, hoping for something to do.PULSAR has a massive lack of content right now. Yes; Each individual job you can do on your ship is incredibly fun, and you can spend hours at a time on any single job (I prefer the scientist position),  but as a game in general, there is actually not a lot to do. If you want to have a lot of fun here, expect it to mostly be roleplay - And by that I mean, fake player-made goals.All in all, I don't think this game is worth your money. Yet. When (or if) more content is added, definitely pick this up. However just leave it for now.			"

								A very good, fun co-op game. Most of the mechanics work well and the only downside is the combat, lack of content and optimisation. This game ran terribly on my computer while it runs fine on others. (As a note, my computer's specs are over double the recommended)Sadly, I do not think this is worth the price. First time I refunded a game I would have enjoyed for a while longer.At its current state, this game should be worth $10-15.			"

								EDITCheck comments and you'll see almost everything I listed here was simply due to the lack of easily accesible documentation.Most of the features are actually present just not documented in an obvious way (like in the controls).Read the following if you'd like, but take it with a grain of salt.----------------------------------PLEASE NOTEI did not play this game for very long (3 hours), but these were my first impressionsI don't recommend this game for the price (biggest issue) in its current state.This game, in my opinion, is worth at most five dollars.I got this game with a friend on sale for about $15 USDThe same day I requested a refund.The major issue is the price, the game is simply not worth $24 USD.I can't convince my friends to buy a game for $24 USD I'm not even sure I like to buy it and play.Pros - cool concept - interesting co opCons - overpriced (biggest issue; if this game was a couple bucks it'd definitely be worth it) - no official documentation on what to do at the start of the game (and for many other things) - planet surfaces are ugly and boring (sure it's part of the art style, but the planets look like Turok with semi-HD textures) - you have to teleport onto planets, ships, and stations (no docking, which would be awesome, and no landers) - very slow gameplay - not very fun if you don't have 5 friends to play this - can't invite friends to your server through steam (you have to scroll through the server browser, which has no search) - no jumping/vaulting or crouching (feels very awkward as you are always grounded)Overall, this game isn't for everyone, and definitely not worth $24 USD			"

								I love star trek.  I live for science fiction.  I used to play a game with my friends called ""what's the worst thing you would do to go to space"".  ""I would eat a bowl of♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; was the very first answer, and I currently have 2nd place for ""eat a plate of my mother's refrigerated pubes"".I played thousands of hours of Star Trek: Bridge Commander.  I convinced all my friends to play Artemis and we played it as much as the game's awful interface would allow.  This game is about as good as I could've ever imagine Artemis could be with mods about 6 years ago.The potatoes are finished and onto the meat:  PROS:+ There's a universe to explore+ There's a learning curve to exploring it that feels ""just right"". + Playing with your friends and training to be a well-oiled crew is easily some of the most fun I've ever had playing videogamesCONS:- The graphics are bad.  It is ugly.  You won't like looking at anything but space.- LOTS of content missing.  If you've ever wondered what half a game feels like, this is it.- The current system of ship capturing and respawning is half-baked at best.  It's hard to immerse yourself when the key to success is a highly exploitable metagameSUMMARY:In its current state, I cannot recommend PULSAR: Lost Colony despite it being the #1 game on my watchlist for over a year.  The game is as barely functional as an early access game can barely be.  It is my hope that the development team doesn't take the current level of sales as a success and move onto other projects, leaving PULSAR in the state of development hell that the rest of us know early access titles to be.  It is my hope that this is just the beginning of a long voyage full of setbacks and the lessons we learn from them, culminating in a fruitful return, just like a great episode of Star Trek :) "

								Not as cool as I was hoping for it to be.  I don't believe it should be worth $25, even for a gracious ""feed the devs"" cost.  Shoddily made enemy AI and shoddily made friendly AI, clunky interactions and of course, low amount of content.  Every location you see in the trailer is in actuality every location in the game, and every planet is the same as it would be in another playthrough.  The only real charm they expect you to experience is playing the game with your friends.  With your friends.  Meaning you and your buddies fork over $25 for a total $125, since they don't like the idea of the 5-pack for 4-copies deal, and they haven't put it on sale at all.  Even then, it'd still be $100, if you try to buy the 5pack!  Overall I'd say not worth the money they're asking, and that's why the overall reviews count reflects the dwindling playerbase reflects the cost shows the devs haven't sold this product enough.How would I have done it?  Well it's pretty bold but here's how it goes.  You can buy the game for $20, right, and play it as much as you want whenever you want.  BUT, you can also purchase 8 hours of game time for yourself or someone else at $5, starting when they launch it on steam, ending when the timer runs out.  It doesn't tick while the game isn't on.  As such, if you have that one friend with the loaded wallet, he/she can give up a whole $25 to assemble friends to play this game.  In the true reality, nobody should play this game more than twice, once to learn how to fail and once to learn how to win.  Any more and you'll see through the sham that is this game's minute content pool.  Additionally, if you have that group of your pals, you won't be playing this game all the time like ""oh let's pop into some PULSAR right quick"".  This is a one time game, and deserves a less binding price model.  And then to top it all off I'd reduce the price to $12.49 when the summer sale rolls along so I don't lose business, because I've got two orbs between my legs and a brain under the dome.			"

								The cooperative game play is neat.  The missions are nice.The first person aspect doesn't add to the game.  I enjoyed the starbase a bit, but the first person shooter aspects are boring, it's okay if you're a twitchy five year old, but I like games that use cover and more tactics than hand eye coordination.Very buggy, couldn't even complete the first mission without endless glitches just trying to get onto the elevator.Graphics are rudimentary, but I found it performed poorly on basic hardware and needed something more mid-level.I was hoping for something like Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator with more of a story.  Instead I got something slower, poorer graphics, and very buggy.  Overall I'd say not worth it at all and wish I could get a refund.			"

								Ok, for starters this game has a negative review. Shocking I know, but for good reason. The game is IMPOSSIBLE with 2/3/4 players as every role needs to be played well in order to survive. The game isn't incredibly well made and if you like pretty games well, this won't exactly be your cup of tea. However that part of the review was based off playing with my 2 friends who where the only ones willing to pay $20 on a early access game. When I went into the multi player, not many servers exist which allow random players to join, so I made my own. It was pretty entertaining working with the other players and I found myself actually enjoying it. I don't know If I will be revisiting this game in the near future though, as the only updates coming out are very minor bug fixes, and If your lucky you may get a very tiny add on to the game.			"

								Although the idea of working with team mates to control a ship may seem very appealing, that is all that there is. No storyline, the bots are atrocious (both friendlies and enemies), no pvp feature, the game gets very repetitive very fast since jumping into a system will always yield one of four possible scenarios and the planets aren't much better either. In fact the only thing I enjoyed about this game other than working as a team was upgrading my ship but even that lost its appeal when you come to realise with the majority of the enemies that you'll either always win or always lose regardless of what gear you have installed. This game had really great potential and I really wanted to like it, but it just doesn't perform.			"

								Deceptive trailer. Buggy, repetitive and shallow gameplay.Like flying ships? Ship flying is terrible, clunky, slow and there is literally nothing in space. Nothing.Like exploring planets? The planets are smaller than your backyard, and there is nothing on a planet. Nothing.Like shooting? Worst shooting gameplay ever, there's Doom clones from 1995 that are better, and I'm not joking, it's straight up the worst♥♥♥♥♥♥ever.Like managing a ship? There's a couple on/off switches and that't about it, it might give you the impression that the panels are complex, but they're not, they just look cool on face value but once you get in the game there's like 3 buttons you can click and trust me when I say that after pressing them twice you don't feel like repeating it.This game is extremely shallow and overpriced. Don't buy this unless it's 3 dollars/euros. This should have been a free game, and I hope more negative reviews roll in because frankly I'm appalled at how all these 3 hours game time reviewers are giving good reviews for absolutely one of the most boring games.You're warned, this game is absolutely not worth money, it should be free for the hobby project it really is. Disgusting greedy kid who charges for this. Go home. Take my money and donate it to some charity because you have no shame or dignity for charging people.			"

								This game has SO much potential, and is one of the first games I've come across that has a true co-op feel that is a good mix between Firefly meets space combat game.However, the new update has completely broken what is already challenging gameplay, even for the the most experienced of space sim pilots. The AI bots are now more useless than ever, and running into even the basic of battles means almost always certain death. You rarely get a chance to level anything on the ship now, and if you do the permadeath model means you're back to square one if you happen randomly into the wrong sector.Until the devs do a basic re-tweak of simple gameplay mechanics this game is not worth the Early Access dollars.

								Honestly I haven't played this game much, but that's because it isn't all that  fun. On the join server option, you either find trolls or extremely kids, who think its real life. On the host server option- well good luck. Hosting a server takes up a lot more RAM and tends to bug out your computer (I've got an i7, and I've been told that hosting does the same to many other computers. Maybe my opinion would change if I played it more- I know I like being aware of how the systems work (specifically hyper jumping and the sientist's terminal) but the game really doesn't do a whole lot explaining them to us newbies, leaving us clueless.

								I bought this game to try it out. Sadly the graphics just did not do it for me. I know it is an EA game perhaps in time the graphics will get better. I know space is empty but throw a few rock in there just to liven it up. Light up the ship interior so you can see without a flashlight. These are not hard things to do. To all of you reading this. If you are looking for something with graphics that match Ark or Space Engineers this is not the game for you. If you have a low end computer this might be a great game because you are so limited to what you can run.			"

								This game is a POS.  I can't believe I wasted $25 on it.  Yeah, I know it's an early access game and that comes with some issues, but everything about this game is bad.  Cool premise -- I've been looking for a good space co-op game for a while, but this isn't it.  The graphics look like a late '90s game.  The controls are clunky.  You get dropped into the game with no explanation of how to play, and no instructions.  Again I've been looking for a game just like this for a while, but nothing about it is enjoyable.  Maybe if better programmers were building it, or if it was farther along.  But don't waste your money.			"

								Incredibly simple and not worth the cost. Gameplay consists of very few and basic mechanics. Cooperation with friends is fun, but you quickly realize that there is no real progression and that you're stuck doing the same basic maneuvers over and over. There's only so many times I can jump and pilot around while my friend fires lazers. In the end, it just leaves you wishing you hadn't spent your cash. The graphics are overly simplified, the ships and components are incredibly basic, there is very little depth to each role and the landing party stuff is just downright useless.			"

								I spent 23 mins runing around my ship which I emersly enjoyed but this game has me at 50/50 on like and dislike and heres why.Like.the graphics are fairly good and not in your face nor so tacky and the size of the ship can keep you exploring and enjoying the surroundings as I went for the Stealth transport ship.There is a lot of detail in the creature comforts in the games ship and I can get to see my own feet hehe that is a happy moment from me hehe I know im strange.Dislike.This game has been made to force you to play with 4 other players and NOT even have the option to have NPC crew to fill in on the roles of the crew you dont have any real life players to fill in and this means YOU CANT even get to play let alone do ANYTHING other than run around your ship or fly it in a not very good flight screen view and the flight controles of the ship is lousy to say the least.If you dont have 4 friends with this game then id advise to not bother with this game but if you do happen to have 4 friends with this game then its a must buy.Im not being biest in any way shape or form im just being hounest and as time goes by and I get more feel of this game my RATE for this game will chop and change.I just hope the devs really do pay attention to the players as without them then the game is as good as a shopping mall with no filled shops.For the time being this is getting a thumbs down from myself.

Yet I go in, and I have 15 odd fps on the entry screen. What? I wouldn't expect such low fps in a game that isn't even as graphically appealing as things like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or even Team Fortress 2 frankly. I've tested this on my late 2014 mac, and on  a PC. For regular PC users who can undock there cores and force multithreading this game is great, enjoyable and fun.But for people on laptops, beware.

I do not regret my purchase.Here is my abridged oppinion of the game:It is good over all and development is steadily improving the game.Im a big fan of the artistic style, music, and the teamwork/exploration oriented gameplay.The community behind the game is also rather friendly and welcoming.My only big complaint is that there is no ability to make the player-character jump. (at least the last time I checked that is), instead you will require a jetpack which for some reason is only available on one of the ship classes, which limits the exploration you can do if you do not choose said ship.My other complaint is that Foxxy is no longer to be found anywhere. :cI keep coming back to this game after leaving it for several months. And every time I do I am pleasantly surprised by the new content.The crew AI is not very smart, and not easy to command either; however the last time I played they improved significantly and I expect them to get better in the future.Sadly I've yet to have the chance to play this game to the fullest as I've never had all 4 of my friends online and willing at the same time to play with. That one is on me however.Required perhipherals to play this game properly:More friends with the game than I have.A Discord server or simmilar and associated pehripherals (mics for everyone, etc.) "

								This is a good game with incredible potential and even how it is now its great. Look at other reviews for more details on the gameplay. But im really worried that this game is in beta and nearning release. It is in no way finished. They have the ships and most everything about them down, but its the other things that need help. The AI is awful, just go to any station and you'll see what I mean. Another issue is gunfights in this game, agaisnt humans or aliens on planets is incredibly bland. From the way you hold your gun, the sounds, general feel of the gun fights are really, really bad and could really use some help. I could go on for a while, but this game feels early alpha in some areas, and beta in others, the devs really need to do a lot of work. Make shooting better, improve AI, improve animations (walking and whatnot) improve player models and add a few more different types of guns on the ships. For 25 bucks its totally worth it though.

								The game that would result in someone getting FTL and Guns of Icarus into a bed together would be glorious.  Luckily, Leafy Games did it, and the result is glorious.  You can take control as one of five classes: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Engineer, and Weapons Specialist.  Each one has their own upgradable abilites that help them along their journey.  Each class is also extremely fun.  Even the Scientist, who does nothing but scan ships and deploy viruses, is an intense and satisfying class.Along with fun classes are the fun scenarios.  From battling ancient sentries to bringing someone a lost sandwhich, each scenario and quest is fun.  Each scenario is also very balanced.  The bosses feel hard, but will never induce rage.  Sentry drones are easy to take out, but they are more than a mere nuisance.  You will never get bored playing this game.Possibly the best part of the game is the community.  While their are some less than mature people playing (there have been ships named the H.M.S.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will always be greeted by friendly space trekkers willing to help you when they can.  This is the type of game where friendships are made.All in all, this is one of the best games I've played, even though it's in Early Access.The worst part about the game are the few bugs that will most certainly be fixed in the next update.

								Review is written during beta 4.2 NOV 2015Pros: Has classic space combat mechanics; Your weapons fire when the angle is appropriate and is charged and you have one shield that covers the entire ship. You also have a quantum shield that prevents the enemy from teleporting to your ship. The player(s) have to manage the energy distribution, control the amount of heat in the reactor to prevent a system failure, and use programs to debuff the enemy or remove debuffs.Cons: Default Unity shaders. Lacks quest; Classic fetch quest. Limited variety of firearms, they are all pistols. Limited vareity of components, each component has only 0-5 variants with only the level scaling up. Limited amount of opponents; You get to fight 5 special enemy ships and then the default ships. The AI is just godly stupid, it cannot tell when there is a wall between them and will try to shoot through walls. Everytime you load a gamesave, you have to respend your talent points and AI priority. Invisible items that show up on radar but you cannot see; And yes, I'm on the right floor. Alot of the planets just use the same map. Apparently, every ship uses the same computer architecture because viruses work on all of them; Even the infected.I wanted to stay neutral but Steam made me choose.			"

								I only have a few hours under my belt, but I like what I've seen so far.Interesting game concept, designed around teamwork. Each player having their own role to perform makes everyone feel useful, to an extent. Some jobs require more attention than others, such as pilot or engineer. Obviously the game needs more content, but it is still early access, so it will come. One thing I WOULD like to see implemented though, is some sort of a job queueing system. Some players will obviously be more comfortable doing a certain role (I've only been a Scientist so far) And joining games is rolling the dice, because you're probably not going to end up in the role you would like, which can make it more difficult to gel with a new team. So it would be nice if there was a way to queue as a scientist, or pilot etc, and be shown a list of games where that role is needed.			"

								Years ago I dreamed up a nice little concept for a game. A difficult co-op sci-fi FTL-like FPS. Fast forward a while and this game pops out of nowhere. I played the game on my own with bots and had a fun time, but I was waiting to write a review until I'd played the multiplayer with friends, since the game IS all about cooperation and teamwork and that bullocks.When I eventually did play with a friend, we had so much fun getting blown up or turned into swiss cheese by enemy crews. What's even better is that that was before we even discovered you could explore planets!-PROS--A completely cooperative game, no competitive modes. This might be a con for some people, I don't mind it though.-A vast, dangerous galaxy to explore with six different factions (Not including the Infection)-Missions, albeit not randomly generated ones, that can sometimes end up being more of an adventure than you originally expected.-Procedurally generated planets with different hazards, such as an acidic atmosphere, or a lack of oxygen.-Multiple ships to choose from with different interiors, layouts, and specs.-CONS--The planets are sometimes disappointingly small, and can be glitchy. It IS early access however, so what did you expect?-It isn't exactly overflowing with content. It is still VERY entertaining, even if you're only playing with one other person, so it makes up for it.-While I don't mind the clean, almost cell shaded look of the equipment and ships-- Infact I think some of the planets I've seen have even made me go ""That's really pretty!""-- But the people look hideous. They're like tall, chubby space-dwarves.All in all, I'd recommend this game if you have friends, and even if you don't. You're missing out if you don't at least play on a public game. Careful though, I hear there's the rare troll that comes around and screws you and your crew over.-Things I, and many other people, would like to see in the future--Diplomacy! I'm sure they already have this planned in the future, what with the inclusion of a comms tab, but it still needs to be said (For the billionth time). Perhaps even a special talent for the captain that gives a bonus to diplomacy checks?-Larger ships. More vessels like the very popular Roland. Large and spacey, yet somewhat homely.-More of a variety of alien lifeforms. Fun things that can pose an actual threat in the long run, something like the creatures in the Thing, or some sort of Xenomorph-like alien parasite (If you've played the game, you thought about that at least once while holding a scanner).-Higher 'Level' planets. Planets that would be too inhospitibal for the average exosuit, requiring special upgrades to the suits.			"

								We arrive at the Citadel, a broken thing I call home, skeleton crew staffed to conduct extrasolar missions for our federation, retrieving and eliminating mostly. We hunt fugitives, set a mapped path, travel through star systems, asteroids, and planets. Bumping hulls with mass relays, xeno-bio ships, drones and enemy factions. Our mission? To retrieve lost medical supplies, save scientists and possibly encounter hostile space vessels. This is Pulsar, a game about adventures in space, where the game is buggy (read: indev alpha) but updates are plenty, and features more fulfilling than any game that you will find in this specific category of coop star-(word) film simulator. It's got an unexplainable charm of how close it mimics the star-(worded) films, it's not an exact copy of a specific one and it doesn't intend to be, but the exploration feels like star-trek TNG to me (small crew and warp drives). Every player has a role in a crew of five, some interact more with the ingame hologram HUD(s), unifying controls for managing the ship together, but separated only by distance from each role's cubicles.The captains, Dungeon Master… err, Creative Director, for the non-DnD nerds. He/she makes or breaks the adventure because of currency distribution, ship upgrades and mapped missions are all done by this role, directly impacting all other players’ experiences. The weapons specialist, novice of left mouse buttons, and experienced to QTEs (Quick Time Events), where the shot for the missile must be struck by beam weapons first to lower their shield, so the next immediate hit can directly impact their hull, bypassing their shield regeneration. The scientist is a part time script-kitty, medic, away-team lead, and first-strike team point-man. Scientists have the most utility aside from the captain.The engineer, an expert in duct-tape usage and juggling, must allocate the ship's power at its best or worse conditions, or we all explode and die.And the pilot, must dodge missiles, maneuver to mitigate damage in combat, belly up = bad, belly down = good.Best experienced with VOIP, intoxicants, video recording program, and popcorn.

It is the most immersive space game I have played yet, just the act of interfacing with the hip through the displays is a gamechanger.  When you have 5 of your friends on T.S. and you crew a ship, it all just comes alive, your role starts to come out almost naturally.  I have played it quite a bit and usually play as the engineer as it is one of the most active roles.  The grapgics arent the best, but this is one of those games where gamplay trumphs graphics.10/10			"

One thing I really enjoyed about this game more than anything itself was how most of the online groups are heavy on RP so you can REALLY get into the game which really makes its fun.Only thing I disliked about it was how your spaceship is running a hardcore mode all the time if you lose your ship you start the whole game over. That kind of sucks but I understand the reason behind it. All things aside though this looks to have a promising future.			"

The community is small but I haven't had a problem finding a friendly crew whenever I've looked. It feels like a very good game if you have a small group of friends that like to play games together.+Several ships to start with or capture (each with a unique internal setup)+Plenty of ship upgrades to loot or buy and configure your ship to your liking+Large map offers enough space to explore and have an extended adventure+Ship to ship combat feels very good and involves all roles+boarding enemy ships is very cool feature+-Crew Bots are okay enough to play solo till you get a feel for the game, but need work to allow much more-FPS combat feels barebones and not satisfying at the moment, but it works-Planet maps (I've seen so far) are rather small and empty feeling-Game is yet to be optimized, so performance issues at higher video settings were very noticableI put this with Early Access games that are complete enough to be worth playing now even if further development is slow/doesn't happen (though I hope it does). This game fits a uique enough niche that I can overlook it's few flaws.			"

								So far so good.  Still learning since this is a game that tried to make every position important, there is a lot to absorb.  So far I have spent most of my time in the engineering and science positions, both support roles that weren't critical for the ships I was on but were still important.  I could see how in a really competitive combat situation every position would be taxed, however you would also need great communication and a knowledgeable captain to pull it all together.  If you don't find a good teacher the first time out, no sweat.  Just keep trying because they are out there and they will allow you to really take advantage of what the game has to offer. "

If you take the time to read t hrough their plans for the game, it's hard not to be excited for it.  I have full confidence they will deliver as well because they have delivered an excellent beta already and are going through with their promises, one updated at a time. "

Early Access Review
								Pulsar is unlike any other co-op game I've ever played, since everyone's experience is their own.I learned how to play Engineer first just in case I wanted to kill my crew for the heck of it.I joined a crew that was seemingly a tiny bit dysfunctional. Decided ""hey, Im gonna screw these guys over""Acting normal and such when I hear burning. Go to investigate. Entire life support room is on fire. I think nothing of it and put it out and repair the system.Keep plotting to kill crew until I be good guy again when the core is on fire. Think nothing of it since we just got out of combat.Another system catches on fire. Go to put it out. See our ten-year-old weapons officer walk away from the fire. Get suspicious. Tell no one.Going on our merry way when suddenly ship power goes out. Go to reboot system. Weapons officer is responsible. Captain was right about suspicions. Decide to not screw over crew.Later, I'm learning how to be capitan on my own ship, the Damrey.Sceince guy with no mic joins and is probably a noob, and is acting overly cheery.Going along when power goes out. Engie reboots it.Noob science is obvious culprit when he turns it off again and runs to captain's chair when we all go investigate.Tell science if he wants to get kicked he should do it again. He does it again.After this crew I got a drunk pilot and a weapons officer who played edgy music through his mic.			"

Early Access Review
								So... Another early access.People have described this by using references to other games, but I think that's unfair. It is a game in it's own right, I'll try to explain what it's about. If anything, playing this game feels like watching episodes of Star trek TOS and those types of references are readily used by players. Be my redshirt for a day.You play as one out of five crewmen, each have their own class with unique talents (skills) that can be leveled up. The crew share level, which is a nice feature and works well for this co op game. You start of with an under powered ship, warp around to different sectors to engage enemies, navigate minefields, send away teams to planets and just do that whole trek thing. You can also get missions from NPC's on outposts.So, if you like these things, maybe this is for you. I say maybe, because we are currently at beta 3 and the game is severily lacking in game content: the planets have very limited areas, model animations are missing, loads of enemies and locations missing and so on. There's not a whole lot to do yet.That said, I like the premise and the game mechanics presented so far. The development team, although small, find the time to reply to forum posts (even on Steam!), fix issues and consider suggestions. If AAA-studios had HALF the customer service these guys do the gaming industry would be SO much better. If you are tired of buying early access games that are broken, has no dev communication and take forever to get updates, you might actually find that Leafy games is a fresh breath of air.It's Unity 5, so it works pretty well on Linux. There are some optimization issues, but this early in development one cannot expect optimized graphics. In spite of being part of the Unity ghetto, Leafy games showcases that Unity games doesn't have to be unstable, GPU slaughtering beasts of C# nonsense. In particular on the Linuxes!EDIT: there is one feature missing that everyone has been talking about, it is also probably the hardest thing to do. Right now it has network multiplayer, but only for up to 5 people of the crew and only one player ship per server. If we could get multiple player controller ships on the same server it would be amazing!			"

								Great game highly recommended. Really intruiging.Pros:Roleplaying is actually fun... You feel a sense of comraderie exploring new planets and going through things together.Small communication like this:""Captain: Align the ship, pilot.Pilot: Aye aye, captain.Captain: Prepare to warp, engineer.Engineer: Warp ready, sir.Captain"" Warp now.""MultiplayerFun conceptUpgradesBoardingPlanetsReally cool idea... Imagine if they had this format for star-citizen...Cons:In developmentBugs - MouseLack of content, but enough to pay to support the gameGraphics... The graphics don't matter to me that much, but it would be nice if it looked shinier... Probably due to the unity 3D enginePerformanceOverall, one of the few games I've played in a long time that I was excited to play when I got home. I think the real spark of this game is exploring. Not only exploring, but exploring TOGETHER, with your YOUR CREW. Build upon this, and there won't be any other game out there like it. Sure you have artemis, but this game executed much better.Fin "

Everyone who liked or loves the romanance of space expedition or simply likes Stark Trek should give it a try.I know very little about the TV Series, but it doesnt matter. This game captured my heart instancely. You have to interact with your fellow players in so many ways that it will always lead to the funniest situation. This game has to be played with friends and voicechat! (Or simply find a crew on the official Pulsar:LC TS Server) "

								If you've played Faster Than Light (FTL), then you MAY enjoy PULSAR.This game should be played with at least one or two other people.  You start off picking a ship.  After that the host (I think) has to choose Captain out of the 5 classes.  The captain can bring up the map, chart a course through the large and extensive universe.  The ship itself has shields, which protect the hull until the shields take enough damage for the enemy ships to deal damage to your hull, which once the hull reaches zero, your ship explodes and either you reload, or start a new ship.  Each class has a station, or their own in-game computer screen that you stand at.  There are many rooms in the ship, and each of the ship's systems are connected to the 4 main systems.  Science, Engineering, Weapons, Life Support.  Those are the 4 systems you must protect.  If they get damaged enough, a fire starts in the room that you have to put out with extinguishers, then repair the system before the fire starts again.There are missions that you can complete which give you credits and fame.  I spend the credits on replacing ship systems with better ones from repair stations located sparingly throughout the solar system.There are factions.  The infested I have never had the pleasure of meeting but I have heard of them.  Some sort of alien race that create organic or living ships.  There are other neutral or hostile factions I have either not met or have had nothing to do with as of yet.  If you play with a group of friends, you WILL have fun with this game.  Play alone, and it gets rather boring.  The UI could use some work, and more game content would be welcome.  Controller support needs to improve, which it has, but I feel like more customization should be had.  I tried using all the buttons on my xbox 360 controller and I was unable to use the bumpers, which isn't that big a deal.  I play the game mostly with mouse and keyboard unless I'm flying the ship.I would rate this game 9/10.  It's in BETA now so when they fully finish this game, it will be awesome - and it's already really fun.  They plan to come out with much more, such as crafting items and more talents for each class.			"

								I have played very little of this game (on my computer, at least. I originally played it at a friend's house). Nothing is more satisfying than charging a warp drive, blasting to another sector, getting into a skirmish, then going down to the surface of a planet to loot and explore. I don't need to say much more but if you like sci-fi, this game is for you.Only downside is performance - my computer obviously isn't much, but it works just fine for me on an AMD but occassionally has *MINOR* lag spikes.

Early Access Review
								This game is on the right track, trying to capture the experience of being at the helm as a Captain or one of the other 4 roles (engineer, weapons officer, scientist, pilot) however I feel it came out half-baked and that the devs should have waited a bit longer.Before I begin, take note that I do not care if your game is early access, alpha, beta, testing phase. As soon as you open the door to recieve money, you are gonna get reviewed properly, no cookie points for releasing unfinished games! This has become bad practice...I will start with what I feel was ""the bad"" in my opinion:- The game's single player doesn't really exist. (AI is too troublesome to micro manage) Joining other players with random people invites alot of trolling and incompetant Captains.- The AI is awful and has odd behaviors, for example, teleporting in combat, unable to perform duties properly when set,get stuck all over the place in the ship if they do try to move around in a fight.- The first person shooter portion is bad, hit boxes  are small, don't try to go for limbs or headshots, keep all shots in the center of the target. (otherwise just very basic point and click)- Game already has people cheating, joined one with a Captain who was giving himself credits to buy the best upgrades.""The good"" luckily, is REALLY good and is keeping this game afloat and on people's radar.- Playing this game with friends on Comms is very rewarding, especially if you roleplay it out a bit.- This is a niche game and will shine a light on a genre that has alot of potential to be done right- The ship's are the star of this show with tons of functionality! Controlling power to weapons, shields, and various departments, all while controlling your coolant to keep your core under control, issuing orders to your crew or blasting the enemy with your all powerful main cannons and even nukes!- Ability to board and sabotage the enemy vessels from the inside and take over the ship for your own.- Going planetside to explore and complete various missions (all though the planets need alot of work, but it does help to have them rather then not have them at all).My score: 6 / 10 - Recommended, however I would wait for a sale or really think about who you can play this with. You can get your moneys worth if you got friends who are really into it and might play it for a week or so, then patiently see if the devs are gonna add more.Just like many early access games, this has ALOT of potential, however I find myself saying that alot, only to be disapointed, so I hope this game can pull it together and make something truely authentic to its genre! Hope this helps you with your decision! I made a video below for my review if you want to see more!

Things I hope to see:- custom things to add around the ship and interact with (they have stoves, lockers, beds, lights)- The devs already expressed no PvP content, but I still have my hopes they reconsider.- Better random encounters, all AI just wanna fight you.- Something to roleplay out a interaction with enemy pirates, a screen to pull up and hail each other would be EPIC.

Early Access Review
								Years ago I dreamed up a nice little concept for a game. A difficult co-op sci-fi FTL-like FPS. Fast forward a while and this game pops out of nowhere. I played the game on my own with bots and had a fun time, but I was waiting to write a review until I'd played the multiplayer with friends, since the game IS all about cooperation and teamwork and that bullocks.When I eventually did play with a friend, we had so much fun getting blown up or turned into swiss cheese by enemy crews. What's even better is that that was before we even discovered you could explore planets!-PROS--A completely cooperative game, no competitive modes. This might be a con for some people, I don't mind it though.-A vast, dangerous galaxy to explore with six different factions (Not including the Infection)-Missions, albeit not randomly generated ones, that can sometimes end up being more of an adventure than you originally expected.-Procedurally generated planets with different hazards, such as an acidic atmosphere, or a lack of oxygen.-Multiple ships to choose from with different interiors, layouts, and specs.-CONS--The planets are sometimes disappointingly small, and can be glitchy. It IS early access however, so what did you expect?-It isn't exactly overflowing with content. It is still VERY entertaining, even if you're only playing with one other person, so it makes up for it.-While I don't mind the clean, almost cell shaded look of the equipment and ships-- Infact I think some of the planets I've seen have even made me go ""That's really pretty!""-- But the people look hideous. They're like tall, chubby space-dwarves.All in all, I'd recommend this game if you have friends, and even if you don't. You're missing out if you don't at least play on a public game. Careful though, I hear there's the rare troll that comes around and screws you and your crew over.-Things I, and many other people, would like to see in the future--Diplomacy! I'm sure they already have this planned in the future, what with the inclusion of a comms tab, but it still needs to be said (For the billionth time). Perhaps even a special talent for the captain that gives a bonus to diplomacy checks?-Larger ships. More vessels like the very popular Roland. Large and spacey, yet somewhat homely.-More of a variety of alien lifeforms. Fun things that can pose an actual threat in the long run, something like the creatures in the Thing, or some sort of Xenomorph-like alien parasite (If you've played the game, you thought about that at least once while holding a scanner).-Higher 'Level' planets. Planets that would be too inhospitibal for the average exosuit, requiring special upgrades to the suits.			"

They are adding content at a quick rate for early access games and it has only been getting better. It is one of those games that really shines when played with friends. The combat is the main aspect with having to work together and everyone plays a part. They have also added places to explore, missions. and more enemies. Heck you can even board an enemy ship and fight dirty.			"

								Review is written during beta 4.2 NOV 2015Pros: Has classic space combat mechanics; Your weapons fire when the angle is appropriate and is charged and you have one shield that covers the entire ship. You also have a quantum shield that prevents the enemy from teleporting to your ship. The player(s) have to manage the energy distribution, control the amount of heat in the reactor to prevent a system failure, and use programs to debuff the enemy or remove debuffs.Cons: Default Unity shaders. Lacks quest; Classic fetch quest. Limited variety of firearms, they are all pistols. Limited vareity of components, each component has only 0-5 variants with only the level scaling up. Limited amount of opponents; You get to fight 5 special enemy ships and then the default ships. The AI is just godly stupid, it cannot tell when there is a wall between them and will try to shoot through walls. Everytime you load a gamesave, you have to respend your talent points and AI priority. Invisible items that show up on radar but you cannot see; And yes, I'm on the right floor. Alot of the planets just use the same map. Apparently, every ship uses the same computer architecture because viruses work on all of them; Even the infected.I wanted to stay neutral but Steam made me choose.			"

								This is a very enjoyable team game.It's ambitious in scope and the concept is excellent. The execution of the concept is also of a very high standard. I went on with a friend and we were joined by another guy where we happily spent about 8 hours straight in this game. Character, crew and ship progression are all in good order and the overall gameplay is solid. The environments are good and seem reasonably varied. My friend and I have talked about wanting a game like this for years now and are happy to see that this one is ticking many boxes.A very high standard of an Early Access title and one that other Early Access developers would do well to measure their own projects by.I would happily advise people to buy this game or at least keep it on your wishlist and track it's progress. It's a great concept, well excuted.			"

								Read the game's description to find out what this game is about.There is enough content to legitimately play this game but it will run out quickly. The developers have written they plan on adding a lot more content once they have finished the basic game structure.The ship roles need a little bit of work. (E.g. The captain can actually become virtually useless, since he is the one with the least information out of all the crew members at his disposal) I can forgive this since the game still isn't fully fleshed out. The only roles I believe to be ~""feature complete""~ are the pilot and the engineer.Personal combat is kind of terrible. There's little to it. Click to fire your weapon, but enemies will also be firing their weapons instantaneously. If you've played Sven Co-op (Half-Life Mod) this is the best description of how the combat plays out. It is mostly shooting, dying, and coming back to finish them off.Do not buy this game to play with people you do not know.If you (and your friends) can overlook the above points, this game is worth purchasing!

								Character graphics, interior ship design, planet design -think minecraft. Space graphics leaves you wanting more but some asteroids are great looking with massive crystal structures.Computer AI is wonky at best.Would still buy again-YES!!!!!!!!The idea behind a multi crew ship game has been wanted for awhile and with the right group of people playing their roles it's a blast. Everyone is at the mercy of the other person preforming their job well so when it all comes together to overcome a tough opponent it feels nice seeing teamwork prevail when so many games these days are about solo play.I don't expect too much from this game since it already does what I want in generating a real team based game. Really hope this game does well and runs  its course without over complicating things.			"

								I've downloaded this game first via some strange ways (also know as not-very-legal-versions). I wanted to try before buy, because I've problems with horror/suspense games (I was afraid this game was, but isn't not!).Imagine Star Trek, without the Hollywood things. This is PULSAR. You can control your own ship, have friends or meet someone to help with your ship, land in planets to explore or complete missions (now you can research things from items you find in the planet).PROS:- The game is really fun.- The graphic is not heavy but it's cool.- The game dynamic is amazing, a lot of things to do, etc.- Is a randomly-generated universe.- A lot of people are noobie-friendly. Is not like the majority of multiplayer games who don't care about the newbies. I like it, since I'm always a newbie!CONS:- A mini-map inside a ship, like the carrier, will be great (really - it's huge and I usually get lost).- It's in beta, so: bugs.- There is a little big of lag.- It would be great to have more team in the ship (up to 10 probably? Specially for ships with more than 1 gun).- Some ships are extremely DARK. - Some people are bad and will damage your ship just because they can and nobody will know who the person was, except if caught in the act. A log system for the captain will be great.			"

								With the right friends, this game really does seem like your own personal episode of Firefly or Star Trek.  So, here's my take on this game.The Captain ordered us to look for security drones.  We spent about 30 minutes on a search and destroy until we needed to head back and repair the hull.  I am the pilot and yes, I'm a girl.  My first attempt at docking with the repair station was ...sporty.  If you've ever seen the movie galaxy quest then you will have a good idea of what it's like to fit the destroyer into a repair station docking bay.  Our first away mission resulted in our captain yelling ""Oh sh*t!"" and then promptly dying.  When asked what killed him, he said something ""Ambiguous"" and told us to head right when we exited the terraforming station.  I headed right and immediately died by the ""Ambiguous"" hostile who seemed intent on shoving a plasma cannon up my posterior.  I was very happy that someone had remembered to turn on the respawning platform on board the ship.  Except for the need to change my uniform, I was ready to beam back to the planet surface and return the favor.  This game is all about friends and teamwork.  The better your team, the more fun you will have.  I wasn't happy with the price tag considering the state it's currently in but if you play this with a group of people who have a good sense of humor and a love for space operas, you will never regret the purchase.  I love this game and I see only good things to come because it's only going to get better from here.   "

								I have only played this game once so far, but this particular session lasted around 2 hours.The game is by far the most immersive one I have ever played. Whichever class you choose, you ""hop into"" it very quickly. As a weapons specialist, I found myself almost subconsciously relaying targetting info, turret charge, misle lock on progress et cetera to other crew members just after first few minutes of manning the post. Same went for other people, they were reclutant at first but later, especially while in combat, the voice chat resembled what you can hear in any kind of movie or game involving spaceship fights.The game could use some polishing here and there, and of course more content, but overall it's really good. Even better if you ever dreamed to play as a part of spaceship crew.Pros : -Immersion.-Every station is straight-forward, you can get a grasp of your role really quickly.-Every screen is interactive, and you perform your tasks through them - it increases the immersion further.Cons : -The animations feel... clunky at times. I understand those are probably engine limited though.-Some of the enemies lack visual indication of their attacks so you could possibly dodge them or at least see that you're getting hit (magma slugs ._.), and in my opinion they're way too strong.

I wish we could have mining since there are so many useless asteroids it would be cool if you could teleport down to them and mine the crystals in them for money. I also would like it if you could walk out into space. Also adding more ship components and maybe some more upgrades.

								This game was incredibly fun when I first got it. It feels like the most complete promise on a 'Star Trek' game that has ever been made. Get together with 4 friends, each of you assume a position of an officer on your own starship: Captain, Pilot, Tactical Officer, Science Officer, and Engineer and go explore the galaxy. Each of these positions feels fun, accurate, and well put together. It's absolutely fantastic. Over and over again the community said, ""man this game would be awesome in VR."" So the devs released it in VR as a free update, and it is. I can't recommend this game enough. Tl;Dr: The best Star Trek game that's ever been made doesn't have the Star Trek IP.			"

								This fulfills my need for Star CitizenImagine Star Trek, Elite Dangerous and Firefly had a dangerous unprotected orgy and both Star Trek and Firefly came inside Elite Dangerous and 9 months later there is a baby. The baby grows up to look simple, but has the personality traits of his parents he never knew. Alone and forgotten he works to one day be better than his parents and make them proud enough to aknowledge him. Pulsar is that child. Fun comparisons aside, this game is fun. In fact, it has been the most fun 5 hour game session ive played in an indie game. 5 of my friends listening to me bark orders while we do, i dunno, whatever we can because we have no idea what we are doing. This game has incredible potential and im excited to see where it goes. I was hoping they add more ships in with more slots for say 2 engineers or 2 scientists but i doubt it will happen.

								So, I just picked this game up for ♥♥♥♥♥ and gigs, saw it had a good review and decided why not? So far this has been a GREAT decision; the atmosphere is incredible. You start with a 5 man crew, you can essentially choose which class you wanna be ot of the five and you go out and explore what seems like thousands of locations. You get to level up perks, upgrade your ship and equipment, every planet you encounter has been explorable so far that i've seen. It's a little overwhelming when you first start, but you'll get the hang of it after a while, things can be explained in the Game Manual or a player guide if you need it.			"

								The game puts you into a role on a starship you can move around on and operate controls. The game also has the ability to teleport off ship to board or land on planets. It is very much a game I was looking for concept wise.Currently the missions feel somewhat repetitive and there are down times when you are just kind of hanging out on your ship like during warp jumps. The game has support for flight sticks but it doesn't support it very well. Not all directions or orientations are supported and for some reason you pilot the ship by using a camera aimed at the ships rear thrusters. It is so bad I can't be a pilot.It is a lot of fun when you boarding a ship or in combat.			"

								Fantastic game, but needs more types of missions and a lot of polish. Diplomacy, escort, aid, scouting, and anomaly investigation missions would keep things spiced up. Engineer could possibly have some kind of mini-game dealing with coolant and power routing. Scientist could have more control over atmospherics in the ship, more in-depth shield modulating, and help with translating comms. Captain's chairs should have direct and immediate access to all ship information. UIs could be greatly improved. Perhaps add another shiphand for security vs boarding as well as another hand on the guns. AI is just awful. Bots are nearly worthless and the control scheme set up for them is tedious to refine to get them to work correctly. Otherwise, it's going in a fantastic direction and I highly reccomend it. It has a very good value vs time.			"

Early Access Review
								If you enjoy good co-operative gameplay and aren't obsessed with cutting-edge graphics, this game might just be your thing. I was quite disappointed when the developers of Star Trek Online said they'd cut multi-crewed ships from the feature list...thankfully Pulsar: Lost Colony delivers where STO dropped the ball. The developers at Leafy Games have figured out *exactly* the game I've always wanted to play: Star Trek meets Artemis meets FTL meets Skyrim in space. The sheer amount of detail they've squeezed into this (still work-in-progress) game is pretty astonishing. For example, in a recent nail-biter space battle I cut power to most of the ship's systems to help our reactor to cool down. After we miraculously survived, we noticed our graphics had all gone grayscale...I'd forgotten to restore power to life support and we were slowly suffocating. :) This game is full of little touches like that.Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there's real depth in this gameplay. When I play, I feel I'm living a Star Trek episode. When things go pear-shaped in a battle (such as having to deal with a ship overheat AND boarders beaming in), it can get extremely exciting.While this game isn't finished, what's there is really fun. It lacks a tutorial but there is an in-game manual which you can also find on the company's website. If you don't mind figuring stuff out and you have a couple friends on TeamSpeak, I think you will have a lot of fun playing Pulsar: Lost Colony.			"

								The game that would result in someone getting FTL and Guns of Icarus into a bed together would be glorious.  Luckily, Leafy Games did it, and the result is glorious.  You can take control as one of five classes: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Engineer, and Weapons Specialist.  Each one has their own upgradable abilites that help them along their journey.  Each class is also extremely fun.  Even the Scientist, who does nothing but scan ships and deploy viruses, is an intense and satisfying class.Along with fun classes are the fun scenarios.  From battling ancient sentries to bringing someone a lost sandwhich, each scenario and quest is fun.  Each scenario is also very balanced.  The bosses feel hard, but will never induce rage.  Sentry drones are easy to take out, but they are more than a mere nuisance.  You will never get bored playing this game.Possibly the best part of the game is the community.  While their are some less than mature people playing (there have been ships named the H.M.S.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will always be greeted by friendly space trekkers willing to help you when they can.  This is the type of game where friendships are made.All in all, this is one of the best games I've played, even though it's in Early Access.The worst part about the game are the few bugs that will most certainly be fixed in the next update.

I am excited when it actually releases and hopes leafy games takes this concept to the next level eventually with bigger multiplayer support. Several shipped crews in the same galaxy might be fun.

Early Access Review
								For all of you folks who enjoy space as much as I do, this game is a nice way to explore it. Here is the views of it and what I think of it (please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access, it is being improved as we speak and/or read).First of all, this game is a multiplayer game where you can play with friends or random people online. You are a crew aboard one of many ships to explore the vast space. Each crew member is assigned a post to fulfill. This may sound lame, but it is quite awesome. The captain gives orders, assigns missions, gives pay for the crew to use on tools and food (for healing). The pilot, well, pilots the ship (this job is my favorite, especially when fighting other ships). The engineer repairs the ship and puts out fire. He can also remove the core (not recommended unless facing death). The scientist observes the ship's status and reports any problems to the engineer. The weapon specialist can shoot the guns. Now, each crew member can do any of these roles whenever they feel like it. However, they can upgrade their talents for their specific job.Now, as of right now, all you can do in this game is to attack enemy ships (you can teleport to their ship if it is damaged enough to have its shield down and kill the crew repeatedly until you claim the ship for your own and use it), land on planets and kill creatures that try to kill you, accept quests and do them, and explore the world. However, as I previously stated, this game is in Early Access, and it will continue to improve. There are many mysteries in this game. For example, I found a random ship that was dead floating in space. When I teleported onto it (yes, you have a teleporter you use to get to the planets and other ships), I found out that it was another ship you could decide to use, and it was full of snow. It was dead, so we (my crew and I) had to leave it, but this was the only time I saw it.Two more things. First, if your ship explodes, your crew and you die. You have to restart. I like this feature. It makes you more cautious, which this game is supposed to make you feel. You need to play your role as if you are there. And finally, there is a manual for the game you can use to check up more on the game. Thanks for your time.			"

								This game is in no way complete, but that doesn't detract from the fun it provides in its current beta state. Alone you can maybe play this game for around 2 hours before running out of missions and 5 hours before you realise just how little this game has to keep you preoccupied without making your own goals. I personally stop playing after the fourth hour only comming back for an extra 5-10 minutes to check out the updates. The rest was playing with my friends, and thats where this game shines the most. while single player has you locked in as captain only unable to change multiplayer lets you play around with the other classes adding some variety. Is the game worth buying as it is now? if you plan to play alone then absolutly not, with friends? maybe when it's on sale, otherwise wait for a future update with the speed they're pumping out updates it shouldn't take more than 2 years before it's well worth the full price.

You start with a 5 man crew, you can essentially choose which class you wanna be ot of the five and you go out and explore what seems like thousands of locations. You get to level up perks, upgrade your ship and equipment, every planet you encounter has been explorable so far that i've seen. It's a little overwhelming when you first start, but you'll get the hang of it after a while, things can be explained in the Game Manual or a player guide if you need it.			"

								The game puts you into a role on a starship you can move around on and operate controls. The game also has the ability to teleport off ship to board or land on planets. It is very much a game I was looking for concept wise.Currently the missions feel somewhat repetitive and there are down times when you are just kind of hanging out on your ship like during warp jumps. The game has support for flight sticks but it doesn't support it very well. Not all directions or orientations are supported and for some reason you pilot the ship by using a camera aimed at the ships rear thrusters. It is so bad I can't be a pilot.It is a lot of fun when you boarding a ship or in combat.			"

								This fulfills my need for Star CitizenImagine Star Trek, Elite Dangerous and Firefly had a dangerous unprotected orgy and both Star Trek and Firefly came inside Elite Dangerous and 9 months later there is a baby. The baby grows up to look simple, but has the personality traits of his parents he never knew. Alone and forgotten he works to one day be better than his parents and make them proud enough to aknowledge him. Pulsar is that child. Fun comparisons aside, this game is fun. In fact, it has been the most fun 5 hour game session ive played in an indie game. 5 of my friends listening to me bark orders while we do, i dunno, whatever we can because we have no idea what we are doing. This game has incredible potential and im excited to see where it goes. I was hoping they add more ships in with more slots for say 2 engineers or 2 scientists but i doubt it will happen.

								Pulsar, is a great game with a great idea to it's name. It's mechanics are great, allowing you to fly around your spaceship, fire weapons, explore planets, and several other things. What makes this game even greater is mutltiplayer. It is so much easier to put hours and hours into this game, when you play with lots of friends. Even if you don't have friends to play with, there is also a great online community to go out and explore.There are somethings I don't like about the game however. One of the big things, is that the game feels unfinished. On planets there is not much to do and out in space all you really can do is fight ships. There are also several bugs with the Ai, and occasionaly other things.Besides some of these, which I believe will be worked out over time, the game is great. I specificaly bought this to play FTL, but in 3D and this game gave me exactly that!			"

Pulsar is only when the players have just started so theres more things to do but when you play on a server that has an OP ship things will start getting boring since the ships components are so high lvl that the crew members become less and less activeI would still recommend this game for everyone to try it out.

								The game does lack alot of content it could have but overall is a really fun game. The planets are tiny and rather repetitive, the boarding can often times result in the ship you are comandeering being blown up in the process and your missiles can often times turn allies into enemies because of the AOE.Understanding that the game is in Beta there is alot of content either not yet added or not yet optimized. I've often been subject to the game lagging a little in shops or had audio glitches. Sometimes you feel like there just aren't enough people to properly man the ship, like having 3 turrets but really only have 2 people who can man them permanently but only if the captain fills in rather than doing his trademark chair warming.I do recommend the game though even despite my review of it seems negative, really I'm simply warning what you should be expecting as of Beta 7.2.

								So, I just picked this game up for ♥♥♥♥♥ and gigs, saw it had a good review and decided why not? So far this has been a GREAT decision; the atmosphere is incredible. You start with a 5 man crew, you can essentially choose which class you wanna be ot of the five and you go out and explore what seems like thousands of locations. You get to level up perks, upgrade your ship and equipment, every planet you encounter has been explorable so far that i've seen. It's a little overwhelming when you first start, but you'll get the hang of it after a while, things can be explained in the Game Manual or a player guide if you need it.			"

								The game puts you into a role on a starship you can move around on and operate controls. The game also has the ability to teleport off ship to board or land on planets. It is very much a game I was looking for concept wise.Currently the missions feel somewhat repetitive and there are down times when you are just kind of hanging out on your ship like during warp jumps. The game has support for flight sticks but it doesn't support it very well. Not all directions or orientations are supported and for some reason you pilot the ship by using a camera aimed at the ships rear thrusters. It is so bad I can't be a pilot.It is a lot of fun when you boarding a ship or in combat.			"

								This fulfills my need for Star CitizenImagine Star Trek, Elite Dangerous and Firefly had a dangerous unprotected orgy and both Star Trek and Firefly came inside Elite Dangerous and 9 months later there is a baby. The baby grows up to look simple, but has the personality traits of his parents he never knew. Alone and forgotten he works to one day be better than his parents and make them proud enough to aknowledge him. Pulsar is that child. Fun comparisons aside, this game is fun. In fact, it has been the most fun 5 hour game session ive played in an indie game. 5 of my friends listening to me bark orders while we do, i dunno, whatever we can because we have no idea what we are doing. This game has incredible potential and im excited to see where it goes. I was hoping they add more ships in with more slots for say 2 engineers or 2 scientists but i doubt it will happen. This game is fun as it is, and look forward to its future			"

								We arrive at the Citadel, a broken thing I call home, skeleton crew staffed to conduct extrasolar missions for our federation, retrieving and eliminating mostly. We hunt fugitives, set a mapped path, travel through star systems, asteroids, and planets. Bumping hulls with mass relays, xeno-bio ships, drones and enemy factions. Our mission? To retrieve lost medical supplies, save scientists and possibly encounter hostile space vessels. This is Pulsar, a game about adventures in space, where the game is buggy (read: indev alpha) but updates are plenty, and features more fulfilling than any game that you will find in this specific category of coop star-(word) film simulator. It's got an unexplainable charm of how close it mimics the star-(worded) films, it's not an exact copy of a specific one and it doesn't intend to be, but the exploration feels like star-trek TNG to me (small crew and warp drives). Every player has a role in a crew of five, some interact more with the ingame hologram HUD(s), unifying controls for managing the ship together, but separated only by distance from each role's cubicles.The captains, Dungeon Master… err, Creative Director, for the non-DnD nerds. He/she makes or breaks the adventure because of currency distribution, ship upgrades and mapped missions are all done by this role, directly impacting all other players’ experiences. The weapons specialist, novice of left mouse buttons, and experienced to QTEs (Quick Time Events), where the shot for the missile must be struck by beam weapons first to lower their shield, so the next immediate hit can directly impact their hull, bypassing their shield regeneration. The scientist is a part time script-kitty, medic, away-team lead, and first-strike team point-man. Scientists have the most utility aside from the captain.The engineer, an expert in duct-tape usage and juggling, must allocate the ship's power at its best or worse conditions, or we all explode and die.And the pilot, must dodge missiles, maneuver to mitigate damage in combat, belly up = bad, belly down = good.Best experienced with VOIP, intoxicants, video recording program, and popcorn.

								WARNING: If your ready to have to put up with role-play captains who won't let you use a fire extinguisher for no reason other than it doesn't fit roleplay, captains who if you give any kind of order to anyone they will jump on you and tell you that's not your job, captains that don't like it when you make the tiniest of mistakes, or captains who will ask you if you have teamspeak and if you say no they just kick you, get this game. If can't handle that, don't buy this game.If you've played Guns of Icarus Online, this game is pretty similar.You and 1-4 other players (along with bots) pilot a space ship, there are 5 classes and each has a unique role and do uniqe jobs. Heavy teamwork is required in order to succeed. You'll go around the universe destroying other space ships, exploring ruins, and pillaging planets. All of this is very, very fun, which is why I recommend this game.As said the only downside is the role-play/super serious sub-community that is quite idiotic and can't accept the fact that what they're playing doesn't affect them in real life by much at all...Pros:+Fun game+Team-based+Mature community+Lots of potential+Unique+Great design+Amazing space asetheticsCons:-Role-play/serious sub-community-Bad NPCs-Easy to grief-No tutorial-Not much planet depth			"

One thing I really enjoyed about this game more than anything itself was how most of the online groups are heavy on RP so you can REALLY get into the game which really makes its fun.Only thing I disliked about it was how your spaceship is running a hardcore mode all the time if you lose your ship you start the whole game over. That kind of sucks but I understand the reason behind it. All things aside though this looks to have a promising future.			"

								I only have a few hours under my belt, but I like what I've seen so far.Interesting game concept, designed around teamwork. Each player having their own role to perform makes everyone feel useful, to an extent. Some jobs require more attention than others, such as pilot or engineer. Obviously the game needs more content, but it is still early access, so it will come. One thing I WOULD like to see implemented though, is some sort of a job queueing system. Some players will obviously be more comfortable doing a certain role (I've only been a Scientist so far) And joining games is rolling the dice, because you're probably not going to end up in the role you would like, which can make it more difficult to gel with a new team. So it would be nice if there was a way to queue as a scientist, or pilot etc, and be shown a list of games where that role is needed.			"

								If you are playing on a Windows computer and have a bare minimum of a brain, get this game. People who have left reviews stating the game is too complex are the type of people who probably think Connect-4 is too complex. If you spend at least 1-3 hours of the game, you should be able to grasp most, if not all, of the key concepts. The game devs release bug fixes very often and have content updates every few patches.			"

								This game is in no way complete, but that doesn't detract from the fun it provides in its current beta state. Alone you can maybe play this game for around 2 hours before running out of missions and 5 hours before you realise just how little this game has to keep you preoccupied without making your own goals. I personally stop playing after the fourth hour only comming back for an extra 5-10 minutes to check out the updates. The rest was playing with my friends, and thats where this game shines the most. while single player has you locked in as captain only unable to change multiplayer lets you play around with the other classes adding some variety. Is the game worth buying as it is now? if you plan to play alone then absolutly not, with friends? maybe when it's on sale, otherwise wait for a future update with the speed they're pumping out updates it shouldn't take more than 2 years before it's well worth the full price.

Early Access Review
								For all of you folks who enjoy space as much as I do, this game is a nice way to explore it. Here is the views of it and what I think of it (please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access, it is being improved as we speak and/or read).First of all, this game is a multiplayer game where you can play with friends or random people online. You are a crew aboard one of many ships to explore the vast space. Each crew member is assigned a post to fulfill. This may sound lame, but it is quite awesome. The captain gives orders, assigns missions, gives pay for the crew to use on tools and food (for healing). The pilot, well, pilots the ship (this job is my favorite, especially when fighting other ships). The engineer repairs the ship and puts out fire. He can also remove the core (not recommended unless facing death). The scientist observes the ship's status and reports any problems to the engineer. The weapon specialist can shoot the guns. Now, each crew member can do any of these roles whenever they feel like it. However, they can upgrade their talents for their specific job.Now, as of right now, all you can do in this game is to attack enemy ships (you can teleport to their ship if it is damaged enough to have its shield down and kill the crew repeatedly until you claim the ship for your own and use it), land on planets and kill creatures that try to kill you, accept quests and do them, and explore the world. However, as I previously stated, this game is in Early Access, and it will continue to improve. There are many mysteries in this game. For example, I found a random ship that was dead floating in space. When I teleported onto it (yes, you have a teleporter you use to get to the planets and other ships), I found out that it was another ship you could decide to use, and it was full of snow. It was dead, so we (my crew and I) had to leave it, but this was the only time I saw it.Two more things. First, if your ship explodes, your crew and you die. You have to restart. I like this feature. It makes you more cautious, which this game is supposed to make you feel. You need to play your role as if you are there. And finally, there is a manual for the game you can use to check up more on the game. Thanks for your time.			"

								Where to begin ?  This game is incredible, since Star Citizen was announced, my love of space sim games has been re-awoken.  This game is different from all the rest however.  It is the most immersive space game I have played yet, just the act of interfacing with the hip through the displays is a gamechanger.  When you have 5 of your friends on T.S. and you crew a ship, it all just comes alive, your role starts to come out almost naturally.  I have played it quite a bit and usually play as the engineer as it is one of the most active roles.  The grapgics arent the best, but this is one of those games where gamplay trumphs graphics.10/10			"

								This game is really good for its current development state. Excellent multiplayer with a real emphasis on team work. There is no other game quite like it. I would like to see more games go in this direction with multipassenger ships that can move during space travel. Most space games leave out features that make them immersive. This game captures immersion almost perfectly. I would however like to see a third person mode added along with more to do on the ships. While this game has a class system unlike any other, the classes need to be fleshed out a little more, with more abilities unique to their role. I would also like to see more domestic activities implemented on the ships and an asymmetrical way of interacting with other peoples crews in other games. Overall great direction and kep adding content. With a lot more pve content this game has the potential to be one of the best space simulations out there.			"

								I really didn't know what to expect from this game at first. The idea behind it seemed interesting, and I decided to give it a try. I had no idea what I was doing, and joined a game just to see how things worked. I was in charge of weapons. Luckily for me, that was the easiest job to pick up. Our crew aboard the U.S.S. Flurry quickly grew, and we soon found ourselves planning to play again later. The potential for this game is exciting, but the community is what made me stick around. Most people will gladly give you tips on how to play your role, information about lore and strategy, and in the end, I made a few friends playing this game. Hope to see you guys out there.-Captain Rubyknight			"

								COOL GAME BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM: DEV PLEASE READSooo... I really liked the game, it had lots of stuff to do, and ive always wanted to try a concept like this. It's fun to run around the galaxy with your friends and fight with people and take over ships and stuff, but after ever since an update like a year ago, i actually cant even press any buttons in the main menu (including the play button) so i cant start the game. and this was like after the second week of playing the game. So i submitted a bug report, (I believe they still havent gotten back to me.) So i deleted the game and kinda forgot about it. Now, like a year later, curiosity got the better of me, and i downloaded it again. Launched the game, aaand still cant play. So while i would reccomend it, as apparently im the only one who gets this issue, my personal experience with the game and the devs has been a bit dissapointing :(*EDIT* im on a mac if that helps			"

								If i had to choose for a single survival game to make it out of early access and get continued developpement over time, between astroneer, osiris and Pulsar, i would want  pulsar to be released.The graphics are ugly but there is so much fun to have in this game.  The universe is way bigger than empyrion and the coop aspect is more in depth than HMS Marulken. This is the closest you'll ever get to being in Star Trek.Even star citizen doesn't have such level of coop gameplay when it comes to the ship.This game needs your support, the dev team is small, and i really want to show them love so that they keep up their good work. Negatives :- Really wish we could mod the game- Engineer should teleport you instead of doing it yourself or teleport button should teleport everything within the teleporter.- Wish we had to bring the cargo from missions back to the teleporter instead of having it magically teleported to cargo.

Early Access Review
								I'll fully admit that it took me a while to decide if I was going to purchase this title or not. The graphics in the screen shots and the videos made me wary that this was yet another Early Access title that does the same thing that other, bigger, prettier games do so much better. (And lets be honest, if you've played Early Access you probably know exactly what I mean.)Then, I decided that I would go on YouTube (something I never do) in order to see what the game play was actually like. What I saw intrigued me enough that I actually bought an Early Access title for what I thought was a lot of money for such a simple looking game. So far, I'm pretty amazed by what Leafy Games has managed to put together. After you play this, you'll wonder why it took so long for a game company to see space combat through a cooperative lens. The game isn't done yet, don't get me wrong, but what it does is something that no other game has really attempted with any degree of success. It takes the somewhat tried-and-true formula of a space sim/roguelike/shooter/RPG and instead of giving each player their own unique starship they make you cooperate to run that one starship well.The five classes they have in the game are mostly well balanced around one another, as each class 'controls' a particular section of the ship. Some roles, like Engineer, involve pushing buttons and pulling levers to keep the ship from overheating and providing power for the other roles to use. Science is the eyes and ears of the ship while providing offensive and defensive buffs through power allocated by the Engineer. The pilot flies the ship and collects space-loot while ensuring that they follow the captains flight plan. There's a lot there, and while it might be confusing your first game nothing is so complex that it will take more than a half-hour to learn it. (Also, the user manual is surprisingly useful for a first-time player that prefers not to engage in trial-by-fire.)The community thus far have been very helpful and nice, which is also a refreshing change of pace, although there are the obligatory trolls/children that will join into your game to shut off oxygen to your ship or purposefully start fires/destroy subsystems for the sheer hate of it. So far, they're relatively few and it's generally pretty easy to recover from any of their hijinks. It's also a small community, so after a while you'll probably know enough people to steer clear of any jokers you might encounter. Obviously, the game is growing, and really my only critique is that there needs to be a few more things that the Captain can override as far as crew decisions that could be deemed 'griefing', such as firing off nuclear warheads or turning off shields mid-combat. The game play is as fast or as slow as your group can handle. Planets are relatively relaxing without any real threat of losing anything, death is painless as you have infinite clones (Although in hardcore mode you don't get a save at all, so you better not all die at once or it's game over.), and voice chat is almost a must if you really get into this game. Bad decisions are punished hard and fast, often times without you necessarily knowing what went wrong. (Such as shooting at a -much- more powerful ship than your own, only to be one-shot in return because Science didn't bother to scan the enemy ship to determine it's relative strength.) You won't blow up out of nowhere due to any one crew members mistakes though, so don't concern yourself with the engineer accidentally ejecting the warp core or hitting the wrong button and killing everyone instantly.Most games that label themselves as 'cooperative' are anything but cooperative. This game is a breath of fresh air into the space sim genre and I hope Leafy follows through on this concept and continues their track record of timely updates and great ideas.As my last parting thought, if you're at all a fan of Star Trek and always wished there was a game that finally scratched that itch that nothing seems to satisfy, this game is literally tailor made for you. Even if you -don't- like Star Trek, this game is worth a look and a purchase just for the innovation they've already put out into the gaming universe.			"

								What can I say about a game I have been waiting for a very, very long time. First off the graphics; I like them. The look and feel of this game visually, is fun. some places you will visit are spooky and full of atmosphere and others are high tech.Secondly, Gameplay; I love it. It is FUN ! The ships are easy to control. Ship systems are straight forward and to the point and They are not overcomplicated which keeps the fun aspect rolling. I got the gameplay down within ten to twenty minutes. Based upon the fraction ship you choose you will be given missions which you can recieve from people at space stations. Once on said mission you may have to divert to save a fellow faction member or encounter a hostile species.Thirdly, Story; So far the main story is not there yet (BETA 11.5) but I enjoyed talking to people on space stations and via ship to ship communications. From there you are told the story of the universe which got me interested. The story is injected smoothly.I definetly recommend this game.			"

								With the right friends, this game really does seem like your own personal episode of Firefly or Star Trek.  So, here's my take on this game.The Captain ordered us to look for security drones.  We spent about 30 minutes on a search and destroy until we needed to head back and repair the hull.  I am the pilot and yes, I'm a girl.  My first attempt at docking with the repair station was ...sporty.  If you've ever seen the movie galaxy quest then you will have a good idea of what it's like to fit the destroyer into a repair station docking bay.  Our first away mission resulted in our captain yelling ""Oh sh*t!"" and then promptly dying.  When asked what killed him, he said something ""Ambiguous"" and told us to head right when we exited the terraforming station.  I headed right and immediately died by the ""Ambiguous"" hostile who seemed intent on shoving a plasma cannon up my posterior.  I was very happy that someone had remembered to turn on the respawning platform on board the ship.  Except for the need to change my uniform, I was ready to beam back to the planet surface and return the favor.  This game is all about friends and teamwork.  The better your team, the more fun you will have.  I wasn't happy with the price tag considering the state it's currently in but if you play this with a group of people who have a good sense of humor and a love for space operas, you will never regret the purchase.  I love this game and I see only good things to come because it's only going to get better from here.   "

								A space-RPG that is a mix between FTL, Guns of Icarus and quest based rpg. The game is fun, and the way to the official release shouldn't be long. That said, there are still bugs and glitches that has to be fixed and more depth to the game to be added. But the potential is there!The game consists of several classes, all of which have their own tasks to make the spaceship run smoothly. They have upgradable talents that will give perks to either themselves or to the ship. The engineer has control of power usage and core temperature, along with the systems on the ship such as weapons, shield and warp drive. The pilot maneuvers the ship. The controls takes some minutes to get used to, but becomes easy after flying around for a little time. The weapon specialist fires the big gun. Probably the easiest positions, but also very entertaining. Railgun, laser turret, missiles, nukes and more. The scientist is more like an electronic warfare operator. Cyberwarfare (infecting enemy ship systems with computer viruses), shield boosting and programming, and scanning of planets and ships. The captain is the big boss. He is in control of buying and selling components and equipment for the ship, has full economical control and makes the plans for where to go and what to do. Personally I think this role is a bit dull, as it consists of mostly just telling people what to do, without doing anything yourself (except from plotting in the course in the starmap). This is realistic, of course, but still the position I like the least. A good crew can be really fun to play with, and you dont even have to be 5 to play. AI exists, but I haven't really figured them out, and initially i find them to be quite crap as opposed to a player. Another similarity with Guns of Icarus I guess. tldr; fun co-op game with space exploration and upgradable ship and characters. Crossover between FTL/Guns of Icarus/RPG.			"

								Pulsar is unlike any other co-op game I've ever played, since everyone's experience is their own.I learned how to play Engineer first just in case I wanted to kill my crew for the heck of it.I joined a crew that was seemingly a tiny bit dysfunctional. Decided ""hey, Im gonna screw these guys over""Acting normal and such when I hear burning. Go to investigate. Entire life support room is on fire. I think nothing of it and put it out and repair the system.Keep plotting to kill crew until I be good guy again when the core is on fire. Think nothing of it since we just got out of combat.Another system catches on fire. Go to put it out. See our ten-year-old weapons officer walk away from the fire. Get suspicious. Tell no one.Going on our merry way when suddenly ship power goes out. Go to reboot system. Weapons officer is responsible. Captain was right about suspicions. Decide to not screw over crew.Later, I'm learning how to be capitan on my own ship, the Damrey.Sceince guy with no mic joins and is probably a noob, and is acting overly cheery.Going along when power goes out. Engie reboots it.Noob science is obvious culprit when he turns it off again and runs to captain's chair when we all go investigate.Tell science if he wants to get kicked he should do it again. He does it again.After this crew I got a drunk pilot and a weapons officer who played edgy music through his mic.			"

								I have played very little of this game (on my computer, at least. I originally played it at a friend's house). Nothing is more satisfying than charging a warp drive, blasting to another sector, getting into a skirmish, then going down to the surface of a planet to loot and explore. I don't need to say much more but if you like sci-fi, this game is for you.Only downside is performance - my computer obviously isn't much, but it works just fine for me on an AMD but occassionally has *MINOR* lag spikes.

								I enjoyed this game thoroughly. Pilot was my first role (and the perspective this review is based on). I did read the entire manual before starting, though, so I understood the mechanics before starting (took about 30 minutes to read the manual). The physics of the ship are great. The ship drifts, gradually accelerates and reduces speed, and can move in all 8 directions (up, down, left, right, roll right/left, pitch up/down). Sometimes the enemy will shoot you with something huge and will spin the ship out of control - very crazy and hard to recoup from. At one point I hid behind a comet and would come out to give my gunner visual, take some damage, and duck back down before our shield went down. The enemy A.I maneuver in very smart ways. I was impressed.There are 5 classes: Captain, Pilot, Engineer, Scientists, and Weapons.Each class can perform the roles of each other and Captains have the option of using A.I. My adventure saw me on a ship with 2 others - a Captain and Engineer for a while. We eventually got a full ship. Many people joined and left. I started playing at 3 am CST and just stopped at 12 pm. These were random people. I did not go into this game with anyone else. I simply joined one of the open ships on the server browser. 2 of the people I adventured with are now on my steam.Adventuring in the game was seamless and fun. Players use warp drives to go to different star systems. Warping to different star systems sometimes prompts the captain to accept or deny a mission. Accepting a mission will show the players on galactic map which star system to go to accomplish the mission. Missions range from protecting a ship being attacked, salvaging / investigating a destroyed ship, and exploring a planet (There might be more currently or planned).Star systems usually contain one of the following: Nothing, A single comet with some enemies / friendlies, a planet, and we ran into something called an ""infected"" star system (very hostile) and we ran into a odd place that looked like ice crystals all around making piloting difficult - very tight spaces - where we picked up scrap to sell for money. Each star system has a different color aura. The infected are a mystery to me. They remind me of the flood from halo.Combat in this game is somewhat complicated but simple at the same time. As a pilot I did not get to see much of what was going on with the crew - however this is what I noticed / read / talked with the crew.The engines, guns, and other things necessary for a ship cause the core temperature of the ship to rise. This rising temperature has to be regulated by the engineer of the ship by altering how much power goes to what. For example - i was using thrusters a lot to maneuver around the comet to dodge enemy fire while our weapons guy was firing. This nearly caused overheating so the engineer cut the power to my thrusters by half causing my manueverability to suffer so that I would not overheat the core. Just before writing this we were running away from a fight, preparing to warp jump and I was at max thrust forward while using the smaller thrusters (meant for small movements) to get as much speed as possible. All the sudden all my engines shut off. I went into first person mode and all the lights in the ship were off (it gets very dark - you have flashlights) the crew was scrambling to put out fires (things catch on fire when the ship is taking damage from the enemy), repair equipment (things break too) and reboot the ship (it shut down due to overheating - mainly because of me).I decided to get off the piloting controls and grab my fire extinguisher and repair tool (it was already in my inventory) and go help - too late. We blew up.This may have been prevented if the scientist of the ship had the proper programs. Programs are essentially buffs or debuffs for the player ship or enemy ship.Luckily, the captain saved his spot. Saving works like this: The host of the server has the option to save the game state. Only the host may load and save. Pretty much, each host has their own ship. Anything a player buys for them self (there are trading stations - I bought a very good laser pistol and alcohol. Yes, you can get drunk. It makes your aim super inaccurate and gives you blurry vision) will be stored in their locker upon exiting the game.The captain of the ship allocates funds to the crew. You cannot buy things without the captain authorizing the funds. Pretty much, the game is a co-op game that does not require real people nor does it punish having real people. The host can play with whoever, whenever, and the host's progress is saved - the ship items and the crew items.This is a very good game. The immersion and teamwork are a type of fun I have found in only a few other games. What I really like, though, is the exploration aspect.I wanted to try some space exploration like No Mans Sky, but without the grinding. I wanted to play a game with teamwork and communication but I wanted a casual setting. This game offers both these things combined.If I were to lable this game it would be:Single player / Co-op, Space Exploration, Casual, Space Flight-Sim			"

								I enjoy this game so much that I feel I want to give a review. I don't usually review anything.As far as I know, there are no other games that I can compare this with. But if you have a group of friends or relatives to play this with, I would recommend it more. i.e. The game is much better when 5 people are playing together and who play it properly. Pros:- Content - For a game that is in Beta, it does have a fair amount of content. We have been playing for about 10 hours on one game so far and we have gone around a quarter of the galaxy. We have not touched the sector commanders just yet. I think we will try one soon though.- Updates - Whenever a new update comes out, there is always plenty to add. Most recently, the new ship - Outrider - is absolutely brilliant. I would possibly recommend it to new players too as it's easy to move around and a good starter to research. Plus, the new Ice Train level is really good and took us a little while to complete.- Systems - I really enjoy playing as the Engineer. The ability to raise and lower power to keep the ship alive is great. The fact that each change actually changes something in real time is brilliant. So often do you reduce a bit of power from Science and everyone is moaning that they no longer can see that enemy. So you take a bit from Engineering and now the Pilot is struggling to turn around. Then the enemy knocks out Life Support and Oxygen starts to go down. So once that's fixed the core has gone into emergency cooldown. - Fantastic!- Role Playing - To play with a group all talking to eachother and actually playing their roles properly is so good. What I mean is: The pilot flys the ship, he isn't manning the turret while the Captain is flying. Meanwhile, the Weapons Specialist is on the Bridge scanning the enemy. (Unless that's how you personally play...) But if everyone does their role and reports to the Captain, it runs smoothly and everyone does their job in the event of an emergency, it is very satisfying.- Multiplayer - If you do find yourself playing alone, there are usually a handfull of games to join.- AI - Yes, I put AI on the pros... I feel personally that the recent update where you have a lot of control over the AI has made it more bearable. The Captain can now add their own orders and change what the AI do when you give those orders. It's not perfect, but the developers know that. This new way of organising your Bots has made the AI a lot better.Cons:- Content - When you have been playing for a little while, the same missions start popping up and you know exactly where to go and who to talk to. With more content and a greater selection of starter missions to choose from would this be overcome. This is coming though so, great!- Updates - Sometimes they don't come soon enough...- Systems - Some systems are not complete yet. On occasion will you get something pop up and it's not in the game yet. E.g. Auxiliary system: Climate Control.- Graphics - I personally like the graphics. But for people who have played uber realistic space sim games, the graphics are not a comparison. (Not that the graphics are bad though...)This is by no means an exhaustive list...---Would I recommend this game?Absolutely!!! For the price you are paying, you will have quite a lot of hours of gameplay in different ships and different people and different roles. E.g. Currently there are 6 ships and 5 different roles - 30 different games?? More on the way!!			"

								This game is awsome. Alot of fun in single player and especially multiplayer.  Just buy it. Star Trek/Firefly simulator. The only downsides are the FPS portions during missions kinda suck and could use some polish, but its not that bad and still exciting (you die in 1-2 shots vs 10+ for enemy).  I really hope alot of randomness gets added to the game.			"

With multiple ships, 5 unique roles, lots of new ewaupment to buy, and plenty of planets to explore Pulsar is one of the best games I have seen in a long time.			"

								Quick Review after owning this for about 6 months - ""BUY THIS GAME""10/10 would turn off crew's oxygen supply to power sheilds again (and the fact you can do this for strategy purposes totally blew me away)The creative ideas that went into this game astound me:(some as to not spoil this)IDEA! - Wanna fix your ship?- no problem, just shout the engineer to power down the shields so the hull can be repaired!         - oh wait, He's just the janitor that found the engineer's uniform and has no idea how to do that.. or put out the fires on the ship mid battle.. or the process to turn the shields back on without turning off the power to all the ships many computers.. and weapon systems.. and accidentally ejects the engine in a blind panic while the scientist is yelling at him.. then the pilot loses patience and goes ""space nuts"" - starts firing his pistol at the glass at the front of the ship while hammering on the distress beacon like he's practicing to survive the Torture Scene in a Metal Gear Solid game.- Learn the engineer role yourself and restart the game as the engineer - sit with a crew while a new pilot warp into new territories to discover an intergalactic hull eating virus that causes everyone else on the ship to start yelling, ""engineer you noob, get the warp core charged now!!!"" - tell the captain, ""I just can't do it, I don't have the power"" - because the captain spent all the money on the giant laser that the weapons specialist was pestering him about last time you docked and forgot the fuel/core charger upgrade... watch with a sense of ""I told you so"" as the weapon's specialist clutches himself in a corner over the fact he never got to use his big gun he always polished in the creeping realisation that in seconds, his life is over...--> The most underrated, under played game I have ever enjoyed. The one thing that would make this better is more people playing it and more Dev time.I hate to say this but.. and I apologise in advance... ""I would even be happy if EA bought this team/game"" (If it meant a bigger team working on this project continually pumping in content for full price expansions.)Would happily pay full price for a larger team working on this project as it's genius that's being totally overlooked.It did to space games what Vampire the Masquerade: bloodlines did for vampire games (Introduced gameplay never before used, set the bar crazy high and then went totally unnoticed and became a cult legend only to be pined over by adoring fans 12 years and counting.. wishing.. just what if.. someone made a game this good again..)

								I love this game so much! I bought it before it was released on Steam and have really seen this game develop. It has many faults but the developers are usally quick to respond and the fix the issue so you can have a better playtime. Its amazing how you can walk around a bridge and manage different controls and stations such as pilot or engineering! The AI has also developed in a lot of ways since the beginning, now you can give them custom orders to follow that they couldn't carry out before hand. I would give this game a 10/10 rating for any space nerd / geek like myself but it still needs a lot of work to be done on it!			"

								This game provides what I was never able to achieve myself: frien... I mean human interaction.In my first game, I found a way to be useful: piloting a death ship. This was gr80 m80. The controls were easy enough to be able to do stuff without puting♥♥♥♥♥♥in blender. After a very noice 4-5 hr session. The crew parted ways and that was that. But, the memories I was left with were amazing to say the least.This is my story, I am legend...-------PROS--------------------+Great mechanics and gameplay+Each roles bring a different side of the game+Variety in spaces+Developer is very active in the community and with updates+Not too buggy------NEGATIVES----------------Missions dont provide much variety-Planets are not too interesting-Graphics are not great (Not important)-----VERDICT-----8.5/10Would definitely recommend, especially if you are into Star Trek or interactive space games.

								I backed the kickstarter on this game for a significant chunk of change and have played it on and off ever since it first came into pre alpha. I do not regret my purchase.Here is my abridged oppinion of the game:It is good over all and development is steadily improving the game.Im a big fan of the artistic style, music, and the teamwork/exploration oriented gameplay.The community behind the game is also rather friendly and welcoming.My only big complaint is that there is no ability to make the player-character jump. (at least the last time I checked that is), instead you will require a jetpack which for some reason is only available on one of the ship classes, which limits the exploration you can do if you do not choose said ship.My other complaint is that Foxxy is no longer to be found anywhere. :cI keep coming back to this game after leaving it for several months. And every time I do I am pleasantly surprised by the new content.The crew AI is not very smart, and not easy to command either; however the last time I played they improved significantly and I expect them to get better in the future.Sadly I've yet to have the chance to play this game to the fullest as I've never had all 4 of my friends online and willing at the same time to play with. That one is on me however.Required perhipherals to play this game properly:More friends with the game than I have.A Discord server or simmilar and associated pehripherals (mics for everyone, etc.) "

								AMAZING game. As long as the players play their respective roles properly, it's a really great experience. It can be highly technical if you want it to be, but if you don't, it can also just be messing around. If you like being strategic and logical, go for the captain or engineer class. Like driving games? Go for the pilot. Just want to shoot things with big lasers in space? Use the weapon specialist. It really does have something for just about anyone.			"
