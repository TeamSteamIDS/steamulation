								20.6 hours played so far, so not all the reviews here are from long-time players.This game sounds like it's for dedicated petrol-heads, but it's great fun as a generic 'play with something complex and cool' game. Everything is explained with the best tutorials for any game, ever. Twiddling all the knobs and pushing all the buttons is fascinating and the well designed scenarios really mix it up well. Actually, everything in this game is well designed which is a rare treat.Major kudos to the devs and if they model the big bad world of fickle customers, predatory competitors (like me), gullible investors (hehehe) and irrational governments as well as they model fuel injection systems this will be an amazing game. Potentially 'all time classic' level amazing and I don't say that lightly.One warning, the minimum requirement to enjoy this game is some sense of curiosity, otherwise you may find yourself searching for the fire button.Would I recommend this game to a friend? Heck yes.			"

								Automation is new to Steam, but should not be mistaken as ""Early Access"", because it's development just began. The guys and girls from Camshaft worked on this full-time for three years. You can expect the game to be of good quality, no game breaking bugs , no imbalance.What you get is a powerful design tool to create cars just as you want to, from 1946 to 2020, sporty, classy, economical, small, huge.. so many bodies to choose from! And this is just the beginning, there is a lot more to come in the future (mainly the tycoon part ofc), including, probably, Diesels! You do need a relatively good system to run the game on full quality and updates take a bit longer because the team is very small at this point in time and because they won't release an update before it is working properly. Need to mention the awesome community behind the game. They mod, they compete and write and now you have the chance to join them. If you have a passion for cars, then there is no way this game won't bring you many hours of fun!			"

								I don't write reviews as a rule, but I feel Automation deserves one. With a tweak to the name it could be released sooner (add in missing engines, forced induction and bodies) and already be worth the money. When the tycoon side is added this will be one of the most abitious projects on Steam and no doubt well made and well polished. Top stuff.And now I waffle...Currently this is Automation - The Car Design Game. And it is bliddy brilliant at doing that. I got this a few years back, just after turbochargers were added to the engine designer. I guess I paid about this price and I have easily had my money's worth. The scenarios offer a challenge, getting platinum on the harder scenarios is a labour of love. And many hours can be lost forever fiddling around in the car designer.There are a few annoyances at the moment, such as not being able to change fixtures for different trims and not being able to morph the body after placing fixtures (although I understand and respect the reason for this). But these are easy to live with just like limitations and design choices can be lived with in other titles.So what about the 'Car Company Tycoon' bit. Why isn't a considerable chunk of the name not actually in the game. Logic. That's why. Car companies sell cars, so make the car design bit. Cars need engines, so build the engine bit. The detail is unprescedented, even with some parts such as the gearbox, cam and ignition settings simplified for gameplay reasons there is still an incredible amount of detail here. So I'm happy to wait months for an update and a year or two for the tycoon game because if the engine and car designers are anything to go by it is worth the wait. After all the 918/P1/LaFerrari (delete as applicable) wasn't designed in a day.So back to the price. Is £22.99 (or whatever it is in $, Euros, Yen, Pieces-of-Eight, ...) worth it for an early access game from a teenie weenie indy dev. YES. Compared to other early access games there is plenty of content, and the devs are focussed on depth first, breadth (i.e. other engine types - I3, I5, V6 etc) later which is the correct way to do things.On to the checklist I like to tick off before going for an early access game:Do the devs communicate well and often with the community? - A definitive tick.Is it frequently updated? - CrossAre the updates meaningful and adding depth to the game or are they just bug fixes and ""look, shiny"" crap to appease the masses? - TickIs the content well made? - TickDoes the game have potential? - TickWill they reach that potential? (i.e. is it a proper game or does it stink of a money grab) - TickDoes it have MOAR POWER - Tick			"

								A great game for car nuts, I've been following it before it's steam release for a while and I highly recommend it. The steam update has really done a lot to make the game easier to get into, you now get to see the effect your changes are having as you make them, so the learning curve has been made a lot easier. And they added a bunch of content like new bodies (AWESOME) and now, pretty much any colour you like, which is a nice touch. The car I'm making at the moment is a hot pink 2.4L V4 citycar (You can do utes or station wagons so that's really cool). They have also added a tooltip which directly allows you to compare parts, Pushrod vs DAOHC for instance which is really useful.One really good thing I can say with confidence is that the Devs are highly active in the forums so it's easy to make suggestions and ask questions and the community is really good as well. On the forum players have been hosting car competitions, I've competed in quite a few and it's really good. And forum users are really helpful if you need advice.To show this, I can point out that:Killrob the lead Dev has made 2584 posts on the forum. Daffyflyer, the lead artist, 3282.Pretty impressive. :DLike the teams that did Kerbal Space Program and Prison Architect these guys really are good for communication and commitment and I'm confidant that this game is a safe buy for it's future.I've spent way too much time playing this game and I have to say, I love it XDAnd I highly recommend this game.

								I have devoted hundreds of hours into this game prior to it's Steam release, and it just keeps getting better. If you have ever daydreamed of building a car and or car company, this is a dream come true. Even if you only have a faint interest in cars, this game has a lot to offer, and can be used as an interesting way to really get to know how cars and car companies work. Can't wait to get into the actual tycoon elements of the game, but even as it stands theres plenty to do.			"

								This is an awesome car building sim. If you  are a gear head like myself, youll love replicating cars and engines or even making your own. Would love to see more freedom on engine designs, particularly Turbochargers. I'd like to have more control on the size and a/r's. Superchargers would be nice and Rotaries would be awesome!10/10			"

Mechanical VoodooI know this might surprise some of you, but I’m not what you’d call an “expert” when it comes to cars. I know they generally have four wheels and an engine to make them go. I’ve learnt the “controls” and I know that you have to feed them petrol or they’ll sulk and refuse to move, but when it comes to the actual mechanics of the vehicle it’s all magic and voodoo to me.Then again, the same could be said about a lot of things, I don’t know much about rocketry either but that hasn’t stopped me from putting some cool spacecraft together in “Kerbal Space Program”.It’s with this “can do” attitude that I approach Automation: The Car Company Tycoon game in development by Camshaft Software.The Fastest ColourArmed with the knowledge that “Red cars go faster” I dive straight into the game with visions of gull wing doors, sleek styling and cherry red paintwork racing through my mind. Casting an eye across the design options it seems that an engine might be an important component, my “cherry chariot” will probably need one of those so I confidently click on the icon, expecting a few engine options to choose from, you know, cheap and slow, standard and reliable or fast and expensive.This was not the case, you have to design your own engines too, a thought which filled me with dread and anticipation in equal measure.Magic BoxThe engine is the magic box that makes the car work, I’m vaguely aware of plugs that spark and shafts that crank but putting one together.... do some shafts crank better than others? I don’t even know what that means!It’s at this point that I realised just how complicated piecing a working vehicle together is actually going to be.The Rocksmith of Automotive Design.Luckily, Automation is eager to lend a hand in the form of tutorial videos which you can access from within the game. This is an excellent and for me vital option which explains the various components, what they do and why they do it.Four stroke configurations, head types, forced induction, headers, mufflers, these were all just words to me before I played automation, they’re still just words to me now too, but at least I know what they are!Any game that can teach you something whilst you’re having fun can only be a good thing.Bespoke BuildEvery component and every material you choose will have an impact on your engines performance.You can tailor your design to your requirements, if you’re building an engine intended for an everyday city car then economy and reliability will likely be more important to you than raw power.Vice versa if you’re planning on building a super car, then a big, powerful and inevitably expensive engine should power your wagon for the super rich.Talk the TorqueThere’s a wealth of information and graphs you can pull up as you tinker with your design, looking for the torque, RPM or horsepower of your engine, it’s all there for you to see in its statistical glory.Sound of SuccessAnother really nice touch are the dynamic engine sounds which will change to reflect your design choices, A beefy V8 should have its own distinctive growl and it does!Other BitsWhen you’re happy with your engine, it’s time move on to the car design itself, what chassis would be best, which suspension options  should you go with, what about engine placement, drivetrain setups, tyres, breaking systems, the list goes on and on, to say that the design options available are comprehensive is an understatement. The level of detail available can be mind boggling, but again, Automation is there with its quick hit tutorial videos and text to guide you through.Nice BodyOnce you’ve finished tinkering with your mechanical design, it’s time to do the important things like adding the trims and spoilers, positioning the headlights and painting the whole thing red.Even in its early access state this design process is a comprehensive, slick and enjoyable experience.Next StepWe’ve finally done it, the “Cherry Chariot”, a masterpiece in botched engineering, is ready to leave the design phase and go into production.So what’s next? Should we start sifting through supply and demand figures? Decide which territories are ripe for picking? set up production lines and start advertising the hell out of our mechanical marvel?When the money starts rolling in we could invest in some R&D, maybe start work on a new design, “The Crimson Carriage” and move our plans for global vehicular dominance another step forward.Stop SignThe answer unfortunately is no, at least not yet.Automation: The Car Company Tycoon is still in development and as an early access title many of the planned features haven’t made it into the game yet.Sign of Things to ComeCamshaft Software are planning some very exciting features in future updates.There will be a campaign mode running from the halcyon days of motoring through to the near future, in game scenarios and the obligatory sand box mode.The game will feature dynamic world markets, distribution and demand, target groups etc. which should give a full business tycoon experience and more mechanical and chassis parts than even the most demanding designer could ever need.Buy a Fuzzy FeelingWhat you get at the moment is a very competent car design tool and that warm fuzzy feeling from helping fund development of what promises to be a detailed car design and company manager tycoon title.Waiting GameI’m not going to pin an arbitrary percentage on to Automation at this stage, it’s just too early and there isn’t really a “game” there yet to rate. I will say that the design element that is in place is excellently implemented (think the car equivalent to designing that spacecraft in Kerbal Space Program).I’m genuinely excited to see how development progresses and I hope Automation receives the company tycoon mechanics it deserves.If the same care and attention lavished on the design aspect is spent on the tycoon side of the game then this could be something special.( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

Early Access Review
								So you're reading through reviews, looking to get an overall understanding of the quality and playability of the game.Well, this might be what you're looking for. I've had this game close to two years now, almost since the original release and I have been following its development and playing it for the majority of that time. As per review writing conventions, I'll do a well understood ""pros and cons"" list with my corresponding thoughts on each item.PROS- It is massively fun: This is a game being done by proper petrolheads. If you're the kind of person that loves cars and especially the technical aspects of engine building, adjusting suspension settings etc. you'll LOVE this game. At least until the euphoria passes, but more on that later. - Designing your own car: This is an aspect of gameplay that's remarkably underinvested in the gaming industry, given the popularity of cars and the sheer size of car lovers out there. Automation is perhaps the best car designer in the industry right now, period. Even if the graphics are utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and some of your inputs are visually invisible (like camber angle). However they are working on a port to the Unreal Engine and those issues will be taken care of.- Engine sounds: Revving a straight-6 that you've designed at full volume is awesome! Though they can become quite frustrating after a while because they're quite ""electronic"" and there's only one type of sound for each engine type. So you won't be getting that awesome V12 ""screech"" as one gets with a Ferrari or a Lamborghini for example. Only the ""growl"" of an Aston Martin. I also find the sound of a crossplane V8 uninspiring. It doesn't quite live up to what it is in reality.CONS- Development is spectacularly slow: This is a big one and it's my biggest issue with this game. In the two years that I had this game there has been almost no real ""real"" progress. Sure they've added some more engine configuration options and ""improved"" the UI, but the tycoon aspect of the game is atrocious. They have released a ""lite"" version of the tycoon gameplay in the past, however it's barely functional and it's hopelessly boring. - The development team is too small: This isn't a problem of the game per se, but it affects the game in a negative way. The above point is a direct result of this fact, they really need to find a way to get more resources and develop this game faster. - It's mostly just a car designer: The game is supposed to be a tycoon game however that's not what it is at the moment. As mentioned the ""lite tycoon"" mode is barely functional and hopelessly boring. There is no real sense of accomplishment. Basically all you can do is spend hours on end designing a beautiful looking and beautifully working car and then boot the game up every once in a while to longingly look at it. You cannot interact with your creations in any meaningful way. You can't race it, you can't see it being driven around, you can't do anything. This is a problem because the game goes to great lenghts to try and give you the tools to design a car that feels real, but then takes all your joy away by essentially only allowing you to just look at it. Which leads me to...- The car designer is useless: Don't get me wrong, as the game stands, this is the most fun -the only fun- aspect of the game. Heck, at this point this IS the whole game. However it is eventually meaningless because you cannot interact with it. The visual aspects of car design are there almost exclusively for your pleasure, meaning whether you put headlights or not for example is irrelevant to the game. And since you cannot do anything with your car -except see its sales on a spreadsheet- leads me to think; what's the point? Why do the developers give us these eye candies and work our expectations up, only to shatter them all, time after time when you're actually done with it? The car design aspect of the game feels like a car porn made solely for the developers' own deviant desires. It works up your deepest passions and then leaves you frustrated, never allowing you to reach climax. It's almost like a sexual domination act, except you never get to finish, so really, it's just torture.It's way overdone. They need to spend less resources on the designer and more on the tycoon aspect.- UI is atrocious: They simply need a proper artist who knows how to design a UI. I mean it is bad, it's just bad. the whole UI needs a redesign. Especially the market screen. That one is just a mashup of little boxes with numbers in them. It. Is. Terrible. One of the things that make the tycoon (lite) mode unplayable is the uncomprehensible and unintuitive UI. Seriously, it looks like a toddler designed it on MS Paint. This cannot be the final look. - It's not optimised well: This shouldn't be a problem for you if you have a a high performance, custom built gaming rig. In fact it isn't really much of a problem even in medium spec computers. However it does tend to get these long freezes from time to time, especially while you're doing the actual physical look of the car. It would be understandable if the game looked like Project Cars, but it's not when it looks like a literal garbage can.- It has THE worst soundtrack, ever: This is really a nitpick since you can mute the music. However you CANNOT disable that hideous, repetitive, MIDI like guitar solo that plays while the game is booting up. It WILL turn you into a murderous, bloody, axe-wielding mad men who is looking for the sweet relief of death through watching life slowly slip away from the eyes of his victims. It's not just me neither. This inability to mute music during boot up has been brought up in the forums a few times and the developers have stubbornly refused to give us that release. At this point I'm starting to think they are actively wanting to torture the player. The signs are there if you look hard enough.Also you can't race your cars. To be honest you can't even make race cars. I mean sure, you can make them ""look"" like a race car -more or less- but the devs said they're not going to implement such a thing. Which is a real crying shame. Can you imagine how awesome it would be if you could actually race cars -that you made- in multiplayer with your mates?In conclusion, this game will only appeal to you if you're a hardcore petrolhead. If you're anything less than that you are better off spending your money on something else. However even if you are a petrolhead, it will only keep you entertained for so long. The whole ""design a car and then just look at it"" thing gets real old real fast. Unreal Engine port should make it work and look a bit better, but with the pace of progress I've seen in the last two years, I'm guessing it won't be a complete game perhaps for another 5 years.I loved this game for a long time, but I cannot, in all honesty, recommend that you spend your hard-earned money on this game, at this time.Unless you think that this game might become playable within the next decade. Then I recommend you buy it now and save some sweet, sweet pennies (even dollars) through inflation.			"

I wish this existed when I knew very little about cars, engines, management etc... but I'm hungry for more engines! I know in the future we will be able to build v12s v10s etc... but I want to see rotaries! Please! Anyway, hihgly recommended If you even think you like cars/automotion world. "

								I purchased this game before it came to Steam (so don't mind the lack of hours, I've put in tons). While the updates from the small team come slowly, what content does come out is solid. At this point in time, the economics part of the game is not in, but here's what you can expect:- An engine builder that:    - Sounds like an engine... even my little british car block sounded like I wanted it to.    - Has pretty good physics and HP translation.    - Has tons of options, from materials to upgrades like VVT.    - Can be tweaked to reflect (most) real-life engines.- A scenario player that:    - Helps you learn the features of the Engine Builder.    - Can be relatively challenging, even for a veteran.- A Body Designer that:     - Allows for many customizations, from brake size to fender flares.     - Allows you to test braking time, downforce, acceleration.Graphically speaking, it's middle-of-the-line. It's nothing spectacular, but not too shabby, either. If you design an old Mini, it will mostly look like a Mini. The sound is pretty good, excepting the tire squeal. The Development team is awesome... they involve the community and communicate regularly. They're friendly and patient, more of what you'd expect from a small bunch of young, enthusiastic devs. Oh - and they actually know how to drive and work on cars.... mostly. ;)What I'd like to see: MORE of everything! 60's-70's British cars, convertibles, ferrari bodies, valve covers, more more more!

								First, let me be clear that this is NOT one of those rubbish Early Access/Greenlight games that Jim Sterling (thank God for him) makes infamous. Quite the opposite. This is a game with a small, but highly passionate and committed, team of developers who are continually making additions and improvements to the project (watch any of the Dev Updates on the Automation YouTube channel for evidence.) The game is definitely in an unfinished state but there's already quite a bit of quality content available.Second, ask yourself this question: do you, or have you ever, wanted to build your own car? At this point in development, that's really all you're doing. But even in a simplified state such as this, it is still quite an involved and difficult task. There is a rather steep learning curve (especially if you have little experience in auto mechanics) but once you figure out the basics, building a car is a pretty smooth process. As I said, all you can do at this point is build cars and then run them (Note: not actually drive yourself though) around a virtual test track; there are three built-in but the forums have numerous other fanmade tracks. Eventually, the tycoon aspects of the game will give exponetially more things to do with your cars.Overall, what you have here is a solid foundation with a lot of potential going forward. If you're a petrolhead, this is a must buy. $30 may be a bit steep at this stage of development (I very much enjoy the game and will concede that fact) but it is worth the investment, IMO.			"

YouTube™ Video: Automation Steam Release - WildKarrde's Review of the Game! 

			Views: 2,403		

			I've been playing Automation for a long time... since before build 199, when I uploaded my very first Automation video to YouTube.		

I've been playing Automation for a long time... since before build 199, when I uploaded my very first Automation video to YouTube. The game has undergone a lot of changes since then, but all of them positive! Back when I started playing, you only had an engine builder, and not even that many options! You had I4, and V8, that's it. No turbo's, no cars, nothing. I still loved the game then.I've had the opportunity to see the game grow from that, to having turbochargers, to having a rudimentary chassis builder, to having an advanced car builder, to being released on Steam as a fully featured car engineering simulator! Sure, there's still a lot that isn't available yet, the tycoon side of the game is just now starting to be developed, but I've already got my moneys worth from the game! I've played it probably hundreds of hours before it even got on Steam, and I'll be sure to play it hundreds more as it is developed even further!This is an Early Access title you can trust. It has been faithfully developed for over two years now, and the updates are coming regularly, with awesome results every time! This might never be a blockbuster game, but for those of us who dream of building our own cars, it is a godsend. If you, like me, have wished for a game where you could design your own car, or a modern version of the old game Detroit, then it is your civic duty to buy this game and support it! Despite this not being a cash cow genre, the developers have dedicated their lives to making this game a success, and they deserve to prosper for their efforts! They are supporting our dreams to be creative, so we should support them!			"

								This is definitely an early access game. The interface is clunky, there are bugs, and there are unfinished sections of the game. With that out of the way, this game is fantastic! It's unlike anything else that I've played in the sim genre. I'd most relate it to Kerbal Space Program for cars. If you've ever wanted to learn how cars work, there is no better resource than this game. I'm already 8 hours in, and I haven't even scratched the surface yet!I can't wait until they toss in some more different engine configurations(only I4, I6, and V8 at the moment), and body styles, but I've already got my money's worth. I can't wait to watch this game develop!			"

								I have like 6 and a half hundred hours because this game is fun as heck and mods help make it interesting when you get bored of what the game has already to offer. The game devs are a small team of devoted (no pun intended) people who are just making the game that they and all gear heads alike always wanted and they did a really good job with it.Buuut the thing is they are steering the game for an easier interface with less engine tuning abillities, so you used to be able to fine tune your cam lift and duration now they are tied to one slider and you could choose the amount of sound insulation you had but that is now tied with the type of interior you want. These things I want control to more make the car as I see fit. It's like a stick or auto tranny, some like the auto because it makes a car easier to drive, others like manual because they like more control of there car. Same thing applies with this game. I believe that they should at least give you an option of like an easy mode or a real mode. Easy mode is pretty much how the game is, and real mode with more fine tuning features that used to be in the games and more over time. People with not much knowledge of cars and people with a high understanding of cars can both be happy.Overall buy the game if you like cars and the mechanical aspect of them, even if you don't know much the game will teach you.UPDATE: I wrote this review a little over a year ago and what I said still stands, except I think I may be addicted...

								So, Automation. You ask: ""What is Automation?"" I answer: ""It's a game that will change the perspective of the universe we live in.""... No, wait, scratch that. Well, in Automation you build cars. And that's what I wanted to do since I was a little kid. I LOVE this game. You can build your dirt-cheap hatchback or your two-million-dollar luxury car that handles like a boat. You can design the cars' exterior and engine just like the way you want. Automation is a really solid game. It's actually pretty well polished regarding that it is an early access game. I've noticed some minor bugs here and there but there's actually not that many. The game still needs more content such as more car bodies, engine types and so on, but luckily there's going to be more.Updates come rarely, but luckily they're always big. And they're not just like ""Look, we got a new text box, how cool is that?"", no, there's always new content. (Actually having big updates more rarely is better than small updates frequently. In PAYDAY 2 there's an update every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ week!)The only bad side I can think of is that you can't actually drive your cars, but I understand it, as a driving model is hard to do with a 3 man dev team, and the game is about building cars, not driving them.To sum it up, the game maybe isn't worth the price of 27,99€ with this amount of content, but if you're even slightly into cars, I cannot do anything but recommend it.

								After playing the game for some time now I can give an honest review.(Pros) :the idea of building your own car company is quit unique and there arent alot of games which get this much in to the details of an actual car company the game has alot of details all the engine parts are modeld correctly and look very realistic. you can see that they worked a long time on them.they add content every 1-2 months so the game never gets to boring and thers also alot of mods created by the community. the tycoon part of the game is starting to take shape.building your car is very fun there are almost no limits on what you can build and the devs add new car models and engine options every few weeks.the engine sounds are very realistic and sound awsome. the music that changes with the years is also very good.the community is rally niceand helpfull. when you have a question you can ask it in the forums and always get nice anwsers from the devs and the community. there are competitions where you can build your cars and compete against other players (Cons) because this is still an early access game there are some bugs and glitches. but the developers are working on them and you can always report them so that they get fixed earlier.the game runs terrible i only get about 30 fps with a i7 4770 and an gtx 970. BUT this should be fixed when the game finally runs on the new unreal 4 engine. the current engine isnt the best thing in the world but you can still play the game.needs to win at least one steam award : )			"

								Managed to create a Pinto that didn't explode...and then I put a Turbo V12 in it...then it exploded5/7In all seriousness, Automation is a great 'build-a-car' ""sandbox"" as it is right now. If you are at all interested in car design you should give this game a look. While you will not get the same designability if you were to design the car in CAD or some other program, for a game (and it is a GAME, not a toolset) the options are numerous and your creativity is the real limitation. Seriously watch the vids (though they are of earlier builds and dont show everything available) and look the discourse forums for this game and see what people have built.You cannot drive the cars you build, that is not a planned feature and as far as I know right now not even a thought of devs. Its not this game's purpose, at all. If you want to drive cars I'd recommend Asseto Corsa. If you want to design and build cars then look no further. This game is one of kind and in a class of its own. There is only one game that I know of that even tries to do something similar and this game, IMHO, out classes that game at every level.The currently implemented Lite campaign is fine, but if you play a game to beat it then this might not be for you, right now. The game will have a full campaign with too many factors to go into, but there is currently no real end-game. If you can't sustain interest in something out of pure curiosity and creativity then this might not be the game you want. The game really shines is its sandbox mode. The base game has a good selection of starter parts and bodies that can allow you to get a good feel of piecing together you're own car. You can deform and the adjust various part of the carbodys in order to attain a shape that appeals to you the most. You then apply everything from headlights, taillights, and door handles with options hood-variations, vent and grille variations as well as exhaust types. Don't see what you like, there is a great catalog of modded pieces that add a huge amount of extra variety. New car bods, headlights, taillights, exhausts, hoods, handles, grilles and much more. The devs will sometimes add these parts to the games, but don't worry they havent allowed modders to take over piece development and are actively making more pieces of their own.The engine builder is a little confusing for people who know very little about cars, but its easy to catch on to whats happening. I3, I4, I6, V6, V8, V12 and more engines coming later. Pushrods, DAOHC, OHC, DOHC, MOHV with 3,4 and 5 valve options as well as VVT and VVL all available. Don't know what any of that is thats fine the game has helpful tooltips that explains most things which are all over the place in the game, just hover over the header and it'll explain whats going on. The tutorial section is also helpful here. Seriously the engine designer is vast and impressive.Then there are customization options for tranmission types, tire and rim sizes, brake types, aero adjustment, susupension adjustment. Soon enough you'll also be able to customize factory/production options such as how many are produced and how good that production is and more. B/c remember it is a tycoon game and once youre done designing you can see how your car would sell in the 3 fictional game regions being compared against other cars built by the devs and some community members.I could go on for a while about the great things this game does now, but I'd be here all day. The devs are always talking to the community about what is going on and what is coming. They have big updates every couple of months that often add several new large features. They are a very devoted small team who deserve a lot of praise. Seriously i've more than got my money's worth from the Alpha/Beta alone. If you've even the slightest interest please watch the vids on here and youtube then look up the forums because this game is honestly a great purchase. It has a great dev team, a great community and hours upon hours of creation possibilities as it is right now. The jump to UE4 can only make this game better.I cannot say enough positives about this game. After 400hrs I still find things that I'd like to go design or revisit. Seriously this game should be at the KSP success story level, but unfortunatly cars are not as glamours as rockets...and the game lacks explosions and we all know b*tches love explosions. (I owned KSP since alpha too)			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE - 10-10-2016TL;DR- I do still enjoy the design and building aspects of the game, and the community has produced some great add-ons through the Steam Workshop, but I think the latest update adding the ""Lite Campaign Mode"" is actually a side step or, more accurately a downgrade.****Updated Review****I've been playing the Open Beta, which has just been pushed out to all Early Access customers. The ""Lite Campaign Mode"" is now available. This long awaited update is an improvement in some respects, but it's more confunding than anything.First thing I noticed is that the game loads MUCH faster than it used to. We're talking probably 3-4x faster loading than before. So, the dev team has been hard at work at refining efficienices. The music still plays while it's loading, even though I have it set off in the menus. Can't have it all, right?When the main menu loads, I noticed that Scenarios have been taken away, they now say In Developement. Well, now that Lite Campaign mode is here, I shouldn't need those any more... but it's a little odd to see functionality taken away. For those who don't have the game already, Scenarios was basically where you got a set of circumstances you had to design for and then you got scored based on how closely you matched or exceeded the circumstances. One I remember off the top of my head was to build a ""Generator"" for the Russian military in the engine designer. These scenarios were fixed (no random variety) and there was about a dozen of them, but there was replayability, as they were challenging enough that you had to work to get the platinum score.I head right for the Campaign button. I click on the Lite Campaign mode, and am immediately presented with a screen full of selections and sliders. The three countries you can choose from are right there at the top, and each one has it's own set of likes and dislikes. Write these preferences down because this information will only be available in a giant number-filled grid which is not a pleasing nor easy to read format.Next we have Company Tech. Seems self-explanatory, give yourself a head start in certain areas (or all areas), but apparently there's a limited number of points you can assign, which isn't explained anywhere, and when you adjust points up and down, and a points total at the top changes, but by adding the new point total by the old point total for some reason. You add one point in Drivetrain, there's one point added to the counter at the top. You add another point (totalling 2 in Drivetrain) and the counter at the top reads 3. Now you add a 3rd point, to drivetrain (I want to be really good at building drivetrains), and there's six points at the top. But, if I add 1 point to bottom end, it adds 1 point to the total at the top.. add a second, it adds 3 points to the top total... What? Why? How?Doesn't matter, don't care, I want to PLAY! I give myself 2 points in each category. Next is Team, where you select team members, I guess. It's not really explained. So I select six random people... But, I don't have to? I can run the factory single handed? Should I hire the ceramics expert? Well, I'm starting in 1946, so maybe? Did people use more ceramics back then? I'm not entirely sure.Next we have Cash & Competition, pretty self-explanatory, except the heading with ""Competition"" and then the $ sign. If you hover over the dollar sign, (which is the opposite of how most of the sliders in the game work, usually you hover over the slider, not the slider title) it says Competitor Car Markup Multipler. So, is that how much your competition marks up their cars? Is that how much higher you can markup the exact same car from your company versus your competition's? And this is represented as a straight number, 1.05 initially. Well, markup is usually a %.Still reading? I'm sorry. We just got the lite campaign setup, this isn't even the gameplay, but it hints at what's ahead. Finally, I give up guessing what all this is supposed to do, and just start.The next screen looks like the Sandbox screen. New Car, Revise Car, etc. Now I get to do my favorite part of this game, design a car and engine. Unfortunately, there is no additional help now that we're in campaign mode. There's no little inset window, or button you can click for a pop up to show how you're doing at hitting target categories. You just have to guess how to make the best Pony Budget, or Sport Budget, and can't tweak settings to see your changes affect it, without an unncessary amount of work. So, I design a car and engine, get pretty close to the targets I want to hit, then I have to build the car, right? Well, here we have more confusion. You can select from Small, Medium, and Large factories; easy enough. Now, do I want a size 1, 2, or 3? I don't know, it doesn't really elaborate any more on what each of them do. There's also no price attached to any of the choices. And no prices for any of the factory upgrades you can purchase.Factories are set up, I skip to when the car is ready to go into production (but I only get that dialog, if I step linearly through the game, that dialog never shows up if I go back and make a tweak to the car or its production). So, I run the production, and that's when I notice EVERY month is 30 days long... even February. I'm done.Camshaft software has done a great job creating a beautiful car and engine designer, but I think they're a little lost on creating the tycoon aspects. Maybe you guys should team up with the lone guy who's creating GearCity. His car/engine designer is nowhere near as sophisticated, but he's got all the Tycoon aspects down really well.*****Original Review Below******I love being able to design a car from the ground up, but that is all this game currently is, and all it has been in the year since I purchased it. It's supposed to be a tycoon game, but there are NO aspects of this yet. Updates are EXTREMELY slow. There hasn't been one since April, that I've noticed. Let me tell you what I HAVE noticed that's changed in the last year: V12's and V12 turbos. That's it. Nothing else from the devs. I paid $29.99 on July 11, 2015. That's a long time in Early Access, and a long time with so little content update. I'm still a fan of this game, but because of the long wait between updates and the lack of ANY tycoon elements, I can't recommend this. When/if this game ever nears completion I would be very happy to consider recommending it.For the gearheads: This game reminds me of those great drag racing games of the late 90's (NHRA/NIRA Drag Racing) where you can build motors and such. But, it is extremely unfinished, and is conspicuously lacking certain features. For instance, there are NO flat engines (boxer type), no Inline 8's (the game starts in the 40's.. c'mon!); you just have a generic slider to adjust camshaft profiles, which doesn't really reflect the nuances of adjusting duration, timing, etc. Does 100% mean a lumpy cam? Does that mean it doesn't run well on the bottom end?			"

								Automation is a pretty unique game about designing cars and engines wich for some petrol heads is really cool.  The graphics is alright. The sounds are good. I have not met any bugs YET. The bad things: The engine types is fairly limited at the moment like there is not v12 and no rotary engines. No supercharger and you cant have turbo for all types of engines.  But overall its a great game and i am sure that the devs will add more things in the future like the ones i complain about and they have also planned Multiplayer and CO-OP wich shows that the devs are caring about the game. i think the game is worth the asking price			"

								A lot of people are saying that you shouldn't buy Automation because it isn't a ""game"", at least, not yet. But that's exactly why I think people should buy it earlier. Automation holds some broad concepts, and is able to implement them in a simple yet extensive way. Building a car is just a series of steps, and yet, at the same time, it's so much more than just ""a series of steps.""True, there's a vast amount of features that should (and hopefully will) be added, like a way to actually see your car in action. And diesel engines. But I believe that Automation, in its current state, is already an excellent sandbox and will only get better in the future. Why others are downvoting it for the very same reason is beyond me.			"

								I've really enjoyed what I've played of car mechanic simulator 15, but I was looking around for something a little more in depth. I came across this and gave it a go. I set out to make an awesome muscle car with a powerful v8 engine. I'm not much of a car expert, but the tutorial videos explain every option in the design process very well. I enjoyed the explanation of RPM and torque, very australian.I gave it a standard 70's muscle car shape, Standard double circular headlights and the like. I went on to make the engine, was a fairly nice looking v8 with 32 valves. After a bunch of tweaking, I eventually got the engine to stop knocking and in a reasonable working order. Building the rest of the car was just as detailed, such as suspension, brakes, internal parts such as seats, safety features and so on.Finally I sent it to the test track. It basically did poorly in every category, except safety. It ultimately became the perfect overpriced car for a man to buy in a midlife crisis that knows nothing about cars, but is too safety conscious to buy a motorcycle. He wants to show off to his friends and neighbours with his new muscle car, but they are all actually laughing behind his back.			"

								Where do I start. Note, that this review is based on the current state of the game - 23. december, 2015. This is a long, philosophy filled review, for a short and quick one, scroll down.The idea for Automation seems just fine, as there's nothing similar to this game to current date. The game has been in development for quite a long time, and the pace for it goes snail-like. Don't mind my playtime, I didn't want to get over two hour mark, as I am still thinking, whether I really want to keep the game.I  have followed this for quite some time, and by follower, I mean, passive. I had played demo version to get the overall feel, and of course, at some point a pirated version, which allowed full access, appeared. Let's not dive in to this, cause it's more about the experience this offers.Development wise, there are huge plans for the future, but not actuall coverage or timelines beneath it, and let me explain why. Idea and gameplay, which Automation attempts to tackle, is for a very specific market of buyers - petrolheads and technical nerds. Don't get offended by this, as I am both of theese. Now, continuing on explaining, as I previously mentioned, the development is slow. Why? Because initially, it was developed by four people, and I assume, that this was/is their hobby right after their daily jobs. Quite recently there was an expansion in crew, and I hoped to see the new people accepted being programmers/scripters, not car modelers, as at some point and time, there's a plan to transfer the game to Unreal Engine.A game which delves this deep in an engineering process involved to produce working engines for cars requires serious R&D, as it is seen in overall gameplay it offers. That what's the problem?Engines consist of thousands of moving parts, and creating simulated versions where everything affects everthing is quite more difficult than producing precisely estimated engine from raw materials in real life. To be able to depict an engine and it's characteristics to at least a fraction of reality requres serious study, which becomes a problem, when so little people are involved in project like this, and, doing the simple math results in long development times. I tried to recreate one of my IRL car engine, which is a 1.6 Liter 4 banger from B5, and surprisingly, with a little tinkering, I came close to the actuall power figures and peak-power delivery. And yes, I used roughly the same materials, with whatever parameters they are coded, but when trying something like this, it becomes noticable, that certain aspects are missing, which probbably is a good thing, cause who the hell would want to enter precise camshaft profiles and what not.To add something, most modern cars are using ECU's. If something like that could be programmed in the game, and allowed people to tinker with ECU values, at least at basic level, would surely bring a huge difference, as pure, predefined metal parts would no longer be the only thing that makes power.TL;DRGood:The game delivers what it promises and is supposed to;Allows you to build an engine with simple yet hard to master tools;Tutorials explaining what everything does, so you have no need to be an engineer;Great educational material for people interested how stuff works;Basic car designer, with click-and-drag functionality;Very interesting at start, as ideas for engines and cars just plow your mind.Bad:Slow development;Basic visual representation with 3D models, which is subjected to change after transfering to UE, i.e., become more beautiful and, hopefully, sophisticated;Small team tackling huge project and idea;Low replay value after you have tried massive, huge displacement POOWEEER roaring, small displacement usable moon-reving, and lastly, econobox engines.-This would not coun't as a con, but it's not great either - the engine sounds. At the end of the day, all same confguration engines sound foggy. You can't make it sound like mean American Muscle, or crisp German high-reving V8. I hope this subjects to change.Summary:This product is rivaling it's genere between game and educational material. If this would take an educational route, and would be pushed further with techical details and every little asspect of engines, probbably, it would make it to school programs, I am sure.I still recomend this game, although, it's possible to try a demo version, to get the overall feel what everything is about, and basically, that's it, at least for now, until core functionality of tycoon is implented.Did they bite bigger than they could chew? In my opinion, probbably yes.			"

								One thing to start off is to note that this game is still under development so please give the developers a huge break. they are constantly working on it and will improve it. That being said, i expect it to be buggy, crash constantly and have many imcomplete features.My first impressions: wow, finally a game that someone gets me. i love building cars. as a kid i had dreams of one day having my own car company, one i can put my name on and triumph as an auto-manufacturer. kind of like way back when there was a man that started his own company called ""Tucker"" unfortunately he was crushed by the big three but the idea was that he was ahead of them with features we have today such as seatbelts. he was an innovator and was different from the rest. if i was to run my own car company i would specialize in being different then the ""sheeple"" cars that are quality, economically priced, fast, fun, exciting and safe. This game excited me so much i jumped over to the steam page immediately and purchased the game. i downloaded it and while downloading it i thought up cars to build, engines to design, what to call everything. even as far as what to call the engines that describes them with a codelike for an example; i have a honda civic and the engine code is D17A2. D-series, 1.7L, A2 (cylinder head - with SOHC VEC)mine is simple C4TE C-inital of last name, 4 - cylinder, T-Turbo, E-Economical (not crazy specs, for DD use)Playing the game: I was so excited to start the game. firing it up for the first time did not ease the excitement. I loaded the main menu and noted that there is Multiplayer comming and also a campain. at this point i am more excited to have that sandbox. no money limits, just plain fun. making engines, making my own custom vehicles.At the time of this review: I have currently been playing this game for 3 days now and have not lost interest yet. i look forward to future updates and more functionality and features. Things i would like to see:- actually driving my designs- more shells to mod- more things to add to the car such as more lights, maybe some body kits, more rims, window tint, customizable interior, license plate holders and such- more engine stuff; supercharger, maybe super and turbo charger together, twin for more then just v6 engines, v6 v10 v12 v14, inlines 3 5-12, rotary engines, W engines, Slant 6, FWD configurations- MOD SUPPORT- Vinyls for customization (even custom text and stuff)			"

								tl/dr: Good game, very in-depth and accurate. Buggy and poor UI.Pros:- Endless content with workshop- Accurate in mechanics and physics involved- Videos show the basics of how parts work and why changes to a part effect the preformance- Can reproduce real cars with ease, down to tinny visual detailsCons:- Buggy UI- Poor ingame engine preformance- Poorly labled, ex. not explaning gear spaceing or tire types ( or the tool tip is cut off because of UI scaling )- Textures are crude, animations are off- graphs bug out ( graphs make up most of the game )Overall, Automation is a great game for not only a gearhead, but also as a education tool. Its simple, alowing for new players to learn fast, but still loads of content for those skilled in the automotive field. In 50 hours, ive not only use Automation to help explain automotive principles in classes, but also to recreate almost 120 of the most iconic cars in history. Its fun to play with and test ideas, but the game is buggy in its early release state and at the time of me writing this, its still only sandbox. Progression in development is slow, but i dont see the devs giving up on there project any time soon.7/10 ignedit: also forget great community, including reddit and workshop			"

								If you are curious about how engines work or how to tweak the tune, then, this game is for you.  A must for any car enthusiast, novice to expert, who simply has extra time to play with a cheap hobbie.  I can now confidently build an engine from what I've learned that can rival any built anywhere, (given the scratch for high end parts not being an issue.)  I already got my monies worth many times over and want more of what they are offering.     This game factors in details like bore/stroke, engine parts materials, head type, # of valves, aspiration, compression, air/fuel ratio, fuel delivery, cam shaft timing, engine timing, intake manifolds, a quality slider (on every creation page), exhaust type and diameter, I could go on, and that is just the engines.  For body, there is chassis design, chassis material, suspension type, engine placement, body material, body morphing, body design, drive type, paint, etc. .  For the 3rd part of the creation (sandbox mode), Automation covers all the rest of the cars overall detail from different differential types to # of gears, # of seats, tire details, brake details, aerodynamic variables, and alot more I'm sure that I missed. There are text and video explenations of anything one would want to know.  Some of the other parts of the game are still in development as of mid May/2016, but, this game already has plenty to keep one occupied while it is too wet to go out and play.    Although currently mostly sandbox mode and recently added lite campain mode, campain and multiplayer are still in development.  There are some other corners of the game I've tampered with, like challenges to design a vehicle, (or engine), towards a particular niche of the cars character (w/ various levels of difficulty, [bordering on a mathematics utopia]) that could seem to stump your reach for the platinum prize, to the tycoon/company side being developed.  Caught glimpse of game with new Unreal Engine updating what already exists, huge improvement of overall game 5/25/16.  The community is constantly adding mods to steam too that can effortlessly be added.  Multiplayer and Campain aren't even highlighted yet.  Oh, the anticipation....     It already covers most engine configurations that exist and with the diligent frequent updates, the rest are soon to follow.  It contains inline 4, inline 6, V6, V8, & V12's and turbos with future updates consisting of (I think) sequential twin turbos to eliminate low end turbo lag.  V10's, inline 3, inline 5, and superchargers are in the works for the future too, along with many vehicle types that already exist to match up with.  I've heard to expect well over 1500 car bodies, wow.   Hopeful future expansions W8, W12, W16, W18, Wankel Rotaries, Flat 4, Flat 6, Flat 8, Inline 8, V4, Two Strokes, Diesels, Hybrids and Electric will probably be future paid content.  The more the merrier, the better the game does financially, the better the game gets.  (I'm guessing again that some of this might be part of vanilla game anyhow, there is a porsche-like mod that would support flat engines perfectly.)  <-- Just a hypothesis.    The game designers really seem to get it too, they follow up on a surprising amount of customer feedback informing all whom are curious on what to expect and why to expect it.  Fairly impressive in a world where games are sold before completed and people often don't know what they are getting.       You CAN upload created engines from Automation ---to---> Assetto Corsa, and then drive your creation in whatever vehicle you upload the engine to.

								I'm not a car nut. I hate changing oil. I forget the difference between a turbocharger and a supercharger. The biggest upgrade I have done to a car is put in a new stereo and speakers (but still paid someone else to do it). I like Top Gear. I love sim games. I love this game. I love making engines, I love making cars and for me what this game has now is worth every cent of the purchase price.However, I can't wait for the Tycoon mode to be ready. I bought this well before it came onto Steam, about a couple of years ago, and every time I play I have slowly learned more about cars. But I'm still not a car nut.			"

								Just wanted to leave my review for one of my favorite games I own. This game is very realistic and has taught me a hell of a lot about engines. I really appreciate the learning that has come with this game. One of my favorite parts about the game is that I can play the game at my own pace. This is the game I go to when I am really stressed out, as it lets me think, and take my time while I play. I enjoy a lot of other games, but when stressed I hate being rushed or pushed into a game, or having to ""keep up"" with the game. Highly recommended to people with anxiety.			"

								Honestly I've had this game in my library for about 2 years, I Install it once in a while because honestly it just sounds so fun... but the issue is that it NEVER changes... some tweaks sure but the promises that were made at the beginning still seem years away... I competely understand that its an early access game... but the issue is that when you buy something early access you expect a year, maybe two... not 4-5 to get a fully functioning game.If you are looking to play the tycoon aspect as i was steer clear for now... I want to upvote but can't with the absolutely stunningly slow development.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't really write reviews, but i feel inclined to say something about Automation.I bought this game the day it came out in early access after having seen a TheSmokingTire video talking about it. Matt Farah's words were too captivating, so i went out and bought my first early access game not completely knowing what i settled myself into.A year later, i really do not regret getting it, whatsoever. This is by far one of the most promising games under development at the moment, as far as i see it. The base game is relatively simple - You build and design cars and engines to produce and eventually sell as soon as the tycoon part of the game is added to the game. The depth of these basic principles is brilliant. Essentially every component of the engine that makes a difference is adjustable and customizeable to some rather great extents. If you want a tiny 500cc 4 cylinder for a kei car, or a stupdily massive 12 liter V8 for a drag car, you're free to do it. This makes up quite alot of fun of the game - Being able to see what you can come up with and test the limits of what works. It's seriously alot of fun to mess about with. There's also an incredibly informative guide troughout the car designing proccess, should you ever find yourself uninformed or curious about a certain car component. The game itself is still a tad lackluster at the moment, only shipping off with a sandbox mode and some different scenario challenges. But, a proper tycoon mode is still under development, and at the moment it's not even fully a necessity, because the sandbox gives you very much to play with.But i think what i want to highlight the most about Automation is the developers and development process. I don't think i've ever seen the developers of a game so involved with the community surrounding it. The developers are essentially constantly keeping an eye on the official forums and the Steam Community hub for the game, talking with the community, helping with problems and taking suggestions for future game addons. There's also occasional update videos on Youtube where a developer (A rather handsome german man ;) talks about new additions to the game, future updates and pretty much anything you might want to hear about.It's this openness and community involvment surrounding the game that i really, really love, and i genuinely do think that Automation has what is the best developer-community relationship of any early access game i've seen. The community aswell, is fantastic. It's welcoming and open, and you feel right at home whether you know alot about cars or not. This community (and the guides in-game) will make you learn more. There's also a healthy modding scene, adding different car bodies or fixtures allowing you to create whatever you want even more. I'm aware this review seems biased, and it is, but i really cannot praise this game enough. It does have it's faults, but there's way too many positives to outweigh the negatives, and so far this game has just been a positive experience for me. So i guess to sum it up; whether you like cars, want to learn about cars or just want to see an early access game that's actually being worked on; get this game.			"

								I have been playing Automation for few months (before the steam release) and I really appreciate the effort on the game. I guarantee I played around 60 hours of this game, its addicting and educative imo.!!!NOTE!!! This game is ""Early Acces"". It is still in development and game is not finished yet. So dont expect diesels or V16s. You WILL see people writing: ""omg dis game sux no dizel no superchargers bla bla bla"". IT IS MENTIONED IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT and if you will check their website you will see that they are stating the same sentences again and again. We are already seeing new players asking for their new fancy stuff such as V16. This game is developed by a 3-man team around 4 years. RESPECTLess important note: PLEASE, PLEASE use the forums. Check the posts and use search function before you suggest or ask. You can also check out what is in the game and what isn't by here: http://automationgame.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3253 (They dont update it everyday, but you can see which type of engines are in etc.) Also, you can check their youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/AutomationGame for tutorials and news. And you can connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to ask us questions. You can reach to IRC by forum. Have fun!Another NOTE: With the steam release, Multiplayer will be closed for few weeks (or months, probably not) because of implementation. But the game contains the multiplayer and already has it.   Automation Game/ Automation The Car Company Tycoon Game is a Car Company Tycoon game which you build your dream ride, start your own company(s), market them and sell them. Or you can go to sandbox mode and have fun with game by creating some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars or make a monster engine with 3000 horses. Or you can choose scenarios, which helps you to learn the game or you can try the challenges there. Or you can go to MultiPlayer and have fun with others.   At the moment, devs were working hard for the steam release. and the game is release. The game is (far away(because developers want the game to be excellent)) to be complete (except tycoon). According to the schedule of the devs, they are going to start developing the tycoon part. Check out the YT channel (link in the upper note) for more information and news.  MORE COMING SOON (I wanna play the game :) )			"

								So, since the dawn of time mankind has dreamed of creating death boxes, in which people would be terrified and close to death. With this game you can actually build those, and shape them to look like cars. Unless you're good with the game, in which case you can create gorgeous, safe, fast, efficient automobiles. I enjoy the game at this stage, and the updates by the devs are constant and clearly visible (GO DEVS). The community is great (recommend forums for it), and as far as gaming experiences go, this is by far the friendliest and coolest community driven experience I've seen yet. The game is a base, the sharing and comparing the results in the forums is the real fun bit. I'd recommend this!			"

								If engines fascinate you, this is the simulator for you.As it stands in the current early access (reviewed 29/03/2015):Pros:- In-depth and easy engine design & optimization.- In-depth stats, graphs and diagrams. They are updated live as you tweak or change options.- Fantastic, realistic audio. Engines sound fab, with reflections on your selected options and tweaks. Even has cheesy music that you expect to get in a sim.- Sandbox mode.- Fun scenarios give you something to do.- Skip between any section of your build.- In-depth in-game videos appear when editing options for the first time. Also has a ""don't show videos"" button.- Pre-game launcher with good selection of options.- Good in-game options menu.- Active developer so far. Good work so far, Please do not let us down.Cons: (Note: We are pre warned on this page about many of these features being unimplemented or buggy.)- Tycoon mode not yet implemented in any form. Frustrating as the title clearly states Tycoon. It's like ordering pizza and only getting the base.- Multiplayer not yet implemented in any form.- UI can be confusing at times. Having to complete a section to get the graph for the section is annoying.- Can't pan the camera properly.- ""Engine cannot fit"" keeps popping up because it's difficult to guage the size, You have arrows that turn green to red in the visual designer, but it'd be nice to have an inline or overlay text appear such as you are X: 10inch out of 20inch etc. Also my UpDown (Height) arrow appeared red when building a 10ltr v8 in a massive truck, which seemingly cannot be resolved.- Lacking in content. I'd like to see more engines, with larger scaling. Perhaps even more exotic ones to cars, like wankel rotary and aircraft rotary.- Car base in designer can only be altered slightly by stretching certain parts. I'd like to be able to move windows and increase engine bay size- Engine colour and trim are very, very limited. Can only change with next or prev buttons. Why? When the car base designer has a colour picker?!- Certain videos are unfinished with ""Video coming soon"" placeholders and can abruptly end.- Graphics and UI could benefit from some higher resolutions and some polish.- Random bugs. Such as a LUA warning in a windows alert box.Overall this is a great simulator so far.It however lacks in the ""game"" element, polish and content.I would recommend this to someone who loves engines, and the build process or customization.I do not recommend this if you are expecting a fleshed out Tycoon or multiplayer experience, as in this build (29/03/2015), it does not exist.

Early Access Review
								This was a game where, after playing it for a few hours, it immediately became one of my favorites; moreover, I paid the full price for it ($30USD as of writing this) and don't regret that in the slightest either.Let's start with one thing up-front: If you're looking for a game where you can drive your creations personally, well, that's not really what this game is about; on-screen rendered vehicle physics isn't a feature of the game. (It is a ton of fun to send your cars on the 'test track', though.)This game absolutely shines for what it is meant to do - let you make a fantasy car company, complete with fine-tuning the engines for economy or performance or both. It focuses on the very satisfying kind of multi-dimensional optimization problems that come with tweaking each model for the best marketability in a segment.My complaints about this game pretty much only center around the things that are either not finished or can be easily modded in. There are some decades where you run out of contemporary body styles, for example; and flat-four, flat-six, V12, and V10 engines would be great. That said, for what this game is, there really isn't anything major missing. Plus, I can't wait for the ""tycoon"" side of this game to start happening (although I tend to lose in money-management settings).One other note: The graphics look amazing while still being able to run easily on my PC. The Lua side of things can be a little shaky in terms of stability, but compared to a particular car-building game from 2003 that I've sunk even more time into (it's not on Steam), it's immensely better.(Edited to add: V12s were added in an update to the game, and I'd be remiss not to mention that mods cover the question of additional body styles.)

								I originally picked up Automation before it came to Greenlight, and even back then I was recommending it to car-nerd friends of mine.As it stands at the moment, 23rd July 2015, what you get is a car design system. Giving you the ability to design vehicles in a period ranging from 1940 through to 2020, with a variety of different technologies and materials becoming available with time.I'd talk though all the various parts of the designer screens, but there's enough videos on youtube by now for you to actually see it for yourself. However I will say that it's quite an intuitive system. The body designer is simple enough that just about anybody can make something they like. While the engine designer is willing to give you enough hand holding to talk you though why your design keeps exploding - and how to fix that. It's even able to show you how to develop a better engine for what you want to achieve. Want to build a high revving lightweight engine for use in a sports car? It gives you enough information to figure out how to do that. Want a heavy duty low-revving truck engine? Or an economy car engine? Same thing.What it doesn't yet have is an actual career mode. And yes, that probably means that as it stands right now it's more of  a design tool rather than an actual game. But I'm confident that the guys behind this thing can get it done, given how much progress they have made already in the time I've been watching them.Is it worth the money?If you're a car nerd I'd say it is, but if you want to wait till they've got the career mode done I'd entirely understand your apprehension.

								I've owned this game (preordered from their own site) for years now and I know a lot of people think that development is slow or stopped but really it isn't, it's just the way they work.You get updates/patches which are usually BIG every few months or so, this can be 3 months or 6 months but they always keep you up-to-date with their videos on what they're working on and what they got planned. Now that they're on steam I don't think they will change their work habits and a lot of ""game is dead"" post will surely popup, ignore them and just check out their regular videos and make up your own mind.Community feedback is taken very seriously and they're very active in their own forums answering many questions and even asking some to us. Don't forget it's just 3 persons working on this game, I say persons because if I remember correctly one of them is a woman and I wouldn't want to disrespect any women by saying 3 guys ;).After more then 2 years I can stll say that I have trust in the devs and this game. Quality before anything else will make a great game.As for the game itself, currently the engine and car designer work pretty much without bugs and is a lot of fun playing. I honestly do not know which options are available on steam but I got the package that includes the juicy V8 engines (also I6) and Turbo's. They got a lot of things still to add like more engines, car bodies and fixtures. So for now you can just design your cars and engines without much limits like time period, costs and so on. When your car is complete you can test it on a top down viewed maps to see if it's any good, fun thing is that there is a track which we all know as the top gear track... of course it's only ""looks similar"" so no copyrights will be broken ;)There are also some scenarios that you can play where there are design limits, these can be very fun and some are very very hard. If you like cars you will like this game. I don't even own a car or drivers licence and I still enjoy it very very much (I'm just a tech freak I guess). Career mode (tycoon part) is what they're working on now and won't be finished for a long time, can't wait myself... well actually I can since I've already been on board for years. :pI suggest you check out their own forums and youtube channel, investing in this game is something I do not regret like other early access games (Talking about you Godus, the scam game).Again I must say and can't emphasize this enough, that you should never buy anything of one review/opinion, even my little early access one. Educate yourself and see if this game is for you and if you want to invest now or wait for release. You know my opinion, now make up your own and enjoy this game if and when you buy it.TL;DR: Dude gives Automation (early access version) a big thumbs up!			"

All of this is forgiven by the glorious content that is already in the game. The car and engine designer are simple enough to be understood by most people, but complex enough to not leave the more experienced ones among us wanting more. The devs are great. Killrob frequently posts update videos on the Automation YouTube channel, so not only do you know they're not slacking off, but new features are displayed and discussed. Seriously, the devs are one of the best things about this game. The community is very active on the Automation forums[www.automationgame.com], and various community challenges can keep you occupied in-game.TL;DRBuy it!			"

								I absolutely love the idea of this Car Tycoon game. It works pretty good too, but there's a few things that I think should be noted:There is a lot of emphasis on the engine, while there rest of the components of the car are pretty much ignored. Makers of the game are obviously engine geeks, which isn't bad but I'd like to see more detail in the rest of the components. The design part is very limited. Basically all you do is start with a basic design, push and pull a little here and there (which almost always makes it uglier) and attack fixtures such as lights and doorhandlesm grilles and spoilers. Thats very limited for creative car design, but I'm sure the programming here is not easy.I am very curious to see the tycoon part of the game come to life; For now it's not much fun, gets boring in a hurry, but the tycoon part hopefully makes this about smart design choices and smart management stragegies more than getting an engine to run right.

								Automation is a must own for petrolheads over there. It is still in early development and lacks many features but you can still have hours and hours of fun playing it. In its current state you are only able to create cars and engines, so if you are looking for the tycoon part of the game might be better to wait. Still there is plenty of good things to point right now.- The game offers amazing tutorials, you will definitely learn something about cars and engines in the end of the day. The tutorials will help you a lot in the process of making your car, absolutely no need to be an expert. There is plenty of them but they are all worth watching, they are explained in a very didactic way.- Lots and lots of parts. There is no other game that lets you build a car like automation, while the visual parts of the car lacks features compared to games like NFSU (however you can download more parts through the workshop), the mechanical part is unmatched, from engine blocks to suspensions. You will be able to create a good all around car, or a car for just a specific use. You are able to create cars from 1940 to 2015- Mod support, the workshop offers many more customizations. Car bodies, headlights, hoods, spoilers, handles, rims, etc. This helps the game to grow more and more.- Competent developers. You are able to reach them and ask questions about the upcoming features very easily. Game updates are not being rushed and they are taking their time to polish before the release.- Complete UI. The graphs, numbers and stats of your car are all shown, so you can easily adjust something to reach the desired end of your car. "

								This game is an early access game for sure. No tycoon, yet or multiplayer, yet. But for some strange reason I like this game. I review this game from a perspective where I knew very little about cars. I could only tell you about a few thing but now I actually feel as if I know a little bit about cars. For instance I had no clue how a turbo charger worked but know I have a good knowing of what happens inside the snail shaped pace machine. My friends, who don’t care or know anything about cars, hate this game because they ask why you can’t drive or use the tycoon. I try to explain to them that I want to support these types of games, I like these types of game and the more funds you or me give the faster you will get these features much eagerly awaited.  Once this game gets updated then it will be a premier game. Until then I will be waiting patiently for updates. This game has a long way to go but if more and more people invest things will constantly improve. This game is fun and educational and that is a category I have never been fortunate enough to play until now. That is why I recommend this game to the people who know nothing or everything about cars to learn something and enjoy at the same time. "

								Note: Been playing this for a year prior to todays Steam launch.To date, we only have the Car and Engine designers, and that alone is a great deal of fun. It's hard to write a critical review at this point since the Tycoon part of the game is nowhere to be seen at this point, but if what we have is any indication we have a real gem on our hands. I've spent countless hours (prior to Steam obviously) tinkering with engines and body designs, trying to see just how much horsepower I can eak out of my race cars... Or how powerful can I make a VW bug and keep it cheap? + Easy to learn + Good Realism+ Good Tutorials+ Designers offer decent variety and continue to add new stuff to play with- Updates have been slow, though of good calibre- Being an EA, new visuals are often of draft quality and go through many updates before looking decent...- No Tycoon implementation (yet)- MP features are still work in progresstl;dr; It's very early in this EA title - Major parts of the game are missing. However, excellent car and engine designers that are realistic, and offer plenty of options can keep you busy for hours. If you like cars and/or designing things, buy this now.			"

								AutomationPositives: Brand new never seen before ideas, Really well made car/engine designer, Skies the limit when playing this game, Teaches the main components of an engine and suspension, Constant updates.Negatives: Rather ugly, Glitchy (Early access), No story mode YET.Similarities to other games: There really is none, this game is truly unique apart from the soon coming tycoon part.New to the table: This game is both educational and real fun to play, when I saw it's educational I don't mean it's going to give you an instruction book on how a car works but small and quick to read workings of something found inside of an engine/car. A great designer for both the engine and cars.I believe that one arbitrary number to rate a game is foolish and about as useful as making a review just ""duuh its GUUD"" so thereforth I will use a divided rating system so people can see if the game excels in what they like or fails miserable (e.g. Game scores high in graphics but low in story, this may be a big deal for some people and one number isn't going to tell them anything) Take these ratings with a grain of salt and refer to this when reading them, normally a full 20 would mean it's perfect but I'm basing this system off of my knowledge. 0-5 - Gamebreaker/Poor, 6-10 - Mediocre/Average, 11-15 - Above Average/Great, 16-20 - Excellent/Blew Me AwayGraphics: 8/20This is really something not nice to look at HOWEVER I have heard word that this game is being ported to UE4 so if Graphics is a make or break for you then stick around this game until that happens.Story: 0/20 [AS OF NOW]This game has no story and is currently free and sandbox but please don't ignore it because of this reason, once the tycoon part comes out you can essentially make your own story with your own car company which may be a big success at first but then become a downfall in the oil crisis.Gameplay: 17/20Really is fun to play and i find myself coming back for that quick and snappy UI helping me glide through the creation of a car, Fast UI's can make a game 10x more fun (I'm looking at you MCLA and NFSUC)Optimization: 16/20I had a really hard time giving a number on this one, the game did work pretty well on my mums laptop but there isn't really any amazing graphics to optimize so, it just worked well on my computer.Originality: 19/20This game definetly shines in the fact that it is such an original idea and something that in the bottom of every car enthusiasts hearts being that they want to make their own car and see how it does out there.Conclusion: Let me just say this, yes you can make your own car... sold? There are certain aspects in this game that can be a gamebreaker and majority of them will be fixed in the future of this games developement so please if there is something you do not like about this game just stick with it till it is implemented or fixed.

								Automation is built around three elements; the engine designer, the car designer, and the tycoon. At the time of writing this review the mechanics of the engine and car designer features are more or less fully fleshed out, but tweaks and additional content are being added. The tycoon feature is partially present, but still being built.Before its release on Steam and the implementation of the car designer, I spent at least a hundred hours with the game tinkering with the engine designer. For players with an interest in internal combustion engines, the engine designer on its own is going to take up a lot of your time. Fantasizing about a tiny 1.5 liter turbo I4 with 450 HP? Build it. A smooth, efficient 3.0 liter I6 for a mid-size sedan? Build it. They're all possible, and the level of detail is sufficient to allow for a lot of tinkering, but not so overwhelming that a degree in mechanical engineering is required to not feel overwhelmed.The car designer is impressive, but less so. There are currently several dozen body types and even more variations (a small hatchback can turn into a small pickup truck by lopping off the rear roof, for example). It is possible to modify existing bodies in numerous ways, such as stretching the hood, modifying the slope of the windshield, extending the fenders, and so on. However, it's not possible to design a body from scratch in the game, which is forgivable. The issue is with fixture placement (headlights, taillights, etc). Currently, this can be buggy and tedious. Getting a specific headlight to fit in a specific place can be unnecessarily difficult because some of the bodies have very conservative placement limits to prevent clipping and warping.For those with an interest in cars, the game is an easy purchase. It's easy to understand yet hard to master. The developer has shown themselves to be reliable at updating the game frequently, and actually improving it with each update rather than adding features for the sake of it. There's nothing else like it.			"

								I am proud to say that I have been involved with the project for a while now, and I've got to hand it to the Devs. I bought it because I was interested in cars, but I became more involved after seeing how great the community is.In short, buy it if you're a Motorhead, but stay because of the friendly community. You won't regret it.			"

								It's been 3 days and I've already racked up a solid 30 hours. So immersive especially on first play. The amount of crazy car builds and engine builds you can do in sandbox are ridiculous. And the engines are surprisingly realistic. I've created mock ups of both friends cars and my own and the dyno graphs are quite accurate to real life figures. Your car creations in both sandbox and career mode are rated on comfort, drivability, smoothness, etc. and you can see relatively accurate 0-100 figures (based on power:weight, grip, wheelspin, gearing, etc.), top speeds (based on aerodynamics, gearing, etc.), fuel economy (aerodynamics, engine efficiency, weight, driving wheels, transmission, etc.) which are really interesting. They even look relatively accurate. Although some of the sportiness, offroad, etc. ratings are sometimes out, they still provide a good rating system and encourage you not to just chuck the biggest engine in the smallest car you can find. Career mode is overwhelmingly complex and immersive, even if it still is in development. You get to determine the sizes of factories, the amount of shifts and quality control anad you get target markets for different areas. People will also buy based on reputation and the career mode can start any time between like the 30s or 40s to the current day, with engine technologies and consumer markets based around those time periods. It offers a new level of depth and involvment for when I eventually get bored of sandbox. Yes the game has a few bugs. But the developers have worked really well on both ironing them out and delivering new content. You really see the commitment from the devs in this game. The bugs aren't game destroying either, they are minor hiccups that occasionally occur if you run the game for too long. All in all, it is definitely worth my $30 for the amount of hours I am going to get out of it. For any car fan or engine nut, this game provides plenty of entertainment. 10/10 would reccomend.			"

Early Access Review
								I've always been frustrated that there was never a true ""Car-Building Simulator"" on the market. Being an engineering student I’ve always been intrigued by well put together simulation games. Several days ago I was looking around to see if any games had recently released that would peak my interest and to my luck I came across this gem.  Even in this stage of the games development this early access version seamlessly incorporates the engineering aspects of car manufacturing, with a strong focus on the engine itself. I've always been an automobile enthusiast, so this game naturally came to my attention, but initially I was worried that I would struggle to play through the game as I was not very experienced with the terminology and internals of automobile engines. Automation was very presentable and surprisingly helpful as I started off. As I progressed in the pursuit of the perfect car the game gave me insightful videos that explained and simplified each aspect of the motor, as well as proper detail on the external parts of the vehicle itself. Obviously not being a final release the team still has work to finish but it seems like they consistently update the game, which is great. Despite not being close to a final cut, the first day that I purchased this game I nearly spent 6 hours just simply fine tuning my machine to my desire. Honestly I could only imagine what the upcoming updates will bring. Hopefully in the future we can come to see more car design options, as well as more in-depth car customization, and more engine customization and detail. Though the future looks bright for this game and I hope that the developers continue to work hard towards delivering a fantastic product!I wonder if there is a suggestion board that I could potentially give ideas on?

								First off this is based on the Early Access experience I've had. So there are a few bugs that pop up and there is a lot of content still in the pipe line.I really enjoy a good tycoon game (there is no tycoon part implemented yet). I'm a big car fan. So I figured I would give this a shot. I'm pleasantly surprised at how the game plays and how enjoyable it is.There is a really good tutorial system which is complete enough to get you up to speed. With the tutorials and the in game feedback you should up and running designing engines and cars.This game is really in depth. the first car you design if you watch all the tutorials along the way will take well over an hour. After you have designed 2 or 3 cars you can crank one out in a few minutes and then if you want spend over an hour tweaking it to exactly how you the the car to be.  I really enjoy shaving a few seconds off the cars lap time and seeing how much faster I can get it to go around the track.I'm really impressed with now well they mimic real life into a simulation. Take a real world car and make it in Automation, You get close to the same HP, MPG top speed, 0-60 and other benchmarks as the real world counterpart. The engine designer scenarios are a lot of fun. Make an engine within certain guidelines sounds easy. Some of the scenarios are really easy others are down right brutal as it states in the scenario.Complete car designer scenarios are a bit trickier if not more rewarding at the end. If you are into simulation games and like cars I would give it a go. "

Early Access Review
								This is a story about potential. If you like management games, business games and games where you design and create something, this will be definitely up your alley. Be aware that right now, the game is still somewhat early in its development stage.You can already create a variety of engines, be it inline 4 or 6 cylinder ones or V6 and V8 engines. There are options to turbocharge your creations as well. However, all of this comes with the ability to customise almost every part of what you create in great detail and realism. To help with the mechanical engineering jargon and explaining what everything you touch does, the game comes equipped with a rather comprehensive set of tooltips and narrated videos, which will help you understand what parts of the engine do what. Especially this latter part is worthy of applause, since you will not only understand the game better and have more fun, you will also gain some actual knowledge of the workings of engines, suspensions and so on.The game aims to be along the lines of Motor City, where you will create your own car company, build factories, design cars, engines and then sell them on the market through various good or turbulent times. The campaign is currently not yet implemented, but it is the one aspect I am truly thrilled about.The creator part of the game is already pretty amazing in itself; designing engines and then testing them is a lot of fun, despite the fact that (right now) there's nothing else you can do with them, except put them in a chasis and have the car run a test track.But, again, if you like these kinds of games, I strongly recommend you keep an eye on this one. It'll be a gem!			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game for about 2 years so here is the first review on STEAM.Updates and developing of the game:I have never played a game where developers keep you updated all the time what they working on and how hard they work so you know what to expect from next small/large update as was this one.They kept us updated on Facebook and youtube maybe once a week/two weeks.So 5 stars for hard work and constantly updating and developing this game.Gameplay/Graphics/Sound/etc. :First of all, it is very easy to use. Whether you are new to game or you are profesional car mechanic working with engines on daily basis this game is good for everyone who loves either to biuld (like) a real engines what existed or just create moster engines and 2000bhp. Like I said it is easy for everyone.If you still not sure there are tutorials for every element about the car/engine and they are very helpfull.Graphics are just beautifull. Very very nice graphics. Engines look better than real engines :DAlso you can use US/UK (metric/imperial) untis in a game to suit eveyone.You can create anything and everyhting. The only limitation is your mind.Let's say you want to create the most powerfull car what goes around the track super fast regarless money/budget.So you can start shaping up your cars body followed by adding lights, grilles, vents/ exaust pipes....Remeber you will need big enough grill for you moster engine :)When you happy with your cars body and chassis off course all from carbon fibre :D than you can move on to make an engine for it.Again you will start by chosing material for you engine blocks and pistons and rods, followed by chosing massive turbos and chosing air flow and pressure boost, followed by compresion and how rich you want your engine to run. When you are happy with you engine test it and THEN you can adjust it/tweak and SEE RESULTS IN REAL TIME.Don't need to adjust it and test and adjust it and test it, just tweak it and see result real time in diagrph.Also every selection you make it tells you what is cost, weight, economy, max rpm, max torque . . . . you can all details about your selections.SO once you happy with engine you put it in a car and then you chose type of gearbox/clutch, spacing, type of wheels and how wide/big you want them to be, off course carbon fibre brakes 6 piston calibers :D because why not :D we have got money and we want overkill brakes :DAnd once you happy with everything test you car on track see the results. time, acceleration/stopping distance, G-forces , drag/downforce, fuel consuption and so all the details are there.Again, if you not 100% happy with car/engine you can go back and tweak to absolute maximum and SEE RESULTS IN REAL TIME and then you can test it again around the track.SO, even if you are type of person who doesn't like these kind of game, you should buy it, it will drag you in and it is fun. You can also do SCENARIOS where you have got orders what type of engine your client is looking for and these are good to test how good you are in making engines. When you have limited budget but what good reliable engine with good prformance BUT also good fuel consuption.And also developers are doing awesome job, they always tell you what they working on, what they will be working on in future and keep you updated all the time.Do I like this game? No, I LOVE ITDo I recommend this game? Strongly recommended to everyoneP.S. Alo I forgot to say the sound of those engines, whether you trying to replicate like a F1 engine it will sound like F1 car or muscle 10 litres V12 and it will sound like it.Like I said the only limitaiton is your mind. ;)			"

								For a simulation of the whole R&D process for an automobile, this is surprisingly accurate.  Especially the engine design area, which takes me back to my R&D days.  The pros/cons of this early access are.  Pros:1. Extremely detailed build section2. The engine development section.Cons:1. limited engine types. (V12, V10, wankle, diesel, etc).2. turbo charger types limited (also unable to develop your own).Recommendations:1. Would enjoy a turbo design section. (variable/set vane diffusion, adjustable a/r, etc).2. Would enjoy making a decision between diesel/gasoline. (as a possible dlc).Overall for an early access game it is surprisingly sound.  From my perspective the developers see quality and attempt to attain it before they let an update out to the community.  I recommend this game to all of my freinds. I will be expectantly watching this games direction of development.  "

								If you you are a petrolhead, want to learn more about cars and want to you use your brain, this the game for you! You can create cars and engines from scratch and then test them on the track. You can build engines as small as 250 cc or a 10L v8 with more than 2000hp! The company manager which involves manufacturing cars, selling them and competing with other car manufacturers is being developed now.In the curent state, you buy this game for the engine and car designer, you create lots of different engines (currently only I4, I6 and V8's) and turbocharge them or natural aspirated and put them in 35 different types of cars at the moment.There are also a lot of scenario's you can play which provide you a challenge and a good laugh. I have played the game more than 50 hours before the steam early access and this game is certainly worth the money in the current state.			"

Even if you're not, like myself, designing engines and cars is a great way to get interested and understand how cars work. There are tutorials all the way along explaining what each setting is for. Learning stuff in a game? Who'da thunk it. Dev team is great as well, constantly keeping you informed about what their plans are 5*			"

								I backed this game a long time ago and would estimate to have accumulated more than 100 hrs by now - which is quite a lot considering what the game has to offer in its current state.Make no mistake - Automation is a very promising game. I would consider the general level of detail regarding engine and vehicle design to be fairly high, though it certainly could be more detailed in places. The main problem of the game is that there's simply nothing to do apart from designing vehicles and this does get old at some point. No one has yet seen the tycoon mode, which IMO should be the main focus of the game (after all, it's in the title). More information about that mode was promised to be provided around Christmas of last year (IIRC), however, no such information was ever published. How detailed is that ominous tycoon mode going to be? Will it ever be released? Will the team run out of money before this, IMO most important, milestone?The truth is, not much has happened with the game in the past few months, possibly even the last year. Even small changes seem to take an inordinate amount of time to be implemented. The GUI was redesigned a couple of times (IMO too often) - sometimes with questionable effects. Little things were added (especially with this Steam version, like more options for brakes, active aero and so forth) - but these are minute additions. It seems like time is being wasted. A look at the roadmap also reveals plans for competitive engine and vehicle design multiplayer modes. Really? Why is valuable development time being spent on something like this? I honestly cannot imagine anyone craving for something like that as it's basically moving sliders around against the clock. I have to reiterate at this point that I love the general idea of the game - and do hope with all my heart that we will all live to see the game live up to its potential - but I remain in doubt. Too many early access programs have failed spectacularly and this has all the signs pointing to such failure. Still, I can only recommend this game, hoping that, indeed, developmental pace will pick up after this Steam release (as promised).			"

								     Automation is not only a game capable of soaking up countless hours of your free time, but it is a useful tool to expand your knowledge of automobiles and how the different parts interact to affect the characteristics of the complete car.     Before I started messing around in automation, I knew all of the basics of how cars worked, but I did not know how everything connected. Automation has been an incredibly effective teaching tool for me. Now I know how Air-Fuel fuel ratios affect compression, how an oversquare engine revs higher while generating less torque then a comparable displacement undersquare engine, and many other tuning aspects.     I am looking forward very much to the completed tycoon game mode, as you should also be. It will complete this simulator making so you can waste even more of your time playing it, not that it's a complete waste of your time. You could be doing much worse things then blowing 4 hours in automation, you could be stabbing a homeless person. Or drowning your sorrows in booze. And while things like these and other activities like them are fine in moderation, you certainly do not want to spend all your time doing them. "

								Another one of these games where the concept of early access is letting the players down. It's still basically a tech demo. Wait until they finish the game. If they ever do.This review is not meant to be disrespectful in any way. This is a review based on how I've experienced the product. There has been much hope, and wishes. This could be so great!But the actual experience so far has been a tech demo, where you can have fun building cars. But within a very very short time, you will have done everything that can be done in the game.The list of promises and ""to do's"" from the developers is great, but doesn't get anywhere. The tycoon part is flawed, and not realy anything yet. It will come. But as of writing, they're still focused on the game engine.This has been 2 years in the making, and the game has not gone that far since the first release. (In a technical way, yes, but not much other than smoothing out bugs and basic gameplay so far.All the promises about features? No.If you're chasing promises and potential, this is a game for you.You'll have fun for a long while, with that potential being there, slightly out of reach. Hang out with the (really nice (y)) developers in the forums, make some wishlists, read about other people's wishlists, and then make more wishlists. Read some lists about upcoming features, and if you stay positive enough, you will forget that the lists have looked the same since the concept was shown to us from the beginning.If you're chasing a great game, hold on for a while. Wait untli this game is finished, or wait until there's a competitor game that won't stay in development hell. I think there's a pretty good chance that other games will pop up with this idea.My main issue is about the early access part. As I seem to have paid into an idea, not a real working game. This project seems to be lacking focus. This isn't made by competent personel (which I honestly can't blame them for, there's tons of valid reasons for that). This isn't Prison Tycoon. This isn't Kerbal Space Program. This is a mess.But when it's about accessing my, or your money, and we've been promised a game. This doesn't deliver. + It IS fun, build your cars for a while. Test out about a dozen of ideas (build time ~5 minutes each) then repeat. Do some weird ideas, then repeat.+ Great fan community+ They go for the details. This is for car people, made by car people- You've done everything the game can throw at you in a really short time. - The game has not been very stable so far, and now they're rebuilding everything again, which could mean good things, but also new bugs.- Lots of features that doesn't add anything. Tycoon mode is useless. You build your car, but the other features are more like a fidget cube, with sliders and options that doesn't do anything.			"

								I've been playing Automation since it was first released and I really enjoyed how far it has come. There are some limitation but they are easily overcome with the mods that are currently available in the Workshop. If you like cars and always wanted to create your own, this game is for you.			"

								I simply cannot find anything negative about this game. If you aren't trying to successfully run your automotive company in the Lite Campaign, you're in the Sandbox building unimaginable cars and powerful engines. The workshop community is top rated, pumping out new material almost daily. You'll never run out of new cars to build, new engines to throw a rod in. Automation is not just for the strict gearhead. The massive tutorials and YouTube video support can get even the most rookie person in the game, and building and understanding aspects of the car and engines. Highly recommended!			"

								Currently, as I write this review, I have logged 1.7 hours into Automation.  And I do not regret any single second of that time.I have purchased a few early-access games over the last few months, and for the most part, I've been disappointed.  Lack of content, polish, or just a general lack of interest in playing them again.  I can already tell that Automation is not going to be one of those games, and I am extremely excited for what the future holds for this game.  As it stands at the time of this review, Automation is fleshed out pretty well.  The graphics are decent, and the engines look beautiful.  In terms of car aesthetics, there is some left to be desired.  There aren't exactly a lot of options, however, there's enough to work with to keep you coming back.  The engines are just outrageously beautiful.  Scenario mode is quite a lot of fun, if not somewhat challenging (that's not a bad thing).  But my real interest lies in Sandbox mode.  When I was younger, me and one of my best friends were obsessed with cars.  We created a fake brand name, drew up ideas for models and specifications.  I had forgotten about all of that up until now: and it's simply amazing to see some of the ideas we had become rendered in three-dimension.  I will admit that there is a ton of tutorials, some of which are kind of grueling to watch.  However, it's more or less a necessity, and you can learn quite a lot about automobiles from them, so if you're not mechanically inclined, it's an educational experience.  In terms of realism and simulation?  Well, this game pretty much gets it to a T.  It's extraordinarily accurate.  To test it out, I built a car based on an actual one: specifically, a 1998 Ford Crown Victoria.  Surprisingly, one of the models looked quite like the real car, so I chose it and made it look aesthetically similar to the real one.  Then, the real meat of the simulation: recreating the engine.  I won't go into all the heavy detail, so to save some time, I'll sum it up: I chose the V8 engine, selected the actual parts, crank, cam, the correct ratios, etc., all based on the real car.  When it all came out in the wash during the testing process, I was shocked at how dead-on accurate the engine audio sounded (I own the same car in real life).  My virtual Crown Victoria ended up rating at 202 HP and 268 ft. lbs. of torque (as opposed to 200 and 275, respectively, from actual factory specifications).  I couldn't believe it.In short, if you have any interest in cars whatsoever, buy this game right now.  I haven't encountered any bugs, but the game has crashed once.  It can only get better from here, which is what excites me.  I'll probably come back and edit this after the next two modes are released, but I'm sure I'll have nothing more than positive words.			"

This game gives you the opportunity to build a car, truck or SUV from the ground up I especially enjoy the engine design which is quite in depth. If you are a car guy/girl this game is definitly for you the developers are always releasing new updates with more toys to play with and the game as it stands is quite enjoyable already.

								This game is fun here's where the game stands for now:- No campaign- No multiplayer- Awesome Car design- Awesome Engine design- Educative Tutorials (even if you knew nothing at all about cars, they could teach everything... literally)- Scenarios are challenging and add flesh to the Early Access- The Devs keep the audience up to date very often- The game is making great progress- This game has been given love and care and will have a bright future (unlike other games *cough* ubisoft multiplayer*cough*)- It doesn't need an amazing computer to run on very good graphics- Attention to detail is stunningQuestion that matters: Is this game worth the price?Yes at this moment if:- You are a petrolhead- You like cars- You like engines- You want to make your own carsPS: My friend bought this game and is ""horrible"" at car designs, and was at ease with the game. Loves it.To whom do I not recoment this game?- People who are not fans of sandbox (not worth to pour full price for scenarios only) "

								Even though it is still in early access, the game already features awesome controls and insight into pratically all the details of a car.I love how it gives control into so many details of the car. The engine, for example, can be configured in almost any way imaginable and the best part is you get to see graphs on how it performs! The detail this game goes into to is just so impressive!The tutorials are incredibly clear and insightful, you will not only know what each part does, but how it does it with the correct terminology whilist still being understandable to a 13 year old.I can say it is well worth the money.If you like cars, and specially engines, then you will love this. If you just want to learn about cars, this is next best thing than to work on your own.			"

								I've bought this game before it went on Steam, and found out that an adult man can spend waaay more time designing cars and engines, than decency allows.This game is supposed to be car tycoon game - it is not that yet. If you are looking for a game that has all the features of company management - well then... ""these aren't the droids you are looking for"". At least not yet. This part of the game is coming.HOWEVER - the car designer, with the insanely good engine designer are amazing! I've had a blast building the models of my company in 1947 and 1952, shortly followed by 1957 sports car. Of course you can jump into the sandbox and build car from any era starting in 1940 - I just like to do the whole history of my company, including the older models.This game is already a jewel, when it comes to the design part. If you use, on top of all that's in the game already, also the mods from the forums (which are ridiculously easy to install) - you have an almost complete car designer.The community seems to be very engaged in this game, the forum is a fascinating plays, and the automation hub, that recently launched, should soon be a great place for automaniacs from all over the world.I can absolutely recommend this game if you love cars. If you love tycoon games - well... then wait for the tycoon part to be added ;).I bought it - and I'm happy. The work devs did until now, and are constantly doing, is just great!			"

								I delayed buying this game for several months.  I purchased it after I saw the developers making regular updates and lite campaign mode.  Within the first 5 minutes of this game, I made what I wished the laferrari engine was.  A 3 liter twin turbo V12, 900 HP demon spawn that revved to the moon.  The interface is easy to use, there's always helpful tips (maybe 14:1 compression is a bit high?), and lite campaign shows promise despite glitches.  I was able to make 20 billion after a few tries.  Anxiously awaiting the unreal engine graphics update!			"

								I got this at least a year ago on a whim and decided to wait until the tycoon part started to flesh out to write a review. When I originally got this the only engine options were L4s and V8s and a pretty good selection of cars to sandbox with. At the time of this review there are L3,4, and 6s, and v6,8 and 12s. L4&6 turbos and V6,8, and 12 twin turbos as well. Campaign is now in the ""Lite"" stage where they're fixing bugs and finalizing the competition and calcuations, which is very fun by itself. The vehicles have become much more varied and there is a very active workshop community uploading new vehicles and body pieces at least twice a week. I play this at least 6 days a week and still haven't gotten bored of it, the content and updates just keep coming with new stuff to expirement and I love it. I had at first thought it was going to be similar to gearhead garage (man I miss that game) in it's final stage, and I'll admit I bought it hoping it would be a spiritual sequel, but it's in a section by itself with car games to me. This is THE car game for tinkerers and mechanics, the freedom is practically endless (want to make a 15 liter v8 and put it in a compact pickup for science? Do it) and the boundaries expand every other day. I'm hoping they eventually add diesels and L5s but for now I have more than enough to play around with and have no doubts that I'll still be playing it at this time next year, with diesels and L5s.

								*********(Warning) This product is addicting, but better for you than crack or Red Heads...********So I hate Early Access games...  They are like presidential campaign promises, rarely ever fulfilled and usually forgotten after a couple years...  That being said, the folks making this game have put a hell of a lot of work into what it is right now, and are putting even more work into making it better... IT IS WHAT AN EARLY ACCESS GAME SHOULD BE... As of right now it is not a full featured game, actually it's oddly not even a game at all just a car design tool simple enough for anyone to use, but well rounded enough not seem, well i'll just use the same old settings...The game aspect, as of now,  comes from setting goals for yourself.   There seems to be a really awesome community forming up on the automation game forums and while I've never done any of them there are regular competitions to design the uber car for whatever segment... Pretty much everything on the steam page holds true.  The tycoon aspect is barely there.  The car design tools are pretty awesome, and right now they are trying to move it all to the Unreal engine.  System requirments, right now as I can't speak to future ont he unreal engine, aren't supper stressful.  I can play it on my Surface III with integrated graphics and an Atom processor witht he graphics set to low.  I have put oddly 506 hours into this game, mostly just goofing around while watching tv relaxing.  I've filled my stable multiple times only to delete them all and start over again looking for that perfect car company.  I litterally catch myself planning out ideas for cars in my head when I should be doing other things.  I recomend it if you want to just relax and make cool fictional cars or try to recreat real cars to some extent within the parameters fo the game... If you want a tycoon game, it'es not there YET...			"

If they continue on and finish it the way I imagine it will be then CIV5 would be no contestor.ProsPetrolhead heaven, highly realistic, precise, intersting, broad, awesome community, great forum, for few people working on it --> very good customer care etc. etc. It is worth more than it costs here.ConsAdictive, the updates come slower than You wished, but again I have to go back to pros, they deliver quality over rushed products, which puts me back to pros, this is really quality content.

Early Access Review
								In terms of a car design / development simulator this is already a very sophisticated, stable and polished product. The fact that it is termed 'early access' is only because there is so much more to come - in the way of the Tycoon part of the game. This is a very ambitious project being undertaken by a very committed team; one of the most professional 'early access' releases I've seen. Like many people I have made a few ealry access purchases Ive regretted, but not this one. I think the sheer popularity of the subject matter will generate the financial support necessary for this one to come to fruition if done right - as it has been so far.You don't get to drive the cars (or shoot at anyone, etc), but that is not the intention here at all; this is not GTA or a racing sim. If you have long hankered for a really good tycoon sim based on automobiles, it appears to be in the making here. Of course the 'tycoon sim' part is yet to come, but with this game you actually get very detailed control of the design, capability and quality of the cars you will be selling (in a way that is far, far beyond other games that claim to let you 'design your own').  That part of the game is here now, and is for all intents and purposes finished.  The main benefit of buying at this stage is that you will have had time to master car & engine design by the time the tycoon part is ready.  If your understanding of car & engine design is a bit limited that time will be worth spending. And it's really not a grind. Although fairly complex it is all explained and presented in a very consumable fashion, and you'd have to be uninterested in the subject matter in the first place not to learn a lot here.   If the Tycoon part is essential to you then of course wait - but if you want to get the hang of developing engines & building cars early, this is street-ready.			"

Early Access Review
								Review date March 23rd, 2017Early Access pre-unreal 4 portThe Car Company Tycoon Game at this point the state of the game is fairly stable.  It allows you to morph basic car templates from trucks to sports cars.  You may then add trim features select drive types and engine placement.  From there you can configure engines I4, I6, V6, V8, Flat plan V8 and V12.  From there you can adjust the bore and stroke*, head configuration, aspiration type*, crude cam profile*, compression, fuel ratio and timing.  From there you can configure fuel delivery system and exhaust.   After that you configure the transmission and tire setup along with the suspension.  Once you complete the engine you can run it and tune it on the dyno.  With the completed car you run it on a 2d test track where it automatically runs the courses.  Then you setup up you factories and put it into production.The car building has a decent amount of detail built into it.  The engine design is even more robust, will still allow you to make configurations that wouldn’t actually work and I hope that would be addressed by release.  At any rate it’s the best part of the game so far.The track testing is basic, this might disappoint many but I think with more test tracks it’s ok for this type of game.  The factory aspect is a complete cluster, extremely unintuitive and doesn’t communicate all the things you might want to do or see.  Example on my 2nd car I couldn’t just use the engine from my first car even though it was exactly the same.  I expect stuff like that to be worked out down the road.As a game, it’s too crude at this point to give a fair review of.  I will say from what they have now my expectations are very low for this aspect of the game.  I contrast this with some high expectation for the car and engine building aspects.  If you are into cars and building I think you will enjoy it as tycoon gamer the jury is still out.*Bore & Stroke:  They are loosely linked by that I mean between the margins they work independently like you would expect at the extremes they become linked.*Cam Profile:  This is just a slider, so you aren’t selecting the duration or lift at this point.  I find with most builds you are frequently using a more aggressive setting than you would think would be needed to get the engine in decent state of tune.  This needs work even if they leave it basic.*aspiration type:  Currently is limited to turbo chargers "

Early Access Review
Update as of 2015.03.25I've got sixteen hours in the game right now and so I'm ready to give some impressions. Understanding that this is an Early Alpha game and what that entails, here goes:From the standpoint of gameplay, there's a lot to like here currently. Primarily there are the scenarios and the sandbox. The scenarios give the player various challenges that require tweaking an engine or a car to meet certain goals. It's a good way to understand not only how the game works, but also what is involved with enhancing a car or engine, not simply slapping parts together. The sandbox is where the player can design a car and it's associated engine with technologies limited to the simulated year, starting in 1940 and continuting to the present day. To help the player ""make interesting decisions"" (to quote Sid Meiers) the game provides a critique of the final product in five catagories: Drivability, Sportiness, Comfort, Prestige and Safety. Additionally the player can also set his or her own goals, like keeping down costs or achieving a certain performance milestone, like a 0-62 time or top speed. There are a couple of test tracks where a sim driver (not you) drives the car and record a time which can be compared to other times. Additional test tracks are now available from fans via the forum. In addition to the above two modes of play, there are also plentiful videos that explain pretty much every aspect of designing a car and engine. They are very well done and reasonably comprehensive. The videos play when you first try to use or tweak certain functions or features in the game, like the first time you add a turbocharger or adjust suspension. It's nice that way because you don't get the information till you need it.The game is missing its campaign portion, but that's been well advertised here on the Store page. It's in Alpha after all. Also there are limitations to the depth of the sandbox, for instance right now you are limited to inline four and six cylinder engines plus V8 types. Also there are a good many but not comprehensive amount of starting bodies.And there are bugs. I've come across a number of non-fatal LUA pop-ups, usually because I've been adding or deleted files outside of the game structure or been clicking the buttons to switch screens and menus too fast. Also there is a bit of a nasty bug that sometimes causes a car you create to not be saved when you exit the game. The bug has been reported and is actually pretty easy to avoid.Graphically the game is far from cutting edge but it has all the graphic quality a player needs, there's nothing that limits what a player can do because of any limitation of the graphics. The developers seem involved on the Steam and their own forum. And in something I can't recall seeing before, they have actually responded to pretty much all of the negative reviews, answering questions and requesting details on what troubles folks might be encountering. That's a nice thing to do, especially since as I understand there are only three of them.So, do I recommend this game? With the qualifications that it is in Early Access, rough around the edges and not having all the planned final content, I can say that I do recommend this game.			"

The community behind the game is what makes it better, in my opinion, with challenges and car threads and such.Can't forget to mention how active the Developers are in mentioning new features, and helping with bugs and discussing features to come.

								I've been playing this game for a while before it came out on early access, and honestly just the engine designer alone is a work of art, Its really rare to see a game that is so in depth about making cars, mostly because these are two fields (game making and automotive engineering) that don't often intersect. This means that Automation, (while still  a bit rough around the edges) is a completely unique game that has already broken new ground in the world of automotive games.			"

								I, personally, am a huge gear/petrol head. I love to work on cars doing anythig from simple maintanence, to aftermarket upgrades. This game has eveything I have ever wanted in a car designing game. It has wonderful animations, amazing customization for both the body and engine, and even though the company design isnt out yet, I have fun imagining how the public would view my cars. I can not wait until this feature is added to the game. Even if you are not a gear head, it's super fun to just play around with the engine tool to see if you can make the best engine possible. The only real cons I can think of are A.) not enough engine style choices yet. There are only V8's, V plane 8's, I6's, and I4's. They promise there will be more in the near future. And B.) they changed it from the original versions, before the steam greenlight, where you could change and add some body features, like adding wings, and more headlights if you want to make a version that is a rally car. I really hope they change this so that I won't have to start over every time I want to make a ""sport model"" and just want to add a front lip, bigger exhaust tips, and a wing to the current model for instance. I should also add that I bought this game before it's release on steam, and I fid myself coming back to in constantly.			"

								I recently activated my steam code for Automation, but I've played it quite a bit before it was released on steam. For those interested in engine and car design, this is the best simulation out there. The game is still in early access, but the engine designer is fantastic and you can already design complete cars.There are a ton of options in terms of the different engines you can create, and also quite a number of different car bodies, layouts and specifications. The game is also a great way to learn about engines and the various challenges that designers face when trying to create an engine that is powerful, reliable and economical while trying to keep the manufacturing costs down.Currently the scenarios are the best part of the game as they require you to design engines and cars within specific parameters, offering a very interesting challenge and a feeling of accomplishment when you achieve your goals. As of now none of the ""car company tycoon"" management aspects of the game have been implemented yet. Once they do, this game will become even better than it already is, but even as it stands there is enough content to keep you playing for hours. Highly recommended!			"

								Hey guys,It's a great game and for what it is now it has some serious options you can do in it.The thing u do is: pick a model for the car, make it your own, do some serious detailing in accesories and drivability. Then you make the enigne, model it the way you like (going from inline-4 to V-12), put it in the car and you're done. It's easy, but that makes it accesable to everyone, even people who don't have anything to do with cars and designing. There are even tutorials that explain the goal of parts inside the engine. It's great fun!Though it needs some updates (extra engines and detailed possibilities), but it's really nice and takes you further into engine and car design than any other game would do.This game can make it very far because of its possibilities (in the game itself and the upcoming updates) I recommend it to every car/design fan!Cheers mates ;)			"

Most people think that this game is only for people that know everything about cars but the tutorials will teach you everything about engines and cars. Most people out there probably don't want to spend $30 bucks on a game that is in early access, being built by company you probably never heard of before but this small team is amazing. It is slow but very steady as there have been no exuses for a long time without updates. The best part is you can basically run this game on a potato.would I reccommend it ? hell ya			"

								If you're really into cars and are somewhat confident with what makes a car work (or even if you're not, try the tutorials), I would 100% recommend this game.If you're anything like me, you've drawn your own cars before, and have imagined making your own and selling them. Automation basically lets you do this, allowing you to design every single part of your car, from the body, chassis and cosmetic design, to the engine configuration, cam profile and compression ratio.Here are some of the pros and cons:+ Infinite possibilties. Family cars, muscle cars, sports cars, luxury cars, hyper cars, pickups...+ You have to ability to custom design your car to your liking.+ The latest feature, the Lite Campaign, allows you to get a taste of what the final game will be like. Create your own company, precisely choose your starting conditions (starting cash, engineers, competitor markups, etc.) then play through from 1946 to 2020 building whatever cars you want, while researching new technologies and trying not to bankrupt yourself by building a full carbon fibre 3-door hatchback with a 50hp 12L V12.+ An active, kind and helpful community.+ Hundreds of mods to download from the Steam workshop to add to the design potential.+ The developers are constantly updating users with what the next updates will include, when they will arrive and what will and will not make it into the final game, all via the official Automation page and the official Automation YouTube channel- Poorly optimized currently, however, this is due to change with the port over to the Unreal 4 engine sometime around Christmas this year.- The game is not yet finished, meaning the full extent of the final games content (Boxers, V16's, I2's, I5's, I8's, Diesels, etc.) is not yet implemented, however there is still tens of hours of fun (I've currently played over 200 hours and plan to play even more still).- Difficult for people who don't have an atleast moderately detailed knowledge of how a car works (specifically the engine), however this can be learned relatively quickly.Overall, Automation is a brilliant game and I highly recommend it.In its current state, I would give it a 9/10, however be aware that this is likely to change (for the better) with the final release, coming sometime mid-late 2017.

								I got this game about 4 months before it launched on steam. in that time i have played easily 100+ hoursi give it a 9/10 due to it being unfinished but the plan is to include everything they can into the game.right now you get inline 4&6 along with 2 types of V8 that you can make almost any size.they want to include..inline 3-8'sv 6-16'sboxter 4&6... they might not stop there. as it stands there is not a masive amount of stuff in the game BUT they are adding to it to build an amazing tycoon game.this game will let you build anything from a tiny 0.3L econobox all the way up to an 11L musclecar/puckup/suv... whatever you want.watch the vids, you can build anything you want and they are only just getting into steam early access.i built a mid engine supercar with 1600+ hp that does just over 300 mph. on the other hand i built an ecobox that seats 5 and gets 58 mpg. i made a puckup truck with a 4.8L V8 making about 200 HP as a ford f150 clone because i could.i made a DB5 clone with a good sounding inline 6 and a good laptime around top gear test track (its the airfield track in the vid)you can make your car as nice or cheap as you want, basic interior, go ahead... hand crafted rolls royce clone, go ahead...the game only has a sandbox mode and a challenge mode right now BUT it is addictive. they will be adding a single player mode that starts you in the 1940's and runs to 2020. as time goes on you get better tech and new body shapes to start with. as an example you start with drum brakes but you get disk, vented disk, and carbon ceramic. TLDR: you can custom build your cars threw time starting in 1940 and ending in 2020.			"

The engine creator is really top notch and allows you to really get involved with the mechanics. Great internal views of the rotating parts as well as the valvetrain that you really cannot find anywhere. Sure the game is limited at this point but this really has a lot of potential to be amazing. Cannot wait for new engines and the supercharger to be put in the game. Keep up the awesome work!			"

								After playing around with the sandbox mode i think this game is totally worth the price, it is an exelllent game (Both fun and educational) it teaches you about the internal combustion engine and the components within it. I feel even after only playing for a couple of hours, my knowledge of engines has dramatically increased! the only issue i have (which i cannot fix) is that the game has no sound, i do not know if this is a common bug at the moment but it does hinder the gameplay as you cannot hear the engine (which would be nice). Overall this game is very solid with only a few bugs (but this is still early access so that is to be expected). anyone who likes engines and car design should buy this. The only improvments i could see for this game is letting the user drive the car they have built as this would give a much better idea of how the car handles, brakes and accelerates (as opposed to a positive or negative values for the oversteer/understeer etc.) and in turn this would make the car easier to set up as you would have a first hand point experience of the car. I would also like to see more engine types such as rotarys or the ability to make hybrids (like the Mclaren P1 etc. or the Toyota Prius). if i had to rate this game out of ten it would be an 8/10.

								AutoMation. While not finished, is the perfect game for engine engineering. This game really is perfect if you want to learn how to make a good engine, from a good power band to making the engine strong enough to handle the power.Honestly if the developers added in EcoBoost and Multi-Air then this would be completly perfect for testing out engines for yourself.Now, you can do body stuff, you could make a Miata rival or a altered Corvette. The only thing is, the bodies are preset.So you can't really make a body from scratch. So if you want to make something totally unseen you can't make a new body, you have to choose an existing one.But that's not a bad thing, because this game does have workshop. In short, I absolutely recommend this game for the Car Girl/Guy who wants to know what it's like to own a Car Company.			"

								Automation was a lot of fun when I first discovered it in 2013 and played the free 4 cylinder demo. I then got the full version and had a decent amount of fun with the other engine types that were released. Which are V8, Inline 6, V6, V12 and now I3 engines.This is without question the best simulation for building and designing combustion engines and just getting some more performance or improvement out of your engine can be extreme fun.From there it only goes downhill. I found the other parts are totally dissapointing, with the low point being the lite campaign that was released a few days ago. It is a full letdown. I held off from writing a review but this confirmed my fears what can be expected from this game in finished state. The campaign feels more like a software for video editing than a game, you are basically just clicking from one modal window to the next, and if you quit before the entire process completed your progress is lost. If you're not painting something on a piece of paper and use spreadsheets you're going to see almost nothing in terms of presentation.The second problem is that it hangs in E/A for much to long, year after year after year. The developers now decided to port the game to a new engine which basically means that the waiting starts over again. I have seen screenshots that looked like from a completely different game, so by the track record of this project, it could take many more years still.The game at time also had a great amount of bugs, there are constantly values lost and the famous ""LUA Errors"" especially if you click the tabs out of order. The save system is awful, you never know when what gets overwritten and better manage your files manually from outside.I can however still recommend this for the engine designer, if you skip the other parts.PROSthe ultimate engine designerSOSOcar designer is an acceptable but pretty mediocre partCONSall other partsprogrammingUPDATE 20170103The funny thing is, this game saves everything you do all the time because their amazing programmer could find no other way to keep the state of variables consistent from one of his window to the other. So he stores everything to disk immediately and loads it back whenever a windows opens, totally circumventing the purpose of RAM memory in computers. Before they introduced this novelty I have seen this game crash often and badly, it was like badly written VBA only worse. I guess it took them halfway through this project to realize the difference between local and global variables. That's why they came up with this save-on-mouseclick memory.Thats also why you have to use this odd ""remember settings"" button on the left as soon as you can, otherwise you will eventually totally ♥♥♥♥ up hours of work once you realize there is nothing to load from disk beside what you already see in the window. Oh and when you restored the values, click it immediately again because restoring also erases the stored values.Even better is to have a near perfect memory or a notebook in front of you where you write all important values, because you can already prepare your self that sooner or later you will lose all your work anyhow. Without going into the fact that the car directory screen is totally unworkable if you have more than 1 page of cars/engines, and managing more than a few is a total pain in the butt. I always have Excel running beside the game and keep my settings there. I also make screenshots with Fraps all the time, which is much more productive than using the inbuilt save system and comes second from writing down everything.On a scale out of 10 I give this design a -3 .. Let me not even go into how managing copies of designs works because I have not even been able make any kind of sense out of it and because it is simply too infuriating. Let me just say that when I make an important change I just create a new car from scratch, this saves me a lot of frustration in the long run.Though I still like the engine designer very much, the rest of this game should be deleted and programmed again, which is apparently what they are doing right now (the so called engine ""switch"" looks like a total rewrite to me. Probably the most efficient solution ... )			"

Early Access Review
 I have been following this game for almost 3 years. Long before all you internet babies existed I found a little software called CarTest. It was basically a software where more than 1000 cars' features and specs existed and you could run them on any track and see what difference a few more HP or 100kg less weight did. It was the year 2000. Fast forward to 2013 I made a little research on google for something similar. The results gave me automation. It was probably the beginning of the project but at least they had a demo where you could make a 4 cylinder engine and play on it. So that summer me and my cousin played around it and tried to beat each other with some restrictions and goal. I had my eyes on it since then. So a few months ago I purchased this product and I must say I was very disappointed at the beginning because the game wouldn't save my cars. Yesterday with the help of (probably killrob) Automation guys through youtube comments I finally did a little trick and the game is without buggies right now. They say it will be imported to UE4 or something which I don't care. I am more about specs, stats and information. If you are a guy who is really into cars but not ""oh yeah GTR is so cool"" level but ""how to lose the oversteer without losing the sportiness"" this is for you.			"

								This is my first game review on steam. The reason for that is because out of all the games i have purchased on steam, this is the first one i believe is worth a review. It's not even just the fact that i love cars that makes this game amazing, it the puzzle factor that allows you learn through trial and error.  Amazing game and its not even finished!P.S. i was given my first car and blew it up while adding turbos..... would do it again			"

I mean dont get me wrong it still has a ways to go yet smoothing out roughness and adding in features, but i sincerly believe that if this product keeps on the road its on that it will turn out to be truly innovative not only for the tycoon genre, but in intricacy of all simulation games. Keep it up guys great product!			"

								I have bought Automation a long time ago, and so far I have been having a lot of fun with it. Game is incomplete, but the devs are adding a lot of content lately. I am really happy that this game is finally released on Steam. I can spend a few hours creating engines and cars, even though there a lot of bugs and missing features. When tycoon part of the game is finished it will be the most addicting game ever created. I really recommend it to every car maniac.			"

								I dont really know what Else to compare this game to. The depth of Design and the formulas and data that can create real time Demonstration engines and Aerodynamics makes me Weak at the Knees.I am often kept awake at night thinking what It would be like to put a 1.6 Litre V8 into a Mid Mounted Car. This game Allows me to live that and see the Insane Cost Involved in creating such a ridiculous Endevour.This game does an Amazing job of Conveying over 60 years worth of Mechanical and Aerodynamic Statistics into a Simulated formula. I cant wait for further Updates!I REALLLY hope Functionality with Beam.NG is combined so I can Export my Cars and Engines. Beam Looks BEAUTIFUL, and being able to combine these two worlds of Design and Simulation would be an Amazing New step in Simulation and Driving Games.			"

								Ok, I have had this game since like what? 2013-14 pre steam, and it has evolved greatly. I just simply love this game, so here is a review of a dude who played 363 hours and counting from late 2015 till now and still counting (prob 500+ hours if i counted pre steam version)Pros: It has a really detailed car and engine builder, great for the real petrolheads and hardcore car geeks who care about everything about a car. It has got turbos, Compression Ratio, Types of injection or Carbs, intake exhaust rev limit type of exhaust types of ..................(too much♥♥♥♥♥♥) and that is just the engine. You get to choose the suspension the interior the stiffness of suspension the gearbox the ratio of said gearbox and aerodynamics and SO MUCH MORE. It allows for great car designs compared to GearCity, although the campaign part is still not out yet as of now, but will be soon. The steam workshop allows for more versatile designs, more body fixtures and bodies itself, which allows a sense of diversity when building the cars you want. This game is highly realistic, you do not put 8.0L 1000 Hp engines in an miata, but a small engine, with the right and complex tuning, can have 1000 hp, but not as much torque sadly. The game even measures your car's fuel economy, and the targeting market like sports or luxury or utility is complex and accurate as well. Every single thing you do, will affect the car in a little way, and with the enough time and effort, you can make legendary looking and going cars, make like 600 horsepower from a 2 litre, make a smart fortwo style car that goes faster around top gear track than ferraris and lamborghinis, or make the best sounding car, best looking or best handling. This might be the best car simulator game, and with the campaign due, it will sure be  very, very, fun in the future to say the least.Cons: It is not without the flaws. The graphics look a little dated, but FRET NOT! a Unreal4 Engine port is coming!The Campaign is still not out yet, but be patient, and don't give it a negative review because of it! It is literally stated as a beta and early access game, what do you expect lol. One real fatal flaw, is how BROKEN and full of BUGS it is. Screw you! LUA ERRORS!In summary, if you want to dive deeper into what meets the eye, Go balls deep into cars, and design your very own car and company in the future, this game is the right game for you.For those people who don't care about my review at all, here are the scores in numbers, you lazy people.Overall: 8.5Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 7Stability (it means like is it polished or buggy af): 5.5Fun: 10Attention to detail: 9Accuracy: 9.5Price: 7Worth it? YES! for petrolheads only. "

								(this is a review based on the open beta stage)This is a really good game!Even at this current stage it's a lot of fun, although the edges are clearly unpolished, features are missing, keep that in mind.But the current state is fairly bug-free and you get a glimpse into the magnificent complexity of the auto industry. If you like building cars, trying to make them suitable for certain markets, you'll have fun.Be warned though: the business management is not the big part of the game.  Most of the time you'll build cars, and often fail to get the best results. :)   Still, I love the game, please keep up the good work, gents.			"

Yes but to people who is a petrolhead and of course has the passion to wait for like maybe next year for the tycoon part? lolBut for the general people who is not interested on this sort of game maybe you guys shouldve wait until the tycoon part going to be released			"

								Very Fun! Awesome Game. Keep up the good work. The Positives.Very fun to build Engines and test them for breakage.Great fast replies from the developers for bugs and problems.Runs very smooth with my GTX 1070 System.The Negatives.Needs better Photoreal Parts as for the Pulleys and Drive Belts as they look like a cartoon animation.When revving the engines the see thru parts not turning smoothly as per rated RPMs.Need smoother animations for moving parts. Belts and and drive pulleys look very low in visual quality.But I am confident that they will get around to making this game much better as it ages in design and programing the code for it. I am sure that the Developers are working hard in getting it better and more entertaining.I know that is it and early access game and it takes time to develop,I would pay top $ for these kind of games when they are of high quality.Highly addictive.Please improve it's Graphics.Jon J.

								At the moment, this game is very much unfinished. What it does have is a very nice sandbox car building engine, a bunch of engine and car building scenarios, and a bare bones career mode. The scenarios and the career mode leave much to be desired in the way of user communication, as creating certain cars changes percentages on a seemingly massive scale of car and truck types.Currently, the devs are working on porting the game from a small engine with little support to Unreal, so the game should look much more polished then, and allow for car driving and fancier campaigns. At the moment, if you're looking for a cool engine building sandbox, this is worth a look at, but I would suggest downloading the demo and playing that until the game engine gets ported.Dev updates usually come out monthly or every two weeks, so the game is far from dead, just in stasis.

								Good afternoon, First off I would like to say that it is coming along beautifully. This is the game I have been dreaming to come out since ""street legal racing (SRS) and of course (SRS:redline edition)So of course I had to buy it for the early release. The fact that it is fully modifiable is one of my favorite features. If there is beta testing or anything I can help with it would be my honorable plesure. Your all doing an amazing job and I cant wait to see how the adjustments ( as there are literally an unfathumable amout of combinations you can do) will effect the way the car drives even if its only a straight qtr mile run then back in the shop to put it up for sale.BRAVO encore and much more.Hope that I am lucky enough to be in contact with the creators as it is an amazing feat and I really couldn't be happier thus far.Just keep on updating and modding it you will have a customer forever. "" or your money back"" Heck who knows in 20 years add in a car show feature addin and people can show the cars that were made from this year even. Well just wanted to see if there is anything can test do to be a tiny part of it I would be honored.Timothy Eerdmansarmyman2121@hotmail.com "

								If you have any interest in cars, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game, even in its currently unfinished state.  I've read other reviews that say the game has little value after you've completed the tutorials. I disagree. My friends and I will set arbitrary parameters in sandbox mode and compete to see who can create the best car. Most Torque or Most Hp in a given chassis is fun, but so is competing for MPG or fastest lap time with specific hp/torque limits. I don't know if the Devs read these reviews but I would like to see in game infrastructure to do this sort of thing with friends or the community. Weekly/Monthly Build Challenges and Leader boards would be awesome.It's already a fantastic game, I can't wait to see where it goes. A refreshing gem in the pit of mediocrity that is PC gaming.			"

								Its a great game, but it is so let down by the amount of irritating bugs. For example, as soon as i move the engine statistics off the screen, i cant get them back unless i restart as the buton disappears, losing the design as the save function causes the game to crash. Also, sometimes the scenarios dont show your requirements, so you cant complete the build unless you can remember them.I really do enjoy it, but the bugs make it nigh on unplayable for me.

								I backed Automation a year and a half ago, and I would just like to say that this game has grown so much in that time. Although far from the planned final design, it offers a lot of fun for such a reasonable price ($30 currently in the US.) As it is, even without the Tycoon bits and a few bugs here and there, it is a full and complex automobile design simulator with a caring and dedicated community that I find both welcoming and highly entertaining. If you are not sure whether you would like it or not in this state, I would still recommend that you take a look at the forums at automationgame.com, and see if the community makes up for the lack of Tycoon content.I would highly recommend this game not only to simulation enthusiasts or Tycoon game junkies, but also to anyone with even a slight interest in how cars work. Also, if you at all watch Top Gear, you should probably buy this game if only to re-create your favorite automobiles (I have tried to build replicas of Nissan's L-block engines, even if they're not perfect, and it is a ton of fun to try and get as close as possible).Please support these great developers, I would love to see Automation succeed for a long time.

								Very cool game! Especially if you're into engine design or just want to know more about how the components work together. I originally purchased this game over a year ago, and have been very happy with the way it has progressed since then. The developers have been very interactive with the community and are steadily improving the game and adding new features.I'm very hesitant to recommend an early access game, but I think that this one is worth the asking price as it currently stands, even if the campaign hasn't been implemented yet.

								So far I like what I see, there is a lot of attention to detail, and I've even learned a few things about engine performance I didn't fully understand before. There is a lot of advanced subject matter in this game about what an engine does and how it performes under stress that not everyone may understand but they do a very good job of explaining the concepts behind them. The graphics are the best for what the car looks like when you make it, I would personally prefer some more functionality in paint designs and lighting effects, but I understand that's not the intent of the game, I can play Forza 5 for making pretty looking cars. This is more about the fundamental aspects of what a car is for and how much it costs to produce and why a company would want to make this car and think people will buy it. Imagine you are taking over Ford, how would you change the mustang, the focus, or their trucks? how would you make sure people wanted to buy them? TL;DR lots of science, and economics, and you get to be in control of every aspect of car design and production.			"

								Fun game if you are a petrolhead like me, and can waste a few hours designing a car, fitting an engine in the car and testing it on a speedway!.Game contains a lot of learning atm so no problem for a newb to start making an engine, but understanding why the angle on CAM's and turbo works together would take a few minutes to understand ;) heheFun game as i said, i look foreward to this game getting into a ""finished game"" with driving and more details!

								Cool! But not ready yet. I'm really sorry. But i refunded for now. I promise i will buy this game again, when it is finished. Or atleast in beta. It feels not like a game for 27,99 euros. I reallly reallly love the simulation more than any other game. It is my fav simulator ever. But the bugs and glitches. And even the unfinished look and gameplay makes it not worth the money. Make sure to follow this and wait until it goes in beta or release ^^			"

								Another one of those games where not many know about it.Automation. You can make yourself anything from your average $15,000 clunker just to get around and make the bucks, or go all out and make a super-luxurious automobile to rake in those celebs.Work out your shape of the vehicle, choose where grilles go, lights, decals, etcetera and then work your way up choosing chassis materiel, engine bay orientation, suspension type. My favourite is definetly the engine tuning, where you create your engine starting with the engine block and its materiel to the size of a turbo or tuning of the compression ratio.If you see me on this, I'm most definetly limiter-bashing the crap outta my Daihatsu-inspired inline 4 cyl. Engine. Because, why not?			"

								The engine builder is fantastic, but this fails elsewhere. The game is a great concept and I believe when the tycoon is put into the game it will be worth the price. But as it stands now I can't recommend this game because $30 for just the engine builder isn't worth it. I would say check on this game every few months and see how far the development has come along. This game is worth 7 bucks as is, but has the potential to be worth the 30 bucks that is being charged as of now.Update 1/18/16Game has shown some slight improvement since two months ago. You can see the dev taking steps in order to implement the tycoon system. But fair warning it will still probably take awhile before the tycoon idea gets it wheels truely rolling. I'll up my rating from 7 bucks to 8.25 for now.Update 4/20/16Game has added in the engineering part of the tycoon, but the tycoon still is not there so be warned. Since my last update the game has more playablity I guess you would say considering it is not longer just a make a car game. Adding in the management of engineers(Frame and Engine) and the management of how the factories will work and what quality you went your things at makes it have a little more entertainment value. That said I still cannot recommend this game at its current stage, but recent development shows hope of much improvement!			"

Early Access Review
								I have taken part of this game since 2012 and i am still very excited about where this game is going. Think of this game as a blend of old car-building games like ""Street Legal"" where you design engines and bodies and mix it with business-simulations where you massproduce said cars in the millions in huge plants for the masses, or have a handful of extremely skilled craftsmen carefully sculpting 10 supercars a year. For now, we have the engine designer and body designer with the business part of the game in the making.Still even in this phase this is one of the best simulations out there on this subject. When i say simulator i mean it in a positive way, but it can also be considered a game depending on how serious you are approaching it and what you do with it. The developers are active on their forum and on their facebook page and communicate with the players on a regular basis and seems like really great guys.You can make your own engines in almost every way concievable from small, cheap, weak and smoking cast iron engines straight out from a peoples car of the 60's eastern bloc to huge, high-tech roaring V8's in titanium with horsepowers in 4 digits from a modern supercar, all with a fantastic attention to detail for those who want to get knee-deep in technical specs. Heck, i've even taken specs from my real cars engines and used them in the game to get quite accurate results!Design car bodies to make hideous and comical cars that should be killed with fire to spare mankind the horror or design beautiful cars fit for the nice salons and red carpet. Go for round, sleek aerodynamic shapes or why not a classic 70's box with wedges and angles everywhere? Make your own take on the huge barges with rocket-fins of the 50's or try to make a copy of the car on your own driveway!I really look forward to seeing this game take off and grow. This is what a car tycoon game is all about. This is what other ""simulators"" and ""tycoon"" games should be if they had any decency and self respect. If you are a car nut like me you will not be disappointed.			"

								As with other games in the series, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon and Sid Meier's Build-a-Bear Workshop, this game delights and astounds children of all ages. My five years old son Jesse has so much fun building cars. He sits at his computer all day, making car after car making ""vroom vroom"" sounds. While the game isn't completely finished yet (you can't even sell the cars), I think it is perfect. Most of the fun of this game comes from the office simulation section of the game. You can answer the phone, read your emails, or set your exploitatively low wages for your factory workers in the third world. Without the ability to make cars in Iceland for $0.50/hour, I would find no joy in this game. While not perfect, this game has everything I could want in a MMORPG. 7/10.			"

								Incredible possiblities, endless fun. That's the promise of the finished game, but this game is still far from finished.The only options currently are Sandbox and Scenario (Make a car go 100 km/h crap), which are midly amusing for 15 minutes each. I have been hoping with each update they would be progressing towards completion of the actual game, but they seem intent on just adding more engines and car shells.If this game is ever completed, it just maybe worth $20-30, but as it stands, it should be a free demo, not sold as early access, when I bought it a year ago.

								For over a year (and a half?) I own this game and not much has evolved. Updates come out at a slow rate but so far my experience was bug free. I rather like that than frequent buggy updates.I thought ""Early Access"" games were in their final development stage, i.e. Release Candidate or late Beta versions. I was so wrong. This game is far from finish and the Dev Team decided to switch the game engine in the middle of the development. If I understand this correctly, it means the current game is being developped while being ported?Early Access should not be used to finance projects but to polish a finish product. Don't get me wrong here. This game has great potential but with so many unfinish (unstarted?) features I really can't recommend it.Honestly, I won't buy an ""Early Access"" game anymore. I'm affraid I'll buy something that maybe way to far from a finish product.In short:PROS: Car design is great (that is basically all you can do at them moment).CONS: Too many missing/in-development features			"

								I bought this game and played a few hours in another pc and had to ask for a refound.What it is at this point I can't recommend this game. I explain you why. When you play for first time the only thing you can do is create your own desired car modifying the chassis, headlights, etc. There's various stages of fabrication, body, engine, interior, running gear... but that's it, there's nothing more than that. If you like creating your preferred car go ahead and buy it, there's also workshop, but if you want to create your car and play the tycoon part it's not made yet. When that part and the campaign arrives, I will change to positive my review.			"

								There is simply not enough here yet to be worth your money.Credit where credit is due. Automation has an eye for technical detail and the engine building tutorials are a pretty decent beginners guide to engine design, sadly on my playthrough some of the later tutorial videos still contained placeholder visuals or were lacking voiceovers. The challenges are enjoyable but pretty limited and hardly varied enough to keep you coming back. Ideally you should be setting out with a goal to meet the requirements but too often you complete challenges by adjusting sliders until you hit the right performance values.  The car sandbox mode is again hugely detailed, quite possibly too much so, but so lacking in an endgoal that leaves it deeply unrewarding.  The crux of the matter is that the game is called a Car Company Tycoon Game and yet update after update releases another slew of headlights or number plate options without ever getting close to being a tycoon game at all. If the devs ever make good on their original intentions Automation might be one of the most in depth tycoon games ever created but as it stands is an overpriced car builder sandbox lacking the satisfaction of an actual game.It is rollercoaster tycoon that lets you build coasters without ever opening a park. Sim city where you build detailed sanitation pumps for a town with no people.Save your money. If they deliver it will be worth the price tag but at the moment you're paying for not an awful lot.			"

								Automation is a great potential. It will be a great game, with a superb car/engine design tool. Sounds are nice too, the engine sound depends on a lot of factors from the choose of the materials. And it's pretty well detailed. But there's a ""but"" in this history. The game in it's current state is very buggy, full of glitches. You don't save your game often and you will find the hour you spend making up a great car going to garbage. Some times it work, most of them don't. I also have another game of the genre, GearCity and beside it does not have this car&engine creator... It's far more stable. Automation also lacks other engine setups / cylinder numbers. Many of them wasn't a great sucess, but they existed. And there's a reason to find those in this games. You can learn why they didn't work. So overall, from my point of view the scores would be:8/10 Audio5/10 Gameplay 3/10 Stabilty4/10 Price for what you getOverall: 5/10It needs more polishment, maybe the new engine will be the solution, till then I rather go for GearCity. It lacks the Automation editor but at least I won't have issues and bugs in 8 out of 10 cars I do.I hope for the best for Automation but in it's current state... Ain't enough for everyone.			"

It has some elements that would be fantastic if only they were in a stable program, such as the engine builder. Unfortunately, the game has been in this state for over a year, with no sign of correction.I would recommend this game as soon as it's in a stable, playable state that causes less aggravation, and if it were priced commensurate with its value. As it stands, the engine builder is the only part of the game that works well and appears finished.			"

								Is this a game with potential, yes. Is this a game you can get about 10 hours of fun out of, yes. is it worth getting now unfinished at a cost of £22 for a beta... No.The game as it stands is very limited, it has no more than a few dozen car styles (most older than 2000), only three engines avalible (V8, SV8 and 4c), and ultimately gets boring once youve created a V8 supercar with as much power as possible (because thats all you can do at the moment, there is no career or ""tycoon"" part avalible yet to progress).Overall this is a good game and the developers have put alot of effort into it, I woldnt personally spend £22 on it but if you have money to burn and dont mind waiting a few months for the finished product then go ahead, otherwise wait until it progresses a bit. When finished probably 8/10, at the moment 5/10.			"

								It certainly sells itself well, but really, not much going on here. On my MacBook Pro Retina, gets lots of error messages within the program.  Sometimes I am clicking the send bug report button more than the game interface buttons.  At this stage, design is clunky and more like games from the 90's.  Very limited.  I rarely can make it through to the engine design, since the game encounters so many errors. Now, this is still early access, so they have the ability to make this a great game.  But so far, the ""creation"" process is not really any process at all.  I absolutely would wait until this game has evolved more before spending money on it.  I deeply regret spending $30 at this point.  Waste of time and money until they actually put some polish and depth into this ""game"".			"

								As a gearhead whos stuck overseas on a long deployment, i bought this in an attempt to help scratch my car itch, and it was kind of neat for about 10 minutes before it crashed, resulting in a loss of all of my work.  Subsequent attempts have resulted in the same thing, I can't get passed putting cylinders in the engine before it crashed on me.So, I have not experienced much further than that, however even if I was able to get through to the car testing phase, I don't believe there is enough in this game to reflect the price point.  At 10 bucks, i could recommend it, but for 30 dollars there just isn't enough there, for now.Hopefully this game won't be early access on a 10 year plan like a lot of these other ones are, and it reaches the quality that its price demands.EDIT:  Stop commenting about my computer, my computer is fine, everything runs properly and my drivers are updated.  The plain and simple truth is that I, ME, Myself, did not find this ""game"" to be worth the 30 dollars I spent on it.  Sorry to all the fanboys that like the game, nothing personal, but this has been my experience.  I will not take down my review, so stop saying to do so.			"

								This game is a great idea, and although it is far better than most games out there as far as designing cars and engines, it leaves a lot to be desired. Customization on vehicle platforms are very limited, you cannot infinietely change and build the chassis, body, or suspension to look the way you want which is pretty lame. Instead, you are stuck with limitations on body lines, engine sizes due to chassis limitations, and suspension and drivetrain limitations that are not real world. Also, adding body hardware such as lights, exhaust, and bumpers is very limited. when it comes to actually testing the vehicle, the test is super lame! If youre really in to building cars, save $30 and get out your graph paper. This game is just not worth the price tag			"

								I was tempted several times to vote this down and as i am writing this review i am still considering this.This game is clearly made by people who love and know their cars and engines however it doesn't seem that they actually know how to make games. While the idea of building/repairing cars or running an automotive company is not new, they managed to go further and squeeze in so much micromanagement and ""learning"" into it that they made boring and somewhat stale simulator which also looks incredibly dated and cheap - from low res UI and videos, to stock music, this game feels like it was made at least 10 years ago or more.However the main issue are the tutorials. Each section of the game, each part of the car, has its own video tutorial and the further you get into game - the lengthier they become. I get that the developers want to teach the player everything they can but i am 100% sure that i could've gone without such gems as ""entertainment system keeps passengers entertained"". Some videos go on for what it feels like 10 minutes and i honestly can tell that i did not learn or remembered anything they said, especially since some videos are not yet finished and only include agonizingly boring developer voice.Again - i get the idea of trying to teach the player something valuable about cars but its one thing to include some trivia along as you play, and its another when you are force-feeding information which is actually required to play this ""game"". And you do actually need to learn things they mention in their videos unless you just want to mash sliders at random and hope for the best.Overall i was impressed with the amount of fine-tuning and options they included but i also was thoroughly annoyed with their videos and stopped paying attention as soon as i got to the ""trim"" part which had the longest and most boring videos. Figuring out things for myself using tooltips, wikipedia and random clicking wasn't that much fun either.I do hope that they are planning to change their UI (at least make it high res and look bit less like Windows 95) and completely revamp tutorials while making them interactive, this would make the game so much more interesting and engaging because as it stands right now its more of an excel-car-slider-clicker-video-learning-course than anything else.Also the ""tycoon"" part of the game is not actually in the game yet - you can only build and fine-tune engines and cars just for the ""fun"" of it. I suppose its good enough for car enthusiasts but for a person who's more interested in the actual strategy/management aspect of the game - its going to be rather dull.Oh what the hell - im voting it down. Someone has to be the bad guy.P.S.#bringbackclarkson#freedomtofracas--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well the developer has responded politely and now i feel completely uncomfortable :( Where are the death threats, deleted reviews and banned accounts? Clearly you are not being professional!Seriously though - tutorial videos in general aren't that bad of an idea BUT you really do need to time them (don't make them too long) and use better voice, and better animation to keep the player engaged.As for an interactive tutorial - you don't have to narrate or animate everything, using tooltips and pointers, perhaps simple ""quest"" system would suffice. An example:1) Tooltip appears briefly explaining what is required from the player in this scenario. Player clicks ""next"" button.2) Second tooltip explains where do you have to click, what it will change (for example changing fuel to unleaded) and the ""next"" button appears when you done so.3) ???4) Profit.5) Rinse and repeat for all the tutorial scenarios, until you teach player everything you want.6) Don't forget to include ""back"" button and/or repeat button so the player can view all of the messages again.The main problem with videos is that i did not remember a thing after watching them. I couldn't fast forward them, pause or view and play them at the same time so i could try and learn what you just told me. You want me to know more about cars? Well... use your own game and teach me while i am playing!As for the tooltips in the game - they were good enough to explain the basics (as in what is this option i am currently tweaking) but not the interaction between different parts of the car and engine which is the most important part to succeeding in this game.I can cope with dated graphics and music but better tutorial is really a must in my opinion for this intricate and complicated game. Take heed in Capitalism 2 - it took 14 years and a remake to actually include decent tutorial in this game, despite it being great otherwise.			"

								First of all, the reason I don't recommend this game is because it is still in development.The Good: The game itself is a great concept, and definitely has an appeal to those who seriously like their cars and want to know more about the car designing and producing process. The game is very interesting and the tutorials are informative and helpful, and actually result in you coming away with a better understanding of how cars work.The game is still in development, so I look forward to it getting better.The Bad: It doesn't really work... for me and a bunch of others. As the game is still in development, it is understandably buggy - my version simply does not run, so the last I played this game was its demo version.The Verdict: My personal opinion is that you, the potential buyer, wait it out until this game is actually released to make a purchase decision, because in the current state it is frankly a waste of money (again I stress that this is in my opinion).This is a great game, and I would not recommend taking the same path that I did - i.e. buying the beta - because it leaves a sour taste in my mouth due to it being unplayable and extremely buggy.

								i was hopping i could take the rules for the shape of crumple zone in the over all shape of a shell and make it look better then the crap we get today when limited by the need of those zones. but shells are set in this game and changes to looks might as well be nothing. and so you cant take a longer car and bring it down to a small car or bulge side areas extra, and not all shell shapes are there.also if this ""game"" has any bearing on how real car's dev are put together it dose a lot to explain why we get so many bad cars. and why car companies get so proud to announce when they combine each part to get an product that dose not blow up, and this game is infact good for being just like it.but if not it need's a lot more work put in, maybe make it so you can look up by parts that affect each part, so if you want to get something higher and lower you can look outside of the part blowing up / under performing in it's area.

								Pros: Build your own cars, design engines with excellent engineering simulations, run your own company. It's a lot of fun if you like engineering stuff.Cons: You can't drive the cars you build, making them competitive to real-world products is difficult, if not impossible, the game is only updated once every few centuries, it's extremely buggy and has the occasional hiccup, some of the car layouts are not done correctly to real-world vehicles, and it's ENTIRELY too expensive.The Verdict: Maybe a decent investment in the future, but certainly not now.

								Kann den Hype nicht ganz verstehen. Klar ist es nett umgesetzt, wenn man einen neuen Motor entwicklen will ... oder das Gefühl zu haben das zu tun. Aber das war es dann auch schon. Eigentlich hieß das Spiel auch mal ""Motor Mechanics"" oder so ähnlich, kann man noch in den Tutorials sehen. Der Teil in dem man ein Auto bauen kann ist im Grunde albern. Ein bisschen die Karosse ziehen damits anders aussieht, ein bisschen Lichter und Luftschlitze platzieren und das wars dann. Und die Probefahrt ist nur ne 2 d tour. Ok, wenn man ein Motorfreak ist, dann ist das n netter Zeitvertreib. Aber wenn man erwartet ein Spiel zu bekommen mit dem man ein eigenes Auto von Grund auf bauen und auch ausprobieren kann ... lasst die Finger weg, dass ist es nicht.			"

								Bought this game because it had great reviews, but as I kept playing the game I realized how poor the gameplay is. The graphics are crap, it's literally a point and click kind of game. There's no driving involved, there's no tuning involved. All you do is select the type of material parts are used (Steel, Alloy, Carbon fiber, etc.) If you want a game that teaches you the mechanics of building a car, this is NOT it. If you want a game to simply pass time with and have $30 to burn do yourself a favor and go buy a nice meal somewhere, it's not worth spending money on.			"

								Thought more of the ""game"". You ""create"" a car without any reason. You cant drive it, only put it on a testtrack and you see your car driving around.When creating a beast of a motor it can't be fit in ANY car, because the engine is to big. So why can you build a great engine then?And what about the suspension etc? It is nice to choose which tires, rims, springs etc to place under your car, but you are doing it for nothing. The only time you will see it or have any fun of it is when you are designing your car. It doesn't mean anything, it has no value in the ""game"".The thing that most annoys me is that you have limited options to build a ""good"" engine that will actually fit a car.To be quite honest, I'm really into creating and modifying cars, but this game gave me a flashback to the game Streetrod I and Streetrod II, offcourse you can change more settings in the Automation game, but what if you have created a car? Then the fun ends. For example, you can design 30 cars (which look like crap from the outsite by the way) and then you have a list of 30 cars. Then what? Are you going to post on your facebook that you have created an awesome ride? You cant do anything with it. In my opinion, after designing 10 cars you are just burning daylight. I expected much more of this game.Refund?#			"

								There is not much to do yet and it's massively overpriced for what it is now. it's better to wait for another year until this looks like a somewhat finished game before paying now 27Euros for basically nothing.There is no Tycoon part at all yet, no campagin, nothing that makes it anyhow challenging to play. It's just a sandbox for trying out motors.I expected something like Kerbal Space Program where it's not finished yet but the core concept and the mechanics are finished and it's fun to play around. I have over 400 Hours on KSP but couldn't make it to 2 on this game. It might become a nice game one day but for now it's just a waste of money. Could have bought so many nice finished games with these 27 Euros and come back for this one in a year or two. Huge disapointment and I can't recommend it for now.			"

								The tutorials are great, I love a lot of the detail in tunning reports and outputs. However it feels very shallow. I built a 900hp car for less than $25k. Not sure that it works right. Also a lot of the the benchmark ratings the game creates like ""Driveability"" and ""Sportiness"" have no comparison. I have no idea what my rating MEANS. I got a Driveability score of 50 on a car that does 0-60 in 3.4 seconds. Is that good? Is that awful? Do you need to be the Stig to drive it? or is it damn near self driving? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? I ask that question a lot while playing this game and I don't mean about technical car features- those are all remarkably well explained. I always ask that question in relation to game features and menu's. This is less of a game and more of an interactive Cars 201 Lecture.			"

								 A great Automotive tycoon game where  you can build your own car line.  This is actually  quite fantastic. while it is still in early  realease and there are tons of changes and additions made to it now and then  and on top of the great selection of workshop items  to add to the game.   This is more of a techical game and it's focus is completely  on building the  cars themselves from the floor up frame  body style and engine.  you can give specifications to the interior but not make actual physical changes to it...yet? that might be something cool to see. you can  see how well the car performs by having your tame racing driver take it a spin around a track which you have two to chose from.. which one definitely isn't the top gear test track.  You do have an option to add other custom tracks.  the cars you make can be very unique.  This game still has a LONG way to go  but  is worth the money to spend. it already is worth its price..and as said not even finished.  if you are into  Cars and Tycoon games  get this game. If you love the techinical  side of car building...get this game. if  you are looking for a racing game this isn't it... but still get it because it is awesome.			"

This is not a quick 'sugar rush' type game. I have really high hopes that this will be a thinking man's game. The devs also have a lot of youtube content out which I highly recommend checking out before you make your decision on this game.

								**Updated Review** (Dec 4th 2015)When I bought the game, I misunderstood the Tycoon elements as imminent. The Devs have really increased comm. around the long road ahead before that happens on the Store page, and responding to individual posts as well. As a result, I am changing my review to a ""recommend"".On to the game itself, (coming from a person who is mostly into the Tycoon aspect): In my brief time with the game, I followed the provided objectives to fine tune a series of engines. Using an increasing number of menu sliders, you raise/lower those until you get the right combination. I learnt some things along the way about engines (nice!), and then ran out of motivation-gas to keep playing... until the Tycoon aspect becomes playable.Once I can Tycoon the heck out of the beasts I hope to create, I have a feeling the motivation to master mechanics of car tuning / creation itself will feel more rewarding too.

								This game is exactly what I've been looking for so many years. I am pleased to see that something like this is at my finger tips. I will assume better graphics are on the way. I do have a few suggestion. A free play mode/racing/in car view/ commutes A-Z gas stops for mpg testing and free roam. More options for customizaton like mirrors, body kits, sun roofs, rims and tires. Otherwise keep up the good work. I support this game.			"

								This game is amazing, I love playing it. The only problem I have is that ever since they released it I haven't been able to play. All that shows up is error after error, and every time I click on something an error comes up. I've done the whole delete and redownload thing over and over, but to no fruition. If I knew how to fix the problem this game would get a 50/10, but since they haven't responded to my e-mails nor have they done anything to fix it since March, so I have to take them down to a 10/10. PLEASE FIX, this game was my LIFE			"

								as the game stands now i like the sandbox mode. trying to fine tune your car for the best lap time or getting the most mpg is oddly fun. I can see this game growing into what could be one of the greatest tycoon games ever but it still has some work a head. If your looking to poke around with cars for a few hours then get it now, but if your looking for something with a lot to offer then hold off. At the price it is right now i could see people turning away because IMO your not getting much for your money.			"

								You puts some in liquid flame, some black goop, and a little air in there, it makes some metal bits do things all so you can go to the store and buy some chips. For the longest of times, I was curious what actually happens inside an internal combustion. If you are bugged by the same curiosity and are willing to throw some money at said curiosity, then this is the little fun nugget you've been waiting for. While still having that musky smell of being in the early stages, it's still very much a delivering program. While you won't go from bumbling idiot to a mechanical genius, it will definitely impart to you some knowledge. Certainly can't wait for the future updates. Quite a bit of potential.			"

								Well worth your money even if its just for the exquisite engine fine tuning options. Buy it, they've fixed the important bugs (Like being unable to save your car, reinstall your copy of the game if this is occuring) and its only going to improve from here on out! A truly epic engine/car/trim/tycoon simulator. I hope they let us drive the car we build eventually! But I'll be happy just to sell them in tycoon mode once the game includes it and tycoon mode is completed.I have quite accuratley simulated my everyday drivers engine and my dream engine, Its so accurate it managed to get to within the last kilowatt/horsepower that the actual real life car produces, and how it would handle around a racetrack. My everyday driver unfortunatley would not fare too well.At least now I know what an extra 10kW-50kW would do to my everyday driver, nothing at all really in the grand scheme of things. Now I don't need to do these modifications to my car, as I know what kind of deathtrap it would produce without also upgrading the brakes.Speaking of brakes, going beyond single piston calipers really isn't worth it, sheer size of the rotors are what matters.This ""game"" can really teach you a LOT about engines/transmissions and body types and their various pros and cons.Oh and don't forget to check out the forums where you can download custom maps, cars, etc:http://automationgame.com/phpBB3/index.phpI hope that they allow us to have an online multiplayer mode where we can buy and sell completed cars. My car the ""carro de los condenado"" or ""chariot of the damned"" with the trim of ""danza de la muerte"" or ""dance with the devil"" would probably sell amazingly well. Especially when the engine is named ""La Diablo"". (ALL names/makes/models and engine names are copyrighted, no stealing!)Love it! Having lots of fun!			"

								Let me start off by saying: This is an absolutley brilliant game.You just know that the team behind it, small they may be, are truly dedicated to making a game that is not only fun but realistic, something that other games of this genre often fail to be. And you know the team at Camshaft Software actually enjoy the topic in which their game is based on, cars. Seeing the developers actually competing in events and being a part of the HVMC (a motorsport club) really reassures the fact that these people are making a game based on something that they enjoy/love.The game is amazing to play. personally I will just spend ages on sandbox messing around with different cars and engines. I cannot wait until the 'campaign' gamemode is released.One thing that I would like to see introduced is more engine types. Maybe the ability to have diesels, 10 and 12cyl engines and some rotary action would be nice.Other than that, keep up the good work. And to anyone looking at purchasing this game, do it, you won't regret it.			"

They realease what they call ""little dev updates"" on a weekly basis where the lead developer will tell you what their current focus is.

								Have been waiting for a game like this for a long time. While it is not yet completed the modification of chassis/body/engine is very good. highly recommened to anyone that likes the vehicle modification style of things rather than a game that you can just change body kits and minor engine and suspension components. NOT a racing game but a very detailed Simulator for the complete construction of a vehicle.What I would like to see further in development would be different/ more variety air filters especially the 4bbl and 2bbl racefilters would it be possible to engineer a more traditional velocity stack and or multple filters for twin 4bbl carbs?Supercharging, could you run a simple positive displacement blower with mods to cfm per revelution and max boost with the pulley changing size (visually) as you increased or decreased boost, and a simple non-intercooled/intercooled option that simply raised the blower 3 inches higher.Then an option for a centrifugul supercharger with mods to a/r ratio, compressor size, and max boost as per the current turbo arangement with the compressor changing sizes and pulley (again visually) and use the current turbo intercooler options?Turbocharging, single turbo option for V engines.Diesel, could  diesel possibly be as simple as adding a option to the carb/injection screen with a simple common rail and single throttle option?MORE BONNET SCOOPS PLEASE reverse cowl, shaker?, hornet scoop (small), single offset (ie early gt falcon)And more Wheel options a few more 2000+ style factory alloys suited from 16-20 inches?Sorry to rabble but I know that the Devs are working hard and that they listen to all ideas and the automation community and my hats off to them for making this a realityThis game/Idea is BRILLIANT 10/10 "

								This game truly does have a great potential. However, it is lacking quite a lot of components now. Apart from the crashes, it is lacking quite a bit of detail, for example, there isn't even an option for a blow-off valve for the turbo and no hybrids. Also, the lack of interior design and the ability to drive the ca or at least see it in action in 3D instead of just a 2D map makes the gameplay quite unrealistic. So the devs do have a lot to work on, but it is certainly worth it to invest in it.			"

								I learned a little bit more about how an engine works in just a few hours of playing this game. While the campaign has yet to finish development, I found a few hours of good game play just going through the scenarious and tutorials. This is a game I'll keep installed on my computer for while and switch in and out whenever I want to feel productive and don't want to make a trip out to staples or home depot.Once the anaimations get a little more polished and the game's campaign mode is ready to play, pick it up and try it out.

								i loved working on cars with my dad, so i figured this game would serve me well, because i also like to make things.The game so far has no bugs at all, but is somewhat limited. rotary engines would be cool, as well as more car body presets.More badges and a FPV driving instead of just the track view would also be really cool.could use some paint patterns and more lights.i realize this game is alpha, but these are all things i would like to see in version 1.0overall, i give the game a 9/10. fantastic game for the price that can only get better with time and updates.

								This game is fun if you love cars. I love to ♥♥♥♥ around and make it so that my VW Minibus is a v8 twin turbocharged 1000hp beast. No tycoon aspect at the moment but there are tons of scenarios that are given to you, like having to build a car with certain requirements or having to build an engine with this amount of max HP and fuel economy etc. Really fun game. One thing though, I don't know if its a me thing but when you click workshop or shift+tab theres no way of getting back into the game without having to restart it. Also would be pretty cool if we can choose when the supercharger/turbocharger kicks in.			"

								Still early access. But building engines is such a cool rewarding experience. Instead of the standard car game upgrade system (Turbo Upgrade 1, 2, 3, etc) you get to adjust real parameters that impact performance in real ways. If you've got even a fraction of an engineer's mind, you'll love this game.			"

								I was a Beta Tester for this game back in 2012, recently switched my subscription to Steam. When I first found this game, I was pyched that may have found a game simular to Detroit and was more interested in the Tycoon aspect of this game compaired to the Car Designer. I was happy to beta test this game for a period of 8 months or so, but found most of the focus was on the car design aspect of things. From what I see in the dev log's they are about to start the management side of the game, but I found it took way too long to get to this point. I personally have stopped playing this game until the Tycoon part of it is being worked on. Now I'm not a big car guy, I struggled to meet goals set when beta testing the car designer as I struggled with the terminology or what things do. I seriously hope that the final game offers a way to purchase pre-made engines, car designs and such as I'll most likely end up creating a car with the power of a lawnmower and trying to sell it to the public. :)			"

								Pretty good game. I'm currently in an automotive program and have rebuilt my second engine. Missing some things like V-12 engines and the old inline 8 engine. If the developers were to add diesel engines that would be awesome. Also would love to see a rotory engine so I can dink around with one of those bad boys. Also we need V-6 engines not just V-8's. One thing that is bothering me, is that when the camshaft lobes contact the push rods they seem to just go right through the lobes instead of pushing up on them and lifting the lifters to push down the valves. IDK why that bothers me, but it does. I like how the game tries to incorporate emmision control things like cadylitic converters, but you are forgetting some things like an EGR valve, PCV valvem O2 sensors and other autmotive inovations that cut back on emmisions.Other than that this game rocks for people who are into automotive. Would love to recreate my 12 valve cummins though... Lol			"

								I stumbled on Automation a long time ago, while looking for a modern version of Detroit (DOS). Automation is an all-encompassing car company simulator. I picked up the demo about two years ago, and have been following the game’s development ever since.Rarely do I ever buy an Early Access game, but Automation as it stands today is WELL WORTH the $30.It’s a little buggy following a complete UI overhaul. Although many features are still in development, you do have the ability to start designing all of your cars. You can make everything from classic steel body cruisers to modern day turbocharged super cars. The design features are powerful and addicting. It truly is unlike any other car designer I’ve ever played with, and it presents itself almost exactly as how you’d imagine a car designer should be.I for one have designed a 1960's Licoln type car, a 1970's muscle car, an early 1990's era pony car, a number of economy hatchbacks, and a few mid engined hyper cars (like the Bugatti Veyron). The range of cars and the depth of the customization is unrivalled.Automation could not be in better hands, as developers, Camshaft Software, work tirelessly. Unlike other developers, the guys at Camshaft have an open and positive relationship with their fans and the Automation online community, being active in all areas of the official forums.As it stands today, it’s a great game. It has great potential. It has a great dev team. There’s very little downside. I highly recommend this title.			"

								This is the first early access game that has made me part with my money. Whilst I wasnt 100% sure what to expect, I think the game shows great potential. the developers have obviously spent a lot of time around the engine/running gear side of the building process, and I hope they go into as much detail with interior detailing and paint/decals.The build system is intuitive and pretty straight forward to follow.I would like to see the following implementations as the game progresses through development:1. A wider selection of wheels and tyres2. More choices for interiors (i.e. Seats, Steering Wheels, Clocks, Carpet, ICE, etc.)3. The ability to have clear glass and various shades of tinting4. A choice of wing mirrors, body panels, side skirts, splitters, etc5. Various paint finishes (Gloss, Matte, Pearlescent, etc.)6. Decals (stripes, tribal, letters, numbers, grafitti, etc.)Looking forward to future updates ;)			"

								This game has a lot of potential. The bugs need to get worked out of it though. For an American playing this game it is rather difficult being that all the measurements are in the metric standard. There needs to be a different mode to show horse power, and torque in lbs. Other than that ive learned a lot from this game! Amazing potential but difficult to play at the moment because of graphic glitches and the standards.			"

								I have a love / hate with this game.I love the idea of it and its possibilities. I've spent about a year on/off playing it and can appreciate it is a big task for a dev team of 3 to manage. Although after a year, it feels not a lot has changed. Even though my PC exceeds the minimum requirements - the game is still clunky and fidgety. And (from what I gather through forums etc) unless you know a bit about graphic design - you're stuck with the limited selection of headlamps etc / workshop items available. So after a while, it get's a little repetitive. I follow the Devs Youtube so am aware it's a constantly maintained project and hope that soon we will start to see real progress from a users perspective. So saying that, yep - would recommend but with understanding that this is far from the finished article.			"

								This game is a must have if you are majoring/planning to major Automotive or Mechanical Engineering. It's a virtual encyclopaedia of cars, and it has taught me lots of things in just ten minutes of gameplay. Yes, it may be slow at updates and isn't exactly a tycoon game, but I think the main reason this game was made was to teach people how cars work and how to work on them, especially if you're looking forward to become an engineer.

								I was a Beta Tester for this game back in 2012, recently switched my subscription to Steam. When I first found this game, I was pyched that may have found a game simular to Detroit and was more interested in the Tycoon aspect of this game compaired to the Car Designer. I was happy to beta test this game for a period of 8 months or so, but found most of the focus was on the car design aspect of things. From what I see in the dev log's they are about to start the management side of the game, but I found it took way too long to get to this point. I personally have stopped playing this game until the Tycoon part of it is being worked on. Now I'm not a big car guy, I struggled to meet goals set when beta testing the car designer as I struggled with the terminology or what things do. I seriously hope that the final game offers a way to purchase pre-made engines, car designs and such as I'll most likely end up creating a car with the power of a lawnmower and trying to sell it to the public. :)			"

								Being an early access game, I was very leery on purchasing this game, but I tried the Demo and liked it a lot.  Currently, there are only Sandbox and Scenario Modes available.  I hope that the other two modes will become available soon.  I like creating cars that are wildly excessive for their time with this game, just to see what could have been in certain times.  This game is a great time waster that happens to be very cool and make a lot of noise (no mufflers on the motor that is).  Unleash your automotive creativity and get this today.  Worth a buy if you are interested in this sort of thing.  I would get the demo first, just to make sure that this game is right for you.			"

								Pretty good game. I'm currently in an automotive program and have rebuilt my second engine. Missing some things like V-12 engines and the old inline 8 engine. If the developers were to add diesel engines that would be awesome. Also would love to see a rotory engine so I can dink around with one of those bad boys. Also we need V-6 engines not just V-8's. One thing that is bothering me, is that when the camshaft lobes contact the push rods they seem to just go right through the lobes instead of pushing up on them and lifting the lifters to push down the valves. IDK why that bothers me, but it does. I like how the game tries to incorporate emmision control things like cadylitic converters, but you are forgetting some things like an EGR valve, PCV valvem O2 sensors and other autmotive inovations that cut back on emmisions.Other than that this game rocks for people who are into automotive. Would love to recreate my 12 valve cummins though... Lol			"

This game has SO MUCH potential for those who love designing and creating all the while teaching them about auto mechanics and the inner workings of vehicles. The videos are great and we need more! Tips and tricks video would also be great. I would love to see more graphics for the vehicles (stripes , flames and customization for the vehicles themselves.)

								 A great Automotive tycoon game where  you can build your own car line.  This is actually  quite fantastic. while it is still in early  realease and there are tons of changes and additions made to it now and then  and on top of the great selection of workshop items  to add to the game.   This is more of a techical game and it's focus is completely  on building the  cars themselves from the floor up frame  body style and engine.  you can give specifications to the interior but not make actual physical changes to it...yet? that might be something cool to see. you can  see how well the car performs by having your tame racing driver take it a spin around a track which you have two to chose from.. which one definitely isn't the top gear test track.  You do have an option to add other custom tracks.  the cars you make can be very unique.  This game still has a LONG way to go  but  is worth the money to spend. it already is worth its price..and as said not even finished.  if you are into  Cars and Tycoon games  get this game. If you love the techinical  side of car building...get this game. if  you are looking for a racing game this isn't it... but still get it because it is awesome.			"

This game has grown into an AMAZING platform for designing cars and engines, even if the original ""Tycoon"" premise is yet to really manifest itself.  There's now a ""Lite"" mode, but it doesn't even matter because the design portion is so entralling. If you're into cars at all, YOU NEED THIS GAME.			"

								TD:LR: Many recent negative reviews are about the lak of development in the past year or so. But this has all been work on a MASSIVE update, so I feel it is justified.This game is definetly in my top 10  sim games of all time. This is due to its fantastic car desinger, which is praised many times over. And now, with the tycoon features coming, as well as a complete graphical overhall, I am more excited than ever.In the reviews, however, you will find many who say that updates are slow, especially in the past year, of which I can agree. However, I have seen many indie early access projects fail from implementing too much, too fast. Along with Stonehearth, I think it is better to go slow and fix all the problems before adding more content.The reason progress has been so slow as of late is that the team is working on the aformentioned graphical upgrade and Tycoon element. This has greatly slowed down the frequency of updates to the game. However, the team has released a video at least once a month while working on this update, and judging them, this update is NOT half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ While it won't have all the features of the full game, it looks like a solid experience. And if it is not, I will make sure to come back and adjust this review.			"

								I have a love / hate with this game.I love the idea of it and its possibilities. I've spent about a year on/off playing it and can appreciate it is a big task for a dev team of 3 to manage. Although after a year, it feels not a lot has changed. Even though my PC exceeds the minimum requirements - the game is still clunky and fidgety. And (from what I gather through forums etc) unless you know a bit about graphic design - you're stuck with the limited selection of headlamps etc / workshop items available. So after a while, it get's a little repetitive. I follow the Devs Youtube so am aware it's a constantly maintained project and hope that soon we will start to see real progress from a users perspective. So saying that, yep - would recommend but with understanding that this is far from the finished article.			"

								This game is a must have if you are majoring/planning to major Automotive or Mechanical Engineering. It's a virtual encyclopaedia of cars, and it has taught me lots of things in just ten minutes of gameplay. Yes, it may be slow at updates and isn't exactly a tycoon game, but I think the main reason this game was made was to teach people how cars work and how to work on them, especially if you're looking forward to become an engineer.

								Pretty good game. I'm currently in an automotive program and have rebuilt my second engine. Missing some things like V-12 engines and the old inline 8 engine. If the developers were to add diesel engines that would be awesome. Also would love to see a rotory engine so I can dink around with one of those bad boys. Also we need V-6 engines not just V-8's. One thing that is bothering me, is that when the camshaft lobes contact the push rods they seem to just go right through the lobes instead of pushing up on them and lifting the lifters to push down the valves. IDK why that bothers me, but it does. I like how the game tries to incorporate emmision control things like cadylitic converters, but you are forgetting some things like an EGR valve, PCV valvem O2 sensors and other autmotive inovations that cut back on emmisions.Other than that this game rocks for people who are into automotive. Would love to recreate my 12 valve cummins though... Lol			"

								I stumbled on Automation a long time ago, while looking for a modern version of Detroit (DOS). Automation is an all-encompassing car company simulator. I picked up the demo about two years ago, and have been following the game’s development ever since.Rarely do I ever buy an Early Access game, but Automation as it stands today is WELL WORTH the $30.It’s a little buggy following a complete UI overhaul. Although many features are still in development, you do have the ability to start designing all of your cars. You can make everything from classic steel body cruisers to modern day turbocharged super cars. The design features are powerful and addicting. It truly is unlike any other car designer I’ve ever played with, and it presents itself almost exactly as how you’d imagine a car designer should be.I for one have designed a 1960's Licoln type car, a 1970's muscle car, an early 1990's era pony car, a number of economy hatchbacks, and a few mid engined hyper cars (like the Bugatti Veyron). The range of cars and the depth of the customization is unrivalled.Automation could not be in better hands, as developers, Camshaft Software, work tirelessly. Unlike other developers, the guys at Camshaft have an open and positive relationship with their fans and the Automation online community, being active in all areas of the official forums.As it stands today, it’s a great game. It has great potential. It has a great dev team. There’s very little downside. I highly recommend this title.			"

								I was a Beta Tester for this game back in 2012, recently switched my subscription to Steam. When I first found this game, I was pyched that may have found a game simular to Detroit and was more interested in the Tycoon aspect of this game compaired to the Car Designer. I was happy to beta test this game for a period of 8 months or so, but found most of the focus was on the car design aspect of things. From what I see in the dev log's they are about to start the management side of the game, but I found it took way too long to get to this point. I personally have stopped playing this game until the Tycoon part of it is being worked on. Now I'm not a big car guy, I struggled to meet goals set when beta testing the car designer as I struggled with the terminology or what things do. I seriously hope that the final game offers a way to purchase pre-made engines, car designs and such as I'll most likely end up creating a car with the power of a lawnmower and trying to sell it to the public. :)			"

								This is the first early access game that has made me part with my money. Whilst I wasnt 100% sure what to expect, I think the game shows great potential. the developers have obviously spent a lot of time around the engine/running gear side of the building process, and I hope they go into as much detail with interior detailing and paint/decals.The build system is intuitive and pretty straight forward to follow.I would like to see the following implementations as the game progresses through development:1. A wider selection of wheels and tyres2. More choices for interiors (i.e. Seats, Steering Wheels, Clocks, Carpet, ICE, etc.)3. The ability to have clear glass and various shades of tinting4. A choice of wing mirrors, body panels, side skirts, splitters, etc5. Various paint finishes (Gloss, Matte, Pearlescent, etc.)6. Decals (stripes, tribal, letters, numbers, grafitti, etc.)Looking forward to future updates ;)			"

Very polished for an early access title, the Devs are in it for the love of it no tthe cash.This game faithfully recreates changes in engines based on bore/stroke ratios, number of cylinders, ignition timing, fuel quality, cam timing and endless other options. I have recreated several real world engines both factory and modified and the game very closely models real world engine dyno results.Plus it's a lot of fun taking part in the forum 'build this car' games.Can't wait for more content and of course the tycoon stage!

								This is a very tentative recommendation. If you want to design engines this game will provide a few hours of good fun as it is now. The car designer is good too but the novelty wears off fairly quickly. I bought this game in January of 2014, well before it became available on Steam. It was very hyped and looked promising, but very little has changed in the last two years, and it had already been in development for sime time back then. I have resigned myself to never seeing the tycoon aspect of this game, which is the part I most looked forward to. GearCity is a great tycoon car game that has a very dedicated developer, but it lacks the things that this game excels at (intricate design). So, as a sandbox engine designer this game is fun, if a little overpriced, but if you're looking for a fun tycoon style game this is not it (and may never be).			"

								I’m rewriting this review because the first one didn’t do it justice. This is the best early access Games on steam and in my top five most played games on steam. The amount of detail put into this game so far is amazing, especially for a game that isn't even half done. The developers have great respect for their fans. you can pretty much make any car you can think of from a Yugo to a Lambo. The engine designer is the most fleshed out for any game i have played without being cryptic like a professional engine designer the real companies use. You may not be able to make racecars or tuners but that's not the point, your job is to make regular production cars and this game does it the best out of any. If you looking for a game where you can make pretty much any car you want, this is the best for your money.			"

								Still early access. But building engines is such a cool rewarding experience. Instead of the standard car game upgrade system (Turbo Upgrade 1, 2, 3, etc) you get to adjust real parameters that impact performance in real ways. If you've got even a fraction of an engineer's mind, you'll love this game.			"

								Great start to a game with great potential.It definitely needs refinement but this is a fantastic game for any car guy who wants to design their own ride from the ground up or anyone who wants to learn more about the finer details of an automobile.The engine creation tool is very well done and will entertain for hours.The rest of the vehicle still needs some attention to detail, but the game is in alpha and constantly improving.Most certainly recomend!

								If you would like to be able and test your own full blown cars, this is the best way to do it short of becoming a graphic designer and or a CAD expert. It allows you to build and tune the engine and a good amount of details about the car.However, the tycoon part of the game is not done yet. In fact, other than demographics charts based on 3 ficticious countries, there is not a  ""run your own car company"" feature yet. If you take as what it is and what it will and can be, then it is PHENOMINAL.Automation is on the track for game greatness. They are taking there time, but they are really getting a lot done for a 3 man team. They are relatively active in the community and on forums. In fact, check out Killrob's little dev updates on youtube to explain newer features and upgrades in the game that may not be explined elsewhere. In a nut shell, if GearCity and Automation had a baby, it'd be the best car simlutator to date. Though neither are very optimized. At least not yet. Crashes, bugs, an clunky/incomplete interfaces can become apparent. I really look forward to Automation being ported over to the Unreal engine. My biggest complain is slowish development. There is so much to be done to finish the tycoon game, yet there are talking of adding more detail into the car designer aspect right now. While I beleive in the future, adding resonance algorithms and more exhaust and intake design control would be great, we should get the tycoon game running. Once the tycoon game is running, balancing both it and the car designer together will take place and we can develop both. The team seams to focus 90% on the car designing aspect. (As the dev pointed out, that has been changing. They are now focusing more on developing the tycoon portion of the game =D)As such, the game is a pretty phenominal car designer and tester. Pretty good visuals and sounds. At least sometimes!In short, if you're a ""car"" person, chances are you'll like this game.			"

								let me start by saying that this is an ALPHA, and it shows, as there are a large number of game breaking bugs. Lots of content appears to be not implemented yet. And as of now there are only inline and v engine configurations. I have used the educational materials to teach others how an internal combustion engine works, And the educational videos included are top notch, and more to come as it seems. This is a great sandbox engine for building motors, and the car design aspects are there, but l;eave ALOT of room for improvement. i.e. a 1590cc inline 4 should fit into a crx body no problem; sadly this is not the case. The motor building and configuring works as it should, I was able to recreate a D16y8 motor to exact specs, and it performed exactly as expected in a sim environment. For all of it's flaws this is what has gotten me hooked on this game. I'm excited to see where it goes, and hopeful that some of the things that get to me will be polished up, like proper belts, without broken textures, or passing THROUGH pulleys. And proper ""realistic"" scaling of engine revolutions based on rpm.In it's current state, the game is definitely not worth $30, however I saw this as an investment in the future of the game. I hope I'm not disappointed in the end. And you'll probably read about it if so.			"

								Do you like cars? Do you like to design your own stuff? Strap in tight and bring some climbing gear for the steep learning curve,... or just start of like a sane person and do the tutorials in the scenarios. Not much is simplified in this game design choice wise, which makes it oh so fun to toy around with as petrolhead, even though the tycoon part isn't finished yet. Got bored of toying around and doing scenarios? Plenty of player created challenges in the official forums.Seriously, if you're a petrolhead and got a grain of patience, not buying this game is a sin.			"

								Okay, let's be fair here.  This is an Early Access game, it's not finished yet, and there's a lot of little quirks here or there.But, all totaled up, this game's addictive in a good way.  Sure, you start at first thinking, ""Well, what do I do now?"" as you're working through the build of your first car, but you soon progress through that and well into ""Let's see, today, I'm going to build a car with a 16 liter V12 because that sounds like a really good idea right now.""This is, of course, made much better with the community, specifically the community-added car bodies/ fixtures, and also the community forums, where challenges are often posted and people, myself included, compete with a car in a variety of different tasks.This game ends up being one of those games you find yourself playing because you're not in the mood for a fast-paced shooter, or a role-playing game, or even a racing game, but just a casual semi-sandbox car-building game.Is it for everyone?  No.  But if you've ever wanted to try your hand at building a car, or an engine, without going into the extreme amounts of detail needed for a raw simulation game, this does it well.			"

The reviews stating that nothing happens are just plain wrong.At the moment (September of 2016) they are working on porting the game to the Unreal Engine so it is to be expected that there ist not much happening.But after that, the game will run much smoother and look way better than it ever could on their current ""key"" Engine.For all the people who are still thinking about getting the game, I recommend looking at their YouTube channel where they regularly post small or big Dev Updates and other Videos showing the current development.I will edit the review as the game progresses and when its finished.

								I have a love / hate with this game.I love the idea of it and its possibilities. I've spent about a year on/off playing it and can appreciate it is a big task for a dev team of 3 to manage. Although after a year, it feels not a lot has changed. Even though my PC exceeds the minimum requirements - the game is still clunky and fidgety. And (from what I gather through forums etc) unless you know a bit about graphic design - you're stuck with the limited selection of headlamps etc / workshop items available. So after a while, it get's a little repetitive. I follow the Devs Youtube so am aware it's a constantly maintained project and hope that soon we will start to see real progress from a users perspective. So saying that, yep - would recommend but with understanding that this is far from the finished article.			"

It's still in early access (by the time I made this), I know, but it needs more polish. For example, I was testing an engine for another car, and I used the little tab that lets you select cars on the fly. When I did so, the car reverted a few versions. Why? I don't know. And sometimes placing items like taillights can be really buggy, even on official models. I will recommend this game, but take it with a grain of salt.			"

								One of my favorite Games at the momement. Even though i only use the Sandbox, i keep playing the game a lot. Everytime trying new ideas.I think you have to be a car nut, to enjoy the game at this Early Access Stage. I am most certainly one. There are some little annoying bugs at the moment, but this is an Early Access, so keep that in mind. Can't wait for the final Game.			"

								You puts some in liquid flame, some black goop, and a little air in there, it makes some metal bits do things all so you can go to the store and buy some chips. For the longest of times, I was curious what actually happens inside an internal combustion. If you are bugged by the same curiosity and are willing to throw some money at said curiosity, then this is the little fun nugget you've been waiting for. While still having that musky smell of being in the early stages, it's still very much a delivering program. While you won't go from bumbling idiot to a mechanical genius, it will definitely impart to you some knowledge. Certainly can't wait for the future updates. Quite a bit of potential.			"

								To understand how the game work and how to use all the tools can take a couple minutes, you will find this game very addictive, since you always try to improve your cars and engines. You can build your car from scratch or use a pre-made model also choose from a front,middle,rear engine as well as 2x4 and 4x4. The engine customization is just amazing with over 100+ choice of parts and tuning - (timing,ignition,air intake,exhaust diameter,fuel mixture,turbos,I4,I6,V6,V8 and rpm) are the choices you have from many others. This is an early acces game but still very complete,the Engine Designer and Car Designer already available for you to try out.			"

								A few months ago I wrote a negative review for this game, but now I want ti change my review. In this game, you build your own company from the ground up, this game goes so in detail with the cars. You can litterly zoom in on the suspension or engine and see al the diffrent parts. It is in early acsess and missing some thing but the forums say that they will be appering soon. The game (which already looks pretty good) is getting remade in the Ureal Engine 4, which is amazing! From all their videos and photos I can say that it will look amazing and very excited. The price is still expensive, but I think it is slowing starting to make it worth it. The upsates are slow and are stated to take around three to four months, but when they do come they are amazing. At first when starting ther game you may be confused but the tutorial is also very clear, and teaches you a lot on how a real engine works and in heavy deatil.  If you are big car guy and want to make your own car company and cars, juts go and buy the game. Even it is in early access it still feels like a full game.			"

								Loving the game. Wondering if any consideration had gone towards expanding the content. Wankel engines, H- blocks, more flat-head designs than just V-8, maybe allow the ability to develope some experimental technology. I believe this platform has the potential to become a credited tool for the submission and branding of products to existing automotive manufacturers across the world. The free sculpting idea is great! It drastically widens the ""use-ability"" of the inventory, you are literally only limited by your imagination. With more of todays technology, and the ability to test some engineering innovation, this program will disrupt major gaming console sales! To the creators, thank you for the amazing game but do not give up, there is way more you can do!			"

								Note: my experience with Automation is not current as I haven't been able to play it in about three months because of migrating my main gaming machine to Linux.Pros:Good way to explore vehicle engine parameters, such as stroke and bore and their effects on power and efficiency.  Several useful scenarios and tutorials to learn about what does what.  Developers are active and responsive and have added a ton of features and are working on porting to a new 3D engine.  The Campaign mode is apparently now active and looks pretty good, although the sandbox and scenarios were plenty to keep me busy and happy.Cons:Game would crash periodically, usually after updating.  Not sure if that is still valid for newer builds, and crashes weren't a gamebreaker.  It happens, especially when using a program that is still in active development.  No Linux version (yet), but hopefully that will come.Conclusion:The engine parameterization simulator is interesting and accurate from an engineering point of view.  As the game is not a complete product development is in a constant state of flux.  If you are a car guy like I am, you will love fiddling with all the different bits that go in to a motor while trying to get the best efficiency and power out of it.  Great fun!			"

								Note: my experience with Automation is not current as I haven't been able to play it in about three months because of migrating my main gaming machine to Linux.Pros:Good way to explore vehicle engine parameters, such as stroke and bore and their effects on power and efficiency.  Several useful scenarios and tutorials to learn about what does what.  Developers are active and responsive and have added a ton of features and are working on porting to a new 3D engine.  The Campaign mode is apparently now active and looks pretty good, although the sandbox and scenarios were plenty to keep me busy and happy.Cons:Game would crash periodically, usually after updating.  Not sure if that is still valid for newer builds, and crashes weren't a gamebreaker.  It happens, especially when using a program that is still in active development.  No Linux version (yet), but hopefully that will come.Conclusion:The engine parameterization simulator is interesting and accurate from an engineering point of view.  As the game is not a complete product development is in a constant state of flux.  If you are a car guy like I am, you will love fiddling with all the different bits that go in to a motor while trying to get the best efficiency and power out of it.  Great fun!			"

								Despite the slow update, I would still recommend this game.Automation is so far mainly a car-design game, which features thorough technologies of vehicle.Fascinating for petrol-heads, not for gamers looking for a real Tycoon Game.(even if the Tycoon mode is fully completed, the design part is already complicated)Automation provides a whole design of a car, which no other game does. That's the reason I recommend it.（$30入的EA，当时Steam都没有国区）			"

								I really like this game. The car and engine designer are good, but if the dev team does what they promise to do, then the game would be great. Overall i give it a 4 star review.			"
