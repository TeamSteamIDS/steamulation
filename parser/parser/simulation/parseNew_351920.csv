												Similar to other reviewers, I remember playing the incredible machine series as a kid.  This latest iteration in the genre provides a plethora of rube goldberg contraptions to solve and a great soundtrack to boot!			"

												 I played the first Crazy Machines as a kid, and spent my time in the editor littering the corkboard with bombs and blowing robots out of the screen. I picked up this game, and now i'm building more elaborate and thoughtful contraptions.  Instead of using bombs and robots, I'm building elaborate contraptions with many steps-although the goal is the same. it's still fun as hell to blow unicorns up with gas barrels, make modified trebuchets, etc. A lot of fun all around, definately recommend!

												I remember the very first Crazy Machines game from when I was a kid, developers somehow manage to mess up great classics, but this was revived perfectly, better looking, more content, and great gameplay, just like it has always been.			"

												Crazy Machines 3, rebooted after 5 years. Is that a reboot I was hoping for? Let's find it out.On Crazy Machines, anything counts as machine. Grab your household items and place the missing parts to complete the machines, no matter how crazy they are. It offers 80 levels and a recently added free extension, sorted in a wide range of difficulties. Nothing's impossible as long as you think and/or improvise, as it always was. What I most liked is the availabilty of Steam Workshop: Make your own objects and levels, share them and try various works made by the community. All of that is packaged with nice graphics and music bringing you peace of mind.I remember when I played Crazy Machines: The Inventor's Workshop (2004). Things have changed in both positive and negative ways, often a matter of taste. For example, some parts I loved experimenting with like steam machines don't appear here, as well as spinning and mirroring of parts. The placing of parts is not infinitely variable anymore and instead you get a tile system which might have less possibilities but in the other hand it also means that it makes things easier. Back in the days, every millimeter counted, resulting some nearly impossible levels. I'm kind of glad that it's balanced now. And there's one thing I miss most, the Crazy Inventor. But maybe he sits in front of the computer instead? Who knows..With everything said, I think Crazy Machines 3 is a successful reboot and can recommend it to anyone who is into puzzles and physics.

												Some really difficult Riddles with a lot of medium / easy ones. Not a lot of user-Content yet, but with the great Level-Editor im sure that will follow.Mechanics are introduced in the 27 ""easy"" levels (some of them are quite tricky).The 20 Medium and 10 Hard Levels are combining the different mechanics and require some more thinking.But the real Challange are the 15 Ultra hard levels. They can show you the possibilities of this game and the Level-Editor.Solved all Riddles in about ~5 Hours gametime, although i have to say that about 2 hours were spent on 4 levels alone.Would recommend if you want tricky Riddles for your brain! :)			"

A Physics Based Puzzle Game

+ The gameplay is a ton of fun and very charming. Essentially, you are given an incomplete (Rube Goldberg) ""machine"" or contraption, and must try to find where the missing pieces go in order to cause a crazy chain reaction to complete an objective. + Visually the game looks incredible. It's very surprising how much work the developers put into the graphics. Great detail, lighting, shadows, and overall very appealing to watch.+ The levels themselves are all original and very creative. Each level seems to have completely new mechanics, puzzles, objects, and backgrounds which keeps the game feeling fresh from start to finish. A+++ level design+ Plenty of unique environments across 80+ levels + A map editor along with Steam Workshop support which adds a ton of replayability+ Great relaxing soundtrack+ The game may seem easy at a glance, but can be quite challengingHonestly, I think this game deserves a Hidden Gem award. If you enjoy physics based puzzle games, you really can not go wrong with Crazy Machines 3			"

												As a closed beta tester, as well as a fan of the series I was clearly disappointed; that is, until I made my way to the later parts of the campaign.The way they designed the campaign is not very good, nor is it understandable to me.The audience of this game will mostly be people who want to challenge their brains, invent, try out stuff, be crazy, however the poorly designed machienes in the first couple of chapters in the campaign that offer almost no way to solve them other than the intended, would've made me give the game a bad review and leave it, if I wasn't a beta tester.What I didn't expect (though hoped for), is that the later parts not only look better and more fitting overall, but also allowed me to actually have fun with the game.I tried to complete every mission in an unintentional way, firstly, because it is more challenging (which means more fun to me) and secondly, because I sometimes had no clue, what the intentional way actually was.I wish the game was a little more well-planned, but I eventually got something that met my expectations.

												Sadly i have to review this game as negative.TL:DR, game is rigged in optimisation and mechanics, needs to be fixed ASAPIf you don't have a really beefy computer, don't buy this, until the game is more optimized.FAKT and Daedelic, is not possible that a N-VIDIA GT 730, makes this game run like a snail, with lossy FPS and stuttering on high settings, even medium, not even ultra! I get that simulating physics can eat up memory but not this muchAlso sandbox is a hell, compared to the older CMs, CM3 lacks ALOT of functions and important items And campaings will drive you mad, 'cause CLIPPING WARNING EVERYWHERE! EVEN WITH BACKGROUND STUFF!So it's a 6.5 for me.If you wanna buy this game, check your specs before, and look for future updates.			"

Game is laggy on my modern PC and corrupts it a little (allways need to error-proof it trough steam or it chrashes) meaning it makes it so unplayable, too because of bugs...sometimes very hard when it's not needed or not clear, even feels unfinished to me... Deadlic won't update it or something... DO NOT BUY! "

And even though crazy machines 3 isn´t as lovely and detailed as the prequels, it still seems to be a nice game :) The addition of the Workshop addes unlimited posibilities too, so the lack of details should be no problem :) Haven´t played a lot yet, but I am sure this game is recommendable.
