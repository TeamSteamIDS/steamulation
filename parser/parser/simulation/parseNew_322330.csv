								Just spent an 8 hour session with a stranger who was willing enough to show me the ropes. From a basic camp, we managed to establish a good base of operations growing crops, setting up spider lairs, bee hives and beefulo herds. Definitely appreciate players such as Hxgvamp to take the time to teach a noob what to expect in this new lore. 10/10 gameplay, 9/10 replayability, 11/10 community.			"

												UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.Starting off:Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and EndlessSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.Wilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a ""Jury-Rigged Portal"" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the ""Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart"" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).Characters -Wilson:Pros -Grows a beardCons - None.Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.Willow:Pros -Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons -When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.Wolfgang:Pros -Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons - 1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only ""Power up"" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.Wendy:Pros -Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons -Does -.25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.WX78:Pros - Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.Cons -Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.Wickerbottom:Pro -Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus.Cons -Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY. PLEASE STOP ADDING ME			"

								This is the one thing this game was missing, multiplayer! And it is extremely well done!You can host your server from the game without the need for port forwarding, downloading extra server files etc.The way the servers handle mods is also great, if the server has a special server mod it is automatically transfered to your client (this is unnoticable), with the exception of some client side mods (UI related and such)...All in all, if you love Don't Starve, you MUST get this expansion!Even if you don't have friends, you can play on public servers, the community is great out there!P.S. I gave the extra copy to one of my friends already so please stop adding and asking if I can give you the extra copy. (I write this only because I have recieved multiple friend requests from people who saw this review asking me if i could give them the extra copy)			"

								An interesting new twist on the original Don't Starve, it now proves to be quite a challenge.New features include: -Twice as many mouths to feed-People who eat their scarce rations without first cooking it-People who sit at home base and squawk for food like a baby bird to its mother-People who don't wear armour expecting to dodge every attack like an anime character-The ghosts of said people, draining everybody's sanity both in-game and real life-Terribly organised bases-Terribly organised chests-Stuff thrown everywhere by people who just plain despise organisation-People who draw treeguards into our designated tree farm-People who try to tank hounds-People who try to tank tentacles-People who try to tank ANYTHING-People who wander off and then scream when they get lost-People who wander off because they saw a ""Truffala tree"" (I'm looking at you, Jonah)-Twice the map sizes-Twice the treeguards-Twice the hounds-Twice the spiders-And most importantly, twice the starving to deathAnd I loved every single minute of it.

								Don't Starve Together has been an amazing experience. But that is because I played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay. For the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter. I however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version. With no in-game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life. Everything kills you, especially your friends. The pace of the game may feel slow but soon the amount of resources to gather and refine become immense and turn this game into a fast pace race to gather the gear to survive the winter.In closing this game has an unforgiving learning curve which is only magnified by the masses of new players who have never tried the single player experience. Prepare to fail many times through your own mistakes and those of others.Have fun and don't burn the berry bushes. Don't Starve Together is a MUST BUY from Klei Entertainment.-12|29|2014 (94 hrs) Vice			"

								This game is really about teamwork.You have to share food, supplies, weapons, and clothes between all players to survive longer (which is the goal of this game). The game saves your progress automatically with each new day so you can continue playing in the same world. You don't have to play until you're starving in game and/or in the real world :DI played it with friends and also with random players and my recommendation is to try it with friends.You can't just let a friend go hungry or let him/her face the hounds alone, right? You set up a base together and make some labor division, give them a nice Garland. I found it a bit difficult to do all the things above with a player I never met before.That being said, the game is an excellent way to test your inner survivor and to learn to work in a team.			"

												Sometimes, we choose games based on a variety of criteria: the preferred genre, sensory engagement, friends' recommendations. We read reviews, compare walkthrough videos, look for replayability value. Curators, Steam sales, Humble Bundle - it all paints a rather complex picture of what we do before making our mind.And sometimes, games choose us. I have never been a person favouring survival games. I have never touched multiplayer before. My approach to games is that of a narratologist: I see them as stories. Thus, I am naturally better-disposed towards examples rich in narrative, possibly less flexibility in shaping the plot, but a fully-fleshed character and loving mythopoeia. I do not need other people to enjoy the action of a BioWare RPG or the king of first person sneakers like Thief. These are as wonderful on their own.I received DST as a gift from my friend. With no practical experience in multiplayer games, I took the plunge due to her own magnificent person. And on the colourful crusade against death of bees and pengulls (my typical bane at the time), I caught the bug going by the game's name. Beginning to host myself, with the ability to create more hostile maps through the careful use of prefab presets and lore-friendly mods, then starting a group to coordinate our sessions and joining the Klei forums came naturally, with little to no realisation on my side. And finally, with a group of similarly-minded regulars in love with the written word, we took our TDE wilderness adventure into the game for the added challenge of survival while storytelling. On the doorstep of my first anniversary of setting foot outside the familiar glowing portal, I am honoured to highlight the impressive replay value of DST. With plenty of detailed reviews dealing with the intricacies of the game, I would rather focus on the bigger picture. DST is one of the rare games growing with you. You start as a rather hapless freshman in a world of wacky science, grim-sweet humour and dangers galore. You learn the importance of bearing a light as darkness approaches, remembering your fragile sanity and crafting items whose recipes are often amusingly bereft of sense (whoever thought wearing a fantasy elephant's trunk as a vest would be a good idea, I applaud you). Topmost, you die. Often. In very endearing ways. But you (hopefully) learn from your mistakes and with time find yourself successfully facing the most daunting of threats. At some point, you feel you have beaten the game. You have at least one big camp spreading across the horizon, parade in thulecite gear and fry giants with magical staves. But this is the point where it is all starting: you seek new ways to challenge yourself. You tinker with worldgen options (""Let's set hound mounds to lots!""). You browse the workshop for mods (where Sturgeon's Law is as accurate as ever, yet still worth the risk for the elusive 10% of gems). You try out new characters, new strategies, new maps. You come up with your own challenges beyond Lights Out. You are prone to becoming the member of the community whose lair is the forums and secular cult: the hallowed Potato Cup. Maybe you actually start GM-ing a wilderness adventure to expand the elegantly unobtrusive plot.Finally, you likely realise the human aspect of Don't Starve Together in comparison to the impressive singleplayer. It is more fun, more engaging, more threatening, even, to die in company. Which, naturally, is many-faced, since the people you meet on public servers are as likely to make a griefer coming-out as become acquaintances, game buddies, friends. DST, while with many differences to its predecessor Don't Starve, can be played alone, with no player slots open or a password. But most people, yours truly included, find soloing with no other transients around rather upsetting after a longer while. Your character may be thriving on their own, but your own mind will keep processing the eerie solitude of this fascinating world. Disclaimer: my game copy was a gift. Since then, I have been picking DST as a go-to present. Another friend of mine is scheduled to receive her own for Christmas. The bug is very virulent.			"

Me and my friend had everything stocked up; tons of bunnies in the chests, two ice boxes filled with food from our farms and drying racks, two crockpots just for those nights that you needed really filling food, two themal stones, enough clothing to keep warmth for a decent distance away from base camp.Had a wall built with three or so beefalo corralled in so that we could get manure and beefalo wool during the night. Honestly, we had this entire thing down set, winter wasn't going to beat us. He said he was going to the bathroom and left me to tend to the fire to keep us through the night. Naturally, I didn't have any problem with that- surely we were set for a night. And then my character heard something in the distance, something that was getting closer increasingly faster. Thinking it was just a wolf, I grabbed my spear and armor, wolves weren't anything to worry about. Except the ground shook the closer it came, rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen; giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye, every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it's mouth hole, every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston. When my friend came back from the bathroom, everything was gone. He died instantly, unable to move or defend himself from the Deerclops, a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight. The Deerclops knew how to get me too, chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out, unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend. Blind now in the darkness, all I could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before Charlie bore down on me, snuffling out the last vestiges of health I had before it was all over. What happened?! My friend exclaimed when he came back, incredulous that this much could happen in a span of a few spare minutes, the monochromatic view on his screen the same as the utter failure that was on my own. Indeed, my friend, what happened? 10/10 Would play again			"

												As me being not a fan of single player games I decided to pick this game up with a friend. So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now. If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently. I really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features. Really pumped to give the ""A New Reign: Part 2"" Update a try tonight.			"

								although i've only played it for about 3 hours; here's what i can tell.1.) the gamethere is minimal lag, and you do not need the hassle of port-forwarding and hamachi and all that, it's already set up! aswell, the game is great and well balanced for multiplayer.2.) communitythe community is friendly, and most of the time, people will band together and make settlements. 4 hands are better than 2! i find that we all get together at night, make food and plan on what we will do tommarow, wether it be gathering food, building walls and traps, or sending a small group of 3 to hunt down a large monster, or to go out and gather more bushes, grass and saplings.3.) Consthe game goes a bit too fast sometimes. what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month. aswell, food (although still a problem) is nearly non-existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning. this goes for health aswell, as bees seem to be someone's top priority. if you are not dumb, or take something on too tough for you, you will never die. (unless you are WX because rain is so BS)4.) end resultthe game is well balanced and fun. there is a dynamic knowledge of what we need to do. you can eventually get to a point where you have ""morning routines"" like gathering the rabbits from the field, and harvesting honey, without the worry of needing to spend your ENTIRE day doing that, like you do in singleplayer. the game move much faster, and the ability to respawn (if you have nice teammates) makes it much more enjoyable, with the fear of permideath always on your shoulder. i would reccomend this game to those that did not enjoy the super-stress of the singleplayer, but likes the overall gameplay, or just because they want to play with friends. this, however, is a short burning flame. the game does not last long, as server hosts need to leave, ending the game for everyone. in the end, however, i give it a good review. it is great gameplay with a slight gameplay twist, that ends up turning it into what seems as an entirely new game by the devs. 8/10; brb going to go play it again.

								+Absolutely the best co-op game (with friends) I ever played, it is better than L4Ds, better than Paydays+Introduced this to my girlfriend (who is a non-gamer), and she was instantly hooked and developed a passion for Webber, so this is the best ""plot to convert target girl into gamer"" game+This game reminds me of life and growing up. When you were a baby, everything is new to you. You have to explore and learn about the world you are in, so that you can live/survive better. As you play more, you will learn step by step, bit by bit, how to survive better, just like a baby growing up. This game is also here to unleash all your hidden childhood mischief that you always had, don't believe me? Just look at the number of people in the reviews killed by stealing Tallbird eggs!+Best WTF Factor. Like to hear your friends say ""What the XXXX"" in many different musical tones, pitches and styles? You don't ever need to ask them anymore because this game does it automatically for you. I can assure you that seeing anything that looks bigger than themselves for the first time will produced the desired effect for your entertainment			"

												My review of the game:Don’t Starve Together is a dark fantasy survival game where players are transported into a randomly generated map that is eager to kill them. Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger for as long as possible. Craft weapons to fight monsters, cook food to stave starvation, and make sure you always have a fire for nighttime. If the harsh winter, packs of hounds, or dapper walruses don’t get you, something else will. Players can choose from three game modes with different features, including whether to play with complete strangers or friends, or to allow PvP.Don't Starve Together key features:Hunting and Gathering – collect resources from different biomes and creatures to cook, build, and craft things to survive.Team Play – everyone must survive! Share and support each other in the dark world, because if one player dies, their presence as a ghost will eventually kill you by driving you insane.Crafting – create your own tools, food, items, structures, and clothes to help you survive through the brutal seasons.Randomly Generated New Worlds – new maps make each game different and unique. You’ll never find yourself in the same world twice.Great Soundtrack and SFX – the music of Don’t Starve Together is refreshing, creepy, and haunting. Each character is voiced by a different instrument, which adds an interesting flavor to the sound dynamic of the game.This game is incredibly fun. I sunk about 270 hours into it already. I recommend playing with friends or on a private server because there is known to be griefers, and I know of one instance we ended up restarting many times due to it. That's to be expected with a game like this, and at times can add to the gameplay, especially when PvP is on.This is the sort of game which tells you ""don't starve"" as a helpful basic premise and then seems to delight in revealing the sheer volume of other things you shouldn't touch, prod, eat, walk near, or forget to build in case of sudden death.In fact it would be more accurate to have called it ""Don't Starve And Also Don't Try To Make Friends With That Tall Bird And Did You Remember To Build A Fire And There Are A Lot More Spiders In That Nest Than You Think And Seriously Please Stop Going Near That Bird"". Oh, and in case you're wondering, Webber isn't a spiderperson. He's a child that lives inside the carcass of the spider which tried to eat him. Which is, y'know, quite a bit darker.If you like survival games, if you enjoy Tim Burton-esque artwork, or if you’re just looking for an unforgiving challenge of a game, pick up Don’t Starve immediately. Pretty much most of the stuff about this game is fantastic, and you’ll undoubtedly fall in love with it. Ultimately, it’s a game that just keeps giving, even as it tears your life from you.8.5/10			"

								This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers. Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers. Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.			"

								Loving the game so far, heres my review: TBH it got really boring when playing alone ( Meaning when we didn't have DT:Together), but when youhave someone else with you surviving its an epic experience! The game stays fresh because you usually find something new and interesting to do every time you play, like crafting something entirely new or making your base better etc.Theres randomly generated maps and with them comes randomly some structures, huts etc. I think i haven't seen all of them yet but still, really cool touchThe artwork is really pretty, and personally i liked the fact that when some of the characters talk (for example, Wilson) You hear random screeching-kind words, thought that was pretty cool :DThere's alot of animals and enemies to discover, and some of them will help you surviveThe designs of the mobs have been done pretty well and look really cool.Theres ''bosses'' too, i don't know if thats the real name of them since there aren't like a special place where you can fight them, they just kinda appearOnly flaw i've really seen is that the fighting is kinda clumsy at times, maybe it can be improved somehow, this is my personal opinion though :) Overall, its a great game with huge world to explore and best played with friends! I would recommend this to almost every gamer :)( My first ''real'' review, so its not perfect )			"

Not only is food a constant issue, as the title would imply, but you'll be trying to keep your wits about you as you battle the elements and a lot of strange, and terrifying, creatures.The Early Access deal/sale is definitely worth it if you have someone to play with.

												Great gameplay mechanics and a stunning artstyle make this one of the best multiplayer games you can experience. Don't Starve Together improves on the original survival single player experience by adding a multiplayer mode that's both fun and balanced.  None of the newly introduced multiplayer elements feel gimicky - the new player haunting system is an excellent addition and is a great way to get players to work together. The game also offers multiple lobby types catering to every type of playstyle - this helps to eliminate toxicity in the community leading to a more enjoyable experience for everyone.  Verdict: Firstly, this is a survival game designed for players that are into the survival genre, but it's also a great introduction for players wanting to try out a new, unique experience. Secondly, this is honestly a great example of how to build a solid multiplayer experience off of a single player foundation. With excellent modding support and great devs, this is an absolute no-brainer to get.10/10★★★★★			"

								Don't Starve Together is the multiplayer version of Klei Entertainment's survival game, Don't Starve. DST adds an increasing level of difficulty due to the rebalancing of the game, playing the game solo is not recomended due to enemies having an increased amount of health. The rebalancing in the game is fair as long as you have friends to help you out. DST is still in beta so not everything has been added to the game yet, but Klei is hard at work adding more and more to the game. If you like Don't Starve you're going to love Don't Starve Together and I highly recommend trying it out for yourself.			"

												I got it all the way back in Beta, a year or two ago. It's uncompromising, but not as hard as you'd think, once you get the hang of things.That being said, you will die. A lot.Especially with your friends, who will, at one point or another, decide they have the power of a god and attack that thing you knew was dangerous. They  will  . And it'll be  hilarious  . Trust me, it's an awesome experience.Worth every penny, and a few more.10/10.			"

								I have got to say this was a lot more fun than i expected! You would think with the lack of caves and reign of giants it would be super boring, but boy was i wrong.So let's get into the pro's and con's shall we?Pro's:+ You can host servers almost instantly from in game which you can customize the world and other option on if you are the host. (No portforwarding required!)+ Different emotes to give your character different facial expressions and or do different actions.+ Exclusive stuff planned (and a little bit added) that will only be coming out for DST. (I guess this could be a con depending on how you look at it).+ Few bugs for still being in beta+ Free for all don't starve owners! (Unless you want to get the beta early.)+ Is Don't starve! Except multiplayer!Con's- Things may be unbalanced but this will most likely change once the full game is out.- Not a whole lot of content in it for the moment. So the summary for this short review would be that it is worth a try unless you wan't the full experience at once and not spoil the small things already added or just experiencing an unfinished game. Though i think that goes with all early access games.			"

												I am just a new player. So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.Good luck!

I really enjoy looking at the cuteness. <3It looks like the computer creates the maps, so there's always something new to this game. That's a good thing. :DIt's good you can choose yourself how hard the game should be (the host can do that).It is really fun to play with friends!! You can help each other survive. You can also agree with your friends to do different tasks, to finish the things that need to be done.I don't have any reasons not to recommend it right now.I really recommend this game! :D			"

								The one thing Don't Starve was missing was co-op and for that reason alone this is definitely worth full price. Amazing fun can be had with friends on this, working together to survive winters, fight off hound attacks, explore further into the wilderness, etc.A major plus is also the mod support. The person hosting the server subscribes to a mod, sometimes the players have to as well, and there are very few issues (and the issues are usually related to a single mod instead of compatibility issues).My only complaint with Don't Starve also applies to this - there still is a significant frame rate drop the further you develop your base or whatever. Multiple farms, bee boxes, flowers, bees, butterflies on the screen in a very small vicinity halves the frame rate until you ""leave"" the area. The way around this though is better management of your base (i.e. building separate areas spread out for each whatever instead of EVERYTHING in a small space).Still, incredible fun. If they didn't send out beta keys i'd instantly buy multiple copies and send them off to friends.			"

								I raided a tallbird nest and got an egg. On a whim I decided to see if I could hatch it instead of cooking and eating it. What began was a heartwarming tale of raising a bird in this dark world. It took a long time to hatch and there were many difficulties. The dangers of the night and keeping it nice and cozy. When it did hatch it was dark night and I had just began building the walls of our happy home. It began by cowering in the corner. I finished the walls thinking it would try to escape. Instead it began to follow me. But it backed away when I tried to feed it. I soon became fond of my new companion. Unfortunately it became fond of me. It was a dark night when... The hound nation attacked. They broke down my walls and forced their way into my camp. The baby died trying to protect me. I would like to say I avenged it, but I died soon after. R.I.P. My Unnamed Baby. Gr8 m8 8/8Edit: I later learned that after full growth they kill you. So that was a hopeless situation no matter what.			"

If you have friends/ family whom can play DS and survive on their own for long periods of time, then this game will make doing so together much more fun. I honestly can't see why this is even in beta. The game looks, sounds, and feels, done to me. It isn't missing any obvious components & has solid gameplay without crashes, bugs, or disconnects. A truly stable environment for a truly unstable game world. AWESOME...I highly recomend this game!!! Don't miss out...			"

												This is a really awesome game to play with friends. There have been moments of suvival fails such as setting the entire forest on fire, or provoking the wrong beefalo (his poop is very valuable). But the elements of this game really bring your friends together (if you have a good enough connection to host).Sometimes the game can be really brutal, but thankfully there is a very nice mutator/customization system for manipulation the game into what is best for you. You need to have the most fun, so why not! Make it harder, make it easier, make it just right.Get this game with some friends and enjoy surviving a Tim Burton-esque world together.			"

I couldn't survive when big monsters surprise attack my camp at night.5. This game is quite cute. I couldn't resist to do stupid things.6. This game is quite hard. I couldn't keep meat for winter because they will spoil.7. This game is quite survival. I couldn't stop gathering resources or I starve.8. This game is quite teamwork. I couldn't survive winter alone.9. This game is quite fun. I couldn't survive hound attacks with METEOR lands on my head. 10. This game is quite WORTH-TO-BUY. I couldn't help but think that this is one of the best survival game.That's all.			"

												This is truly the best game i've played on steam so far, because of it's massive selection of items to craft, things to do, and tactics to choose from, the fact that you can stray from the meta and still do amazingly well is perfect, as i like doing things my way. The steam workshop is SO easy to use on this game, you literally subscribe to a steam user and you will recieve the mod you desire, unfortunatly, with such an easy-to-use system in place, a lot of people including myself download mods willy-nilly up to a point where the Don't Starve experience fades away overtime, with mods that make it easier to survive the game it's hardly still a challenge, and ironicly i never die of starvation, usually it's the dark, shadow creatures or random bees that start nipping away at my health.Overall this game is amazing and on a scale of 1-10 id give this an 11 if i could, unlike most games; you can play this over and over without getting sick of it, starting out new is always fun, even if you already did it 100 times.

One awesome workshop with tons of mods that will improve your gameplay and make different every time you play the game, if you want it  ofc.The game itself have a great artwork, with a good soundtrack and the devs make constants updates.So, if you are looking for a game to spend a good time, this is the one for you, but be aware, you will starve a lot, but at least you will not starve alone.10/10, buy it :D			"

												Decided I would host a server and play a game with my wife and a way more experienced friend of mine. Friend is helping the wife and I out, we're doing well, day 8-9, winter is coming and my friend has prepared us very well. I decide to show off to the wife and start a forest fire, I die and end up a ghost. I realize I can ""haunt"" people. I decide I'm going to constantly haunt the crap out of my friend. Understand that the forest is still on fire and spreading widely. After excessive haunting my friend dies ""due to Gringo's shenanigans"". I'm laughing so hard I start crying, friend is in shock that you can die because of shenanigans, and wife is left alone in a burning forest, eventually dies.10/10 would Start Forest Fire, Die, Haunt friend to death, and leave with for dead again.

								游戏本体是好游戏，不必多说The game itself has got its reputation如果和同地区基友开开小服玩那是相当欢乐，10/10If you only play with a few local friends it would be very funny. 10/10 in this part然而公共多人服务器蛋疼的很，主要原因：太多必须的资源是不可再生的，早期版本的燧石如果你进的晚了，你走遍卡拉迪亚大陆都找不到。石子？你还想找石子？种地狂魔表示种田种不了不能忍。。However the public servers are muuuuuuuch worse. Main reason : lots of necessary resources are not reproduceable. For instance, flints and stones in early versions. When you get in the serve afterwards, it's almost impossible to play it.很多一次性资源烧了就烧了，一个Griefer进来整个服全废了，杀牛烧基地烧猪人村的啥都见过Once a griefer come in the serve, the serve would face a massive catastrophe. He would burn the big houses, the base, kill the buffalos and dig rabbit holes, burn everyone elses' hard work into ashes easily.新人在冬天或者夏天进服基本必死。然后新手一死，survival服务器马上就炸了，我理解一个人死降所有人san值是为了让大家有羁绊，但是很多新人一进服到处乱转，死了也不说话，所有人都找不到他，大家san值一起疯狂的掉，这使得很多吃san值的角色根本没法用（机器人，图书管理员）If you come in the serve in winter/summer, you are a dead wilson. Once a player dead it would not be a good situation for anyone else in the survival serves. I know the aim of sanity loss for death is to tied up all the members, but there always be someone likes to play alone and once he/she's dead, no one could find him and would suffer a long time.(Usually I quit in this circumstances.) It also cause many characters who have got low sanity rarely seen in the serve, like WX78 and librarian.这造成服务器的新人友好度低，因为新人很大程度上基本上和破坏者Griefer没什么差别.At last most serves are not welcome the new players and give them little help, cuz unexperienced new players have small differences with griefers.我很喜欢这游戏，希望能在多人服务器的可持续性上多一些改进。这样才能“一起繁荣”.I love this game very much and I hope in the near future the game would improve in sustainable issues in order to Thrive Together.

												Don't Starve Together is an artistic, charming, extremely challenging, at times downright brutal multiplayer survival game. Ultimately, it is one that will mostly likely take modifications for many to find playable, or at least enjoyable ~ When they say ""uncompromising"", that is the truth. This game might make you pull your hair out, so be aware.Three of four seasons will kill you without protection.Giant monsters will hunt you down and destroy everything you have.Almost every living thing will also kill you.Food is scarce and will take dedication to maintain.Shelter is temporary and extremely precious.Your food will spoil.Your sanity will disintegrate (literally, you have to keep your Sanity meter up).Your storage is limited.The art style of this game is creepy in a good way, reminiscent of Tim Burton's art style for example, and is very charming. The music, art, and how it is incorporated into the game is rather lovely. Due to the high difficulty of the game, even small achievements like making shelter or cooking food can feel unusually rewarding. I cannot say the game is bad, but I will say that it's possibly the most difficult survival game I've played. Be alert, be vigilant, and bring friends ~ and you just might not starve.			"

												Ok, now for all the people who say ""Oh, it's just a Tim Burton Minecraft"". First off, that's like saying ""Castlevania's just Mario with a whip""; the mechanics and overall feel of the two games are completely different. That aside, I love this game. Be warned though, once you boot up this game, you may never see your family or sunlight ever again. You'll probably want to start off play running this game alone, since it's frustrating to have a noob constantly die in the base, and not even know how to play the game. We're trying to survive too buddy, now go learn the game! :DAll in all, it's a great game, that's more addictive than crack cocaine. Trust me, you'll be saying ""Oh, I'll just continue playing until the full moon, then I'll go feed my kids"", and before you know it, you're on day 1600 and you've been pronounced legally dead. Who even knows where your children are at this point?Buy the game, you'll get your money's worth with it, but be sure to clear your schedule for the next year and a half, 'cuz you ain't goin' nowhere for a while!

												Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason. If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed. Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!

								The gameplay of Don't Starve will be very familiar to a seasoned player of survival games. Your main goal is to establish a base camp, gather items, and find a way to make your required resources (mainly food and heat) sustainable—all while avoiding the monsters that lurk in the dark. The added element of a sanity meter makes for an intriguing twist in gameplay that often requires the player to make less practical equipment (such as flower crowns) as well as the more obvious items (like farms).As someone who's apparently unable to last more than six days without starving (or more likely being eaten by monsters in the dark), I had hoped that being able to play with a buddy might reduce my death count... in truth it's a lot harder to feed two people than it is to feed one! I found myself constantly out in the beefalo fields, gathering fertilizer only to run it back to my partner, eat a few carrots, and then run back out into the fields to gather even more poop while barely surviving.Don't Starve is a fascinatingly challenging game with rich and diverse settings, an intriguingly vague story, spectacularly crafted sound effects, and a bevy of triumphs and heartaches for the casual player and the expert alike. It's made even more engaging (and difficult) with the addition of multiplayer.Don't starve alone—starve together!			"

However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max-This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it? There isnt a reason to own DS if someone buys you DST because you can play offline on DSTThis game is a def buy for your friends or yourself, If you like DS, More than worth the money.			"

Before I could speak, a large, bipedal deer who had a single eye approached our camp. We attempted to flee, but we had no torches. The deer tore through our structures. First went the thermometer, then the farms, then the science station, then the crockpot. My friend and I attempted to fight, but its claws tore through us like paper.

								I'm not a fan of the genre. Those multiplayer craft-based, survival sandbox games just don't appeal to me and neither the notion of playing early access games. But I love me some Don't Starve Together. Klei is slowly becoming my favorite indie studio because they just seem to understand what makes games fun to play, and DST is fun as heck. I liked the earlier game but I always found it too stressful. By playing with friends the tension just seem to evaporate and stumbling upon new and exciting ways to die horribly becomes something we all get a big laugh of.

												This game is extremely fun and revolves around pure teamwork. From slaying the murderous Bearger to fending off the ravenous Gobblers, you're all doing it together and having fun. It's so easy to mod as well, which can lead to some of the better conversations between friends. Mods can also socialize the game too! All in all, the gameplay is very flexible, easily able to meet everyone's standards, even the most cynical person. Definitely one of the better games on Steam.I'd recommend this to any person of any age. You could even play with the whole family if you wanted to!Such a good game, kudos to Klei for this amazing reboot of an already perfect game.			"

								This isn't really a review,,more a ""this is what i think about the game as it is"", and I will update it later on if needed. I mean it IS Don't Starve...with the only difference now when you die, you can take comfort in the fact  that your ""friend"" running the other way probably will survive..*for now* ^.^Only been playing 5h or so but during that time it was like playing DS, we did not run into any bugs at all,,so I must say it's a great work in progress. I know some ppl have a ""issue"" with Dont Starve doing the coop thing. I can't really understand why, since no one is forcing you to play..together. As for me I've been playing and enjoying Don't Starve for quite some time, same with my son, and we always said,,""to bad there's no coop *sad face*""But hey,,now a year or so later there's coop and we love it..yes maybe survival get's a bit easier? *or will I lead my son into a spiders nest..running away laughing?* Time will tell, but no matter what I do,, we love this development and will give our continued support to this great game and developers.Keep up the great work you do. \o/And yes,,buying this is a nobrainer, even if it's beta And no I dont work for Klein ^^ This is just one of those rare gems in development that actually deserve their reviews.*shut up and take my money*			"

								I started off with burning down an entire forest with my lighter to get rid of an annoying Gobbler turkey thingymabob that was hiding in a berry bush. It can go gobble in Hell. Leaving a trail of ashes behind me, I proceeded to murder a sleeping Cat 'cuz it looked like a racoon. Turns out it was a catcoon, so I wasn't totally wrong. Then I was 'cookin some berries on a 'lil fire to pass the night only to have this HUGE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ING CREEPY shadow hand casually crawl out of the edge of the darkness and pinch my lovely campfire into oblivion. I then turned into a ghost after being shanked in pitch-black darkness only to haunt a bunch of trees which then transformed into tree monsters to kill me once I resurrected.I'd say it's pretty guud.

								Don't Starve is a fantastic game and Don't starve together just builds on that. Personally, playing with people I know, I found it no easier than the standard game. It takes a lot of time to get into a rhythmn of surviving together, you need so much more food, supplies, and fires. I can not recommend this enough, especially being that it's still in beta. This game is fantastic and will only get better as they're proving with updates. They're adding quite a few DST exclusive things which makes it exciting and the various game modes are AWESOME! Love wilderness game mode! If you're on the fence, consider getting it, you will most likely sink a lot of time into this cruel, unforgiving, wonderful world.			"

								This game will steal time from you, and you won't even realize it. Played with and without mods. Some tweaking to the gameplay is necessary if you don't want to rebuild your camp every two days, IMO. Beefalo's will chase you while in heat (I'm assuming that's what it means anyway, when their rear ends go red). Frogs will annoy you. Tentacles will slap you silly. Pigs are the happy go lucky ones, for the most part. Turkeys will be jerks and steal your berries. Mosquitos and bees will chase you. Spiders get butt hurt if you even go near their property. Basically, expect the unexpected, and don't expect to live very long at a time.In other words? It's great. Can't wait for the full release, and I'm currently making sure all my friends get it.			"

								Excellent survival game with a unique artstyle and consistenty strange personality. One of the few actually complete survival games, with tons of stuff to discover and run away from! In this online co op version of the original game, not only do you get to play with friends, but you also get the reign of giants dlc for free! I'm a bit perplexed as to why the original game doesn't have this content as well yet though (included).In don't starve you do exactly what the title suggests. find food. Food is essentially the most important thing in the game, being the sole reason to venture out and gather things. If you don't keep finding food, you eventually starve. There are plenty of other dangers of course, but ultimately, it's that constant need for food that really makes it a challenge. Wolves? No problem. Giant dragon flies? Peice of cake. Carrots?♥♥♥♥♥♥WE RAN OUT OF CARROTS. This game is so much more fun with other people. Sure, it was fun alone, but the dynamics of co op really make it extra fun. Your friend might accidentally provoke an army of pigs to murder them, then you have to go rescue them and you then spend 10 days trying to recover the health and sanity you lost, ultimately crippling your preperation for winter. THAT is the sort of wonderful stuff that can enrich your experience. And obviously, friends aren't always a burden. YOU might be the burden at some point and they get to rescue you. Or you can all share food with eachother. It's just really really fun. Definitely recommend this game. I would also recommend getting some mods for the game as the mods deal with some issues I found with this version of the game. Like not beign able to see your friend's icons on the map.			"

												This is one of those games where you will die over and over again. But that's okay, because that's how you learn to play. It's difficult learning the ropes, but it is rewarding. I've made so many friends through this game and I enjoy how Klei updates their game on a regular basis. Not everyone on here is nice, in fact you will meet many greifers which is probably the hardest challenge. I recommend you play this game if you like a simple (or complex)survival challenge, but DO NOT buy or play this until you have played Don't Starve(single player) or at least on a world by yourself so you get the hang of things.

A great game to play with friends; a not-so-great game on public servers.Don't Starve Together, or DST, is a multiplayer game based on the popular singleplayer game, Don't Starve. DST is an incredibly fun game to play, with many elements from Don't Starve incoporated into it. It does not have a relatively high learning curve, and the HUD is easy to learn and familiarize oneself with. The crafting system is simple and neat and only the bare minimum detail is used, albeit cleverly. This game is not forgiving however, do not expect an easy game. Every second must be spent doing something, be it gathering basic resources, or out exploring new sections of the world, scoping out potential allies to befriend or enemies to behead. You may be frustrated at the lack of many ""OP"" items in the game, or their cost; however, remember this: This is Don't Starve Together, a game that does not want to help you, that will send misfortune upon you, that wants to kill you. The Bees, the Dogs, even the Birds don't like you very much. It's up to you (and friends) to brave the bads and get the goods. So saddle up and invite some friends to play Don't Starve Together. P.S. I also highly recommend the usage of mods to enhance gameplay once vanilla gets bland. Mods introduce new characters, new buildables, and other fantastic fun actions that you and your team can do.

								Alrigth so Dont Starve together, Whats the difference between dont starve.. 1. Multiplayer experience though that should be something you pick up from the title2. There are some tweeks,bug fixes and its overall a better experience in my opinion as long as you are with friends3. Its highly addictive and can be quite fun to play if you have the time for it as there is no pauseSo why whould you pay money for this game if you already have it ( single player ) Well if you already have Dont Starve singleplayer then you will recive a free copy of Dont starve together when its releaced and out of beta.Should you buy this game before its releaced from beta?I recomend doing it as you get 2 copies of the game in your steam, 1 for you and another to give away which can be perfect for a birthday gift or any ocasion of that sort.there is 1 major problem for long time players of the dont starve game.. Mods.. Yes this game has mod support and yes you can play these mods with your friends but the more mods you have and how drastic the mod changes the game will lag you to the point where its unplayable. I would love to see this problem fixed if possible.Over all I give the game a 7.43 out of 10, I enjoyed this a lot more then single player and I highly recomend picking it up on sale!~JessicaJSK			"

												Don't Starve Together is a top-down survival game of the original Don't Starve, now with multiple mouths to feed with. You start off by selecting one of the diverse characters from the Wilson Family and are thrown right into the world. Your job is, as the title suggests, to don't starve and survive the upcoming 4 seasonal periods. As from there it goes on, you craft science machines to invent new things, get clothing to fit into the current circumstances and fight off hundreds of hounds, spiders and giants along your way. If you die, there's no other way to be resurrected except a few rare items or the all-famous Telltale Heart, crafted with the blood of other players (literally).Pros:This game is harsh. It is full of little things that try to kill you or the other way around, limited resources are almost guaranteed, and let's not forget the seasons. You have to prepare for the upcoming season you are about in to enter, which can be a bit tricky sometimes to get used to. Clothing, Hats or items that help you stay cool, warm and dry are crucial. The gathering of resources and understanding the core on what to do to survive is satisfying to watch. Having your own base set up with all required farms, chests and structures gives a successful feeling to the player and encourages them to repeat said process, to see if they really got the hangout. Speaking of base building, this is a good game to play with a friend to that has a basic knowledge. A newcomer can learn fairly easily where the rabbit is going and should get the hang of the survival techniques quickly. It may be confusing on what to do first, so it is always recommended to watch what others do, hence said before that it is good to play it with another friend with basic information. Immense workshop support. This is a big plus for all the mods out there. They can make your life easier, harder or just add some neat little things that really don't change the core too much but help out a ton. Cons:The lore of this world you are in is briefly explained as ""statues that stand around"". There is no real way to tell how much the game developed in the story without looking it up online. I wished the lore would be given to you at least a bit while playing. While the world is easy to jump into, the resource placement can be pretty shady at certain parts. I once had one world where thousands of lizards spawned in the middle of the desert, or one biome wasn't generated at all, even after exploring the entire map for a good solid 10 days. Seasonal periods last for a long time and aren't something you would play quickly for an hr and then go shut the game off. To get into winter, at least 20 days are set, which are about 2 hours in. It doesn't seem that much but the time can feel stretched out at this point. Conclusion: A very good survival system with lots of food and magic (as Klei likes to pronounce it anyway)			"

								So for people that want seriousness. Long story short, this game is great, I played it for 8 hours yesterday alone and I went through effort of trading yesterday just for a day early access to this game. It is amazing what you can do, and the possibilities with mods, the gameplay is solid and will only improve as Klei are some of the best devs out there. You will enjoy this game so much. One moment you'll be on day 35 and think ""Yeah, me and my friends are invincible!!!"" after taking down countless hounds and a treeguard or two. And then, you'll run into some killer bees and game over. 10/10 Would never starve alone again.			"

								For an early access game this game is amazing. For those who say ""Oh it's not as hard to die if you have another person"" think again. You and your friend/friends have to split resources like food or tools in order to survive together and not just die poorly. This game is so far vanilla Don't Starve but with more people, you can still use mods and the controls and lands are the same so far, but that's the way I like it. They did however add a new item called the ""Tell-Tale Heart"" which takes off 40 health (unless you have armor) and some hunger, but acts as a revive to your friends. Speaking of reviving that also works diffrently, the touchstones now can only be activated if you're a ghost (AKA dead) and while you're a ghost anyone around you will slowly go insane. Overall this game is great for early access and I hope that Reign of Giants soon comes to this for a free addon.			"

								As I reviewed the single-player version of ""Don't Starve"" I think this one should have a reivew of it's own because it's VERY different and yet similiar.So, let's begin with the core of the game, the gameplay.Whilst most of the stuff remains unchanged or majorly unchanged the DST version feels a bit laggier than the SP (single-player) version, even when hosting your own dedicated server using the built in server hoster and not the external one.It takes about 0.3 seconds for the server to get the command to harvest resources and after these 0.3 seconds it will initiate the picking up sequence. The time used to be smaller but since they introduced the caves to the built-in server hoster the servers have started to lag compared to the older version.Enough with that, let's skip to the combat:As with the core gameplay of looting, the combat still remained unchanged though the feel of it is worse.Remember what I said about the delay when picking stuff up? It probably won't affect you that much when you ONLY do that, but in combat you will feel it MUCH more. Kiting is 200% harder in DST which I assume is because of the server lag, also the feel of the combat is very different compared to the normal game.*I should also point out that if you haven't played the SP version of the game you won't feel like anything is wrong until you do try it, as its the superior version of the game.The game is also MUCH harder, the mobs can absorb much more damage and they inflict more damage aswell, making this game built for a team of players (I'd recommend for people with a group of 3 people and above to play it), the giants got their health doubled and damage aswell, making this game impossible without a group.This version of the game has stuff which the base game doesn't have, for example, Beefalo riding.The feature was added in order to add more fun to the DST version I suppose as it might be fun to ride them with friends, but while I have about 30 hours as of now I have yet to even use this feature.The built in server hoster is excellent, it actually allows you have mods in your server without the hassle of extracting them to a folder, installing them using a mod loader and such, all you have to do is download them from the workshop and enable them in the ""Mods"" tab and you're good to go.The built-in server hoster also allows you to customize your world like the SP version which is great because you can choose how much of what will appear in the world and also allows you to make the game work as you wish.Also, this version has skins, which, as well as all the other games with skins, are only cosmetic. (I must admit I even bought some).DST also comes with the RoG (Reign of Giants) DLC which adds a LOT of features to the game (I can't even think about the game without it), and by purchasing DST you get a free copy, so that's great.All in all, this version is good for a group of people to play (as I said, 3+ should do the trick) while playing it alone is impposible (hence the name together).This game is good if you're already familiar with the game, although I recommend buying the SP version of it as its much better for learning the game if you've never touched it, it offers a smoother experience and it also has the SW (Shipwrecked) DLC which is fun but its still in early access so many features are still being added.This game is great nonetheless, it is by far one of my most favourite games of all time, I recommend you to get the mega-pack as Its worth every dollar you spend on it.

												Don't starve together Review.Intro Don't starve together is a online game of don't starve written in LUA code developed by klei entertainment. As I have spent well over 580 hours playing the game, hosting dedicated servers, making mods, playing though-out early access and after release I will tell you what I think of the game that ate up most of my free time. Pros1 The game is stable, functional and works well just like don't starve does but only online. The game has a massively active fanbase and after I wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages I have been sent to help people on their server, to help get mods working and to join people in there server. The game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag, but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well. I have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me, running 20-40 mods with many people on a server.  2 The game is modable it runs on  the same code as don't starve on LUA code so if you know how to read basic code, and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game. I have been able to make mods for don't starve and don't starve together although I only published them privately. The game is very easy to mod, hell even someone as♥♥♥♥♥♥at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made, crappy, interesting, fun and awful mods you can enjoy. You could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore, or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don't starve together workshop has.  3 The game is really fun I don't need to say that when I spent over 580 hours in the game do I? Well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content. The combat in the game I would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright.Cons 1  The game made me read and write code. I didn't need to and I didn't want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so I could log out of my own game then rejoin it when I came back. Then I learned stuff like how to write ini files, LUA, batch files, and other codey words I can't remember. That stuff isn't fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game. If you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff.   2 The game doesn't have local multiplayer its possible I even say a don't starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn't they add that into DST? Well I can think of why they didn't they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that's fine. It still sucks that I can't play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever. WARNING this game is going to mess with you, first you join a few games then your like ""oh I liked this in this game but I didn't like this in, this game"" then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse. Second, You will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30-80 mods you can enable or disable in your game. then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods, then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer, then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast, well and you will build a awesome base with other players, have lots of fun but then because PVP is off and the game is public, the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made. You can't kick the scum fast enough and you don't just want to kick them... No you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it. So then you turn PVP on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you. Then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies. Warning this game will change you.  Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, yeah its alright. "

												I really freaking love this game! A friend gave it to me a while ago as present and I never played it 'cause I had no idea, what it was about (I don't like playing games if I don't even know a little bit about it) one night we played it together and I freaking love it! I'm so obsessed with it.I like that you don't actually need the Single Player Game ""Don't starve"", you can also play all alone on your own server and even offline. It's quite challenging, it's pretty hard to keep health, hunger and sanity up and avoiding/fighting weird creatures, but it's so much fun though! And even more fun with friends. A must buy for people who like strange things and challenging survival games. I really like the style of it, the sketchy grafics, the cute characters, the music and sound effects, this game is a masterpiece and worth every cent. You can do so much in this game, it never gets boring.			"

												When I first played Don't Starve, one thing that I kept thinking was - I wish I could share this with my friends... and finally, I can. The multiplayer experience is amazing - especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat. The Don't Starve world translates very nicely to co-operative play, but since I haven't tried PvP I can't comment on what that's like at all.  Out of the three friends I've played with, two ended up finding Don't Starve too stressful. Something about how there's too much to keep track on at once, and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work. In the game's defence, this was during early beta, and they weren't Don't Starve players to begin with, but I think there's something to it. Don't Starve demands that you're quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree. It can get pretty hectic and there's not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts. It's something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options.Me, I feel like I've found the game for the very first time, all over again. The stuff I loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side. There's a bit lost in atmosphere because you're no longer so devastatingly ALONE, and things are less creepy... but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability. Today, for instance, I was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees. A well-planned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival.			"

								Don't Starve Together is a great idea, though I'm not sure why it wasn't part of Don't Starve from the beginning.  The whole concept fits so well with the game.  It takes Don't Starve, and makes it so you can play with up to 6 people (I'm told servers can be modded to have even more, and that dedicated servers can have 20, will edit this if/when I find out more).  There are a few differences from Don't Starve however.In survival mode, when a player dies they turn into a ghost.  Beyond interacting with the environment in odd ways, there's not a whole lot you can do as a ghost.  However, if a living player can make a Telltale Heart using 1 spider gland and 3 cut grass, once given to the ghost they will be revived.  Be warned that crafting a Telltale Heart damages you and if on low health that could mean your death as well.  In endless mode, when a player dies they simply respawn from the Jury-Rigged portal where you initially spawn into the game.  You spawn with a decreased amount of health, but hey you're alive at least.  Also just in general having extra players changes the game entirely.  You now have to cooperate with others (or I suppose you could kind of compete against them or go your own ways as well) to stay alive.  In my personal opinion having other players really makes the game a lot more fun.  Definitely worth playing.			"

								I love Dont starve, is that kind of ""non goal oriented"" games that can dristract you for hours. Always wanted to play it with friends, but as now still not the good experiencei i was hoping for.Unless you run a private server, there is the things that turn out to be annoying:1) scarse resources: unless youre one of the first players on a given world, is really hard to find even a piece of flint. 2) Harsh start without warning: add this to the mix, you can start in the middle of the winter! lol.3) Bully heaven: as now, nothing stops you for being an A** and burn all the flamable resourses. Almost 99% of the time i join to a new server, more than half the world is already burnt.in general, a little status about the world before joining in would be nice... as for the pyromaniacs, not sure what can be done, but sure are annoying.About the game in general:4) No voice chat: is a minor issue, but i would love to scream ""HELP! INCOMING DOGS"" to everyone instead of typing it :p5) perhaps some kind of ""finite resourses"" check/respawn would be nice, not to dumb the game, just for giving a small chance to those who join late.anyway this game still looks promising, but needs tweaking with multiplayer in mind...Soo... stop BURNING THINGS!

												Don't Starve Together is simply one of the best sandbox survival game I have ever played.The art is very unique... let's say it is creepy yet cute!The survival system is incredible addicting since you need to plan ahead what to do to survive in the next season. There are a lot of stuff to learn and you will die a lot at the beginning but fear not! Learn from your failure and do it better next time :) Imo this game is incredible fun if you play it with friends or alone. Joining random servers is fun too but don't get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies. (Doesn't matter if you are online or not)The developers are very passionate, shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you won't get bored easily :PI highly recommend this game, even without sales it's worth the money!

												Survival, crafting, dark scary nights and a social aspect of bringing your friends along for an adventure.You simply can't go wrong with a game like this. The artstyle is of incredible beauty and highly stylized, the soundtrack is very suitable for the game's setting and the effects round everything up.As for the gameplay, it is not for a second shallow. When you start of you are in this intense rush to get enough materials and food to survive your first night. Klei brought this idea of dark and fearful nights back and really did a great job at delivering this frightening experience to the survivors. Especially when you're only just starting, the lack of knowledge and your cluelessness about what to do add a thrilling factor to the world of Don't Starve. Seasons, your sanity, the need for food and the want to build a home make for a very packed list of things to do in only ever so much time, as the days are flying past one after another.The base game is already a lot of fun, but with the twist of playing with friends it is even more. The reviews speak for themselves and for the price, this is an incredible deal that you probably don't want to miss out on.			"

												Very fun and addictive survival game where you can team up with your friends and try to survive in the wilderness against monsters, hunger, darkness and cold and keep yourself from losing your mind in the process.Pros:+ There is no perfect class. All classes have one or more weakspot aswell as one or more strength that counters another. All depends on your play-style what you want to go with.+ I tend to have trouble creating servers and having my friends connect to those but on this game I have seen none of those problems.+ Plenty of different game modes to fit to your preferred play-style.+ The game rewards you with cosmetic items every once in a while to customise your character.+ Countless hours of fun with your friendsCons:- There seems to be no way of tracking your friends. When you reach a certain distance you lose track of their location. I ran around for ages joining my friend's server trying to find him and his camp until I eventually died in the dark. Add some way of partying up and maybe something that shows in which direction and how far away from you they are.- The game could use a tutorial. If you only just started playing your only help is checking the key-bindings.- Public servers are full of territorial hermits that will guard their camp at every cost and will not take friendly to intruders. (Even when the server clearly states it's Co-op).			"

												Day 14:Myself and a few friends venture north to gather some much needed gears to grow our base. With my friend playing Wickerbottom recipes are a breeze and we establish a small dwelling of berry bushes, crockpots and a small birdcage. Things seem to be going well and we spend the rest of the day gathering food. One of my friends had died to an elephant so to stop his eccentric hauntings my other friend went about gathering the necessary tools to revive our fallen friend. I however remain around camp tinkering with recipes and trying to raise my sanity to stable levels when i am attacked by shadows. Night immediately falls, with my only source of light being my trusty torch. I run around the wilderness trying to escape the shadows but it was for nought. With my torch dwindling i do the only thing i can, i set fire to a far off tree... how i would soon regret that decision.The fire soon spread, hopping from tree to the next until finally it roasted the berry bushes, melted the crockpots and turned the birdcage to ashes. My friends arrive back at base to see everything is left in a smoldering pile of cinders with a lone ghost floating in shame.10/10 would play again. Also has hats!			"

								You kick your feet up peacefully. The roaring fire glistens in your eyeballs, and a warmth encompasses you. Not only physically, but mentally. You've made it through the hard part, after all- right? Those silly spiders and frogs couldn't keep you down! Then you hear it, feintly echoing over the empty plains: barking. ""What's that?"" you think, worrying. You've faced wolves before, killed them even. But these seem...different. As you reach for the spear to your side, you hear the beating footsteps of the pack, drumming their way up towards the light. You tighten your grip around the spear- you are prepared.Except you really weren't! Dogs jump from all angles towards you, salivating, hungering, desperate for a bite. You slash and spin, killing a few as you go. But...there's a different one. A red one! It runs over, and in a second, one single moment, everything is set ablaze. You watch as your chests, farms, machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time. In your shock and awe, the red dog takes you in his jaws, ferrying you into the darkness. Your body, being devoured, simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash.==================A new day... a new chance?You push through the first 29 days in this hell. You've made quite the home for yourself! And look at that! Not even the fire-dogs could stop you now! ""Another victory!"" you yell, as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all. You revel in the moonlight, basking in the greatness that you're all responsible for. A bird cage? Farms? Bushes? Fridges?? You're advanced now! You're self-sufficient! Proud survivors! Everything is brilliant! Not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you're all feeling.But then, as you sit to enjoy a moments peace, the serenity is disturbed. A tremor. A single shake in the ground, followed by a monstrous roar. The team pause, confused. Suddenly, before you know it, another is unleashed. You all look to eachother for answers, but no answers can help now. In the corner of your eye, you see it. Reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire, there is an iris, floating high above the ground. Another tremor rattles the team, and the body of the creature is exposed. A single eye, antlers, a fur coat, and the will to destroy. Time slows down.You observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature, as it swipes the ground, eviscerating them. Your friends fall to the floor, lascerated with gaping wounds. Blood shoots from their oozing injuries, and the creature laughs, turning its attention to your happiness, your creation. It stomps on the bird cages, uproots the farms, and defecates on your berry bushes, before crushing them inbetween its hand. As the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers, it's eyeball finds its way to you. It stares at you, dropping the pooey bushes. You close your eyes, drop your clothing, and assume the necessary position for what is to follow.You don't quite survive that winter. "

Early Access Review
								I personally love the original Don't Starve, and when this came out, my friends and I knew that we had to play it immediately.This game is more similar to roguelike than sandbox survival as the constant threats of hunger and other necessities to survive through the game are always pinning you down. Coupled that with various necessities that you have to make and prepare for the upcoming dangers, the multiplayer version of this game starts to make us feels like a chore. There is simply no time to rest, you are either gathering food, or gathering things, which is what this game is supposed to be, in its earnest imo, and may appeal to the more hardcore fans. However, for those who would prefer a more relaxed game, I will suggest getting a mod instead, which is what my friends and I are currently running. With some of the mods available here, you are able to sort-of tweak the game at your own volition (we personally opted for the 50% hunger rate) or whatever you deem fit to be fun and not game-breaking.Playing through the game with 3 real life friends, we realized that the most optimal way to survive is to split up and gather things on our own, which is rather ironic considering the title ""Don't Starve together"". Take it with a grain of salt though as the core components of the game are taken from a single-player game, therefore, the idea of setting up a base together (for many benefits of being together, which there are, in many survival games), does not really fit in this game where you can literally do things alone. Many things are tweaked to enhance multiplayers though (increased boss health and sleeping), which shows consideration being put in place just to make Don't Starve Together work. The game might not be the finest survival game for co-op, however, it certainly was made from one of the best single player survival games out there. 'Klei' however, proves to be providing us with ample updates and the fact that they have an open policy with modding only means that this game will not die just yet, if anything, it will get better.My friends and I are currently in our 5th playthrough and just got over 50+ days, I must say that there was never a day that it was boring, so far.

												Don’t Starve Together is one of my favorite games on steam. However, the game isn’t without a multitude of flaws, which becomes blatantly obvious the more you play. Most of this stems from the transition from single to multiplayer and the different player base that comes with it. Since a large amount of the steam reviews already cover the positive aspects of this game, in this review I will be highlighting what I consider to be its longstanding problems.The context of this review will be of having played on vanilla servers with strangers and sometimes friends. Some might say playing on random servers with strangers was not what Klei (the game makers) had intended for their audience. Despite this, I feel as though it is the environment that the majority of the players (or at least a significant portion of the player base) who buy this game will be playing in. Also Klei does provide servers that hosts this type of setting, so I do not think it is unfair to say that Klei has intended this type of gameplay.Problem 1: Time Requirement and Server ResetsWhen players first join a server, ideally they start at day 1 to gather resources to prepare for winter, but how much time does it take in real life to reach winter?Let’s calculate:Full day = 8 min Winter = day 20 8 * 20 = 160 minutes or  2 hours and 40 minutes!Most people I’ve played with barely have the time to spend 2 hours and 40 minutes preparing for day 20 and start leaving afterwards. In single player, time wasn’t an issue because you can pause the game and resume playing later. But in multiplayer, unless you are hosting your own server, if you leave for a couple hours to take a break, the server will have reset by then. This is due to the fact that most players don’t join during winter and after, because of resource constraints and seasonal difficulties. My experience has been that 95% of the players who join a server will leave by day 30, usually making the server reset. This means all your hard work which you labored for hours will be gone. It’s unrealistic to expect players to be able to play for many consecutive hours straight, especially in a game where looking away for a couple minutes could mean your complete demise. If players become tired after reaching day 30, how will they ever make it through the full year to experience most of the game’s contents? After a while, it can feel like a Sisyphus experience where you put great effort in setting up a base only to have it destroyed. Rinse, Repeat, Ad Nauseum.Problem 2: Resource ConstraintAgain, it becomes more evident that the game wasn’t designed for public multiplayer. You could join a day 5 autumn server and all the flint, grass, twigs could be picked, all the berries bushes dug up, and all the pig houses destroyed, leaving you with not much to do but suffer a huge set back on preparing for winter. After all, what’s the incentive in stopping players doing all this, especially with the fatalistic fact that a world rarely lasts til day 50?  The world regen doesn’t really take into account the number of players there are, so joining a server late can be costly. Flint and gears in my opinion are the biggest offenders. Spending 20 minutes to find two pieces of flint is just aggravating even with the addition of birds dropping flint. Gears are also problematic because if somebody else reaches the clockworks before you do, goodluck getting gears for your fridge or ice-flings,assuming that you even make it to summer. Yes, I am aware that gears can be found in the ruins, but most players are casuals that just want to chill on the surface with friends and not hardcore ruins rushers. Tumbleweeds aren’t a reliable source either.This issue is worse in endless and wilderness modes since the server never resets, leaving a sad barren world devoid of even the most basic resources.Problem 3: SeasonsThe whole concept of the seasons is to give players a challenge and something to work on. However, they are NOT FUN challenges, but rather terrible game designs. Because when you get there, there’s really nothing. You’re either ready for it or you’re not, as in you either die or wait for it to end. Sure, in winter you can hunt a mactusk or two, but there’s not much to it than that. In fact to make things worse, summer literally has nothing special other than cactus flowers and fire hounds. The freezing and overheating debuffs in these season encourage players to sit around near base. So the whole game devolves into a wait-fest, where you might as well alt-tab out until the boss comes. In single player, you could at least pass the time quickly with tents, but you can’t do that in DST.Furthermore, most players who reach winter and further are tired and need a break. It’s not fair or practical to expect players to play for a marathon of hours or face the risk of losing everything. New players joining can help extend a server’s lifetime, but because of seasons, you’re at the mercy of other players to help you, which isn’t always possible. Compounded by factors of resource constraint that I mentioned earlier, it’s no wonder players, other than unaware beginners, stop joining. The result is a very tiresome, boring, and lonely experience for players who just want to stay and keep the base going. The challenge of the game turns into stay awake rather than surviving, leading to a feeling where it’s a complete chore to continue forward. Eventually players get sick of this and leave, meaning the server will once again reset with their base completely destroyed.Problem 4: Reward for Time InvestmentOk, let’s say that you actually do make it through the year. Your base is looking nice, plenty of food and you’re well supplied in materials. Then comes the question of what now? Because by this point, starving isn’t really a problem and the monsters(hounds, seasonal bosses) that the game does throw at you to make things interesting are fairly easy to kill (with proper kiting) or ditch. You’ve now reached the mid to late game and the most challenging part of this game is over. By this point, after having painstakingly set up a sustainable base, you would expect to able explore more of the game to find fun and interesting challenges. Yet to me, that’s not the case. Let’s look at a couple options you have.Option A: Going BossingBosses considered to be the late game content of the DST. After all, to fight them, you need to be stocked up on resources. However, the bosses themselves are mostly just giant blobs of health where fights are mostly just kiting and tanking (Treeguard, Deerclops, Bearger, Moose) and the ones that are actually interesting to fight (Toadstool) are almost impossible to kill in most servers, due to the time it takes to get to the content. DST bosses are balanced assuming you’d have help from other players and the time requirement means less players will be there to fight.On top of that, the rewards themselves are discouraging for servers that don’t last over 100 days. Bee queen’s reward is just some combination of a Battle Helm and tam, toadstool’s is just a lantern building, and deerclops’ is essentially a glorified rain hat. None of these actually entice players to stay on a server.[ Continued in Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/R7pZ9wx1 ]			"

												Starting with collecting sticks and grass and then moving on to build your base, you can pretty much find anything you would expect to see in a survival game in Don't Starve. As it's very clear, the main objective is not to starve. You not only choose to cook what you want from the endless list of recipes, but also try to survive from bunch of evil creatures. Make your own farm and collect your vegetables, hunt down some animals and gather your meat and also create your own bee hives to gather some honey. Mix them all in a crock pot and Voila! You got yourself a delicious meal for dinner.Even if the graphics don't look like so, the realistic ambient of the game is awesome. If you get closer to the fire pit, you will burn, you can build a fire going through all the forest and they turn into ashes and coal. If you get closer too much to the sea, the items you drop will fall and disappear. Standing right next to a tree will cover you a little bit from the rain. You know what? That's not all I can tell, you need to get the game and discover more.Actually, survival in this realistic and somehow not realistic atmosphere is a lot fun, surviving together with your friends is even more fun. Everyone takes their roles and you can build your base faster than ever. If you die in this world, it's not the end of the world as long as anyone of your friends could stay alive, but you need to pay the price for it. It is harder to stay alive in this game if you have more friends. A dead body in the map cause all the remaining players to lose their minds. So, it's a lot more fun and also a lot more challenge. Don't just sit and play some boring games in your beautiful chair, try to don't starve!			"

								8/10, great multiplayer experience Pros:1. The multiplayer aspect changes the game from the previous one. Adding alot more fun and organization to your days surviving.2. The Online modding community is great! its got great modders who keep on adding mods to keep you hooked onto this game, much like minecraft.3. the challenge in this game is rewarding and not afraid to be hard. you can still adjust the game to fit your style of gameplay but the default is much reccomended.Cons:1. The Game is intensly boring if you want to do a singleplayer game. it dosent offer as much variety as Dont starve rein of giants. However is made up for the mods that can be added.Overall:buy this game on a sale or if you really want to buy it now. its a great example of how a survival game should be and unlike other survival games ( eg: minecraft, 7 days to die, etc ) this actually requires alot of effort to survive.

								Take Don't Starve, now add in pillaging with friends, braving the harsh winters together, fending off hostile wolves and other limitless fun. Honestly I wasn't that into the original Don't Starve; I found it fun but didn't really have the drive to survive as long as I could (which is the point of the game). With Don't Starve Together, having a friend or two join you makes it not only thrilling but gives the boost I needed into making this my favorite co-op game of all time. Deciding on day to day duties, collaborating on making items that are pertinent to survival, adapting to different climates, and just messing around when the struggles of staying alive becomes too harsh (seriously, causing chaos as a ghost is really fun). I highly recommend this game and my only advice to you is Don't Starve! (or freeze to death, get killed by shadowy figments of your imagination, blow up from a trap, mauled by walking trees, anger mother animals, and anything else Don't Starve Together decides to throw your way)			"

												So my former best friend gifted me this game out of the kindness of her heart, and boy was i excited to get to play this game~~! After being nearly 100 hours in this game i thought its best that i give it a review, so here it is! This is what a true survival game is all about - this is THE game that got me into this genre in the first place. I will say the game had a few minior annoying problems in the vanilla version; no way to find your team mates on the map if you go your own way finding resources(This has now been corrected as you can find your team mates if you both have a compass), and a little hard to find food or other stuff you may need in default settings of the map sometimes(you can tweak the world gen settings to add lots of foodz but you'll make your game very laggy). But these can be easily fixed with workshop mods so theres really nothing bad to say about this game. To me this was a very refreshing and new game from the useal BOOM BOOM KILL EM' ALL types of games that i useally play. No zombies, gore, medieval stuff, dragons, nudity, or guns - just pure adventure fighting to stay alive. in real life i wouldnt last 1 day in the world of Dont starve togther...id miss my internet and stuffed crust pizza too much :3			"

								So about DST.You are playing with friends so its a big plus.If server is publick you do get grieffers and trollers. This is hard to handle. If you ban them with full inventory of stuff the grieffed you lose so much time. There should be an option to enable ""drop if banned"". Hopefully they add RoG but i know that it will be hard because caves take loading screen and people can't join while world is generation so it would be cool if they would generate with the world and when you go in cave it would have same effect as you go in wormhole. It would teleport you to a location which would be isolated from anything elese and would look like cave. But I went off topic now.I like mod support. Hopefully you could be able to add biomes and new trees, giants, stone guardians and so on.Thats it.I would give score 8/10 because of the stuff i said above			"

												First off, buy the game! Its $13 for 2 copies (at the moment)Im 7 hours in (2 days in real life) and its been a blast. Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge! Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.Recap:Buy it!10/10 would recommend to all my friends again.

								This game is an absolute pleasure to play, especially with a large number of friends. The plethora of random events allow for more than just a few treasured memories and this is one of those games can make or break friendships. Definately not for the faint of heart, but if you are looking for hilarity, hysteria, and whole lot of insanity, I would highly recommend this game. Just don't be upset when all your hardwork and effort gets ruined by one bloody lightening bolt that hits one bloody berry bush that ignites all your other bloody berry bushes and trees leaving you starving and wondering whether you should laugh or cry as the hounds tear your campsite and your friends to pieces. 10/10.

								Don't Starve is a fun survival sim thing. Is it even I sim, maybe not... Anyways the single-player game got so much hype for multi-player. BOOM! Here it is! Crazy crap can go on at the same time but you can get trolled if you don't have the server on friends only. Adding a person makes the game 10x better! The downside is that you need to worry about another person. Food can run out quickly. Unlike the single-player, food is everywhere! On multi-player, food is no where near you. Heck it can be all gone! Some tips: Find beffolos, grab poop, farm, traps every hole, FOOD! Traps are hard to make too, everyone will take anything. My friend and I cut down a whole green area in 10 mintues. While in single-player it will take some hours or DAYS to do that. I'm not saying that low food and low materials makes this game bad, it makes this game harder! The sudden spike of difficulty makes the game better or worst. Depending if you like hard games.You can survive together or die together but you will screw up somewhere in this game.Soory for the misspells I don't have time to fix ~ JelloApocalypse and BlueberryMuffin			"

												Review ENG/ITAA supplement that extends the life of game. Multiplayer until 4 players and custom worlds, which can make your survival game more easy or hard. With default settings, mobs will inflict much more damage and they'll have much more health, in relation at the number of players in game. Futhermore the food consumption is directly proportional to the mouths to feed, micidial element at start game when you haven't an advanced base camp. Even if you're veteran this mode will test you. Therefore, you don't let your guard down.....Supplemento al gioco principale che ne allunga, sicuramente, la giocabilità. Multiplayer fino a 4 giocatori e mondi personalizzabili possono rendere più facile o più difficile la sopravvivenza. Con le impostazioni di default i mob faranno più danno e avranno più vita, in relazione al numero di giocatori. Inoltre il consumo di cibo è direttamente proporzionale alle bocche da sfamare, elemento micidiale a inizio gioco quando manca un campo base sviluppato. Anche se siete veterani, questa modalità vi metterà a dura prova. Quindi non abbassate mai la guardia....Vote/Voto : 8,5/10			"

								There were once two brothers who set out to live off the land. One was named Mike, and the other was named Jim. One day Mike decided he would ask the all mighty Console for somthing fun. The Console listened to Mike and bestowed upon him hundreds of jerky and teleportation staffs. Jim saw that the Console had done such a thing and was jelous. So he asked the all mighty Console to spawn twenty Krumpuses, and the Console did. Mike soon found himself being robbed of all his jerky and staffs. Mike seeked revenge on Jim and teleported him to an unknown land. Jim soon found his way back and did the same back to Mike. The brothers did this for days until one decided to ask the Console to spawn one hundred Deerclops, and the Console did so. After hours of deerclops fighting the brothers found themselves laughing over carpets of meat and eyeballs. The end. Story based on true events.			"

Although im complete and utter crap at this game, it is extremely fun with friends. This game was gifted to me by a friend who got the Don't Starve bundle and we both have been getting a kick out of it. Our favorite thing to do so far is feed the Oinkers and collect their poop and collect poop in general. We have yet to figure out how to kill the Gobbler, but when we do...oh boy.			"

I kneel in my camp as I slowly begin to fade. My body withers. I look to the heavens and ask ""Why are turkeys so fast? Why was I born in the middle of the woods to no mother?

								The base game is solid, no bugs or problems when me and my boyfriend played, however so far the game is simply different versions of survival mode. Adventure mode doesn't exist in the game and thus there is no challenge other than surviving as long as you can which, while fun for a few runs, is entirely boring once you hit the plateau of having everything and surviving is no longer a challenge. This is a game with no real end goal or reward, currently.  Original Don't Starve along with the expansions is worth your money more (at this point) if you want a truly fun Don't Starve experience reason to move forward and greater challenges.  You may be able to play with a friend, (which is excellently done I can't stress enough) but with nothing to do but live on forever what's the point in continuous play? However, this is still early access, and hopefully their expansion (to come Spring 2015) will give more reason to play together, as well as encompassing all their other expansions into it as well. Other than that, hosting and joining servers is flawless. The worlds are exactly the same as Original Don't Starve, with some things from other expansions and new never before seen events and creatures too. It's solid as a whole, but if you're looking for something to play more than once, wait a little longer until they add more to it. Klei delivers, and I personally can't wait until this game has Adventure mode me and my friends can play, as well as ALL the characters from Reign of Giants.  My boyfriend and I greatly miss our main characters of Webber and Wigfrid. <3Spiderbro for life. Webber forebber.			"

												After playing for over 500Hrs, I gotta say, I really enjoy this game.With all the content that's been put on this and more coming along with updates keeps this game experience fun, but at the same time, their's plenty of cons about this game for new players joining the Don't Starve Together Community.BEFORE YOU CONTINUE-------------------------- I highly Suggest you play solo mode by making a new server and setting it to solo before playing online to understand some simple mechanics and getting the basics on what to do in-game OR buy the originial Don't Starve and play that before playing Don't Starve TogetherCons-------*Don't always expect a helpful hand with other players (Sometimes), people like me or any other long time player can't babysit and take care of you and teach you the ropes of every little thing, your first time or how many times you play this should be you trying new things and learning technquies yourself.(or use google for resource)* Play with friends, it's always fun to play with randoms, but we all know that its more interesting playing with your buds while trying to fight off creatures and survive.* Trolls are everywhere, you don't think it'll happen, but it will, it happens alot in this game so be mindful on who you trust and want to stay at your base.Pros-------* Fun game, the replay value is so good, with different ways to start up and lots of areas to explore.* Your not alone now, you can work together with your friends and experience everything that the original don't starve  game had to offer, with more content being added on to it.* It's a Indie game with a community thats been thriving for so long, keeping this game alive and active either on the forums or in-game, developers actually listen to the players in the forums.* You get to unlock Gifts that lets you get various custom skins for some of the objects in-game, which isn't in the original Don't Starve.So yeah, this game is fun and if your into survival games i reccomend buying this, either on a sale or whenever, don't miss out, its worth at least giving it a shot, if you don't enjoy it then refund and get your money back, simple.Thanks for reading if you did & I'll see you online ^)			"

												Very enjoyable experience overall, one of the few games that I would show to people and not feel bad for doing so.Art style heavily influenced from Burtonland.Developers actually care about their community and talk with them as well as actively fix bugs from their bug reporter.Monster AI is predictable and combat is pretty one dimensional, like Dark Souls but with less choices on weapon behaviours.Game won't hold your hand when playing, so discovery is half the battle.That being said for someone who knows what they're doing the game currently has little to offer, and it is easy to be ""unkillable"" in less than 20 in-game days- the state where the player is prepared for anything that is thrown at them.Through the Ages content should give more ""end-game"" activities, but it is not here yet as of this review.The game can be compared to building a card house or sand castle.It is easy to do once you've mastered the skills, but it is just as easy to make a mistake and watch it all crumble.

								Started the game with my friend , did classic things.Found a chester and named it ""Chester Freeman"". Day 4 we almost got killed by a tentacle and barely escaped.Build a home got attacked by hounds but we were prepared.Day 11 we fighted with bees in a beeland with 500 residents.Chester Freeman died and we killed half of them while playing a war musics behind and run away.While we exploring we get assaulted by hounds again.Barely win with like 5 and 10 hps.Then winter came.My friend died in day 22 while searching for wood.I made a telltale heart and asked him to show his corpse place.He said far away , try to survive on your own and opened a sad song.I died in day 26 because of low sanity while the lyrics was ""I'm dying tonight , Nobody can hold me.""11/10 GOTY			"

												Personally, I LOVE this game.Pro's to buying this game: You get to play with other people in the steam community, there's a chat, sometimes you need the help, everyone knows new things about the game that you didn't know and you can all come together and be one awesome base.Con's to buying this game: There is no age recommendation and some children (childish children) play this game and they don't talk the entire time, steal your supplies and light your base on fire. But that's also a reason to take mods into consideration if you're trying to run a dedicated server because you can add a mod to prevent such actions. Then ban them :)Now, I'm not saying that you have to talk in the chat but please ask for supplies. They are there if you absolutely need them though, or you ask. It's hard to play a game that's vanilla without a chest lock mod, but please, just ask. Also, when you light our base on fire, your lighting hours of our work on fire and burning it to the ground. You should have a temp ban from the game, js.Over all, I do recommend this game and encourage everyone to give it a try!Happy gaming			"

												So... Don't Starve Together... right.Anyway, it's not just  another  survival game. Usually survival games aren't my kind of jam. But this one is something different. S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶'̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶E̶a̶r̶l̶y̶ ̶A̶c̶c̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶G̶a̶m̶e̶,̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶e̶c̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶p̶e̶r̶f̶e̶c̶t̶.̶Don't Starve Together is a dark fantasy survival game with amazing playable characters, enemies, items, soundtrack,  art style, atmosphere, story and more. Players must work together to exploit their environment to combat their ever-draining sanity, health, and hunger, collect resources from different biomes and creatures, build and craft required resources such as food, weapons and light! Make sure you always have a fire for nighttime!Each character has it's own pros and cons, except Wilson, who's a great playable character for newbies. Also each character is voiced by a different instrument, that's what I personally love the most about the game.Don't Starve Together includes Reign of Giants content. So there are 4 seasons and most people would think that winter is the hardest season to survive. Wait til' summer, darling. Winter is easy peasy comparing to summer. Autumn is the real chill season, so give it some love too, plebs.I highly recommend it to peeps who enjoy survival that is both realistic and challenging at times but also mixed with creepy elements. Play this with your buddy, if you'd like to have a good time and ruin your friendship. Funny fact: I play this game mostly alone, since my buddy is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't want to play this game, anymore.			"

								Seriously, this game is the type of multiplayer support I've been looking for on a lot of popular games. You got Minecraft, Gmod, Civ 5, etc., where all their multiplayers are only usable if you have the patience to deal with the annoying crap they give you. This, all this takes is a click of a button and you have a server where all you're friends can join and screw around (and as far as I can tell, it's lag-free). I think it's worth the $5 since you get 2 copies and the fact of how amazing this thing works. Also, giving money to them isn't that bad since I do wish to see this worked on and expanded. 11/10 m8 would starve again			"

												Day 21: I joined a public server, it started winter. Collected some grass and twigs to survive the winter. Plus collecting some food for winter. Asked the server ""Where is base?"" they ignored me.Day 22: It started snowing. I got no winter stuff it started snowing I met 2 really friendly untalkative people. They told me they just joined too but they gave me some wood, twigs, grass and food. I found a cave and went inside collecting some stuff to make science and alchemy engine.Day 23: Made a thermal stone and felt confident to survive the winter. The new comers all died except for me. They all left the game except the people who lives in their base.Day 24: 2 griefers joined, I asked the people who lived in the base to pick me up then the 2 griefers lied and said ""He burned the base"" ""His at your base stealing your♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. His other griefer friend supported him and said ""Im a witness, I saw him burning your base and stealing the food"".But then I was really far away from their base and lived in a cave solo.They were convinced by the 2 griefers and votekicked me.I got banned.10/10 would want to meet the community again			"

												To maximize the joy from this game, i suggest you:A) Read some decent guides, if you don't want to spend time learning the hard way.B) Make dedicated server and get decent hardware. With Caves turned on, you're running 2 servers at same time. (i5 + 16 GB RAM) and i haven't encountered any fps drops.C) Add some skillful friends from public servers, whose'll be able to play at same time you do.Playing closed survival game with few more people makes the game much more better than playing on public servers. With ability to ban, rollback and other console commands, your game won't be ruined by trolls and other junk people being.			"

								I can remember it quite clearly now.It was just starting to get dark and my friends were collecting mushrooms. I was feeding the  fire when I realized we were out of logs. I chopped down a tree just as night began. Suddenly, the tree next to it wakes up and slaps me with his thorny hand.My friends arrive with torches only to see a giant Tree God at the base. Naturally, before they had arrived, I had crafted a torch myself and set him on fire. We HAD trees planted all around our base for a sense of cozyness. I burned down everything trying to set the tree god on fire, but it hadn't seemed to have an effect on him at all. It just burned down all our trees and walls.He ended up slaughtering all four of us.10/10 ""like skyrim with tree gods"" - IGN			"

However, I have not tried to join the community made servers yet, because I don't think it will be as fun as with my friends over Skype. Also, if you already have Don't Starve Alone, you get it for 75% off and it comes with 2 COPIES, so your friend doesn't have to buy it as well. So, if you have (a) friend(s) that want to play, or you just feel like not starving with the community, get this game. Best 5 dollars I've spent on Steam.			"

												Hello this is my review and thoughts for Don't Starve Together currently in Early Access.( Updated as of 9/4/2015 )To be honest it's currently one of the best and most complete game in Early Accecss here why it's worth every penny:Steam workshop support is amazing many Early Access game's are missing this.Beautifull soundtrack just amazing well thought out.Multiplayer is very stable you can except a very good ping if you have a decent internet connection.You can create your own servers allowing you to enable mod's as well allowing you to change the world setting's to your preferance.Playing with your friends or a random stranger is just amazing experience requiring all the player's to use multiple strategiesps: Be sure to watch your back who know's your friend or a random stranger might be trying to.....Gets updated regulary. the dev's always try to interact with the community and don't go silent like most of the dev's.Gameplay has incredible depth in everything. you really don't need me tell you how it is as most of the game is just your classic don't starve.Graphics i don't even now if the game's 3rd dimensional or 2d but the graphics are just perfect for this type of game though not many graphical options but non the less fully perfect for this type o game.Controls are fluent and tight as ever, easy to navigate through while not overly complicated.Content just so much content here its like saying take 1 whole empty candy land now fill it with alot of sweets and just sweets all over it, its what you get here jokes aside the expansion region of Giants is also packed in here but thats not all even more coming in future. The bad stuff? Seems like nothing here to be said hmm odd isn't it?Well let me check again ahh lets see so where were we oh yes here but nothings to be found here.I'm really not kidding you guys no Con here... Guys no con here what am i even saying.Jokes aside no game breaking thing here or anything at all its wierd but that's how it is don't starve togwther really is perfect in what it does.Worth it?Surely why wouldn't i recommend it after so many pros.

								As I'm somewhat of a culinary expert, I kept my friends alive for a long time on my world-famous meatballs. Day after day, meatballs were on the menu. If they requested anything other than meatballs, I'd tell them the alternative was wet goop, so they accepted it and moved on, enjoying my balls of meaty goodness. My secret recipe was the most guarded thing in the server, and I would be paid in large quantites of gold nuggets for my juicy balls of goodness. Everything was happy and good, until a curious Webber snuck into my crock pot facility when I was busy burning down a forest and enjoying the screams of innocent rabbits.The Webber soon figured out my ultimate meatball recipe: 3 pieces of ice and a rotten morsel.As he tried to run out my base and expose my delicious massive balls, a boomerang smacked him across the head, knocking him out. I don't know who threw the boomerang, and I don't know where he's gone. It truly is a tragedy, and everyone mourned over his loss. What could have possibly killed the poor Webber who found out my recipe? What a shame......Spider meatballs, anyone?			"

 IS THIS YOUR TYPE OF GAME? Don't Starve Together is so unique compared to many other survival games I have played. This game actually provides a challenge for its players, as well as providing some relaxing gameplay too. For those who like: Survival games, Base Building, Challenging PVP (Player versus Player) or PVE (Player versus Environment), and/or a game to relax to as you have a conversation with your friends, then this is definitely the game for you. This game is so great that I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this game. Gamestyles:-Traditional Survival With Friends (or friendly community strangers): Enjoy PVE? In Survival Mode, there is a mixture of both challenging and relaxed play. Survival Mode PVE focuses on the base building and boss fighting aspects of the game. -Competitive Survival: Want to take it up a notch from the Traditional Survival gamestyle? Wilderness mode is the ultimate challenge just for that. Using either PVP or PVE, players will all be on their own doing their own things. At the start of the game everyone will be spawned on different areas of the map with little to no help to know where the other players are located. It is everyman/woman for themselves as they fight off the environment... and maybe each other.-Relaxed Survival: New to this game or this type of game and want to learn some of the mechanics? Or are you looking for new ways to survive in Traditional or Competitive Survival? Or maybe you just want to mess around with your friends without the worry of permanent death when all players die. Then relax with Endless mode. With this mode, if you die, just head back to the world spawn point (floral portal) and respawn. Figure out the perfect base set up or fighting tactics against waves of hounds or against the giants.*There are certainly more gamestyles, these just are a few of the main typesWhat makes this game unique compared to others?-Most games all you need to worry about is your hunger and health. In this game, you must deal with hunger, health, and SANITY. Sanity makes the game more interesting as you start to see things that the other players do not see, making it difficult to get around the map... or maybe use it as an opportunity to collect certain materials. -In many survival games, characters do not have anything that make them special compared to others. The characters of Don't Starve Together all have their unique advantages (and disavantages), giving you a different spin on how to play the game.-And lastly, but certainly not least, The World of Don't Starve and its seasons. Every new game will have a new map, so finding certain locations, creatures, and/or items will be different (the host of the game can even change the world settings, making it ever more difficult to map out and survive the world). Also the seasons hold their surprises, as you fight to collect material to survive the current season and for the next season and all at the same time you dread the moment your character says... ""That sounded big.""The gaming community and its devs:-The community is great! There is always new and exciting mods made by the community to give the game an exciting twist. Also, each online community server has their unique gamestyle and gameplay. -The devs have been on their A-game pushing out great new features to add to the game and exciting events. The more they continue the new developements, the more they can grow their community of Don't Starvians. I'm very happy to see them continue on the Don't Starve storyline and then maybe, just maybe, we'll see the developement of Don't Starve Together: Shipwrecked. (But I would rather have them focus on the Traditional Don't Starve Storyline before getting into Shipwrecked)Don't Starve Together is an amazing game. You will not be disappointed and I promise you hours upon hours of exciting gameplay. Keep in mind, this game can be challenging. YOU WILL MOST LIKELY DIE DURING YOUR FIRST WINTER OR MAYBER EARLIER. Don't you worry though, keep on trying and soon enough you will become the Slayer of Giants, the Master of Magic, the Professor of Science, or King of the Don't Starve World. "

								This game is quite fun if you play it with friends. There are still some serious network issues and connectivity issues depending on who you are playing with and you will be less efficient with your time due to lag (longer time to gather/pick up items and sometimes being frozen in place while the clients try to reconnect and sometimes disconnection). If you get disconnected you get a free light source so you don't die at night but it might be a pain during winter.It's always better to split up and gather resources in different areas of the map for a few days rather than competing for the same resources in one area. If you dislike this then I strongly suggest that you increase the spawns of resources for your game depending on how many friends you have playing with you.One more thing is that if you join public games listed it won't start at day 1. You can end up in the middle of winter with nothing on your character so just be prepared for that and hope that the existing players can direct you to where the established base is (it won't always be nearby the portal).The only thing missing is probably a Don't Starve Together 6-pack deal or something. I really have no interest in the single-player campaign so they don't need to inculde that.The only thing needed now is for Steam to fix up their policy on inter-regional gifting so you can actually gift games to your friends on Steam instead of going over to GoG and getting a code there for them. Hint: some of us don't mind spending more to send a gift (this rant is unrelated to the product). "

								Don't Starve Together is Minecraft for people of a different creed. The essentials are the same- sandbox building, collecting, adventuring, and hording everything you come across. But Don't Starve Together, in my opinion, stands out amongst all the other sandbox build-'em-ups out there. It's got charm. I had never experienced legitimate terror until I played this game. I had never experienced true artificial insanity until I played this game. Heck, I had never even built a magic tophat machine until I played this game! Sure, maybe it doesn't have all the content that the original had. But it's got co-op! And infinite modibility, which, might I add, has some of the most entertaining workshop content I've seen for any game in the entire workshop. Don't Starve Together is a good game.Also, I got to watch Mario and Shrek fight hordes of spiders together. 10/10			"

								I extremely enjoy playing this co-ope Tim Burton style open world survival game. Don’t Starve Together is the multi-player version of  Don’t Starve game.Don't Starve together is a wilderness survival/roguelike game, and the premise is simple enough - you're dumped in the middle of a harsh, unforgiving world and you need to figure out how to stay alive. So you start off by choosing your character from a selection of 5 very different personalities each with there own benefits and downsides.After the character selection you will be warped through a portal into the dark nightmare themed landscape surrounded by trees, plants and animals. From here you will collect resources to craft your first basic tools to allow access to even more exotic resources. Not only have you got to look for these initial tool parts but you also very quickly start to learn that your hunger levels drop quickly and you need to be on a constant look out for sources of food. Once you have built some basic tools and kept your hunger at bay you need to then look around for harder materials to build better weapons and armor. Within a few days of in game time you are sure to bump into some not so friendly animals that will quickly make a meal of you.As a roguelike, death is permanent and this might leave some people feeling fed up after a couple of tries, because you lose everything upon death and must start from scratch again, and it can be quite difficult and time-consuming to build up a good base as is. However, for players that like a challenge, every death brings you a little more experience and gives you a better idea of what your goals should be, and how to be more efficient in the next gam.Don't Starve together is a unique take on the popular survival genre, and is a deceptively hard game that can leave some players discouraged with its difficulty and lack of instructions. But for those that enjoy the survival genre in general and like a good challenge, you'll find yourself losing hours in this game as you figure out how to survive its harsh, unforgiving world.			"

								(quick summary at the bottom)I love playing this game! It is great fun and I often find Don't Starve to be a bit lonely after a few hours of wandering around in fear of what might be ahead; but with DST it makes everything a lot less lonely...but at some cost! Playing with friends is a way around all the major downsides though.The game quickly takes a firm grip on you! Losing sanity and finding yourself being attacked by shadows is terrifying! When night catches you off-guard and Charlie strikes I get such an overwhelming panic that it takes me 30 seconds once safe to calm myself down!You are driven to explore and find things, discover the world, to work as a team to do menial tasks quicker (such as one shaving the beefalo, the other picking up the hair. or one chopping trees and the other digging the stumps). To work together to kill the things you need a hand with! It is so much more satisfying to share the tasks of the game.Down sides:Firstly, the community is noobie. You do have morons join, very often, who make things annoying for you! If I'm host I tend to be quick to kick/ban people such as this. But your sanity drops with a dead player in the lobby and if you are struggling it can make it just that bit too much!Joining a server or lobby which is later in the game (Day 30+) can be very difficult even for experienced players. The nearby area will have been picked clean by that time. Everyone is naturally unhelpful to the new person who just joined (because most aren't worth your time and effort to fully equip...or they leave with all your stuff anyway) so I tend to find myself becoming the annoying noob who dies from starvation before even arriving at camp. Despite actually being half decent at the game.But this can be solved by using one of two possible mods to allow the map to regenerate. Or to plant a few berry bushes around the portal you spawn in from. But most don't bother with either.You also get people who like to destroy EVERYTHING then run off with all your nightmare fuel and marble and gears! You can spend hours and hours collecting and planting perfect lines of berry bushes, grass and saplings in your base, only for some pyromaniac to join and burn it all to ash! Annoying! But there is a save feature which you can set as daily and you can leave and reload but you lose all the people from your game...and all the stuff they were carrying (unless they rejoin)! As well as the in game days progress.Pro's:-easy to get gripped-looks good (esp. when going insane)-fun to work as a team-less lonely after longer time playing-many awesome mods to help make things easier/quicker/avoid issues with multiplayer aspectCon's:-People join and ruin your game (burn, steal and leave, die and haunt you)-Not full DS game content available yet-chat is annoyingly slow to use and leaves you vulnerable-loading a pervious save of that lobby kicks people out-stuff people were carrying gets lost when they leave-noobs join and are a drain on your food/health/sanityThings to improve:-Make mods official tested solutions to common problems (allow chests to be locked to certain people, when people leave your lobby the items they carry spawn back close to a road or at base, spawn with axe, pick, shovel and food to survive a couple of days due to depleted environment, regenerate chessmen)-easy to use chat system-ranking system so decent players don't get mistaken for noobs (based on deaths, kills, resources collected, time played, days survived, health lost:animals killed, etc...)Things to help make you better players:-If you get hit when killing spiders/treeguards then let somebody else do it-If you have a lag or occasionally suffer a latency to a host then be careful when attacking, or leave it to someone else-Be helpful and ask what needs doing. Carry your weight.-DROP EVERYTHING WHEN YOU LEAVE (besides axe, shovel, pickaxe)-Learn to cook, or don't cook at all!-Prepare for night while it's day-Have FUN!!! So overall I would rate this beta 7/10. And I do recommend it despite the flaws!Hopefully you found my review helpful!			"

Because when you have some friends to play with than this game is perfect made for you if you like a hard survival game.  The game it self, trys to kick your♥♥♥♥♥all the time again with anything. And as i said before, if you have a good team with some friends you can survive pretty long. But always keep in mind, the game isn´t your friend. With every ingame day it just becomes harder and harder. The main thing is to not starve, and to survive the winter which you have ,,lots of time"" WRONG! you just have like 22 - 26 ingame days, but in these days you have to do so much other stuff that winter is pretty soon for your door and you don´t have the equipment to survive it. Anway for this game i give 10/10 top game!			"

								Original Don't Starve always left me with an odd and uncomfortable feeling of loneliness. It may be considered a part of the atmosphere - your character is stranded in a hostile environment, after all. But still, it became tiresome after some time. Now, you can invite a friend to share the game world. Delegate tasks, feed each other, support your companion in battle with nature and elements, or suddenly leave your friend to be devoured by hounds while you escape! Instant fun!It's a bit tough that you can't pause the game, though. Don't starve is a time-consuming game, and when you play in company, someone is bound to be distracted from the game at some point. Would be nice to have a sort of ""vote to pause"" system, or a server admin pause switch.			"

												This game is a very strategic and tactical game. Playing solo is hard, but playing with others might just be harder. One must survive as long as they can. Finding food, a good camp ground and piggies is key. Spider nest are always helpful and be careful what you chop, it might just attack you. Get armoured up and head out far as you can and find many other creatures and new weapons. Lastly, be ready to defend against a gang of wolves. Pro's- Enjoyable alone or co-op- Suspenseful and exciting- Something new everyday- Climate change and weather changes everythingCon's- Wolves attack early sometimes- Boss fights can get you one shot'd- Co-op ghosts are negative to everyone everywhere in the gameOverall I recommend this game is worth purchasing with a group of friends, 8.5/10.

								Fun game to play with friends, but with a twist a challange to it.When you start off you start outside of a portal in the middle of nowhere with your friends or just random people you decided to join. You have a bit until night to at least get a fire started so you don't get attacked by the shadows lurking in the dark, and if you're out there you are most likely going to die. Dying will cause your friends trouble, they start to lose their sanity from one of the others who are stranded there die and it haunts them. No fear though, you can easily craft yourself a TellTale Heart. You go up to your friend who has turned into a ghost and stick a new heart into them giving them life again, or you can go haunt a touch stone which will also bring you back to life. Be careful though (I think) it chips away at your max health (last time I played with my friend I had to revive them quite a bit and their max health was lowered). On the other hand the game play is great the graphics are simple and great, plus you don't have to unlock the characters. You can get more fanmade characters off the DST website or the steam workshop which is also fun, but the one issue with it is when this happened (to me). When my friend who downloaded the same mods, but off the steam store (when I got it off the official DST website) would not work. So when you want to play with mods make sure you download the content off the same website/workshop.Again this is a great game for people who enjoy survival co-op games.			"

								It was a little to learn at the beginning, frustrating having never played single player.  I couldn't learn it by just playing I had to do some research, but the research was just as fun as playing the game.  Its much better if you play with someone that's played before. The characters are awesome, Wig is my fav! The community is small, servers only hold 6-8 people at a time, but I totally recommend this game.  You really only need 3 to have a great time! It's the perfect amount of challenging... until you get to summer... GLHF!!			"

Recommend purchase of the game, and find few people to paly it with, post question in general discussion you will find somebody, who will play with you. Lag free - Solo - Multiplayer - Cheats does not result in ban - For 20$ Graphich is great - A lot of cool stuff to do out there, Woudn't reccomend to play it alone, not veyr easy to survive without company !

												After getting a 100 hours of gameplay out of Don`t Starve Together, I can say that this game is worth the money. Although I never played the singleplayer version of the game, which I am told contains more story, I still enjoyed playing this when a friend wasn`t available. It is enjoyable both alone and with friends, and I personally don`t think that it is necessary to own both games if wanting to play single or multiplayer.The customization options when generating the world can allow for each player to adjust the world to their difficulty level. Newer players can make it a bit easier for their first time so they can get a feel for the game and test it out, while more experienced players can adjust settings to keep the game from becoming boring. However, one may choose to play on the default settings to get the true experience of the game.For many, the in game items and outfits are an important part of the game. These drop randomly and require that the player has at least the basic science machine built. When entering a world these items can be applied the your chosen character, or can be changed by crafting a wardrobe. Character customization can be important to some players, and items can be collected to do this over time when playing. Otherwise, the items may be sold or traded on steam. I could expand further on this game, but that has the potential to ruin the experience for new players that should discover the details of the game themselves. Overall though, I would suggest this game for those that enjoy a survival based game that contains different types of environments and a gradually expanded crafting system. It can be enjoyed alone or with friends equally even though this version is more geared towards multiplayer. I have gotten a large amount of playtime out of the game already without becoming tired of playing yet.			"

For early access they've done miraculous work getting this project off the ground, I long awaited the multiplayer and so far I have not been disappointed. The only downside at this time is a lot of mods only effect the host of the server (this is only a downside if you play with mods, anyway)10/10, I have enjoyed every minute of this game - even the minute when I died and my friend killed himself making a telltale heart for me. That was a rough winter.			"

												I was very surprised by how much I loved this game-- the first week playing it, I poured 50 hours into the game while managing school and work (somehow). Oh my goodness does this game have depth! I saw the beautiful, simplistic UI design and simple resources, and thought ""oh cool I'll get to relive my Harvest Moon days"". I was not prepared for hounds attacking me at night, trees turning into monsters to attack me, pigs becoming my best friends, or being excited about poop. It was hours and hours of fun, and I still have not worn out from the game.Honestly, I very much recommend this game not because I am positive that everyone will love it, but because I believe that this game is well-worth the price tag! It is well developed, well designed with an active multiplayer community, and patched often. I feel like the game designers work closely with the players to manage the direction this game is going as well. As someone that comes from an MMORPG background, I was very pleased with how active the multiplayer aspect of this game was.			"

								Don't Starve is one of my favourite games and I can confirm that it's significantly better with a friend. Trying to survive feels more meaningful when someone is depending on you, and you're depending on them. You split your resources and cooperate to stay alive, and lack of cooperation ends abruptly with death. You'll end up learning new strategies and things about the game from the other person and everything feels much less lonely. This version of the game is also a great learning tool for those who are new to Don't Starve as you can have another person directly guide you through it. I recommend playing Don't Starve Together wholeheartedly, it's an amazing experience. I can't wait till development is finished and my favourite lumberjack gets added!Edit: He's been added. Feels good.			"

								This game is addictive. Halp.Day 235: Killed by werepigs. GG.For an early access game, Don't Starve Together (DST) is well put together by the developers. The game mechanics are simple and easy for players to get into and the concept - being able to survive (together) for as long as possible within the randomly generated world - is simple. Unlike Dont Starve, utilising the resources given  is not the only challenge in DST. The main challenge, I believe, is cooperation between the players in order to survive. Without this cooperation, survival is less likely to be achieved. On the other hand, like Don't Starve (DS), the basics of the original game are integrated into DST. Game controls and the characters from DS are all integrated into DST aside from the Reign of Giants DLC. Hopefully Reign of Giants will be integrated into multiplayer soon.As I continue to play DST, I will continue to edit my posts and note down the glitches that I have come across as well as suggestions that may improve the game in the future. Feel free to leave comments regarding this. GLITCHES: • Every time a dapper vest is dropped, the vest cannot be picked up. (FIXED)• Items that have been dropped near drying racks are sometimes extremely difficult for the player to pick up.SUGGESTIONS:• Being able to name chests would help a lot when sorting out resources.• Ability to build rooves for houses/structures.• Mini maps - could be a craftable item so that players have the choice whether to have it on their screen or not.• Waypoints.• Buildable teleporters.EDIT:- The recent changes on Willow, though it's a stopgap, is ridiculous. The trademark of Willow being the much-loved firestarter has been lost.			"

								This game, oh this glorious game. I have owned Don't Starve for a long time yet I had never really bothered to play it. For some reason when I saw Don't Starve Together I figured I would go ahead and give it a shot. I don't remember my first few attempts of not starving together; although I do remember wanting to cry the first time a batch of hounds came through camp. Let's not forget the one time I thought I had truly bonded with the Beefulo however, I was not warned about mating season. Just figured they had rashes or something. What I'm trying to say is, you will fail. A lot. More than what you ever thought was possible. For some reason you will continue to pick up this game with hopes of lasting just one more day. . .or finally killing that annoying jive♥♥♥♥♥turkey that decides it just wants to pop out your berry bush AND THEN EAT YOUR F*CKING BERRIES OFF YOUR GOD DAMN BERRY BUSH. *Ahem* Sorry, the hate for those turkeys run deep in my veins.

								Don't Starve Together contains the highly requested feature of multiplayer to Don't Starve. On June 3, 2015, Don't Starve Together was released for free to owners of Don't Starve on Steam. For those who are not, Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together can be bought individually or as a bundle. It was originally scheduled to come out in Summer 2014.Starting December 15, 2014, Don't Starve Together Beta was in Steam Early Access, which closed when the game was released just under 6 months later. --Features--Don't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: local, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. Game mode and PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference. A type of server called ""Friends Only"" allows a server to be created whereby the only people who can join have to be on your steam friends list. Many console commands have changed or been removed for DST.--Game modes--There are three game modes, with additional modes that can be added by mods. Survival is the default mode, intended to be a cooperative, more difficult mode, in which dead players become ghosts that drain the sanity of living players by 3.3/min (up to 10/min total). When all players are dead in Survival, a timer starts, and if no players are revived in that time, the world is reset. Endless mode is intended to be a more relaxed mode that doesn't force players to cooperate. In Endless, the world never resets, and players may resurrect themselves at the spawn portal. Wilderness is intended to be more like other survival games. Players spawn in random locations across the map, there are no ghosts, and players who die are returned to character select wiping their map and respawning them in a new random location. No resurrection items exist, including touchstones (although their set pieces with pig heads will still be generated). Rate: 10/10			"

												So, you are here reading reviews, instead of buying this game? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GTFO AND BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥ITS SO GOOD.First off, the artwork! When i play this beautifully crafted game, i feel like i am wondering about a Tim Burton film. It's a welcome change from the normal survival game interface and artwork, much like its' sister product ""dont starve"".Second, the way you evolve with your character. At first glance, you seem like a cave man who just woke up and needs to eat, but when you find some berries and get fed, you instantly start scrounging around for grass, twigs and flint. You make an axe and start to collect wood logs. OH NO IT'S NIGHT TIME WE GON DIEEEEE. You now have to make a fire. All of these simple beginners steps turn your caveperson like sprite, into a brave warrior who fights wolves from hell, living trees, and a huge deer with one eye whos one wish in life is to crush you and your friends hard work (and or skulls).Finally, whatever else is good about ""dont starve"", its twice as good in this game. ""why?""""You can work with friends, accuaintances, enemies and the likes, but no matter what you do... always remember...""WINTER IS COMING""			"

								A classic game made into multiplayer. What's not to love?The excitement, the memories and more can now be shared with your friends, enemies or strangers.To anyone thinking on getting it and playing with a friend, here are some tips to help you out.-Birchnut trees are a quick and safe way of getting food. Make sure to cut the trees with two branches at the top.-Be careful on what character you choose as they all have flaws but the best to start with is Wilson.-Always have some extra food on you. You'll never know when someone desperatly needs food.-Green Mushrooms are very good if you are low on sanity. Make sure too cook them though!-The best area to put a base in is near Beefalo  and a road for quick travel.-You do not have to fight spiders to get their silk/glands. Simply lure them into a trap and you get the resources trouble free!-Another say way of getting meat is by going near Moles, putting rocks/flint on the floor and waiting til they go out. Then attack them and you get a morsel without risk!-Treeguards can be be calmed by planting saplings of their trees near them.-Be careful when choosing Webber, as pigs will attack you on sight and you have lower sanity.That's all i can think off the top of my head. Happy hunting and as always; Don't Starve (Together)			"

												Don't Starve Together, a game about:- accidentally burning your base- freeloaders absent-mindendly standing around and eating all of your hard-earned food from your fridge, occasionally burning your base- grannies killing you and your freeloaders with lightning, ultimately burning your base- dragonfly killing you and your whole squad, also burning your base- fire hounds killing you and your cronies... and burning your base.as you can see, fire is very devastating and seems powerful. despite this, the only character that focuses on using fire is also the most useless one. klei plz			"

												This is one of my favorite games!The multiplayer aspect is fun because it allows you to cooperate and coordinate with friends to make surviving easier. There's also the added challenge of making sure there's enough food and resources for everyone the more friends are in a game. The fact that you can disable PVP and only allow friends on your server greatly reduces any issues with griefers and makes playing fun and laid back in my opinion. There's so many different ways to play and a lot to explore in a world with the inclusion of caves and the Shipwrecked DLC. The diverse characters and complexity of survival make it so there is something for everyone to enjoy.DST is already amazing on it's own but with the addition of community created mods there's even more to enjoy! I feel as though the mods keep the game fresh and exciting with all the fan created characters. My friends and I are always finding great characters to play as in the workshop.Lastly, the art style and music are wonderful. The creepy-cute vibe is perfect for the game and is one of my favorite things about it.All in all 10/10 would recommend to anyone, especially fans of co-op and survival games. "

								(Coming from someone who has never played the original but has seen a lot of footage of it)  I got gifted Don't Starve Together yesterday, and while I have only played 4 hours, it's been really fun. You could say the game was made easier, but it wasn't in some cases, if you are new to playing Don't Starve, losing your friend can be one of the most traumatic experiences in games. The selection of characters can make a game interesting, trying to find out the gimmicks of them and such. The sound of the game can really make you feel creeped out, the pig screams and tallbirds made the game very creepy, and adds to the atmosphere. Overall, it's just as spine chilling as the original, but much more fun due to having a friend/s alongside you.			"

								I'm not really a fan of survival games usually, but DST is a very approachable game - especially with friends. The world customization allows for some nice variants if you want to make things a little easier or harder as well.The art style is rather cute, and it is simple enough to learn the basic crafting. But strategy for the long term and advanced crafting take time to understand. The mod base is growing and includes lots of interesting and useful UI, character, and environment additions.I really wasn't interested in the original Don't Starve, but playing through the DST craziness with friends is quite a fun experience!

												DST is a great game, possibly outranking its predecessor. You'll want to find a good group of people, though, because randomly hopping on servers can be a subpar experience rarely. Once you have a really good set of people on a good server, however, DST shines. Very worth the price!			"

								One day I launched Don't Starve and played , but one night I asked myself that question : Will I ever meet other people ?Well Hell God Damn Way I can ! Don't Starve Together is an amazing experience and what missed to the initial game .Server supports mods , gameplay still as good , although you might get a good connection if you want to play without some lag .Don't Starve Together is almost a full game wich for a Beta is pretty full compared to others (I'm looking at you DayZ) .The game is the same as the single player mode , but this time , no more of running around the firepit 'cause you're bored ,  your friends are here to entertain and if they want to survive too , they better help .I highly recommend the expansion , even if it's 5 dollars (or Euros or whatever the money of your country) , it will be worth trust me !

												Don't Starve Together(DST)  is the multiplayer version of its base game, Don't Starve. DST encourages teamwork, corporation and trust on its players to ensure their survival in the game. You must manage your health, hunger, sanity, heat and humidity. For instance, If your sanity is too low,  you must retrieve flowers or sleep to regain sanity and prevent it from plummeting. This is very similar to the basic human and conceptual skills needed from the base game: Trustworthiness, Teamwork, coodination, dependability, quick-thinking and management...-To be continued tmr zzzz-			"

												Hey guys, here's a quick review ( and pardon my english ) :Good graphics, runs very smoothly even on my regular laptop , and most of all its a hardcore survival and unforgiving game. I have been playing most of the time in public servers. And one thing i dont understand is, why people put the server public if they kick u away immediately when entered the server. So, that's why  i recommend that u play on dedicated servers if you're on public. Some of the Beginner tips : Character matters ( Most of the characters are balanced which means, they have a positive talent/skill but also have a negative one. For example Wolfgang can become strong which grants you increase attack and health when your stomach is full. However if u dont eat enough you will become weak. Check the game's Wiki to know more about characters. Also choose wisely your character when u enter a server/ or host. You can't change it anymore in-game. You just have to wait until all dies and reset the server ( Survival mode ). Seasons ( I Wouldn't join a game which is on early winter, you'll freeze in no time if there isn't any ppl around and also refuse to communicate, lol, Winter starts at day 20 ).Resources ( Gather anything in sight, twigs, grass, flowers, carrot, flint.. then make a axe and chop down trees and don't forget to mine some gold to progress, which can be indentified by the veins in the rocks. And cut down those birch trees which are white and have some black stripes on it, then u can sometimes get birchnut to be cooked and eat.)Sanity ( Picking flowers raises your sanity, eatin cooked food etc. etc. or make a flower ''hat'' with 12 flower pedals to maintain your sanity. )Well, that's some of the tips i got through with my 10 h gameplay and experience, guess you have to find out the rest yourself. Oh, do i recommend this game ? Yes i absolutely recommend this game and HIGHLY recommend that you play with friend(s). Most of all, don't die and Don't Starve Together.			"

												My review about this game was originally a silly joke in the form of a satirical in-game scenario, but I feel like I really need to do it some justice. Don't Starve Together, ideally, is just that: Don't Starve, but Together, with other people, normally with your friends since public servers are admittedly going to generally be pretty toxic. However, it is still perfectly playable solo, and there's so much more to the game than just being a multiplayer version of its predecessor. The team behind it seems genuinely passionate about what they're doing, so much so that some of it even rubs off on the workshop and the creators of a lot of the mods in it. They even gave Don't Starve Together away to owners of Don't Starve for FREE back when it was still in the beginning of its early access stage, and INCLUDED all the DLC they had for the latter game at the time.To start, if you don't know what Don't Starve (Together) is, it's probably one of the oldest, truest, and all-around best survival sandbox games out there. It has a unique artstyle, some interesting lore, and easy-to-learn but still always threatening and challenging gameplay. After hundreds of hours, I'm still learning and being amazed, or, at the very least, intrigued by a lot of the things I still don't know about that I accidentally stumble upon while playing. It's truly a new experience every time. It also doesn't have the problem almost every ""survival game"" out there has nowadays, too, with being very one-dimensional, predictable, or feeling just like one of those dime-a-dozen copies of popular representatives of the genre. There's so much you can customize for each individual world, both the good and the bad, the objects and the mechanics, it's just overall very customizeable, which is always a welcome feature, especially to the picky folk or perhaps the type who easily get bored of games with one or very few different settings, and that's not even mentioning the mods.Oh gosh yes, the workshop. It's absolutely wonderful. Although a lot of people can agree that making and maintaining mods for the game can be very difficult and ""time consuming and a mess of coding"" in the game's current stage, the level of activity and additional customization that can be found in the workshop is amazing and provides virtually unlimited replayability to the game.Honestly, to any modders reading this who still support their mods, I think I speak for everyone when I say I'm genuinely thankful for what you're doing. You make the community and the game even more awesome than it already is, and it wouldn't quite be what it is without all of your contributions. Unless all you do is make reskinned Wilsons of anime, pony, or FNaF characters with nothing more than a buff to the base character stats. Seriously, cut that out. It's embarrassing for everyone.This is also the only game I know of with an in-game market worthy of mentioning without some stupid desperate attempt to grab your cash for every box you want to open. You get free boxes of cosmetic items for your characters just by playing, and can also open them... for free! And you can even buy and sell them on the Steam market, and recycle them with a function in game.Seriously, I can't think of any downsides with this game--even if I could, the good most certainly outweighs the bad--and it's tough to imagine Klei bailing out on development and letting us down. So why haven't you gotten this game yet? The devs deserve your support and you deserve to give yourself a quality time killer!			"

Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer survival adventure game. It stands out from other survival games due to being original and different in many ways.Pros:● Unique, hand-drawn art style and models that resemble cardboard cutouts ● 4 seasons with perks and disadvantages (e.g different monsters every season, shorter days, frostbite, snow during winter, heat and wildfires during summer, ..)● Big maps with different biomes● A huge variety of food ● Sanity bar with a possibility to go insane● Many interesting craftable items and structures● Peculiar enemies (like deerclops, werepig or a mixture of a goose and a moose)● Great soundtracks that go well with the artstyle giving cartoon vibes● Workshop support● Easy server hosting with lots of world settings● 10+ characters to pick from● Highly addictive● ChallengingCons:● After dozen hours into the game there's not much left to do● Tough to perform your wanted actions while being near many other objects/items● Could use some in-game guides (where to get certain items, etc.)Overall, it's an excellent game, especially with a friend or two.9/10 "

												Don't Starve Together is possibly the best multiplayer game I have ever played. Nay, possibly the best game, period.When I first started playing, I could barely survive on my own. I was in constant fear of starving to death, going insane, and running for my life from bloodthirsty packs of hounds. I was dying a lot and most of the time it was my own fault. I kept playing though because with each death I learned a little more about how to better survive the next world.The best part of this game has to be the friendly community. I always love joining a random server and being greeted with a friendly ""hello"" usually followed by directions to a base. I learned most of my Don't Starve skills from more experienced players who offered their help and advice. Now I happily do the same thing for new players. It's a great feeling knowing that people are enjoying the game more because of me.If you ever get bored of the normal gameplay there are also tons of great mods on the steam workshop. Not to mention that this is still getting updates to the vanilla game. This game already has so much fun content in my opinion but the fact that it's still being updated is amazing. I'd like to thank the devs for making this awesome game and for their continued support of it.What, you still haven't decided if you should get this game? Just look at my hours and I think you'll see that it's worth your money. Happy not starving my fellow survivors!			"

												SO! Time to write another review. I've been playing this game for roughly a year now (The Together Edition) and OH BOY IT'S FINALLY OUT OF EARLY ACCESS.Let's start off with the good.This game is so much fun with friends and a GREAT way to make friends. On average (from my experience) the communty i friendly. It is Don't Starve, after all, so it's a unique gameplay and idea. There's a bunch to do, especially with mods. I've done everything form 1v1 tournaments to just regularly playing/surviving. The game is updated regularly and maintained with a close eye. I love how responsive the creators at Klei are. They love to stay interactive with their fans and fellow gamers. There's an interesting backstory to DST, which branches from DS (Learn about it by playing the CycIum puzzle). I just love this game so much.Now, for the bad.There's not much here. There are and always will be bugs, especially when mods are involved. Without Don't Starve background, the game can be a bit dificult, but that shouldn't be a problem with help from the other gamers (assuming your server has other people). That's pretty much it. The game isn't really bad.I'd recommend this game to anyone who:A) Likes survival games.B) Likes games that involve interracting / making friends.C) Likes a very interesting sketch-like art style.

												This game is very punishing if you have no idea of what to do in order to survive. There's no clear instruction of what to do other than don't die, don't starve, and don't go insane - and there's no tutorial.Often times you'll wander the wasteland finding nothing but rocks and boulders, praying to the merciful gods that you'll soon reach the sabana where you can finally settle down, living from the hunt and start preparing for Winter. Other times you'll find a good spot fairly soon into the game, only to realize that there's no boulders nearby and you're pretty much stuck because you can't build advance structures.You WILL die, starve, and go insane multiple times before finally figuring out the do's and don'ts. Once you get past this point, you will finally start having fun.			"

								I found Don't Starve Together rather enjoyable, it's very fun, and very easy to play. Klei have done an amazing job coding the original Don't Starve into this multiplayer version and it's obvious that they've done a brilliant job doing so. The game itself consists of a 2D/3D background with a cartoonish grey outlook where your aim is to survive as long as possible until you die, depending on whether you have a friend on your game with you, there will or won't be a chance to respawn. If a friend is on with you then he/she can craft a ""Telltale heart"" to bring back a dead player at the cost of 20 health, 3 grass and a spider gland. Dead players cause sanity loss on living players and can roam around ""haunting"" objects and creatures. Perhaps later on as an idea for haunting, the dead player can control the object/animal depending on sanity and having low sanity can allow you to control bigger and more ""alive"" creatures/objects.Don't Starve Together also brings the concepts from Reign of giants into the game, such as the actual ""giants"". These giants seem to be seasonal with ""bearger"" at autumn, ""Deerclops"" at winter, ""???"" (or goose/moose) at spring and ""Dragonfly"" at summer. These Giant enemies bring a new challenge to players and can bring games to an end because of the high attack damage they possess. This can be a rather difficult challenge for players as giants such as ""deerclops"" can come out of the darkness in winter and destroy your base/encampment.  Don't Starve Together also brings new characters and character concepts into the game, such as ""Wigfrid"" a warrior woman who can only eat meat and has her own character locked weapon and armor called the ""Battle Spear"" and the ""Battle helm"", I found this very useful and fun to be able to use a new weapon which won't bring down sanity, however the character itself can be rather restrictive as when I played as ""Wigfrid"" I felt as if I were restricted to my base as I could not wander too far from my food source which was rabbit traps. Perhaps ""Wigfrid"" could eat food and it would be more filling so that it makes up for the fact that if there is was little meat left the character won't die so fast of hunger and allow for players such as myself to be able to explore without too many restrictions. ""Webber"" is another addition to the game and is described as (""Is a monster, befriends spiders, grows a silky beard"") he is a very good addition to the game and grants a bigger freedom in the game as the character can eat a wider variety of foods such as monster meat, which I found as a brilliant idea for a character. The character itself though get's attacked by ""Pigs"" if the character gets in a close proximity and this can be very repetitive and persistent, this is a good idea at best but perhaps the character ""webber"" could just be unable to befriend ""Pigs"" and just instead of being attacked just avoided.Overall I found the game very enjoyable and would be happy to see any improvements in the game such as previously stated and caves which I'm sure Klei are working hard on.

												Big amount of mods in this game. Its a typical survival game with hunger and stuff. I like the idea with how longer u wait then more ur character gets crazy :D U can craft things to survive longer,too cook food to make them more usefull,frides to collect them,different clothes,weapons and much more.This game is a how many days can u survive :3Its not a waste of money if u have friends to play with			"

								When DST first came out connections were horrible and it was almost impossible to play. However, that is no longer the case and I can now drop a positive review. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and playing it with friends not only makes it more entertaining but more challenging. (No pausing + having to take care of them because they're babies :P)Pros:Incredible art style and graphicsHours of entertainment and infinite replayability (if you're into this genre)Plenty of spooks as you progress in the gameReally makes your choices matter as one slip up can cost you the gameMultiplayerCons:Very difficult even when you have lots of experienceFinding a good dedicated server that stays up is nearly impossibleCan't be paused (get singleplayer if you want that feature) "

								Incredibly worth the buy - multiplayer was exactly what this game needed. It's tons more fun being able to play with your friends, and having up to 6 in a game is nice. Multiplayer is extremely easy to set up, which is a big plus.Overall if you like Don't Starve, the beta is totally worth it.			"

								I love this game. It is challenging and a lot of fun to play with other people, it makes you appreciate having a good team and requires organisation to survive. I really recommend it even if you are a beginner to the game (I was), the community is great (apart from the occasional troll/griefer but hey it's the internet, what did you expect) and are willing to help you out.

Great co-op, and am still learning more about the game. I can't imagine the first people to play this without experienced players or a wiki.

								Don't starve is a pretty good game on its own that personally would have been better with a buddy. I was waiting for ages for Don't starve together to come out and now that it finally has i find it a whole lot better, the fun part is that you can have one person out getting one thing as you get the other and you can build a home and other things either together or apart and have a PVP battle after building your own little empire, i think it would probably be a bit better if you could pin-point some things on the map to make it easier and maybe have a mini-map to help you find your way back or find some things that you want to keep, i just think it would make it a whole lot better.

								Obviously you should play with a friend otherwise just play the normal Don't starve ;DBut since I'm a multiplayer fan I didnt play the normal one a lot. But this... Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's sooo ♥♥♥♥ing much fun :DI'm playing with 2 other guys most of the time, sometimes even more. We still haven't explored everything, which means that we'll probably still be playing a lot more.And if that wasn't reason enough to buy it, they have added Steam Workshop, which means we can't really run out of content thanks to mods. (And the devs are also still working on this so we get even more content ;P)The game itself has a very nice Style, Sounds are really nice and it has many funny/creepy/cool features.And I have to say: I absolutely LOVE these dark hands creeping to your fire to put it out with the most ♥♥♥♥ing creppy soundeffects EVER :DDEDIT: Most people (incuding me) would think that winter is the hardest to survive.

								PROS:-Mods work seamlessly in multiplayer, it's wonderful and I love them-Flawless connections to random people, even with my crappy internet-All the fun of Don't Starve, but multiplayer, 6 player cap but mods allow even more (up to 30!)-Super easy to have your own servers with friends only, still no connection problems at all! Even I hosted!-I haven't stopped having fun yet-99% of people are really friendly-Pvp is toggleable-Your world can still be customized in every way just like regular :D-Super Easy to join friendsCONS (rated from 1-10 on a scale of how critical it is, 1 barely an issue/10 gamebreaking):-Public servers can have griefers, only one server had this for me, some random a-hole came in and teleported everyone randomly but was quickly banned (3)-No tooltip to tell you that the means to revive your friends costs 40 hp... I've killed myself twice before realising this (4)-Haunting doesn't tell you what it does, I accidentally made a werepig thinking I could control a pig (2)-Dead allies drain sanity REDICULOUSLY fast and revival barely recovers any at all, 2-3 players suffer the most due to inability to reliably obtain spider glands (4)All in all, I love the challenge, even the heavy insanity drain which is why I give it only a 4 rating out of 10... Others might make an argument that it's too much but there are mods that increase and decrease litterally everything! Don't like certain aspects of the game?

Grabbing food and crafting supplies and meeting weird but interesting looking monsters is only part of the fun.

								It's still missing quite a lot, but this 'vanilla' experience is still what Don't Starve (except with friends!) is known to be.  I more than recommend playing with others you know, because if game-anonymity has taught me anything, it can be a mixed bag with regards to who you'll be playing with.With this, now you can laugh, cry, and otherwise have a few buddies experience the same things you do.That being said, I'm using my previous review:---Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.  If you're not prepared, then prepare to die!			"

But the graphics style and humour is enchanting and it's insanely addictive when you start playing co-op.  While this will be free for people that have Don't Starve when it gets fully released I really can't stress how happy I was I spent the money and got to play it early.  It plays like a completed game already! Very worth the purchase, don't hesitate!  ---------------------------------------------------------------Update - I've had this game for ages and I still play it with my partner, its one of our go-to games for stress relief.

								Nice survival game, I really like it. Draft of this game is so amazing, graphics, all crafting mechanisms, seasons and items - they are not too OP but worth it. Every world is randomly generated, making each save original (I really like exploring uncharted coasts). This game is every time trying to beat you. It is sometimes funny, but sometimes, it makes me VERY angry. Also a community is super. Almost every 3 days someone creates extraordinary mod - character, item, dish, animation, etc.For some people, it may be really hard, but that is also the reason, why is it in MULTIPLAYER (if you have got minimally one friend to play with, you will spend much time by playing DST).I actually find one think, which tricks me off: When you pause the game, playing just one (without any friend), it will NOT be paused, it will be still resumed instead. I also hope, Shipwrecked will be on DST soon (in DS, you can buy R.o.G and SW DLC and switch between them), but in DST is permanently R.o.G. on.FINAL RESULT sounds: Thanks god (eventually to Klei) for this game....Keep on mind, it is still a BETA.PS: For newbies is every tip important, so I will maybe create a page, where will be everyone able to write anything about this freaking awesome game.

								Don't Starve if you don't know is the kind of game you spend days perfecting and moments destroying, I love it. Ive played Don't Starve and since day one Ive enjoyed the unique survival approach to the genre, now that it has multiplayer its even more fun because we all know its better to die together then alone. My thanks go to the developers for allowing every owner of Don't starve free access to Don't Starve together once it left closed Beta. From what Ive seen the developers care for their fan base and also care for the game they've created, with regular updates theres always something new for even the most experienced of players to be challenged with. Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a hardcore survival type game and who enjoys it with others even better.			"

												NOTE: I started playing in the EARLY ACCESS.First of all, I've started playing this game again after a while, and again I got addicted to it immediately.This is one of the most fun games I have EVER played with friends.It's SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. GOOD. Ohhh I'm such in love with this game.I've spent over 30 hours grinding every world until I die, and it doesnt bore me AT ALL.Every world is unique and I keep finding new things in those worlds where I can make something from. Grinding in this game is super fun, you need to get a lot of resources in order to stay alive (which seems pretty hard for me since my record is only day 24 lol.)PROS:- SO much fun to play with friends.- A lot of unique items and bosses compared to other games of the same genre.- Very unique art style, which I love by the way.- So many diffrend crafting recipes.- A lot of diffrent options for a base.- Very diffrent characters, which is handy if you want to find a character you really like!CONS:- Food can be a problem sometimes, but oh well..9,5/10 For the game, if they added the DLC's from the normal Don't Starve into this game, it'd be a 10/10.PS: Have an amazing day!

												This game is awesome and deserves my 70+ hours on it.DST is much better than offline DS. However, some bugs still exist in game and the game would quit randomly. (Especially when I played ""Musha"" character in Musha mod and the game quited so many times in one day) Looking forward to have new DLC and wish the game wouldn't laggy in China anymore. (I hope so :p)Really like the game and enjoy the time with friends in DST.GJ Klei!Update 2016.06.07- Downloaded MOD: ""Ride"" The ox riding was awesome!- ""Musha"" MOD always crushed and could not save the data - Musha MOD is FUNUpdate 2017.01.11- Need to update mods and game quits randomly- Overall the game is enjoyable			"

								It's a really fun game to play with friends (or alone). It has many things to craft, places to go and monsters to kill. There's one con though, that after a while when you uncover everything, it gets pretty borring (or monotonic). But bigass community workshop comes to help here. Starting with additional crafting items, bushes, trees and monsters, ending with additional prebuilt buildings to discover and fight with (no really, I tried to destroy a wall and I ended up triggering a trap and running away from a huge mechanical monstrosity with 1k or 2k hp).So if you like survival games that are pretty much a sandbox where everyone still tries to kill you, the game is perfect for you.

												Don't Starve Together is an amazing multiplayer game which you can play alongside friends or with strangers if your friends are unavailable to play with. The game has a beautiful and sometimes creepy art style and the main goal of it is to prolong your miserable existence for as long as possible. Basically, survive as long as you can! No matter how many hours you play of it, there's always new things to be discovered within this game and always new items to craft/learn about and it provides endless hours of fun. Playing it together with your mates provides many hilarious moments. Quite often some nightmarish creature will come along and kill you both for absolutely no reason, but it'll be absolutely hilarious hearing your friend scream as they die.I would definately reccomend this game! Especially since every copy of the game you buy, you recieve another copy to gift to your friend! Which is an awesome little thing the developers added.			"

Game Play: There are three game modes each with different type of play: Survival, Endless and Wilderness. Each has a different style of play, Survival is the default game play mode and is meant to be more difficult once everyone dies the world resets. In Endless you can play more relaxed and respawn at the portal if you die (unthinkable!), in Wilderness you spawn in random locations in the game.

 Achievements: None that are steam linked, but you do get bragging rights if you're good at Don't Starve, you can show your friends that if you were sent into a survival situation you would survive by making an axe out of grass and sticks.Price: Don't Starve Together's standard price is $19.99, if you already like Don't Starve, this game is a no brainier, I can't speak high enough of how awesome the Don't Starve series is. If you can't afford it wait for the game to get out of Early Access mode and get it on sale. Conclusion: What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said? Get this game if you want to play Don't Starve with friends/enemies/people/psychopaths/Wilson's.


It was really hilarious to watch my brother chase a rabbit with an axe. haha

								This game is crazy fun. I didn't really like Dont Starve by itself because I found the solo a little dull. But this is much more interesting (and harder) as there are more mouths to feed and more resources required e.t.cGreat game to pick up and play. If it keeps getting updated then it is worth every penny.			"

-Quick Review-""Say pal, you don't look so good. You'd better find your best friend and burn down his stuff before he looks better then you."" Thus Don't Starve together was born!-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Don't starve was based on surviving long enough to escape the world you had been put into, now the enemy has a more familiar face... You can work with your friends to try to survive, or you can burn down their base.

								Sooo... Let's cut to the chase.. I love this game. A LOT. It's just so addicting. 10/10.You start up noob, knows nothing about this life. Prepare nothing just trying to survive the day.But as you play you learn things. Like how to not die silly. Make other stuff you never made before and figuring what it's for.Without wikia you're nothing lol. Not kidding.Trying so hard to surpass winter. But eventually, deerclops ♥♥♥♥ed everything. Then hounds. Lots and lots of hounds.♥♥♥♥ing doggie.♥♥♥♥ deerclops.♥♥♥♥ dragonfly♥♥♥♥ EVERYTHING!!Can't I live a normal and simple life, lounging at a siesta-lean-o???Must there be so many struggles in life.Life ♥♥♥♥s us harder in this game than in real life.But still... let's retry in xxx seconds.Just wished there's an in game voice chat.

								Don't Starve Together is nearly identical to Don't Starve, but includes Don't Starve's Reign of Giants DLC built in, along with multiplayer and some rebalancing to accomodate for multiple players. It's actually harder than Don't Starve itself is because now you have to divvy up your resources among multiple people, and if you don't communicate and co-ordinate, everyone's going to die (especially if randoms join your server just to grief).It's still in Early Access and they haven't added everything from Don't Starve, but it's totally playable and enjoyable.

												This game is so incredible. Simple but complex at the same time. The game has a lot of secrets btw,  just amazing. Once, I made a base where The Moose and Goose was going to spawn. I didnt know his nest was there. Spring arrived and there were 3 Gooses in my base, plus 3 eggs. When the egg hatched... Oh god, they started eating berries, everything on my base... Yeah, playing and learning ^^I couldnt kill 3 Gooses, it was too much for me... I had no choice but to share my base with them :/			"

								The gameplay may seem simple, but it's in that simplicity that it holds its charm. What might seem easy as first can quickly begin to seem like an enormous task as the burdens of living in the harsh land snowball onto your character and you can't keep up. The perma-death feature of the game can make death a traumatizing experience as the character you've so lovingly built up and kept alive for so long has now found it's way to a lonely grave, at the same time it leaves your mind whirring as the cog's and gizmos in your head try to learn from your last play through so that you can survive longer in your next. The re-playability is huge, there's always something to learn or do better the next time through. On top of that if you decide you'd prefer things a bit different from time to time there's always a huge selection of mods available for the game that offer a wide selection of features. Things as simple as adding in a new playable character based on the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 or changing the rules of how the game work can really spice up the gameplay. So, really give this game a go if you're into moody, strategic, action packed games that leave you twitching at every movement on the screen. It's my top pick of the year!			"

Cons: - Couldn't find any so far :)- Couldn't run fast enough to avoid a tallbird needs NOS incorporated ASAP xDI know this may not be very helpful since I bought the game yesterday but I'm loving it so far :)If you enjoy survival games and games of the sort look into this because it's really worth it and believe me when I say I searched numerous games and this one caught my eye.

								Don't starve for me was a perfect example how you should make a survival game. Most noticeable aspects of this game is it's artstyle which is unique. You need to keep yourself alive by being fed, sane and warm in a crazy world. Also have a light in the dark. This essentially the same game, only with other people and that completely removed a barrier for me and other people who couldn't get in to this game as much as they wanted because it was singleplayer. Frankly, this is the survival game worth getting and most likely to get finished, unlike certain early access survival games on steam.			"

												To start this game is amazing... Just plain a-maze-ing There's just no way you can see this game (if you already have Don't Starve) and not say ""Really TOGETHER..... I wonder what that would be like."" My only problem with this game is that it's just wierd if you don't have friends. BUT that is such an small problem that some people probly won't notice. Anyway the gameplay is just like Don't Starve and the creaters have basicaly change nothing exept some minor game bugs, some new things and monster stuff like that, and you can play with your friends (wich is good i'm not saying they should add more exept it might be cool but, yeah). So IF you have Don't Starve and can't wait for it to get out of early-access, you should buy this game and expirience surviving with your friends in the world of Don't Starve!			"

								Don't Starve was a gritty grind for survival that left you tired and miserable. With multiplayer, you can now be one of the determining factors in making other players tired and miserable. It's delightful, in a macabre and completely heartless kind of way. I disguise as a bush, and lash out with a spear at anybody who tries to rustle through my leaves for food. They either die, or are weakened, and subsequently finished off, by the biting cold or a wild dog or the evil omnipresent demon that lurks in the night.I don't recommend doing that though because you might learn a new swear word or three.Seriously though, this DLC is siphoning my life away. Top kek.			"

								Don't Starve. Before buying this, take note it is an Early Acess game, so bugs, crashes, are bound to happen.Out of the way, if this is your first time to Don't Starve Together, I recommend you play the single player version first (if you have it), so you can get used to it's original experience. Plus, DST is harder.Honestly, I'm not gonna say much, since this game is utterly Don't Starve but multiplayer, something that was demanded a long time ago by the fans.			"

												I love this game, it's incredibly fun to play with my friends when they're online. Recently however i've been permanently banned from the DST community hub just for voicing my opinion about this toxic community.Let me state this clearly though, as some people have not gotten the memo yet. IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THIS WITH FRIENDS AND ONLY FRIENDS, DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS REVIEW. PLEASE BUY THE GAME, YOU'LL THANK ME LATER#1: Furries   These ""people"" upload as much furry content to the workshop as they can. At least 50% of custom characters uploaded the Steam Workshop are these ""fursonas"" or whatnot. These bipolar toddlers are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disturbing as well. I recall once joining a server with said characters and seeing something along ""ohmygodddd it looks so hot XD"" in the chat, no I am not exaggerating. Say anything that these neglected kids have a differentiating opinion on and they'll introduce you to their fast typing skills of ""stfu"" or the classic ""YOU JUST CAN'T APPRECIATE THE FURRY COMMUNITY♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Furthermore, I posted this picture to the community hub:http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/366zzf (Furries everywhere)   Within half a week I was permanently banned from posting anything to the DST hub. And when I investigated by looking in the page source (They mods never specified why I was banned in the first place, funny) I found that I was banned for ""Offensive content and Spamming"". Neither of which is valid in any way at all. Most of the Furrys had the nerve to go on my profile and report a bunch of my other content. They managed to team up to take down all my Payday 2 posts, one of which had around 1,200 likes and was on the top Steam posts for about a week. To this day, a -year and a half- two years later my privileges are revoked on both hubs.Thanks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.#2: Kids   I'm fine with kids playing games, i'm going to clear that up right now. But when you have 7-9 year olds playing online, always asking you for ""flint pls"" or spamming ""xD"" in the chat it admittedly gets annoying after awhile. (Thanks the Klei for not adding voice chat I haven't gone completeky insane from these kids.) This is fine however as they usually keep to themselves or just tag along with a friend, but usually this is not the case. Don't expect to come across any kids with respect for you or anyone. They also like to follow you around and steal your loot, that's cool too.#3: Griefers   Remember that game Minecraft? Well, in that game the multiplayer servers had 'Griefers'. These people would go around and purposely destroy other peoples creations. But in this, these people will play as the character Willow who starts off with a lighter, they will then go around and set everything on fire making most servers unplayable knowing that all the resources have been destroyed. Unless the existing players have some sort of plant and tree seeds stored away, the server becomes unplayable as it has no wood or food. This happens to most servers without some sort of anti-grief feature. Luckily, more servers are adopting new anti grief mods. So this isn't too much to worry about.#4: Stupid people in general   I'm not saying everyone is, but a good majority of people in the community are. From ingame people asking all the time ""how 2 I get wood?/"", and the community putting useless guides and discussions in the community, it's damn annoying.To start off, ingame you're most likely to come acroos flat out stupid players. For example, this one time I found a pig village (An uncommon group of buildings that are accompanied by lots of food) I ran about 5 minutes to get to it, and I found a lot of berries enough to last me a few days. I then grab the berries and start walking away. Sooner or later come across the owner of the server and he said to me, (and trust me these were just about his exact words) ""wow you just took my berries"" Banned from the server, why? Because I took ""his"" berries. This was on an open public server. This is an uncommon example, but i feel like this game appeals to ""that"" demographic of kids, y'know? Like the Roblox/Minecraft/Unturned kids. Extrememly toxic and malicious kids. And the Steam community is much worse. If you go on the DST Community Hub right now, you'll see many Guides and Discussions made by little kids who don't know what the term ""proper english"" means. To be completely honest I could write a book longer than the entite Hunger Games book trilogy complaining about how damned this community is. Take a look for yourself, you'll see what I mean.   There's my rant about why this community is horrible. If you're a decent human being who; doesn't jerk off to animals, you're over 12, nice to people, and has actually had an education. You should pat yourself on the back, god thanks you. But still avoid this game.(I'm guessing everyone's going to flag this for ""offesive content and spam"", right?)Edit: 08/24/16Day 568, people are still getting pissy.Edit: 01/14/17Day 721, people are STILL pissy. Still banned.			"

								Amazing game!You can play this multiplayer OR single player!While the content is somewhat lacking for solo play in comparison too Don't Starve, playing solo is still an option for those who may not want to buy Don't Starve AND DST.As for multiplayer, there is so much that can be done, if you and your friends are new to the game, start with default settings and just see how long you can last. The first time through you may get caught of guard by the winter, and die half way through, but that's OK!!! Death is a thing that happens ALL THE TIME in this game, but it's never a soul-crushing defeat. When you finally get it down to a science, cool, it's time to mix it up! When hosting a match, you can change up the settings, making certain resources more scarce or bountiful, change the duration of the seasons, or even the starting season ( if you want hard-core setting, try starting with winter, and making berries / carrots more scarce)You can change the spawn rate for certain beasties to make it more challenging or more noob-friendly.Now, my last positive thing to say about this game revolves around their idea behind public matches. one of the most frustrating things for me when it comes to multi-player games is dealing with port forwarding and hosting. Thankfully, these guys make hosting SUPER easy!!! you set up your server in their fancy-dancy host option, click play, and BAM, you're hosting a server. no portforwarding or anything, no headache, just easy-peasy fun. Good luck to everyone, and i hope that this shed any light on the game!			"

								This is great game to play with friends or for couples! It has a very Tim Burton-esque vibe for those who are a fan of things that are a mix of creepy, cute, and full of depth. My boyfriend, who is a much more frequent gamer than me (I haven't really played many video games in the past 10 years), bought this game for me. It's easy enough that I could get into it, but difficult enough that its about equally challenging for the both of us. I would definitely reccomend this game for friends who want to play a game together, but have different experience levels when it comes to gaming, and definitely to couples who want to play a casual game together. Don't be surprised, however, when this game has you stressing out all over the place, trying to get through the harsh winters and nights. There will always be new things that can kill you. It's still a lot of fun though, as long as you're up for a challenge. Happy camping!			"

								Hiya, today im giving a review on the game, Don't Starve Together. This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!Don't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, ""The hounds are baying!"" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)Pros~Character Variety(Workshop Aswell)Art styleVoices are instrumentsNever endingLaughs and scares for all X3A fun coop gameCons~Can be very difficult at timesHackers do existFurries on WorkshopEverything will killTo sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :DAnd the game gets better and better after each update :)Buy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play. You won't regret this purchase at all :)			"

								If you've played the original Don't Starve and have been aching to play it with your friends, or random people, I highly recommend this game. This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to ""observe"" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to ""pull their weight,"" because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.If all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).Even though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve.			"

								Group wilderness death simulator.Much like its older sibling, Don't Starve, everything wants to kill you.The big difference is that now you have friends to share in your agonising death.Remember, you don't have to outrun the hounds, you just have to outrun your friends :D			"

												Day 28: Winter is approaching, we have a base with thermal stones, Science Machine, Alc. Engine, walls, a good 20 or so berry bushes, a fridge, some improved farms, me and a friend agree that we're set. All we need is some jackets and we're good to survive. My friend goes to hunt, I go to scavange the last few bits before we start our hibernation.Day 29: Things are good, I've gathered a full stack of berries and carrots, and my friends on a trail. We are making it through the winter.Night 29: The worst happens, it begins to rain. I should mention I'm playing WX, my friends playing Willow. I start taking damage from the rain and advise we make our way back to camp, but he's convinced he can finish his hunt in time.Day 30: Winter begins. It's raining heavy and we're both freezing. I'm back at camp and our thermal stones are cold. The fire is lit, but struggling. No sign of my friend, he's still on the hunt.Day 31: It's obvious he isn't returning, and the rain ain't leaving, so I start tracking him down, following the burned trees and picked berries. I'm gaining hope in finding him, but I take a dart. The rain already had me weak, and I drop dead, the thermal stones falling with me. Ironically, the rain stops right now.Day 32: My friend has looted me and is halfway back to base. It's here we decide to keep him alive through winter, and revive me once he's recovered sanity and health. He had make a jacket and all was good.Night 32: I still don't know what it was, all he said was he heard a thump, them bam. Our base has no walls, and the nightmares are attacking. He evades through a wormhole, but that only makes it worse. Day 33: Until I was able to be revived, I took a passtime of haunting everything I dropped back to base, and convincing my friend it'll be OK, and making inspirational speeches against death. Midway through the day, we're both dead.The world resets. We do it again.			"

								Hiya, today im giving a review on the game, Don't Starve Together. This game has its pros and cons of course, like any other game I will honestly rate it!Don't Starve Together is a game currently in Beta made off the game Don't Starve, you must survival the dark and twisted world. Weird giants and creatures all around, harsh weather conditions, the horrid wave of hounds you always forget about until you see the words, ""The hounds are baying!"" This game is definitly a game you want to try with friends or maybe on your own, you work together or not, and attempt survival. It is difficult at first to be honest, but as the game goes on it gets alot better :)Pros~Character Variety(Workshop Aswell)Art styleVoices are instrumentsNever endingLaughs and scares for all X3A fun coop gameCons~Can be very difficult at timesHackers do existFurries on WorkshopEverything will killTo sum up the game, I'd give it a 9/10, I play it with my friend Tori all the time and it's always fun, never ever do we get tired of playing it. We suck so we usually cheat. I don't like the hounds but you can turn them off, now they have gifts :DAnd the game gets better and better after each update :)Buy it even if it isn't on sale, I bought the 4 pack and gave some to friends to play. You won't regret this purchase at all :)			"

								If you've played the original Don't Starve and have been aching to play it with your friends, or random people, I highly recommend this game. This game is a lot of fun when it's played with friends because you guys get to decide on what type of adventure you guys want to get yourselves into because you can edit the world to your liking. Whether it be a world with scarce resources, monster-filled environments, or with just plain, set-to-default settings, it's still very fun! As a veteran player, I really like jumping into random games people host because I like to ""observe"" what the other veterans do (like hunting Koalefants/Tallbirds for their meats) and what the new players are trying to do (like killing five spiders, two of which are Spider Warriors, with a pickaxe), which, I have to admit, is very entertaining the majority of the time. There are some times, ESPECIALLY when the Winter season comes, where you just wish everyone that joined the game you're in knows what they're doing, or just able to ""pull their weight,"" because of scarce resources (many people make all sorts of personal tools and gear without gathering the materials themselves) and constantly dwindling food supplies (too many mouths to feed and not enough hunters). However, when your whole team DOES manage to make it past the first winter season, it's a very satisfying accomplishment.If all of what I previously said doesn't sound very appealing to you, then don't bother with the game. Frankly, if you like making a base JUST for YOURSELF, not liking the idea of being with other players, or just being antisocial in general, then you really wouldn't like the multiplayer addition to Don't Starve; this game is meant to be played with other people and working TOGETHER with said people (hence the emphasis on TOGETHER for DST's teaser), so you're seriously better off playing vanilla if you're just going to be antisocial in a social game. I don't want to sound mean, but it's the truth (at least it is for me).Even though the game is still in its Beta phase, it's very playable; the devs have done a great job so far and the updates just keep rolling in with fixes. Get it if you really want it, but if you can wait, then I recommend waiting for its official multiplayer release (around summer), of which is included (I THINK) in the original Don't Starve.			"

It's a lot of fun to forage around a world and gather supplies to make an awesome base and to keep you and your friends alive for all the monsters, seasonal changes and events that come your way.

								Grabbed this game because my sweetie pie suggested it would be a good game to casually play. Tips: 1. Its hard to be a vegetarian in this game 2. When someone catches a TALL EGG for you to hatch for a pet , don't eat the fawkin' egg3. If you're playing with 2 peoples, have someone cook food while the other creates stuff and thangs 4. I would include this game during the process  of screening someone whom is romantically interested in you. Test the waters with this game. Ladies , if they don't make you a fuggin' flower hat or some armor , get dat♥♥♥♥♥♥out. Same for you gents! If she cant help either mine up some material, fight off hordes of angry frogs by your side  or slave over the crock pot, say it's just you and gtfo .On your way from being a bottom feeder to having established a pretty secure rich land , this game will definitely make you lose track of time.

								This is great game to play with friends or for couples! It has a very Tim Burton-esque vibe for those who are a fan of things that are a mix of creepy, cute, and full of depth. My boyfriend, who is a much more frequent gamer than me (I haven't really played many video games in the past 10 years), bought this game for me. It's easy enough that I could get into it, but difficult enough that its about equally challenging for the both of us. I would definitely reccomend this game for friends who want to play a game together, but have different experience levels when it comes to gaming, and definitely to couples who want to play a casual game together. Don't be surprised, however, when this game has you stressing out all over the place, trying to get through the harsh winters and nights. There will always be new things that can kill you. It's still a lot of fun though, as long as you're up for a challenge. Happy camping!			"

												It's by far the best game i've ever played involving survival, If you are a person that prefers gameplay over graphics, Then this game is for you! I have no problems at all to report. And for those people who say this game has problems and it freezes, You are certainly wrong about the game having issues. The game it's self says that if you add mods Klei cannot help you if a problem occurs. Therefore I give this game a 10/10, Excellent game I recommend buying this game over any game.			"

												Fun! Staying alive and not starve with friends is always more fun because of the shared suffering.You can share resources, food, anything. Combine tasks and divide your foodstock with a simple ctrl-click of the mouse. You can, but you don't have to.Take more risks and get killed. Build your empire of laughs and fingerpointing together with your closest mates. Run away from big birds together. Get crazy together. No really, you'll be saying ""Here's Johnny!"" before you know it! (The Shining ref)Get separated and see side screen icons on the edge of the screen showing you where the other(s) are. stray out too far and see the icons dissapear, go search for them, tracking your way back.Or stay together, because THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME !?10/10 would get f**ked up together again.

								Why DST? Because Klei knows how to arouse your inner sadist by decorating the terrain with skeletons of previous victims, one of which you will soon become!So, in summary...Watch your friends die one by one! Watch that one loner with a dark sword brutally murder you and your friends! Watch that same guy burn your whole camp down with a torch! Watch your gang of friends become a group of wandering ghosts, relentlessly haunting any flammable objects in sight in hopes of setting them on fire! Wish upon a shooting star, just don't stand still for too long! Fight off Deerclops! Fight off Deerclops with your friends! Run away from Deerclops as he murders all of your friends! Eat your friend's corpse! Express yourself through emotes! Make new allies! Convert those new allies into newer enemies! Become that loner with the dark sword! But most importantly, watch the time; the next hundred hours will be the quickest ones in your life. I present to you the highly anticipated game, Don't Be-that-one-guy. Together. Or something.			"

								             Don't Starve Together is a awesome addition to the origonal game, gameplay makes sense and survival is very fun. One of the biggest problems in the origonal game was that there was very little replay value once you have mastered survival, though with this expantion there is always something new to discover.             I anticipated multiplayer ever since I first play Don't Starve, and I have to say this is a great addon. I recomend this game to people who have friends to play with and people that have no friends(sry about that) because there are tons of servers you can join at anytime. The mod support for this game is very cewl and allows for players to play their way, with friends or not. I highly recomend this game if you are a fan of the origonal and want a new experience.			"

								Grabbed this game because my sweetie pie suggested it would be a good game to casually play. Tips: 1. Its hard to be a vegetarian in this game 2. When someone catches a TALL EGG for you to hatch for a pet , don't eat the fawkin' egg3. If you're playing with 2 peoples, have someone cook food while the other creates stuff and thangs 4. I would include this game during the process  of screening someone whom is romantically interested in you. Test the waters with this game. Ladies , if they don't make you a fuggin' flower hat or some armor , get dat♥♥♥♥♥♥out. Same for you gents! If she cant help either mine up some material, fight off hordes of angry frogs by your side  or slave over the crock pot, say it's just you and gtfo .On your way from being a bottom feeder to having established a pretty secure rich land , this game will definitely make you lose track of time.

												First of all, i have been with this game for a very long time during early beta aswell as when they added a new charecter, This game is amazing. If you think you suck at this game or you think u arnt going to like it then try it, get good at it, if ur starting out get a couple of friends and host your own world. If u have gotten good at it and a bit bored with the game then get some mods in there! Mods are really helpful for beginners, like the No Death Penalty or Extra Equip slots. This game is honeslty ALL PROS, I am yet to see a con in this game, Its multiplayer, sigle player controllers work on this, its on sale while im writing this so its cheaper, you can make money off of selling items, its popular, There is always something u have to worry about making the game a bit challenging, it has fighting, bosses caves and custom worlds! If you have a bad spawn area you just move out of it to the next one! This game is TOP NOTCH, it is AMAZING. If you have a problem in this game and disagree with any of this comment on my profile and i will prove you wrong! The ONLY THING IS it DOES NOT DO SPLITSCREEN, they are working on that, give Klei a break people it litterly JUST GOT OUT OF EARLY AXCESS AND ITS AMAZING.

								this game.... this. game. i have nicknamed it '99 ways to laugh at you and your friends dying'  (as opposed to the single player version '99 ways to die'). and its so addicting!!! x.x Seriously though, it looks cool, its a hell of a lot of fun to play and will quickly make you wonder how surviving 20 days can steal away so many hours of your time. Its artsy, burtonesque, steampunk look is brilliant,  the crafting system makes sense (well mostly.. not sure when the last time was i made waffles with twigs >.>), and the utter randomness of things at times just makes you laugh out loud ... or perhaps that's just the insanity kicking in.  Add to that the ability to die with friends, or sometimes because of them, and we get a great survival game that will appeal to nearly anyone with a sense of humor and the love of a challenge. Highly recommend it!! 10/10			"

								This game really should be called, ""You're gonna die sooner or later"" because that's exactly what happens in this game. Why?- You can freeze to death.- You can starve to death.- You can die from insanity.- You can die because it's dark and you forgot a light source.- You can die for no reason other than you probably shouldn't have hit that beehive with an axe.Good job, you're dead.

												Huh, they actually did cosmetics very well. KudosIf you like survival management type dealios this is probably what you wantPro:This game can be pretty spoopy, but in no way is it a horror gameSimple Steam MultiplayerVery enjoyable alone, with friends, or even strangersLots of content to explore (Surprisingly this is more updated than Don't Starve as of me writing this review)Straightforward craftingSteam Workshop modsCosmetic items don't require you to spend any money unless you buy them from the marketCon:There's no endgoal, perhaps in a future update they will have something so stay tunedNot nearly as challenging as Don't StarveIf you like what you see then go ahead and get it, if it's not your thing, whatever.

								This game really should be called, ""You're gonna die sooner or later"" because that's exactly what happens in this game. Why?- You can freeze to death.- You can starve to death.- You can die from insanity.- You can die because it's dark and you forgot a light source.- You can die for no reason other than you probably shouldn't have hit that beehive with an axe.Good job, you're dead.

												First of all, I would like to thank Markus the gay rattlesnake - a friend of mine who gave me a key to this game. The amount of fun I'm having with this game is enormous, it takes coorporative survival to a whole new level. Don't Starve is an amazing game already, but turning it into an experience you can share has to be the greatest Idea sinse RoG.This just takes you through so many thrilling moments. From following Koelefant tracks in the cold♥♥♥♥♥winter to trying to get a Tallbird egg while the other one distracts the herd. The only thing this lacks is the updates ahead, I absolutely recommend this game! After all, what's the fun in starving alone?			"

								I really like Don't Starve together because of all the fun moments you can have with your friends while you try to survive. When i played the original game I died every time because of me being really slow with gathering resources. Now when i play together with my friends we have been able to survive for much longer than we usually do alone.The only negative thing is that you can't spot your friends on the map or anything.(that's why I love that you can mod the servers!)

								This game is very well balanced. The fighting system is rediculous for one person to handle, making it easy to see that the game is meant for two or more firends playing together. This multiplayer expansion proposes many new challenges, such as sharing food. The entire experience of Don't Starve is made even more enjoyable with the addition of multiplayer. I know  I will have too much fun with this expansion.Definitely worh the $5 now, even though the game will be free for Don't Starve owners post-beta.			"

								It's fantastic, there's new content that mixes up the multiplayer.  You can now divide up jobs amounst the players, gathering firewood, finding food, building the base, gathering manure, looking for biomes, you still never run out of things to do.  More arms to fight, but more mouths to feed.  Death results in a spooky ghost who can stick around until the other players sacrifice a bit of their health to craft a revival item.			"

								Don't Starve Together was released into Early-Access on December 15, 2014. I was lucky enough to get a beta key and I played before you could buy it. And I got to say, unless you have friends.... DON'T PLAY THIS VERSION. It seems everything is a little harder like enemies for instance. Then again playing with friends doesn't really help. It probably makes it harder until you get the hang of it. If this so far seems like a negative, it isn't. I actually love this game. The fact that Don't Starve could only add multiplayer to make it better is amazing. This game is great singleplayer, but it gets even better...Together.			"

												Don't Starve Together is a multiplayer standalone version of Don't Starve, with separate content being developed for it only. Developed by Klei, I found it to be a wonderful experience overall, but of course, multiplayer games are not without their kinks.Let's start with gameplay as usual. Don't Starve Together, as per its singleplayer predecessor, is a survival game with crafting and obtaining resources. Unlike most standard subpar survival games, the way it does this is rather unique in the environment and resources that you utilize. Let's get this out of the way: You will die. Several times probably. But unlike the singleplayer version, you can have other people help you learn the mechanics of the game. The modes of multiplayer can't really be boiled down to essential basics, as factors such as being able to hurt other players or not, or if players decide to be loners or want to team up and create bases will affect how the game will play out. As for more of the game mechanics themselves, they tend to be better off learned through experience or reading it up on the dedicated wiki regarding the game.In terms of graphics, this game presents a rather well-done artstyle, looking entirely hand-drawn and with many shading effects looking scribbled in. As well, this game should run pretty well on most modern computers, and even some not-so-modern, although if there are many many entities on-screen, several computers will suffer some sort of framerate loss. Along with this is an entirely-cosmetic... cosmetic system. Players can earn drops by playing on a server for somewhat-variable amounts of time, for up to four gifts a week, resetting sometime on Thursdays. The time it takes between each of the four drops of the week increases as each gift is obtained and resets along with the gifts as well. Cosmetics are ranked in rarity, so the usually more-desired Elegant or Distinguished items will be rarer and generally cost more on the market. Also in place is a trade-up system and utilizing nine of the same rank of item can be taken and transformed into one item of a higher rank.In terms of sound and music, the sound design is also well-done. The sound designer did essentially all of the sounds themself in a practical fashion, which I find commendable in this day and age. As for music, Don't Starve Together features a selection of instrumental tracks which play during periods of working activity, basic mob combat, or combat against large ""boss"" mobs, and variations dependant on the season currently in place. I personally encourage those that grow to be a fan of the music to find the album by Vince de Vera and Jason Garner and get that, although one will have to find the tracks added later elsewhere.Being a multiplayer game, I do stress that playing with others online can affect how you might feel about the game initially. Please do keep playing until you've had a proper and full experience! Thank you for reading my review, and if you do purchase this game, have fun! If you prefer a more isolated experience, you could opt to get the singleplayer version, Don't Starve, which also features a new DLC still exclusive to it, Shipwrecked!			"

												The game is a very nice edition to the Don't Starve itself and now that it's not a DLC anymore I see big potencial of what's to come in to the game. It already has good content and there is much more to come. I really enjoy playing it with my friends and alone also. If anyone likes playing survival games, but doesn't like playing them by themself I really recommend this game as you can join servers made by people that you don't know and play the game with someone new.Survive. Have fun. And most important. DON'T STARVE.			"

												First of all, I would like to thank Markus the gay rattlesnake - a friend of mine who gave me a key to this game. The amount of fun I'm having with this game is enormous, it takes coorporative survival to a whole new level. Don't Starve is an amazing game already, but turning it into an experience you can share has to be the greatest Idea sinse RoG.This just takes you through so many thrilling moments. From following Koelefant tracks in the cold♥♥♥♥♥winter to trying to get a Tallbird egg while the other one distracts the herd. The only thing this lacks is the updates ahead, I absolutely recommend this game! After all, what's the fun in starving alone?			"

								This game is very well balanced. The fighting system is rediculous for one person to handle, making it easy to see that the game is meant for two or more firends playing together. This multiplayer expansion proposes many new challenges, such as sharing food. The entire experience of Don't Starve is made even more enjoyable with the addition of multiplayer. I know  I will have too much fun with this expansion.Definitely worh the $5 now, even though the game will be free for Don't Starve owners post-beta.			"

								It's fantastic, there's new content that mixes up the multiplayer.  You can now divide up jobs amounst the players, gathering firewood, finding food, building the base, gathering manure, looking for biomes, you still never run out of things to do.  More arms to fight, but more mouths to feed.  Death results in a spooky ghost who can stick around until the other players sacrifice a bit of their health to craft a revival item.			"

								Don't Starve Together was released into Early-Access on December 15, 2014. I was lucky enough to get a beta key and I played before you could buy it. And I got to say, unless you have friends.... DON'T PLAY THIS VERSION. It seems everything is a little harder like enemies for instance. Then again playing with friends doesn't really help. It probably makes it harder until you get the hang of it. If this so far seems like a negative, it isn't. I actually love this game. The fact that Don't Starve could only add multiplayer to make it better is amazing. This game is great singleplayer, but it gets even better...Together.			"

								Alright. Listen here, and listen well, as I am only saying this once kiddos. You're probably going to die, even if you do well by yourself in the singleplayer version, YOU.WILL.DIE. It's a fact of this game. You can die a multitude of ways, whether it be from trying to save that one dumbass who doesn't understand the the beefalo will in fact, hit back, or the one who thinks it's a brilliant idea to try and tank a treegaurd with no armor. Maybe if you're on a public server and someone joins and takes all your food, one way or another, you will probably die. And it's awesome.			"

								It is a really fun game, to play with friends, or with yourself (make a server and just play by yourself). Might be helpful to get in a call with buddies (Skype) to communicate because if you are being attacked, you can't get reinforcments by typing in chat (I have experienced this dilemna, and its not fun). I love this game because its funny when my buddies and I panic when hunger gets down and the health is on the edge of depleting fully. I don't like how they set up how to look for servers. It takes time to get used to finding your friend's server, but it's totally worth it! :) Its also nice when you get the game, it comes with another copy to send to a friend.			"

												First of all, I would like to thank Markus the gay rattlesnake - a friend of mine who gave me a key to this game. The amount of fun I'm having with this game is enormous, it takes coorporative survival to a whole new level. Don't Starve is an amazing game already, but turning it into an experience you can share has to be the greatest Idea sinse RoG.This just takes you through so many thrilling moments. From following Koelefant tracks in the cold♥♥♥♥♥winter to trying to get a Tallbird egg while the other one distracts the herd. The only thing this lacks is the updates ahead, I absolutely recommend this game! After all, what's the fun in starving alone?			"

								Don't Starve Together was released into Early-Access on December 15, 2014. I was lucky enough to get a beta key and I played before you could buy it. And I got to say, unless you have friends.... DON'T PLAY THIS VERSION. It seems everything is a little harder like enemies for instance. Then again playing with friends doesn't really help. It probably makes it harder until you get the hang of it. If this so far seems like a negative, it isn't. I actually love this game. The fact that Don't Starve could only add multiplayer to make it better is amazing. This game is great singleplayer, but it gets even better...Together.			"

								It's fantastic, there's new content that mixes up the multiplayer.  You can now divide up jobs amounst the players, gathering firewood, finding food, building the base, gathering manure, looking for biomes, you still never run out of things to do.  More arms to fight, but more mouths to feed.  Death results in a spooky ghost who can stick around until the other players sacrifice a bit of their health to craft a revival item.			"

								This game really should be called, ""You're gonna die sooner or later"" because that's exactly what happens in this game. Why?- You can freeze to death.- You can starve to death.- You can die from insanity.- You can die because it's dark and you forgot a light source.- You can die for no reason other than you probably shouldn't have hit that beehive with an axe.Good job, you're dead. Now your survival partner(s) must try to revive you before they go insane. Oh? They're starving AND it is the middle of winter? Well, I sense a server restart in your near future.On another server, you could have PvP enabled. Oh good, you're starving but they have food? HAH, not anymore! Unless they kill you, or you lead a pack of very angry bees into your new ""friend's"" camp and you both die. The possibilities are endless, but sooner or later, you'll die anyway. It's inevitable, and that is why I'll keep playing.Is the game impossible? No, but does that mean surviving over 123 days makes you invincible? Nope, I still died anyway. Why? Lol... I accidentally lit myself on fire.			"

								I really like Don't Starve together because of all the fun moments you can have with your friends while you try to survive. When i played the original game I died every time because of me being really slow with gathering resources. Now when i play together with my friends we have been able to survive for much longer than we usually do alone.The only negative thing is that you can't spot your friends on the map or anything.(that's why I love that you can mod the servers!)

								Don't Starve Together. I remember I spent two whole days playing this, non stop. It's really fun! Infact I still play it today. I can't stop playing it. I love the atmosphere, music, players, enemies, magic (ESPECIALLY MAGIC :D), etc. The community also helps make this game even more fun by creating mods for the game itself. I would help create modss, though I am not good at that ._.There isn't anything I can really say about this game that is bad. Everything is so perfect! Though there is one problem. From my experience some of the ancient biomes are not in the game, no matter how many times you create a new world. I loved these biomes but they aren't in here. Or at least I have yet to actually get to one of them. So if that could be added. Awesome!Overall this game is a 9/10 for me.			"

								An adorable, challenging, and interesting game. From simple tools like an axe and a shovel, to magical items and powerful weapons, this sandbox lets you explore a beautifully creative world where imagination reaches a whimsical, yet nightmarish peak.

												First of all, i have been with this game for a very long time during early beta aswell as when they added a new charecter, This game is amazing. If you think you suck at this game or you think u arnt going to like it then try it, get good at it, if ur starting out get a couple of friends and host your own world. If u have gotten good at it and a bit bored with the game then get some mods in there! Mods are really helpful for beginners, like the No Death Penalty or Extra Equip slots. This game is honeslty ALL PROS, I am yet to see a con in this game, Its multiplayer, sigle player controllers work on this, its on sale while im writing this so its cheaper, you can make money off of selling items, its popular, There is always something u have to worry about making the game a bit challenging, it has fighting, bosses caves and custom worlds! If you have a bad spawn area you just move out of it to the next one! This game is TOP NOTCH, it is AMAZING. If you have a problem in this game and disagree with any of this comment on my profile and i will prove you wrong! The ONLY THING IS it DOES NOT DO SPLITSCREEN, they are working on that, give Klei a break people it litterly JUST GOT OUT OF EARLY AXCESS AND ITS AMAZING.

												Well, alot of gag reviews but i'll try and make mine a bit serious.Don't Starve Together puts you in a radomly simulated world with various resources. The goal: Survive.Although that might seem easy, the game amps up in difficulty with anything from bosses to hounds that spawn periodicaly to ♥♥♥♥ over your run. The pros:Great game to play with friends, Laughs were, and will be had. Beautiful artistic design. Amazing survival simulator without being overly serious.Great modding community. Runs on any potato. Great diversity; you always come back.The cons:No real progression system, if you like quests, this isn't the game. Seems hard or unfair at times, although this changes with experience. The hounds are easily managable but for new players the seasonal bosses RoG (reign of giants) adds are just rediculous. Playing together makes the game harder in terms of food as all of it is split. Even with good internet it can be hard to get prestine connection, which is important for kiting. All in all Don't Starve Together is an incredible game, worth the price, especially if on sale. It can be a bit rough, but with a couple friends and the wiki, learning it stops becoming annoying but fun. The fighting mecaniques in the game are very odd when comming from something like Terraria or Minecraft but work very well. The game is overall extremely polished and offers at least 50 hours of play.  "

												I've loved the art for this title since the base games inception and I promise that this version, while missing a few story features, still carries all of the love and charm.   In my opinion, ever since I played Don't Starve in alpha state on Google Chrome, I felt like it would be a fantastic co-op or even versus experience and the steam numbers don't lie, everyone loves Don't Starve Together!  Every character is unique and those specialties are even more colorful in multiplayer as you can take on different roles that you are suited for in your co-op or group play.   If you enjoyed Minecrafts vanilla survival experience but now want a much deeper and more challenging adventure, take the leap and jump into the world of DST!Note: from here on out (since launch) the base game and Don't Starve Together will have diverging content updates which means that there will be content not included from the base game and vice versa.Note: in the description it is called ""expansion"" but it is entirely a seperate game, you don't need the original game to play this. Note: for multiplayer it says (Co-Op) but you can't share screens and you need 2 versions of the game.Note: game uses Steam Workshop, so you can download tons of mods and that includes some modded in characters from the original game's new expansion ""ShipWrecked"".Note: difficulty is VERY high, but that is the ""point"" of the game of which is literally called ""Don't Starve""...they mean it.Despite its challenge, I recommend this game for all ages and interests.  It's not unlikely to die your very first night playing the game, and then the second night, and then the third...but that is the point of the game and once you start diving into this dark and twisted world,  I promise you will find adventure as well as a new tickling, creeping sensation to jump once again through the portal into the Codex Umbra...FOR SCIENCE!

First spawn in game. Starved. Died alone. And miserable.Second spawn. Starved. Died with a friend. Not so miserable anymore......N spawn. Not starved (too much). Died but got revived by friend. Friend died. I revived friend. We both died. Almost happy ending (no massage included). Will N+1 spawn for sure!Fun fact: have you seen a titan done in by frog rain? Is AWESOME!Also beware of nighttime Koalefant: horridly sounds like old people making out!Cool tips: always invite a poor, lonely, shriveling-under-the-winter's-winds Deerclops traveler in your base - is the humane thing to do. Beefalo in heat is the friendliest beefalo around, go pet it right now. Be a good host, offer nice meatballs (or any meats for that matter) to friendly cave-dwelling Bunnymen, they will surely appreciate you for it. Best time to visit Pigmen is under the gentle light of a full moon, super-fun guaranteed! Eat lots of rot to stay healthy, as Glommer goop is good for sanity, gulp on it like there's no tomorrow (and trust me, most of times nor will it be). Plus here's a hungry Spider Warrior to keep you safe! (if playing Webber take campy Warrior Pig instead) Friendship is magic and always ends well! *wink-wink*Conclusion: I uber-recommend this game, best multiplayer (subjectivity overload) tested so far! Even if burtonesque artwork is not your cup of tea, whimsical comedy, layered depth (tons of stuff to build, do, crazy mobs to whack and watch whacking themselves, friendly graphical interface, mods etc), assured entertainment and generally welcoming community surely will be. Still a small warning: it has a bit of a learning curve, but nothing that cannot be overcome with some practice and/or a good guide.PS: every week, playing the game like a maniac enough time, you get up to 4 skins[dst-skins-checklist.firebaseapp.com] (for characters, props etc) aka nice customization and/or marketable stuff - ole bonus of further game addiction!

								Think you've found yet another survival game? Guess again! This game will test you in many ways, are you cunning enough to save up for winter? Or brave enough to fight a giant monster that fills half your screen? Would you die for your friends? Well I'd figure as much. Don't worry though, you are prob'ly still new to the game when you read this so bear with me. When you start the game you can pick a character of your liking, some are better at adventuring, others will be good fighters, while others will shine more at building a proper base. Though some will pick Wess and make a lot of balloons. Anyways after you enter the Jury Rigged Portal you'll emerge yourself in the Don't Starve World, luckily your friends (if you have brought some) will join you in the same spot. The key thing is finding resources to craft with, if you don't craft you will not last long in this game. From an axe to a fire staff, much is possible indeed. You will start with collecting the nearest recources, see a lot of cute bunnies, bees and butterflies and maybe even some pigs. Though not everything you see will be friendly.. After spend the first day collecting you will have to make a warm fire to keep yourself warm and keep the monsters away. ""Wait did he say 'monsters'?"" Well yes I did, allthough it's better not to mention to much about them right now. I don't want to scare you, that's all.If you survive day 1 without burning, killing, starving yourself let me know. We should really play together sometime, I might learn a thing or two from you ;)Pro's:+ What's more fun then starving alone? You've guessed it, starving together!+ Original art.+ Stable connection, I've played fine with 4-5 people.+ You can host and edit your own server.+ High replayability, I've played over 90 hours and I'm still seeing new things and learn new tricks.+ Much updates, the developers work to make this game better each day!Cons:- Not for the faint of heart.- I'm scared of the dark.- Friends might rage sometimes.9.5/10			"

So rogue-like even in multi-player it continues to hold that rogue-like aspect! *sniff* I've never played an indie game like this. 10/10. I hold this game near and dear to my heart. *sniff* It's given so much to me and now I want to give back to it by making mods for it! These mods will be great! Believe me! *sniff* And we can all band together to build a wall and keep those filthy dogs out! *sniff* Write-in nominate this game for the ""Best Game Ever"" award and we can make Don't Starve Together great again! (Even though it already is great)			"

								Playing this game with friends is fun.  Collect foods, resourses together and craft items to survive.  The feeling is a bit like playing minecraft, but the survival elements in this game is even better than minecraft.  So, I really like this game.However, something has to be improved / fixed:- Controller / gamepad is still not available to use in this game- There is still no way to share the map with other players.If these problems can be fixed as soon as possible, it will be a perfect game.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E31 Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together 

			Views: 179		

			Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety.		

Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety. Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.But, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.So as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.My only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap. I personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!TL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together! -Double Thumbs Up from Royial			"

Klei made Don't Starve even better with Don't Starve Together!This is a multiplayer game, and in my opinion the community is what really makes or breaks the experience. For new players, please refrain from using phrases like, ""Where is base?"" the moment you enter a server. We know that you are new and we are more than willing to help, but please understand that this is a game where you learn and build upon your mistakes. Instead, ask for tips on what to do and what to prepare for and try to survive on your own! Veterans will respect your curiosity and independent attitude. These are the type of players we want to build a base with since we are all able to take care of ourselves.Also, realize that this is a slow paced game in the sense that you will have to commit a lot of time just to experience everything. To even complete a full cycle of the seasons will take you hours, with many challenges along the way. More often than not, players who are unprepared for the obstacles will end up dying multiple times in a course of a play through. With that being said, go out there, explore, be curious, have fun, and most importantly, don’t starve!			"

								What makes a great game like Don't Starve better? Why playing with friends of course. Journey into the world of Don't Starve with up to 5 friends in Don't Starve Together. This standalone expansion brings with it a whole new style of play to explore the strange and wonderful world of Don't starve.If you are not familiar with the gameplay of Don't Starve, the concept is simple. Your character is dropped in the middle of a strange wilderness and you must use your wits and whatever else you may have brought with you to survive. Don't starve Together removes some of the story of the original, but the basic concept remains the same. You, and your friends, are dropped through a portal into a random area of the procedurally generated map. You are immediately tasked with finding the basic resources to survive. With the day and night clock running, you need to do so quickly before the darkness sets in, and you are relatively helpless.This is where the sense of balance from the original game can sometimes feel off. The original game has enough resources scattered around the spawn areas for you to usually be okay the first night or two so long as you are careful. You have only one mouth to feed, and a small pool of skills to use depending on which character you have unlocked, and in play. With Don't Starve Together, you are open to choosing from among the entire cast of eclectic characters from the original game, and the DLC, Reign of Giants. This early access to all the characters gives an interesting chance to mix and match various skills together to see if they can coexist. This process however is often hit and miss, as the resources available early on, are much different than what you would find in the single player game. This often means that you spend a lot more time harvesting basic items like food, as you need to travel farther to collect enough for two or more mouths to feed.When you do find a good balance of skills between your characters the game shines. For instance mixing Wigfrid's combat skills and good starting armour with Wickerbottom's smarts allows you to quickly build an advance base and defend if you work together well. And yes, all the playable character's names start with 'W'. Pick the wrong combination however, and even good teamwork can lead to frustrating death, upon death.Really though, this game is meant to be played with friends. The game worlds available to drop into are varied, and many run with different settings and mods and figuring out how to survive with strangers, or just avoid them and make your own spot in the world has it's moments. When it comes down to it however, the best aspect of Don't Starve Together is going in with a group of friends and experiencing the weird and wonderful world. With a good set of friends, the general wit and humour of Don't Starve, it's impossible not to have fun, even when one of your friends accidentally dies after running directly into a wolves den, or opening a mysterious chest that suddenly begins winter.Graphically there is no difference between either version of Don't Starve. Don't Starve together however includes the full content of the original game's DLC as well as some new items, creatures and biomes to explore. The game runs relatively smooth, with only a minor amount of lag up to the 6 player limit. Though it is possible to allow more players onto a server, the game becomes unplayable due to lag, and latency issues.The Dev team at Klei Entertainment are quite active, and as this game is still officially in beta I am sure they will iron out the balance wrinkles. They may even be able to expand past the 6 player maximum. If you enjoyed Don't Starve, there is absolutely no reason why you won't enjoy Don't Starve Together. For new players to the game, it gives a unique opportunity to work with others to learn the mechanics, or have a friend help you start off. Overall this is a great addition to this game's universe and I can't wait to jump in with my friends and play some more. "

												Don't Starve Together, hmmm, what to say about something as simple as not starving? Oh wait! I know!! This game is actually really fun to play, work together with friends to survive a fun little worlds full of creepy monsters and night time hours that kill you if you do not have a light source. There is allot of things to find and fight in DST, from murderous frogs too GIANT monsters, and rampaging dogs that come every 12 days.How hard could not starving be? Surprisingly you can die really fast in this game even if you bump up the resourses of your server. Pkus what else makes this game amazing is the modding community. Some mods you can just scroll past and forget exist but most of the mods on the community are amazing and can bring more life too the already great game.I highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone			"

												Very fun game to play with friends (or solo!). Unique art style survival game, with fun crafting and gameplay. Lovely cast of characters to choose from. I love that you can play casually, or tweak the server settings to make it more challenging. Worth the pickup (especially if on sale!) Great replay value. I take a break now and then but always come back to play when I've enticed a friend to join.			"

								Never played don't starve. Together is more fun with friends, especially boyfriend/girlfriend.Survival game needs wide views and arranging things with strict plans. This game is harder and leans to survival not creation. So it nearly cannot build a bright new house like MC or Rust.Recommand for the lovely characters and scene.Recommand: 1 When creating a new world, increase the beffalo number! In case that the map only have 2 beffalos. (Crying me).2 Adding some useful mod might not affect the balance of game. "

 Facts	You start as one of the characters who have their own special abilities, perks and stats. You start near a gate in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to gather a bunch of stuffs and know how to hunt animals, use traps and know how to farm in order to survive easily. But if you f*ck one thing up, you'll have to restart from the beginning.  Or just find a way to respawn.	 My opinions	In my opinion, it's fun but a bit repetitive. It's better if you play with friends WHO KNOWS how to make good decisions and knows a lot about the game but of course you and your friends can start together and learn about this game together. The default settings is too hard for you. You can change it if you don't mind it. Personally I won't be satisfied if I make the game easier with the world customization but there's a lot of things that are pretty dissapointing in the default settings like for example,  hound attacks happens too early and they're too hard to defeat if you have no viable weapon to use to kill them,  After an hour of building your survival camp, you still can die at any moment. You'll have constant pressure from everything like Hunger, Sanity, hound attacks, rain and the fact that you have to do everything at once. And what if you forgot to do one thing and something is coming to you? You'll be screwed and in order to not waste any more time, you'll have to re-create a new world and try again or just try and fight back if you don't take games too seriously like me... Verdict	I rate this game [.68 / 1] personally... But if I can only rate this game by the quality of it and not involve my personal opinion about it, I would rate it [.89 / 1]. This is why I recommend it. I don't like it as much as the average players do, but I sure do know a lot of you will like it.			"

								This game... Wow.It's awesomely fun.Characters are in-depth, experiences are all different... Man.To truly explain why I enjoy this game, here's a little story:So my friend, I'll just say X, had been playing for, eh, an hour or two. We never got passed day 4 since we suck.So X dies on day 1. For fun, I decided to continue playing. After 4 rough days of survival, things were going alright...Until I forgot to build a fire fast enough.Suddenly, I get smacked three times. Due to my characters low HP, one more smack would destroy me. I quickly equipped a torch. Due to my damage taken at night, I had now lost all sanity. Things got spooky. Like really spooky.I somehow survived for three more days with one HP and low sanity... But the last day was when I died on purpose out of pure fear.As night descended, I quickly built a fire and waited there. Eyes were blinking all over the shadows. I had done this twice, so I didn't think it could get worse. But boy was I was wrong. Suddenly, creepy music began playing, like something from an old music box. This shadowy hand then extended itself from the shadows, reached over to my campfire, and suddenly my fire went out. Daytime then arrived.Literally super scared, I found a shadow monster and let it kill me to end the terror.I'm now super determined to never go insane just because of that. Was... spooky for sure.

												I've never been good at writing anything, so here goes my first serious Review.To the point: This game is good if you like having big goals/ or would like to make friends. 9.5/10-FRIENDS-I've made many friends in this game, some of them are even my besties now. A friend introduced me to this game, a friend helped me through this game, and a friend showed me to a group of friends I will never forget. This game will enhance your best experience with friends as you fight, survive, and thrive in the wilderness.-GAMEPLAY-Don't Starve Together is a classic survival with many challenges. I'm sure you know most of the basics like ""don't starve, don't eat this, and don't hug the shadow right? Let's skip that. There is a lot more to surviving than building spectacular bases, raiding the ruins (Mid-Endgame stuff), creating farms, and setting goals. There comes a time however when Don't Starve Together gets repetitive. You could fix that with the large amount of mods available in the Workshop, or try to set goals for yourself. Here, I'll give you some to work with...-Raid the ruins by winter.-Fight all the bosses in a run.-Set Tusks to more or lots.-Long term Ruins base.-Build a huge wall separating a piece of land.-Play PvP with friends or strangersHOWEVER... HOWEVER HOWEVER HOWEVER...This game has faults as well. As you know, some people are complete bum bums, and they try to ruin the fun like in most multiplayer games. This game has griefers. These terrible little creatures are fueled by the salty tears of the people who got their base ransacked by these little demons. Basically they can burn your base to ashes, smash it to pieces, steal, destroy, and just tear it apart with ease. There are also other types of bum bums which are very rude to others. This community is not perfect, but the risk makes it worth the reward.Now if you're planning on buying this, you should probably know some Don't Starve Together gamer terms.PK - Pig King (The Gold giver)DF/DFly - DragonFly (Boss of the desert)Griefer - Despicable creaturesKiting - Dodging an enemy and hitting it too.AG - Ancient Guardian (Boss of the ruins)Deer - Literal Deer, not Deerclops.Tstone - Touchstone (A 1-up basically)Quarry - A biome full of rocksMosaics - A mix of turf and biome. Usually includes a rock biome inside and a pet cave.PK Forest - The Forest surrounding Pig King, Autumn colours.Roll - To roll a die. do '/roll' and you can roll a number between 1-100. You may edit this as well. For example: /roll 10D10000. The maximum roll you can do.My goal for this review is to get you ready for this game, and hopefully I succeeded in that. "

								Don't Starve Together is still a work in progress, but it's quite stable and much, much, more fun playing with friends! The mod system isn't perfect and some players can't use certain mods unless your the host of the server. There aren't many mods in the workshop yet either, but more will be added in time. This is comparing to the originial don't starve mods so it's actually not bad at all. There are lag problems which led to many restarts, but overall it's stable enough to play and lots of fun!

												This is a survival game set in a world full of things that can kill you. Yeah , that's right. Survive as long as you can while you care about hunger stats , health and sanity... WITH FRIENDS ! The game is extremely challenging since it's pretty easy to die. It is a very fun experience to play with friends. They still do updates , so yeah - I do reccomend it , but only if you have friends to play it with! 10/10 I really like the visuals , the unique art style and the soundtrack is simply amazing and fits the atmosphere.

												First off, I never ever think anyone should buy any unfinished video game. Don't buy this game until the release comes out. Why? Because Towns, Starbound, Cubeworld, etc.I should also note that I left Don't Starve a very negative review, and I still stand by that review. Don't Starve was brutally hard, unsurvivable, and just not fun.However, Don't Starve Together is different.I think this game has a decnet chance of being great when finally released. With a determined group of starving friends, if everyone cooperates (and Willow doesn't burn everything down), you can gather enough resources and fend off hunger long enough to build a small base, set up some farms, and maybe survive winter. You can even have a little fun doing it.Don't Starve Together still has a long way to go from being a single player game to a good multiplayer game. There are significant technical issues which still need to get worked out. Development has also been painfully slow. I don't expect a final release for another 3-5 years. YEARS.PS: Remember when they said there would be no multiplayer? This is why those who say it can't be done should not be allowed to stop those who are doing it. Also why some people need to be slapped up the face.http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/4073-multiplayer/ "

								A little weird to me that you either wait for the launch of this game to get don't starve together, or get a free copy of it at launch when you own the game. These games typically are a bit weird because you never get an unfinished copy of it until it's done. However it is a quirky little fun game that's 2D. Typical old school point and click type game for movement where you point and click on floor. Movement is a weird because of the graphics and the character gets stuck or has problems moving around things at times in order to pick things up. Could use more work. The devs actually put out updates and fix things. They have been timely with caring and tending for their game. This is your typical survival game. You can actually beat it in adventure mode but it is very short and not much gameplay is offered there. You can build but it is very limitted. No roof's or shelters for you either. You can make things like umbrellas but you will never have true shelter other than building a fence. The fences are not durable and there are no gates available. It's a chore constantly breaking things to get in and out of your fenced area. Storage isn't good. Crafting storage takes a lot of wood and offers very little space. You end up crafting 30 or more just to keep your things stored. You can't really build too much and you can't rely on farming because in the winter nothing grows. You can survive from animals you hunt or stored rabits as well as other things here and there like birds. Provided, that you prepared and stocked up on items to survive. The game offers seasons which may or may not make things a tad more difficult due to weather changing. Food will spoil quickly even in a craftable ice box. I suggest storing rabits with traps you made to catch them in storage chests so you can avoid the spoiling of food through the winter. Each storage chest can hold up to only 9 items. The idea is get what you can and survive while preparing for winter. Collect and gather resources and craft items to survive or play adventure mode and survive. At night if no light is made by you, you will die and just about anything else can kill you as well. Fun for a few hours but not enough to keep you busy for months. I pop in and out of it as new things become available. Several mods for this edition of the game as well as the original version of the game. Recommended for short gaming sessions for those who want a much easier and funnier survival game. There are ways to avoid death by crafting armor or touching a touching stone or getting supplies to make magic items non stop that can aid you to stay alive. But if not prepapered you will die and have to restart your game again as there is perma death. However in this version of the game you can come back to life if you have your settings set for that. This version is almost the same as the original version of the game but allows for playing with other people you pick or with randoms. You can very easily play with other people with little to no hassle or set up on your end. You do not need to deal with port forwarding settings which makes this co-op experience more attractive to newbies. Their wiki for the game is a bit weird to use and no search bar is even provided so I suggest just reading forums or talking with their community for help or ideas. Although it is not really needed as they game shows you what you can and can not craft. Making it so much easier rather than playing a survival game where you have to be glued to a wiki page because the game failed at teaching you anything or showing you what you could and couldn't do. I am really liking the games that clearly show you what is going on and what you can make. Enjoy! :)			"

												Although not for everyone, Don't Starve Together is a masterful combination of art and gameplay. By adding multiplayer to their largely successful title ""Don't Starve,"" the original becomes better than ever before.As I mentioned, this game is not for everyone. People who enjoy shooter games will not find joy in playing this game. It's a game that requires patience and good habits (checking your food, health, sanity.) As a casual gamer, I find this game to be a blast. It's exiciting and fun, and each time you start it up, it's a brand new experience. I know that I will be playing this game a lot in the near future.			"

												As someone who hasn't played the single player version that much I still wholeheartedly recommend this game. You are going to get the most out of it with at least three friends. Talking and planning is essential here – maybe you will see your buddies in a new light after a few hours of a desperate battle against the many odds the game throws against you. Beware: human emotions tend to go haywire in dangerous situations. You'll know what I mean if you ever built – what you thought was – a reasonably stable ecosystem only to completely be bamboozled by some irresponsible action of a friend.Life will be tough but it's addicting. Especially together!+ realistic simulation of being lost in the wildernis with your friends. (=you die)+ lovely graphics+ the well goes deep: there's much to explore+ endless replayability+ intuitive gameplay (this one's a must)+ stuff gets patched and refined regularly+ you can burn forests!- main menu is a bit confusing to use with the controller- you may lose a friend or two- you can burn your campNomitated this game for the “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award.

Since i have a groep of 5 people, this is a great game to play with my friends. The game is challanging and forduses you to work together with your friends, so it isn't just one good player who will have to take care of everyone. overall a great game espacially for the price.

								I think this game will be amazing when it's ready for release. The Beta is doing so much better, performance and content -wise than I had hoped. It's all the horror and danger from before, but with the advantages of sending your husband to fetch cut grass for you while you set up camp. Then again, you might play with strangers and wonder why they plant trees right on top of your campfire every time you cut them down, or why they go AFK long enough to starve to death and literally drive you insane.All in all, the new dimension provided by other people is awesome. I can't wait until we can hit the caves. Maybe I'll finally get to do that Ancient stuff with someone around to watch my back?!Current con: ...the... lag. Rubberbanding when I play with strangers gets me killed. A lot.			"

								Ever wished Tim Burton was a game developer? Wish basically ♥♥♥♥ing granted. The art style, the monsters, and the creepy little sayings you'll observe in this game are very reminiscent of the whimsical creep master and his amazing films. Have no idea who Tim Burton is? Well, first of all, how dare you. Second of all, you'll still love this game. There is never a lull in forward momentum. You will always need to be doing something, you will always be fighting for survival. Whether it's against starvation, monsters, the weather, or the darkness itself. Something will always be waiting to kill you. Always.In a word? Addicting.10/10.			"

												This is the absolute best isometric survival game that you can play with your friends, at least in my opinion anyway, just look at the average reveiws for recent and all time... overwhelmingly positive, that is making a statement on its own, but this game isn't easy, it really ain't, dont go into it thinking that it wont be that hard, at first you are only likely to last 3-7 days, and then when you have properly learnt the game, 20+ is normal, the mods are great (although most of the character mods look♥♥♥♥♥♥because they are in a differant art style to the game, which is really dumb on the artist/author of the mods) i have only ever crashed once in 40 hours and that was because of a broken mod (stackable rabbits just in case you wanted/needed to know) but i got back in the game and just disabled it and it worked fine again. if i could, i would force people to play this if they like survival games. :steamhappy:			"

As the entire base is razed to the ground, a wave of hounds shows up and kills everyone who is trying to put out the fire.2 days later, after small backup base is being built, a Deerclops shows up and slaughters everyone.10/10 for never ""winning"" or being bored (at least when other players are involved)			"

								This games lived to be miles above my expectations. With an extraordinary art style, unique game play and tactical thinking. You're not only trying to survive but you're trying to beat your own preious goals each time you begin a new server. Every day that passes you and your friends scurry off trying to gather as many supplies for the winter (and days ahead) and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot. The multiplayer element really makes the game just as enjoyable as the single player version. With friends you're able to set goals and tasks to each person and team up in combats. PVP is a ""hunger games"" like experience. Seeing another player is frightening but an opportunity to team up and take on the server.Modding for this game is highly accessible and easy to implement. The host of each server controls modding, so whatever mods they have installed, they will be the only ones avalible to use. Un-modded servers are available, however if you havn't played the single player version of Don't Starve I wouldn't recommend joining any un-modded serves. The game requires some getting used to and practice.As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body. Highly reccomended, good luck and Don't Starve.			"

								Remember the first time you go camping, and you're really excited, but then you realize that you forgot to bring food? That's what this is. Except you have the feeding times of an infant. Even if you manage to make a camp and you and Spazz321 have resources to last a few days, you end up having to sneak food when he's not looking and cause rivalry. Eventually he dies, becomes a ghost and scares the ♥♥♥♥ outta you in the middle of the night, but it's fine because you can craft things that can revive him, just so you can both repeat the process until he angers a group of frogs and ♥♥♥♥s you both over.                                              2/10 would play with Spazz321 Again                                                      11/10 would play with someone who doesn't like poking a spiders nest again.

								Hello everyone, this reveiw is not just speaking of my opinion of this game, but my mates as well!Don't Starve is one of many of our favorite games on PC/Steam. We were having lots of fun with this game until one day: Don't Starve Together Beta confirmed everyone! As soon as the game was open to the public we received it for we already had Don't Starve. We were so happy that this happened, I didn't start playing until some of my m8's wanted to play. So I started hosting a game and we're having so much fun 7 hours into the game. We've also got mods on it to make it even beter! Since it's still in Beta it is a little buggy but we're okay with it. It took me a little while to make and account because the Email wasn't received till later the day I signed up. But we got there in the end, the mods we've downloaded helped with some issues with lag and glitches, and we also got some of our old favorites from the original Don't Starve so we're pretty happy about that.At times can be a challenge but yet a simple game, I'm not yet used to the attack style of the game yet but I'll get there, I'm more used to first person shooters, but I'm not gonna go there.... You choose a charecter and spawn in to a brand new world, your arn't yet to know what is expected to happen, but around the 9-10th night be ready, for there is a band of wolves that will come your way! Also to fans and friends and other people the game dosen't take that much to run, easy to handle and a great game! I will also be recording this game with some mates after some time in the near future, so be sure to check that out when I do. Thanks for reading and I will leave a little ranking of the game below! I rate/rank this game 9/10 for now, when all the glitchy stuff is fixed and it is out of Beta I will be giving it higher! =)			"

								Easily the most enjoyable game I have ever played. Each time you start a new world you make it slightly further than you did the last time only to die to a new aspect that you never knew before. Takes several times to get a mechanic, but once you do the you can finally start learning the other aspects of the game such as crafting and fighting. Playing with friends makes the game 1000x more enjoyable. This game is a deal breaker I see potential in losing friends over this game :p 11/10 would recommend			"

												This is one of my favourite games that I have on steam! (ALSO THE GAME IS AT A DECENT PRICE AT 10.99 AND INCLUDES AN EXTRA COPY TO GIFT TO A FRIEND OR WHATEVER)The game is very well created there is alot to do and several different characters who are better and more useful at different things! A fun thing about surviving together is that you will probably find a playstyle that you prefer whether thats fighting,hunting,building,farming,gathering or something crazy,It is more fun with friends but I have survived on a game alone up to 200+ days and it was still lots of fun.Klei Entertainment the developers are still adding new content with a New Reign recently announced which brings new content every 3 weeks for the next 6 months .This game used to be an early-access game but it is no longer! Have you heard of many early access games that actually left early access?Dont Starve! :-)			"

								After I load into the world, camped up next to a large campfire which my character describes as, “Glad it's contained”, I notice the amount of food has decreased. I update *John when he spawns in and begin my hunt.After catching four rabbits by simply chasing them into traps, I make my trek back to base. As soon as I begin cooking dinner, however, my character begins worrying, “The puppies are coming”. The puppies he’s referring to aren’t young and cuddly. In fact, they are a hungry pack of wolves, or hounds (as they are referred to), and they caught our scent. John recalls a herd of Beefalo, yes Beefalo, and as soon as my delicious meal is done, we got to stepping. About 15 seconds later,  four shiny-black-furred wolves with unnecessarily huge jaws caught up and begin snapping at us. Our feet soon hit the plains, and start making a pleasing sound, like someone walking on hay. We spot the herd and steer ourselves that direction, while the hounds busily snap at our ankles, determined. When John and I disappear inside the herd of Beefalo, the hounds switch their targets to the six or seven vegetarian four-leggers. But the pack of predators are soon brutally killed by the might of Beefalo. We, the spectators, occasionally and casually pick up the meat from the maimed corpses. Once it is all done with, John and I return home, satisfied with our newfound food. We fill our bellies with meaty stew and make use of the night, resting on straw mattresses.I am awoken by the cold of the air. I straighten up and take in the new surroundings, winter! The grass and trees, now pure white, have a new mood. The rabbits and frogs also have on their winter camouflage. I quickly fuel the fire with a grass tuft, which burst the fire into flames. I placed two thermal stones last night, and one is missing, presumably John took his.  While I shove a winter coat and hat on (which I have been saving for the past couple days), I notice a trap, moving. I walk over and “check” it. A lovely blizzard-colored rabbit pops into my inventory. Lunch!While I pick berries nearby, an idea slips into my head. I gather manure from the friendly herd of Beefalo and Man-Pigs (gross!) and some stick, seeds and grass. I chose to build the “Advanced Farm” and install it outside our home’s walls. I plant a seed and fertilize it twice. Boom, a carrot!. Pop, an eggplant. Blam, a dragon fruit!  I bounce to the crockpot and place the dragon fruit, eggplant, carrot and berries inside and press “Cook”. John arrives, with fresh meat and eggs after making “peace” with some irritating penguins. I give the dragonpie to my starving partner and update him about our new farm. I cook myself some bacon and eggs. We craft ourselves new tools and some chests for extra storage during the evening. John explains he found some tracks on his journey. I wonder what animal is on the other side as I lay down for bed. A koalefant, a lone Beefalo we can scavenge, or a danger Dragonfly maybe. There’s no telling what in store the next day in Don’t Starve Together...*Name Changed			"

												Well, Don't Starve Together. I love this game, and I don't think I need to point out why, over 30 thousand people have already pointed it out. Impeccable music, unique and incredible art style, brutal yet rewarding gameplay. I have to say, it's hard to stop playing this game, and not in a Skinnerbox method, Candy Crush/WoW kind of ""I can't stop playing."" I'm a total survival + sandbox game junkie, and this fills both of those needs. It's hard for me to name a single problem with this game itself, but I'll get to the problems with it that aren't Klei's fault later on. ---The Game Itself, and what it's like.---The game is a blast, full of tough decisions, engaging gameplay, and stress. Lots of stress.Don't Starve Together has you managing a few main things, this being your HP, your Hunger, your Sanity, your temperature, your wetness, and probably most importantly, time. You need to go throughout the world, collecting any resource you can simply to survive. Survive intervals of hound attacks, which get more frequent as time goes on. Survive full moons, where normally friendly pigmen become ...werepigs. Spooky. You'll travel throughout an unforgiving world and eventually set up a camp where you can unlock new recipes to help you survive. Later on, winter will start. In this, plants grow more slowly, days are shorter, nights are longer, and you can very easily freeze.  After a long time, you can improve your base and make surviving ""easier"". It's a grand world of fear and surprises, I'm only scraping the surface.---Playing Singleplayer---Playing singleplayer is great, but if you wanted to do that, Don't Starve is better for it. It's considerably easier, and it even has another gamemode, Don't Starve Shipwrecked that... Well, I'm getting off topic. Singleplayer is great, but it's not where Don't Starve Together is centered.><~~~Playing Multiplayer~~~><     Ooh, fancy.Multiplayer is where Don't Starve Together both shines and falls flat. If you gather some friends and make a private server, it's a total blast! Some of the most fun I've had in a while. Spoiler alert, having food isn't as easy with 6 people.You can survive together, help each other, and if one of you dies, one can revive another for a relatively small price. Truly, in multiplayer, cooperation is key. And that's exactly why public multiplayer is the only real flaw in the game.The game's community, if you haven't heard about it before, is... Well, it's something else. Over half of the people who play the game are imbecilic and lazy, or just game-ruining for a good laugh. If they don't play well or even decently, they're probably stealing your stuff, destroying your base, or literally just sitting around doing nothing!True story if you care to listen, actually, I was once in a server that made it until late winter. We even defeated the deerclops, a major boss in Don't Starve. One of the players who lived in our base hadn't really accomplished much. The player that had helped our base grow the most was asking him politely to do something, and he didn't respond. I gave him a golden axe, and asked him to chop some trees for logs. He took it, and did nothing, instead asking for food. The other person started yelling at him to do something. Again, he did absolutely nothing. We ended up kicking him.It gets MUCH worse than that, however. People just join, ask if they can join your base, or asking for key resources, with varying levels of grammatical errors. If you refuse, they'll give a quick ""f*** u ur a n00b"" and then proceed to either leave, or whine and complain until kicked, or until they inevitably die because they weren't actually playing the game.~~~Conclusion/TL;DR~~~DST is an incredible game blending fun mechanics and stressful decisions. You definitely should buy it if you have friends willing to play with you. If not, then buying the singleplayer Don't Starve would be better... This game isn't worth it for public multiplayer. About 1 in every 6 servers you join will have a decent game waiting for you. Just about everything in the game itself is flawless... If you can take the community.So, get ready for a fun night with friends. Deal with sanity, monsters, hounds, and especially other players. But most of all...Don't Get Caught Out In The Darkness Without A Torch. Can't wait for that game.			"

								Me and my friend were finnally able to establish a decent wooden base with lots of farms and berries. Whew, we thought this has been a very good 7 days in game! We are doing the best we have ever done we thought. Next day comes and goes without any danger. But... Throughout our 8th day, our characters  are saying ""Do you hear that?"",  sadly we just ignore this and keep on going without knowing the danger ahead. Then, night starts to kick in. Then suddenly hounds are everywhere! They have surrounded our base and there is no escape! ""Block the doors with wooden walls!"" My friend yells. I do so and both of us think we are finnally safe.... But then the hounds start breaking down our walls for their upcoming feast. ""The're coming from the walls! The're coming from the walls!"" I yell as we both take out our stone spears, ""If we're going to die, we're going to take some of them down with us!"" We both think. In a flashthough the hounds leap on to my friend and start brutally ripping out chunks out of his body as he yells in aganizing pain! ""There is no hope..."" I think. ""But wait!""I thought as i pull the pin on my grenade and dive into the frey of wolves yelling ""AAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAH AAAAAKABAR!!!!"" But then I realise that their is no grenades in this game and I have sacrifised myself for nothing. ""I am too young to die... If only things could of gone differantly... IF WE KNEW!... We could of maybe survived... I'm sorry my friend..."" I think as me and my soul get torn apart vishously as I scream in horrible pain.  The last thing I see is the hounds tearing into my body as they rip apart me, and I slip away into the darkness.....10/10 would get torn apart by pesky wolves gain while feeling aganizing pain*I wish they add grenades9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 ign			"

								In genral, the DST games are everything I love: a sandbox game featuring crafting, heavy procedural elements and resource management with some rogue-like aspects such as permadeath and randomly generated maps- sign me up! I prefer Don't Starve Together to the original game, I love that gameplay is extra punishing to compensate for the additional helpers. I like to play cooperatively, I find that having another player to collaborate with makes the game more enjoyable. There is no in-game voice chat (just a text feature), so me and my friends use the steam voicechat. The RoG DLC has added some awesome complexity to game play, summers are no longer a time of leisure and are arguably more anxiety-inducing than winters.  "

								Well, what can I say? I've been putting this off for a while because I was thinking, 'What words can I use to describe this game?'It's a bloody gem. AN addictive one.It's very Tim Burton; A little scary, twisted, adorable with some funny moments. If they ever made a movie, Depp would be Wilson. Helena might play Wickerbottom (depending if she gets on with her ex).But seriously though, if you're thinking of buying this, then be prepared for lots of addiction. You'll meet some friendly, helpful people on the normal servers, you'll enter the hunger games in the pvp ones, but most importantly, you'll have FUN with friends.Go on. You know you want to.			"

From me not understanding how to find flint to being chased from the Ent like tree monsters all the way to freaking out yelling when the atomsphere before the hounds came (  I haven't died to bees yet I dont see the big deal  ) my gaming experiance has been a great joy.

								Incredibly addictive gameplay for Don't Starve; throwing in friends/family of varying degrees of ability and the game is a surprise pot of gaming entertainment.  If you aren't already familiar with the game, no amount of words trying to describe it will get you a real feel for the game.Just know this:  Not dying is the overall goal of the game.  Starving is but the most basic of ways to fail at this goal.  Hit up some youtubes or twitch streams, or just take my word for it and dive right in.			"

								At first, I wasn't to sure about buying this game. I wasn't even interested in it.  But a friend of mine had told me about it, which lead me to do what I always do before buying a game, and start researching some gameplay on Youtube and reading some of the Steam reviews. So I decided to give it a try, buying one of the packs that include two copies so i can also give this game a try with my boyfriend. Ever since, this has now become one of my favorite games!!! I love the challenge of surviving as long as possible. In the beginning, i was lucky to survive to day four, but now, with the help of my boyfriend and two friends, we actually manage to survive to summer. But since we have never lived up till then, imagine our surprise when the sun and heat made our whole camp burn down... saddest thing ever. Overall, there will be many things that surprise you along the way, but if you all don't starve together, you can all survive together. :)			"

This game is not the most new-player friendly (lack of tool-tips and good tutorial) if you have not played the single player but the community is amazing and I'm certain people would be happy to show any new players the ropes. Overall they did an excellent job turning the orginal game into a multiplayer experience.			"

The Devs are awesome and always fixing and updating the game. It is very east to play. You can use a keyboard/mouse or just a controller. It's really game if you have friends that play but even playing with randoms are fun most of the time. Tons of mods but still great without. So yeah give it a try specially if it's on sale and even better to buy the bundle to get a buddy to play! Game looks great, easy and quick to learn, dont need a super computer and is fun alone, with friends or even randoms :D			"

												Day 2 a derpy friend trips the summer trap needless to say we all die 10/10 IGN. In all seriousness its a rather niche and unique game that has this Tim Burton esc style to it. Every time you play the game it feels different from your last playthrough and your generally excited to see whats in this new world. Every charecter has its own playstyle and feel useful in a team enviroment (Except for Willow fudge Willow). 200+ hours into the game I still learn things to this day (Dragonfly drops and egg??? no way). You can play this game on your own but keep in mind most mobs are stronger than the previous game for multiple people balancing. Feel free to add me to play with or just to ask questions about the game. And remember the night is dark and full of terrors (My Gilfriend)(I play Maxwel a lot) so bring a torch.			"

								Everything seems nice with the game, but I had some problems with it:Multiplayer usually lags. No matter how big or how low ping is. Also random character slingshots.No Mac? :( C'mon!No Reign of Giants... I know it's a lot to ask, but at least characters from it?And on most servers Willow is instant ban, any ideas on how to prevent this?Anyway, this is an early access game, so I still recommend it, but only if these get fixed eventually.

								I think this game will be amazing when it's ready for release. The Beta is doing so much better, performance and content -wise than I had hoped. It's all the horror and danger from before, but with the advantages of sending your husband to fetch cut grass for you while you set up camp. Then again, you might play with strangers and wonder why they plant trees right on top of your campfire every time you cut them down, or why they go AFK long enough to starve to death and literally drive you insane.All in all, the new dimension provided by other people is awesome. I can't wait until we can hit the caves. Maybe I'll finally get to do that Ancient stuff with someone around to watch my back?!Current con: ...the... lag. Rubberbanding when I play with strangers gets me killed. A lot.			"

								First of all if you liked dont starve, then youll like dont starve together.Its the same game just multiplayer (you can still play by yourself if you want) with multiple game modes like survival,endless,pvp etc. Ive only played with 2-3 friends and I always host so my experience may be different I guess from playing on klei servers, but the game is amazing. If I had to complain about anything it would be clicking to drop things on the ground or give to other characters can be a pain, but besides that amazing. The added multiplayer adds a solid teamwork aspect to the game and is pretty fun when you all raid some spiders nests and build a massive wood fortress together. Couldn't recommend this more. "

								I would get this if you have Don't Starve regular version and want to be able to play with friends. I would not, however, get this game to play by yourself and to be able to have the option of playing with friends because the game will expect you to play with other people. Enemies will have more HP than the regular edition and the game will be harder. If you get this game do so to play and work together with others. Get the regular edition if you plan to play mostly solo. Don't Starve together will be harder to play solo and will expect you to have friends to help you.			"

								Remember the first time you go camping, and you're really excited, but then you realize that you forgot to bring food? That's what this is. Except you have the feeding times of an infant. Even if you manage to make a camp and you and Spazz321 have resources to last a few days, you end up having to sneak food when he's not looking and cause rivalry. Eventually he dies, becomes a ghost and scares the ♥♥♥♥ outta you in the middle of the night, but it's fine because you can craft things that can revive him, just so you can both repeat the process until he angers a group of frogs and ♥♥♥♥s you both over.                                              2/10 would play with Spazz321 Again                                                      11/10 would play with someone who doesn't like poking a spiders nest again.
