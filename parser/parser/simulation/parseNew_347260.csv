												Yes buy it if you can get it on sale like I did. I owned the game in 1991 and downloaded it as Abandonware a bunch of years ago before Steam...it's no different. DRM is still there and it still runs though DOSBox.TIPS: Graphics select: 1 - VGA 265 Sound select: 4 - AdLib Use the manual to type in the DRM question otherwise the game will freeze After Alt-Tabbing out of DOSBox, goback to fullscreen mode by hitting Alt-EnterThe game is obviously dated, but if you stick with it, it really is a great game.  But I doubt modern gamers could actually get into this game..EDIT: just remembered a game breaking bug when I used to play it via DOSBox when this game was Abandonware and it's STILL here. At one point in the game you go to a Broodmaster World and hit 'P' to make contact and the screen goes black - but it still plays their music.Night Dive - do you have anyway to fix this? or are you only in the business of repackaging?

												Sure its an old game, but for its time was a classic. This is for those who are a little nostalgic, and those that like good ol classic games. A good concept that worked.			"

												Not a very bad game but it is 25 years old and it shows. The graphics are old but mostly the gameplay is really outdated. Buy in a bundle at very low prce.			"

												The vast emptiness of space....    Maybe I went the wrong way...    then I couldnâ€™t figure out how to quit.  Rebooted the whole machine.  LOL.   The visuals look cool because I've been listening to too much vaporwave.			"

												By far one of my favorite DOS games from my youth.  I have dumped countless hours into this game in the past and just had to have it when I stumbled upon it on Steam.			"

												If you played Hyperspeed nearly 25 years ago, buy it again and re-live the fun from back then. For me, it is great fun.Else, look at the graphics and decide if you can bear them. They are very basic, but the gameplay is nice. I would guess about 20-30 interesting hours at least, less if you look at a walkthrough ;-)			"

												Hyperspeed is a good game.It's not the best, but for $7 bucks it's worth it, and if you dont mind first gen of 3d graphics. It's replay is some what limited. but it takes awhile to get through the 4 systems. "

												IF you like to get into space adventure just Hyperspeed is not enough.Same gamplay have -Star Control 2- for example (talking to aliens, fighting them,gathering resources) but it drags you in from the first steps while -Hyperspeed- is so blank, empty.And if you want something more from this genre(type) of games try -Millennia: Altered Destinies-.

												This game does not work.  It runs for 3 minutes before it has a fatal error and closes itself.  I got no help from anyone at Steam or the developer of the game, when all I wanted was my money back.  I do not recommend this game to anyone.			"
