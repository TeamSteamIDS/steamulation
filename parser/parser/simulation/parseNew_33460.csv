												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												Don't get this game, not because it's bad, but simply because it uses Uplay.I pre-ordered from dust when it came out and loved it, sadly I lost my old email and I've been unable to login to Uplay. I contacted Ubisoft and pretty much got a big middle finger in response; they refused to help me, even when I offered paypal transaction details. When I said the legality of their pracices relating to CD keys is questionable within the EU, they stopped responding and two weeks later, they sent an email saying that the support ticket had been closed.I've tried their support another three times but they've offered me no help.Find some other way of playing this game if you must, it's pretty fun; but don't buy it from Ubisoft.

												TL;DR, I highly, highly recommend playing this game, but I do not recommend buying it. This is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen destroyed by an unusable DRM scheme.From Dust is a work of art. Watching the form of the earth change and mould as the player manipulates it brings back memories of Black and White, but with a sense of visual awe that comes from being a much more recent game. It is something that I feel any gamer owes it to themselves to experience at least once. Sadly, I can't recommend buying the game, as I have an ethical objection to UPlay. The alternative, a Chrome app that is free in the Chrome Store, is okay, but ultimately Ubisoft's disingenuity has ruined, or at least limited access to, what I consider to be an actual art piece.Fun fact: Ubisoft actually patched the game to remove UPlay. I had been hoping that would happen and bought it shortly after. Only a few months later, I had been happily enjoying my new game when I launched one day to find UPlay had been patched back in.Ubisoft, I know you're not listening, but stop punishing your customers for buying your products. You did the right thing once before and removed the DRM from this game. Now that the DRM is back on, I would not be surprised to find the number of seeders for this game on torrent sites has spiked. No one wants a content management system inside another content management system, especially if they only have one or two games in the ""nested"" one.			"

												From Dust was a very fun puzzle sandbox game, until UPlay got involved. It didnt need it back when it got released, but now you cant play it unless you log in with a Ubisoft account. Now dont get me wrong. While I dont mind too much about logining in and saving the info so I dont have to do it over and over, the fact that the game didnt have this at launch(or a couple years after) is what drives me away. The fact that they felt it was neccesary to include this ""Feature"" that late in the game just shows me what kind of paranoid, crazy, and untrusting company Ubisoft is becoming.			"

												This game is beautiful, the physics are the best I've ever seen and the environments are pretty, but that only gets it so far, the AI is stupid, and the men seem to be incapable of moving out of the way of water and lava coming right for them, and are confused my tiny differences in height, where I have to dump earth all over just to convince them to climb it, the game doesn't let you build a village where there is 'too much water', which is fine until you find yourself not being able to find where the water is in this tiny area, because you're not allowed to have a single drop in the place you want a village. Getting to the next level seemed more frustrating and tiresome than fun. I pre-ordered this on Steam and was really looking forward to it, but was ultimately disappointed.			"

												From Dust is a creative and interesting god-game/strategy game. It's sort of an update on Populous. Way better looking than Populous, though.I enjoyed playing From Dust through about half of the game's missions. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment to advance your tribe through a series of goals is fun and challenging. But after about 5 levels, the game's challenge became less about figuring out a strategy, and more about executing it with the awkward controller scheme. After about 8-10 levels, it just became too awkward to play. The strategy elements of the game outgrew their clumsy control scheme.I might recommend this, though, if it's on deep sale. It's pretty to look at, and I had a good couple of hours of fun before deciding the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. ...That damned level with the burning trees. Gah.			"

""From dust we came and fought the natural forces""An amazing little godmode game, where you can handle the elements earth, water and lava. I think it's too small, only 15 levels, more like an advertising game. But the concept is quite good and challenging. On the one hand you have to protect your people from deadly floods, on the other hand their villages get burned down by fire caused by the lava. Sometimes you have to fight all the elements together at once. Then you should have the right strategy to survive...			"

												The Steam version of From Dust runs just fine without Uplay. If that's the only thing preventing you from buying it, then don't let it keep you from experiencing what is a very unique and enjoyable strategy game.It will only take you 5 minutes, at most, to create a firewall rule so that From Dust will run just like any other non-Uplay Steam game. You don't need a Ubisoft account either, and you can play in offline mode.After downloading From Dust, but before starting it for the first time, install Ubisoft Game Launcher from the From Dust\Support\Ubisoft directory. Then use Windows Firewall to block the Ubisoft launcher from using the internet, which will prevent it from updating to Uplay when you start the game.That's all you need to do. If you aren't familiar with how to use Windows Firewall, there is a short guide that will show you how to create a rule for From Dust right here:

												First of all this game will require Uplay to play and you will have to lock your serial to that one account so don't forget the information. While annoying, this is doable and not the only game like it. Wish I had read more of the steam reviews before buying. I would not recommend this game and if you already bought it, my sympathies, but it is not the next Black and White. Buy at own risk, I cannot stress this enough.Controls and Mechanics: Saw a lot of complaints about this. Some buttons are counter intuitive or not 'the norm' but you can grow accustomed to them fairly quickly there's only two really weird ones. UI is spare so you aren't overwhelmed with options. Movement of the cursor corresponds with the movement of your avatar and 90% of the time this is fine and you get used to it fast. The other 10% of the time it will go too far too fast or something at just the wrong time and Bad Things will happen because of it (this has caused me to restart at least one map). Similarly 1-2-3-4 isn't hard to remember, but when the powers attributed to them shift around you have to constantly check the menu to make sure you're using the right power.The AI of the people is actually fairly decent - when it works. When it doesn't you get dozens of annoying little voices screaming at you from the top of a hastily erected pillar as rivers of lava flow around them, voices which you cannot stop until either that lava does, or one of your powers comes up, etc. Furthermore idiotic people have cost me wins before, causing me to have to restart some maps several times or making simple tasks very hard. Camera: Similar to dungeon crawlers, up above and slightly behind the avatar with the option to zoom in a little or to zoom in completely (and not be able to do anything) on just one of your humans. Like the controls 90% of the time this is fine, but when it goes wrong it can be very frustrating giving the fast liquids you are working with.Now to the reason I am writing this review: some spoilers ahead (I try not to name names). Surprisingly interesting premise and I genuinely wanted to see my people through and to find out more about what had happened before me. The cut scene between maps gets annoying overtime since its pretty long and just the same footage over and over again but that's not game breaking. What is game breaking is the end. The last level. First of all the game froze just as I was about to complete it so I had to go back and do it all over again (first time this had happened). I hesitate to detail what exactly happens but suffice to say that I was extraordinarily displeased, felt that absolutely NONE of the plot points were tied up (they didn't even try to softball something in or if they did it was too subtle for my shock and disappointment to see it), we weren't given any revelations or massive info dumps, its one giant screw you to the idiot stupid enough to waste their time on this game. Before the end I was willing to give this game a pass and say there were some levels worth redoing, some content worth getting every little bit from, but afterwards I uninstalled the game without second thoughts.

												From Dust is a fun physics game that won't keep you coming back again and again to play it, but luckily the technology itself has aged well. What other game has free-flowing water, sand, and lava that can all be mixed together to create rock, land, volcanoes, mountains, earthquakes, and tsunamis? If you are hoping that the very end of the game unlocks a no-strings-attached sandbox mode, however, you may be slightly disappointed. The sandbox mode that you get at the end is another level where you get to use all the abilities you gain across the rest of the game to beat the level. After you beat it, you return to the main menu. From there you can choose to play it again, but it doesn't feel at all like a truly free sandbox mode. If you can get past that, then I would recommend this game simply so you can playing with water, sand, and lava.			"

												I don't play a lot of ""God games"" but for me From Dust was fresh and different. Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.Visually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.For the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire. It was never bad enough for me to make me stop playing though.From Dust is a nice change of scenery and play style that is definitely worth your time.			"

												I'm surprised many people down-vote this great piece only because of uplay. Uplay is a bit tiring, but the review should solely be done of the title not the other third-party system. It has a very unique atmosphere of environment.Players have to lead the small groups of tribes and achieve given goals.The obstacles are environmental hazards mostly. The physics system is beyond words. It creates a beautiful scenary while you have a power to reform terrainand also feels very responsible for such little lives of tribes. It is a genesis simulator. It gets challenging in the later phase.			"

												From Dust has been repeatedly misidentified as a ""God"" game, which it is not. It is more accurately described as a terraforming puzzle game, and a very good one at that, managing the ideal puzzle game balance of simple, intuitive mechanics that are extended across a substantial breadth and depth of scenarios. It's one crippling drawback is the horrid, controller-developed control scheme, although this is manageable and somewhat forgivable.			"

												An extremely gorgeous and breathtaking experience, enjoyable with few weak points throughout the game. If you loved Cryo Interactive's games in the 90s, such as Lost Eden, then you'll also love From Dust.The atmosphere of this game is pretty unique. The puzzles have a gradual learning curve, the challenges are pretty cool. Sometimes things can be a bit annoying to control. Speaking of which: play this with a 360 pad, not the keyboard & mice. It's so much better.Overall I'd recommend it almost on the atmosphere alone, which I'm a big fan of.			"

												Once you get past Uplay, and I did swear at the screen many times during this process, this is a good game.I wouldn't call it a 'God' game. There's no morality choices, no true growth of a civilization, and you’re the only ‘god’ around. It’s you against nature, in a series of puzzles to test your growing powers. It doesn’t take long to make your way through the puzzles, and while there’s a sandbox mode in there as well. It didn’t really hold my attention. Expect 5- 10hrs Gameplay, depending on how fast you like puzzles.All considered, it's physics engine is beautiful, the gameplay is simple but fulfilling, and if you get angry you can wall up your little guys and let them slowly drown beneath the growing tide.Once again, Ubisoft is a pain, Uplay is stupid. But if that’s the biggest downside; it must be a decent game. "

 It's a pretty nice game, buy it but if it does not work, better pirate it. As MANY of the reviewers said, it's a nice game full of breath-taking art, incredible music and deep atmosphere but try to crack it, because of the Uplay and Steam issue. Even tho, I do not had any problems playing it and the 5€ paying was totally worth it since it was on the sale.Now to the game:You play god. Controll earth, water, lava and plants. Build your own cities and create your own story of you followers.If you like games like SimCity but you are more interested in strategy, this game is a must-have for you. Set your cities, plan them to be safe, form rivers around them to let your citizens not be eaten by lava. Follow the individuals to get ancient signs and bring themm safe home.All in all. Buy the game if you like it, download the game by warez if it doesn't work. This is not a game, this is a masterpiece.			"

												While most others complain about Uplay its not all that bad. You can get the game easily working within 5 minutes, you just have to uninstall the uPlay that comes with the game, and instead use the one from the official website. Beyond uPlay this game is fantastic. With the completely terraformable worlds and amazing powers and gameplay its a definite buy in my opinion. I personally like the water physics most. Its just very intricate and well scripted, even on a large scale when the lakes and tsunamis are involved. And who can resist taking a large glob of lava and setting your village on fire?			"

												The actual game play is minorly interesting. Can be very pretty. However I'm glad the game only cost me $6 ... the UPlay Situation is obnoxious to say the least and even when I've closed the game out UPlay keeps the process running such that it looks like I logged 13 hours playing it ... which I certainly didn't.

												From Dust gives you a place you can design on your own. Throuugh the story you will unlock more powers and so you can shape the land stronger. The Story is perfectly told and hides many secrets you will uncover. A negative point is the lack of a Sandbox mode. You are in a quarter and you can only form the land in that quarter. In conclusion this game is worth buying though you shouldn't expect much from it.			"

												An amazing adventure, magical humble little game that puts you into role of a god that guides mysterious tribe on journey to discovery through the power of terraforming. Every mission is essantially a puzzle to solve and with increasing difficulty it results into about 10 hours of top notch entertainment. Some people throwing temper tantrums because of the uplay, I had no problems with it at all (I never had uplay crashing or anything those guys are ""experiencing""). The important thing is that a review that only lists problems with uplay is not a review of this game at all. The game is an overlooked gem, it has amazing aesthetics and so much charm most of the other titles would be envious. It's not a groundbreaking title, as this was done before, but it's done really well.Two reasonable criticisms - mouse controls are not that good, and while your villagers aren't exactly lemmings, they can be pretty dumb. Neither of those are serious issues and will only take a few moments to get used to it.			"

												From Dust is a brilliantly done, wholly unique... gosh what to even call it? RTS? Eh, I dunno about that. Simulator? Kinda?  You get to play as a god that shifts the terrain of a planet in order to benefit your people. That's what you do; I don't know what to call that kind of game, but I guess that's my bad.  Anyway, it's not only a gorgeous game but it's so well crafted in mechanics, character, and just overall design that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a game that challenges you, but does so in what seems like a nonthreatening way so your motivation as a player feels very organic and unforced. The soundtrack is jawdropping, and helps to draw you into the world like nothing else. In short, for those who want an immersive, unique take on the sim/RTS franchise, pick up From Dust. You will not be disappointed.			"

												The Uplay issue has long since been fixed! The game is perfectly playable from Steam.Now I got this game to fill the void left behind Black and White. There just hasn't been a god game to equal it despite it's flaws. This could have been a worthy successor, though it may be a little too eccentric for some players.I like the tribal setting, its not something we get to see very often in games and it gives this game its unique sense of identity. It starts to lose its edge however as most of the game is manipulating the enviroment in very puzzle like ways, to get your little tribe from point A to point B. There's really not that much more than can be said. It's seems addicting, but it's no Black and White. Unfortantly it got tedious fast. I just can't in good concience recommend it.			"

												While this is a recommendation in favor of From Dust, it comes with a lot of qualifiers. This is not a game that is worth full price. Yes, the graphics and production value are above average. And yes, this is a well designed God Game. And yes, because of the dynamic way in which the world behaves in reaction to your choices can drastically change the playthrough of any particular level. And ultimately yes, the levels (what few there are) are well designed.But that brings me to my first complaint: There are only 12 levels (not counting the finale which doesn't really count since you can easily win simply by not using anything but the Breath of Earth.) For a full priced game, this is scaled more as a tech demo and paying full price is outrageous. (And I mean that to be a bit dramatic, because Fromt Dust is offensively short.)It took me roughly 6 hours to beat the game (And I had to play at least three maps over.)Which leads me to my next complaint:  There are no saves. If you fail, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. That's not horrible, but it is made painful by the unskippable cutscenes and monologues at the beginning of each level. If you're not beating the level in the first or second try, the tedium of unskippable cutscenes is likely to drive you slightly mad. The cutscenes are ""cute"" the first time through, but after that they start to grate on your nerves. Your followers don't speak English. Everything is subtitled. While this seems like a novel idea at the beginning, people speaking gibberish at you on the start of each level (coupled with the fact that you cannot bypass it) quickly becomes annoying. This annoyance is mercifully mitigated by the short ""single player campaign."" (Of questionable value, since it also means there isn't much meat on the bones of this game.)My third complaint is that it requires Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM. Ubisoft's DRM is draconian. There are multiple features in many games that simply do not work if you do not have an active internet connection (as opposed to Steam, where that connection is only required on first activation.) Additionally, Uplay fails to install correctly when installed through Steam and you have to jury rig it to work (I put a guide together under From Dust for anyone who buys this and runs in to the installation problem and goes looking for the solution.) While Ubisoft has removed some of the other unpalatable elements of Uplay DRM, it still remains the poster child for ""what not to do"" among game producers.However, if you catch this on a sale ($5-10 tops) and you can tolerate dealing with Uplay, you will find yourself faced with a few (very few) enjoyable hours with Fromt Dust.The gameplay that derives from wielding god powers (water, warth, fire and life-- no air here) is enjoyable. The sense of urgency that derives from the interaction between floods and earth washing away, or between a lava flow steadily working its way into your followers-- these interactions are compelling and interesting.Unlike Molyneux's ""God Game Remake in Godus"" there is no farmville experience here. You really are left solely with Godly concerns. How do you unlock your next power?, how do you expand your followers across the world in the face of looming environmental disaster?, how do you help them escape the world before the tenuous balance you've maintained comes crashing down around you and your followers?The story is nothing special. It starts as a question, and it ends as a question.The graphics are pretty spectacular (for what it is). There's not a ton of individualized follower behavior (You typically zoom all the way out and do your best to stay on top of the floods, or the tsunamis, or the volcanos  that are poised to end your followers.) But the environmental effects are pretty interesting. Water that is volumetric and looks like water. It has waves, it feeds plant life, it cools lava. Lava that is equally volumetric, and which cools when it thins, leaving behind a layered rock strata on which the next wave of lava will rise over it. Each river, be it water or lava, is unique and behaves according to physics which seem realistic (so long as you don't analyze them too heavily.)The game performs well (one crash of the game, one crash of Uplay before I applied the installation fix I mentioned earlier). The audio is well designed, if a bit shallow and repetative. The digeridoo sounds are thematic and interesting (but if you don't like them, they become fairly constant in late game and that is likely to get on your nerves.)All in all, despite its many flaws, I would give From Dust a positive rating-- at a much lower price point.If you happen to see this on sale and feel like a few hours with a novel take on the God game genre, then give this a try. (But don't get it except on sale, because there just isn't much under the hood to justify the cash expenditure.)			"

												-Choppy graphics as its old and had poor support from the start. Use a controller. -limit your expectations, that way you won't be disappointed. Buy for $5 or less.-Only good for mindless building/destroying on the last level. The last level is a sandbox level.-Put 1,000hrs+ in this on another platform as it was something simple I could mess with while watching the stock market. It didn't help me make money.Had arid vegetation appear in sandbox level from a glitch. Carefully cultured the arid vegetation, its glitch seed was a small area spawned forth from a dead tribesman. I did this untill it encompassed all viable landscape. This required burning away the traditional tropical vegetation so the arid could grow, this took some time as arid vegetation growth rates are slow.Arid vegetation does not burn when in contact with lava or fire. Lost arid vegetation to accidental tsunami. Losing it was devastating.8/10			"

												This game honestly has to go down as one of my top 10 games. People that are looking for a Black and White clone this isn't it. Its a sandbox physics game and I found it highly addictive. The water physics are amazing and I have never seen a game with water this advanced. Basically each level is a puzzle (think Lemmings if you will) where you have to get your tribes people to the exit by claiming all the different sites around the map. Once this is done the exit will open and you can lead them to it. Obviously its not that easy as tsunamis, fires and even erupting volcanoes try to stop your progress. You can manipulate the water, lava, sand etc to help you along the way as well as being able to restart the map if you feel you f'd up because you wanted to see what happened if you diverted that river into that volcano..Sad for the people that had issues in the past with the DRM/Uplay stuff but it looks like Steam has changed that now and for me I was able to open the game right from Steam without any issue.For the hours of fun and cheap price of £7 I would have to give this 9/10			"

												This is a beautiful sandbox game in that it is literally like playing in the sand. I bought it on sale, and for whatever it cost me (maybe $10) it is one of by happiest gaming hours/$ spent. I got about 10 hours out of it at this point and am very satisfied.Visuals:Totally great. Sure, they could be better, but I loved getting down to the tribe's viewpoint and watching the tidal waves come, or the water rise. So neet.Challenge:Not too hard, but kept me on my toes even on low difficulty on the later levels. YMMV.Replay:The game is really attractive, and the challenges of each level ensured that I played each level through at least twice. However, beyond this once-or-twice level replay I did not feel the urge to replay. Partilly this is because on many levels while there are multiple ways to get through the challenges, but usually there is a clear optimal one. I know I'll pick it up in a few months and enjoy it again, once I have forgotten some of the tricks though. Imagination inspiring:Just amazing. If you ever played in the sandbox as a kid, or built sand castles on the beach, check this out. Some of the less obvious strategies can be fun to at least try!Uplay/copy protect:Whatever system other people have their legitimate complaints about... it didn't effect me. Maybe there was an overhaul of the system? It did not affect me in the slightest, so I consider this issue resolved. Note, I played on steam/pc.			"

												If you can get this without Ubisoft getting their incompetent EA-wannabe claws into it, do so. It's a really good game that has sadly had its reputation marred by Ubi's typical bumbling. Do bear in mind however, this is really more of a puzzle and skill game than the god game it looks like. If you're after a resource management style sim game you'll have to look elsewhere.From Dust plays like a very stylized physics puzzle game and is tremendously nice to look at, to boot. Admittedly I mostly grabbed the game because it was Eric Chahi's return to gaming, and I was interested in what he had to offer. The man certainly hasn't lost his touch - while I feel the game's concept certainly could have been taken further, it does what it sets out to do pretty well.			"

												Ubisoft have DRM. And a few weeks ago they changed their DRM so that I now have to not only log in to Uplay, but log in with 2-factor authentication provided by Google Authenticator and only Google Authenticator. But my Uplay username is not my Gmail address. If I install Google Authenticator on my phone, I will need to use Google Authenticator to access Gmail (which is not supported by the third-party mail client I use at work) so in short I can either have games working or email working. I chose email. I wrote to Ubisoft's customer support. They reset my Uplay password. They did not remove the Google Authenticator requirement so that I can actually log in. All of my Ubisoft games, including From Dust, are now totally inaccessible. Fortunately I didn't have many of them, they have not made many games I thought might be worth money. From Dust, one of the few exceptions, was a flimsy puzzle game not worthy to raise and lower the land under Populus' sandals. I do not care if Ubisoft never fix this, from now on they can shove their games up their DRM-loving jacksies.			"

And a few weeks ago they changed their DRM so that I now have to not only log in to Uplay, but log in with 2-factor authentication provided by Google Authenticator and only Google Authenticator. But my Uplay username is not my Gmail address. If I install Google Authenticator on my phone, I will need to use Google Authenticator to access Gmail (which is not supported by the third-party mail client I use at work) so in short I can either have games working or email working. I chose email. I wrote to Ubisoft's customer support. They reset my Uplay password. They did not remove the Google Authenticator requirement so that I can actually log in. All of my Ubisoft games, including From Dust, are now totally inaccessible. Fortunately I didn't have many of them, they have not made many games I thought might be worth money. From Dust, one of the few exceptions, was a flimsy puzzle game not worthy to raise and lower the land under Populus' sandals. I do not care if Ubisoft never fix this, from now on they can shove their games up their DRM-loving jacksies.			"

												Controlling the power of good and evil.....no, wait....this is not Black & White. From Dust is not about training a creature and fighting other gods. It combines some elements of Populous and B&W but it is very unique in it's own way.The game is set in an extreme version of planet earth. Being a god, you must protect your tribe against the powers of nature by manipulating the world with sand, water and lava. Help your people to survive and expand. Besides the campaign, you can play several time-based challenges.Eric Chahi and his team created an intense god simulation game with a marvelous physics engine, a great contribution to a genre, which is unfortunately very rare and inconspicuous.

												Don't let the beautiful pictures on the Steam shop page blind you; this is -in 9 of 10 cases- not what you'll actually see while playing the game. I'm not saying that the graphics of From Dust were ugly, they are not. But you watch the world from high in the air, and the tiny people of this world are just that: tiny, tiny people. But that's not the problem of the game. I admit, I was hoping for a modern version of ""Populous"". A proper God-simulation. But your powers as a God in this game are highly limited. Everything in this game is highly limited. Your tiny people have to discover or populate around certain obelisks before you can work wonders. Those ""wonders"" allow you to manipulate the world to a degree. I'd say 80% of the play time, you pick up sand and drop it somewhere else. This way you create land for your tiny people, or you dig ravines for controlling the flow of waters. It's actually quite fun for a while, but pretty soon it gets old. You are doing pretty much the same all the time. From Dust clearly is not the new Populous. The old hit from 1989 beats From Dust in the categories fun, length and complexity. The world of From Dust provides only roughly one dozen maps, and those are not really huge. Between the maps you watch the same boring sequences again and again, you do the same things again and again, move tons of sand from A to B so that after some settling you can get your tiny people to make it to the exit of the world. Maybe that's why we only got a dozen or so maps (of which the first few are pretty much meant as tutorial maps...), because the developers realized that the game concept is simply not complex and entertaining enough to motivate for more than 10 or so hours. French games are often pearls of innovation and creativity, but this one sadly, is not.			"

There's a really cool idea at the core of the game and it's ruined by terrible AI and imprecise controls. If it's on sale and you're ok with a casual game with no worthwhile story and little replay value, then go for it. Otherwise, just watch some gameplay and move on after you've seen the mechanics.

												From Dust is a very, very small game with very little content, few maps, middling execution and far too much hype at launch. It was worth my money but not by much so I don't feel burned but I didn't get much out of the experience. I can't recommend this game because the game is exactly as shallow as it looks, in fact most of the game is how it looks more than what it is.This game is in no way comparable to any other god game because all other god games are massively more ambitious and even for their failings achieve much more than From Dust. In particular I've seen this game compared to Black & White, which is bares no relation to whatsoever.			"

												From Dust is possibly one of those games you play that turn out to be just as good as game with tripple it's price tag.The game is classed as a Godgam & Semi-sandbox. You play a sperm, i mean something called 'The Breath' and the main goal is to spread your people around different lands avoiiding dangers that harm your people. Like God verstion of lemminigs so to speak.The physics in the game is beyond anything i have seen, water moves so realstic i was busy creating waves to notice my Tribe burning to crisp. There are 12 levels and one more that is you create your own land. You may clock in 7 hours on your fist playthough. Plus lots of possible replay value. This game is worth more than some games with tripple it's price tag.Con's: - Badly ported with poor controls. Unleess you use an Xbox pad like i did.- Few loading bugs for people and 'Uplay' can be a ♥♥♥♥♥!Easily a 9.4./10If you love Black and White, Populus or ever physics game you will loves this. :)- Dean Micheal			"

												This game is very creatively made. It's not one of those games where theres just one way to solve a problem and you have to find it; rather, you are given tools to shape the environment that cause gradual butterfly effects that are sometimes not what you expected and no two soltions will be exactly alike because the environment is constantly changing and adjusting in response to your actions. This creative platform tickled me a lot; I've never seen another game quite like this. Some levels were challenging and frustrating but satisfying in the end; others were a little easy but over all it was well balanced. It was a joy to see what creative challenge came up next each time. My only complaint is that the game is short -- I would love to see more! Also its replayability is limited.

												From Dust presents an interesting way to sculp the Earth, though with a poorly made PC port.In From Dust, you control villagers like in Populous. You can manipulate earth, water, and lava to reach village points and to reach the next level. The goal is to find out where these villagers came from. As levels progress they start in island places with lots of water, next to big volcanoes, or in a stretch of dry desert. The villagers have a unique appearance to them, along with their art and music being of unique looks. Controlling matter is easy and the land and water physics is handled very well. These points add for a special experience.The problem lies with the later PC release. As this was made for consoles it wasn't well optimized. Ubisoft requires to use their DLC along with Steam just to use it. The performance is abysmal, but the art and music are sure to please. While the game has a unique artistic and realistcally amazing design, the PC framework just doesn't do justice.			"

Using this you can form land bridges or small lakes to help your tribe survive; it is a lot of fun.This game is a good game but the port has something to be desired. I managed to play it through to completion a few years ago but even then it crashed repeatedly and now it is almost unplayable. If you can put up with the technical problems or are lucky and don’t have any then this is a real gem and worth playing but if not then I wouldn’t recommend it.Oh and Uplay... enough said.Have fun ːMMForFunː			"

												Predstavte si, že ste niečim, ako boh a máte vo svojich rukách osudy primitívnej populácie v období, kedy ľudské pôsobenie na zemi ešte len začína. V tomto originálnom koncepte realtimovej stratégie sa doslova môžete zahrávať so životmi praludí a to ničím menším, ako rovno zosielaním skázy formou prírodných živlov. Sledovať malé postavičky snažiace sa bezmocne úkryt pred obrovským množstvom valiacej sa vody, či na opačnom konci rozmáhajúcej sa žeravej lávy, je vážne zábava. Vašou úlohou je ale životy nič netušiacich primitívov previesť cez všetky nemilé prírodné katastrofy a zachrániť tak našu civilizáciu pred neštastným osudom, aký postihol vyhynutých dinosaurov. Dostanete do rúk vlastne sandboxové pieskovisko, do ktorého sa Vám nikto babrať nebude a zostava len na vás, ako jednotlive úlohy splníte. Je potrebné priviesť malé postavičky praľudí na druhý breh silnej rieky? Môžete sa pokúsiť pritekajúcu vodu zastaviť pieskom vytvorením hrádze. Púštny piesok ale silný prúd vody nemusí vždy udržať a skôr či neskôr prerazí a vaši zverenci skončia v dejinách vyhynutých tvorov. Čo tak ale nasmerovať lávu z neďalekej sopky priamo k rieke? Ta potom prudkým ochladením vodou začne náhle meniť svoje skupenstvo a razom mame základ pre pevnú hrádzu, ktorá divokú rieku ďalej nepustí. Lenže ona rieka stále priteká a naša premyslená lávova hrádza nemá neobmedzenú výšku. Voda časom začne pretekať a svojou neúprosnou silou zastihne nič netušiacich praľudí snažiacich sa po novovzniknutej cestičke prejsť na druhu stranu, bez akejkoľvek šance na útek. Logika by v takom prípade našepkávala docieliť nejakým spôsobom menší prítok vody k hrádzi, aby nezačala pretekať. Pripadne sa len snažiť spomaliť tento jav na dostatočne dlhu dobu, aby bolo možné osadenstvo neďalekej dedinky bezpečne previesť k novým zážitkom. Opäť máte niekoľko možnosti, ako toho docieliť. Jednou z nich je časť valiacej sa vody presmerovať vytvorením provizórneho koryta v piesku a odviesť tak určite množstvo nechceného živlu inam. Teraz už naši spokojní zverenci môžu bezpečne prejsť na druhý breh rieky a spoznať tak opäť další kút našej budúcej zeme. Takýchto rôznorodých úloh budete plniť veľa a neustále a bude len na vás, ako s ďalšou a ďalšou výzvou popasujete. Časom ale cela hra skĺzne do opakujúcich sa postupov a prestane ponúkať nové možnosti skôr, než si budete sami želať. Stáva sa tak postupom času mierne stereotypnou záležitosťou, ktorej až príliš skoro začne dochádzať dych. Tento koncept hratelnosti je ale tak iný a tak unikátny, že nedoporučiť tých pár hodín nenahraditeľnej zábavy, by bolo snáď ešte väčším hriechom, ako svojou nerozvážnosťou zapríčiniť vyhynutie našej rasy predčasne.

												The game works fine and has interesting game mechanics, primarily the control of natural elements like fire, lava etc. but the novelty of the levels wear off and it just doesn't feel like an accomplishment when you finish a level. I was left more infuriated at the lackluster controls, which seem like they were made for controllers not a mouse, and the repetitive nature of the game. There are challenge modes aside from the main missions but there is no definite ""zing"" with anything this game does (aside from the awesome sound and ambient music). It seems more like an experiment than a full-fledged game. This was definitely originally intended for console gaming and not PC. You'd do well to watch some gameplay videos before going for a purchase and even then I'd recommend waiting for a sale. Also, UPLAY DRM ALERT!! Functional, but shallow and uninteresting.			"

												A rather short game but fun all the way down. It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.A real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes.It has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.So it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.			"

												It's no ""Populus: The Beginning"", but it does well.Some interesting puzzle mechanics, but it just doesn't feel too deep, and certainly feels to short. So if it's something that's somewhat challenging.Artwork is great and is probably the strongest point of the game. It's a shame that you often can't appreciate it as you're mostly staring at it from afar.It's certainly worth your time and money for an update of Bullfrog's epic ""Populus: In The Beginning"", even thought the reworking on shines a veneer rather than get anywhere near the depth of its spiritual predecessor.

												This was a pretty terrible game. I got it mostly because it reminded me of Black & White, but that should have warned me as Black & White was also released a barely functioning sandbox as opposed to a game. I got through everything the game had to offer in less than five hours, but that is because all it has to offer is environmental sandbox manipulation and no matter how much you call them puzzles that doesn't make them puzzles. I concede that the game looks and sounds beautiful, but its an extremely shallow beauty with no depth whatsoever. This is of course aside from the issue with Uplay that might render the game unplayable for most people. This is of course aside from the fact the game is meaninglessly locked to run at a lower frame rate to match those of the console versions.You can find the full review over here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/07/from-dust.html.

												Going in, I was a bit intimidated by ""From Dust."" I was worried that I'd get overwhelmed by a complex, totally freeform sort of experience where deep mastery is required to have any fun at all.I'm pleased to say that this title avoids that problem. You're generally allowed to ease into the mechanics quite gently, and you also tend to get a lot of warning about things potentially getting away from you. Thoughts like ""Oh...what I'm doing with this volcano won't be very helpful in a minute"" are much more common than ""What the heck just happened?"" Your goals are easy to identify, and mistakes are usually correctable. Even when you completely fail, you can usually see where things went wrong.I also felt that the general mysteriousness of the game world was highly compelling when combined with what you do find out. It all left me wishing that I could have discovered more regarding the goings-on.It's true that the behaviors of the people you're trying to help can be a bit less than helpful, especially given their tendency to be finicky about where they can and can't go. (There's also the whole problem of them managing to drown in something like one foot of water.) Even so, the quirks aren't so bad as to ruin the game.""From Dust"" is a slightly quirky but ultimately interesting ride. I think it's worth trying.			"

												I played this game on console, and I bought it for Steam the instant it went on sale. Not because it's not worth the money, but because it was the second time I was purchasing it. (well, and it's short, so buying on sale is probably the better bet for that reason as well) This god-style puzzle game is just gorgeous. A beautiful, atmospheric, absorbing and utterly enjoyable game that will captivate you while offering progressively more difficult tasks to advance your tribe through the various stages of their evolution. The interface is intuitive, the puzzles are sophisticated and yet gentle in their difficulty curve - but there is DEFINITELY a curve, they will get tricky - and the story while fairly barebones is one that gives you some cause to get attached to these little guys as they deal with the struggles ahead of them. I have not had to use mouse and keyboard on the later puzzles of course, but I could see where you might prefer a controller - it's definitely a comfortable and pleasant experience on the console. I strongly recommend this game!Fair warning: This game requires Uplay to use - if you don't want to deal with the Ubisoft DRM system, then this is probably not the game for you.			"

Overall, it's okay.But the DRM, oh my god the DRM. It's complete and utter garbage, VERY annoying and a chore to setup. I really hate this uPlay♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really do.

												Really awesome until the last few levels. Before the later stages, it was relaxing, like playing in a sandbox, yet reasonably challenging without being frustrating or punishing. Unfortunately, as I got to the later stages, difficulty arose due to a certain totem being placed in a very tricky, high and near-lava location. You have to rely on the individual pathing of the AI, but there's not much indication if they'll be able to get up slopes (when there's multiple potential routes to a location) so trying to get them to this totem without having them try to cross lava is an exercise in frustration. The AI pathing tends to be annoying to deal with as the stages get harder. Also, depending on how you may have tried to build walls in stages with lava, you may find yourself having spent a lot of time on a stage but in a sitation where you'll have to try to destroy some walls to let your villagers get to a totem. Doing this is tedious because you need to use explosive plants (if you made rock walls). I don't understand the point in letting players manipulate something in such a tedious way instead of providing a less time-consuming method.Overall, dealing with the lava is quite frustrating, especially with how it can completely wipe out villages if so much as a particle touches some of your greenery. I understand having a challenge makes things more fun, but the way this challenge is presented is more frustrating than entertaining, because a small mistake can reset your entire stage progress. Slight variation on the level design and the lava mechanics would've probably made the game fun, but as it is I can't recommend it because of the unpleasantness of the later levels. Challenge should not come from dealing with the stupid AI, and mistakes shouldn't make you feel like you've just wasted a bunch of time, because that's no fun. Towards the end it just became not pleasant to play anymore. It's a shame because the sandbox mechanics are very entertaining to interact with - it's almost like they weren't sure whether they wanted to frustrate players with hard challenges or provide a relaxing, slow-paced sandbox game.

												The world has released yet another Call of Duty clone. I mean seriously. How many Call of Duty clones do we need. Now usually I rant on how this game is a worse version of Call of Duty. But ""Oooohooohoo man"" believe me when I tell ya. This game is probably, no it in fact is, 100% better than Call of Duty. It has such a good multiplayer community, dudes only of course, some of the greatest Multiplayer PvP maps I have seen, and of course, who could forget the sweet graphics this game includes. Now I do now know how to type out how amazing these graphics are. But I'll give it my best shot. These graphics are Real Life. The playstyle is amazing. I love the first person shooter aspect. There is the ability to take cover. And of course, do sweet 1080 quick-scope trick shots.			"

3/10God games like this are usually a blast, but I was really underwhelmed.The Good: It was a really interesting and new idea. Never seen anything quite like it.The Bad: It was too easy to complete though the natural disasters could be a HUGE pain and really screw up your game (as in the level your on, not the game itself).The Ugly: TOO DAMN SHORT!!! I beat the game in under three hours (and that was including a considerble amount of screwing around with playing god) and spent another hour or so knocking out the challenge levels and...that was it.In summation, cool game but not enough content to warrant keeping it.

												For  short game, it is a decent amount of fun. This is a fun sandbox game that gives you an objective, but you can complete it at anytime and in any way that you would like. I spent a lot of time playing the demo on my Xbox 360, and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to finally get the game for my computer. The AI is decent at path finding, but can get irritating at times with them getting stuck going up a hill when they could much more easily go around. The gameplay changes from stage to stage, adding a new element for each stage. I enjoy that they do this. Diversity really helps this game. I think I may be getting to the end of the game, which is disappointing, but there are challenge modes to tackle after you have completed the main story. Final note: Wait for this game to go on sale if you are interested in playing it.			"

												I DO NOT recommend this game. Ubisoft makes you create/use a uPlay account to log into this game, which is just annoying.. I already log into an account via Steam (Yes I know it's a seperate network, but still.. 'user experience' much?)It IS NOT a spiritual ancestor to Populous because the title itself is fairly limited. It reminds me somewhat of the Black and White series (and a similar one-gimmick game play). If you like pretty graphics and pressing Space Bar, then you'll like this game though. It is about right-priced if you're OK with annoying.Also see: http://www.1up.com/news/from-dust-drm-removal-steam-give-refund "

												NOTHING LIKE POPULOUSThis isn't a god-game, not in that sense. You're a god, sure. With powers over nature, sure. You lead a tribe of people, sure. But this is really a puzzle game. You move dirt and lava and stuff around to make a way for your people to reach new village spots. That's it. Oh and there's no real progression between levels. If that sounds fun, have at it.I expected more, and I guess that's my fault for not reading enough reviews.BUT, the mouse controls suck. I'm four levels in and I still hate how the mouse controls. I regularly pick up water instead of the dirt I want that's next to it. Directing my people to a new spot is hard because getting the mouse to settle on that spot is hard. There's some really weird acceleration going on. And the game forces me to use uPlay. Despite my admission that I shouldn't have bought this game, I think this paragraph still warrants a thumbs down, because I tried to enjoy it for what it is and these frustrations stopped that.			"

												It's like a smaller scale Black & White, without a giant animal. The goal is to guide your tribe to the right place(s) while protecting them from natural disasters. This can be done by changing the environments. So, for example, you can create walls to protect them from lava or you can create a hole in the ground to keep the water in. It's all up to you, as long as you can protect them. But it gets challenging pretty fast.The graphics are pretty sweet, especially for a downloadable game. It definitely has a nice style. The sounds are very well done as well.All in all, it's a game I would recommend. There aren't that many 'God sim' games around these days, so From Dust is a great addition to anyone's collection.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												I'd recommend this game but with a couple of major reservations.First off the good.I think the core mechanics are neat and well executed. Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.Now for the badFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.Second, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.In conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.

(this tip is for the developer) If you dont change that then your making mountains the whole damn time and that gets annoying on a level like the sea one. They obviously didn't think it through and I might even think they didn't even play through it themselves before putting it out. The point in making a game is so you enjoy playing it while having a bit of a challange. Not play a game that has a very strict way to win in short time with terrible controls to work with.			"

												Okay I played From Dust a while ago on my Xbox and fell in love with  it and now that I've gotten into PC gaming I was so excited to see that there was a PC version. I highly reccomend it to anyone who loves god games HOWEVER. In order to get it to even run I had to delete the Ubisoft launcher files from my computer and then go onto the Ubisoft website and download the Uplay launcher from there. Now it actually works. So I do actually reccomend the game, but bear in mind that you will need to do a bit of finangling to get it to work, but the game is totally worth it!			"

												I own this game on the PS3 and I can tell you now it is the single most infuriating game I have ever played... But I love it to death. The art style is simply amazing, as is the concept; I've never seen it before and I love it. Getting the hang of the game can be challenging at first, but it gets easier and is totally worth it.			"

												Seeing a lot of flak for this game.... it is NOT of the 'god game' genre. If you enjoy PUZZLE GAMES or even strategy games then this is a very unique and dare I say rewarding experience. Also, if you went to the beach as a kid and spent 100% of the time digging trenches and moats in the sand rather than swimming, then I can't think of a better game to satisfy those impulses. (pls tell me if there is!) Get it on sale tho as there is not much replayability after all the challenges have been solved.			"

												I'd recommend this game but with a couple of major reservations.First off the good.I think the core mechanics are neat and well executed. Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.Now for the badFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.Second, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.In conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.

												Very similar to other god games I’ve played, but with the ability to alter the landscape, but not in a click-and-drag sort of way, but in an elemental sort of way. For instance, if you want to create a river, you don’t just press a button and a river appears. Instead, the games says “♥♥♥♥ you, if you want a river, make a river. Move the water, drop it and let it carve trough the land, like a real river you lazy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥”The game lets you experience erosion and land forming in a realistic way, with fun challenges. I highly recommend buying this game. "

												One of the best games ever.The game mechanics are so original and easy to use. Seeing the surroundings evolve just brings a big smile on my face. And the little people are so sympathetic that you'll try your best not to drown/burn/suffocate them. Because of the dynamics of the surroundings there is also replayability, so the game is kinda short but you can replay it a few times.Buy it when you can afford it.Only downfall, they push Uplay with it.

												It's a shame the store page shows mixed reviews in red, this game is fantastic! It's not super long or deep, but it is a well paced, well balanced, terraforming and water physics based puzzle game, with a sandbox mode to boot. It looks incredible, and is extremely good fun and damn satisfying. It plays much better with a controller (or at least it did at release, I can't say for now), but most people's complaints are purely about uPlay, which really isn't THAT bad, and certainly not a REASON to NOT get a great game, at least it is AVAILABLE on Steam unlike anything by EA these days!

												Worst experience I have had with a product. It's not often that you see a developer void all responsibility in the making of their game. Releasing a game with one set of minimum system requirements and then rather than fixing conflicts uncovered, you change the minimum requirements and simply void out all mobile chipsets? Terrible.. abhorant service model.LOL and I couldn't post the above because I hadn't had more than 5 minutes of game time.. Thats because the game doesn't work. Hold up.. I just clicked to launch the game another 5 times.. Now I can post this as apparently the 'spinning mouse cursor' counts as gameplay.. Best game ever!			"

												This game is a bit deceptive in it's marketing. It looks like an immersive RTS where you manage a tribe and develop them into a civiliazation whilst avoiding the plagues of nature.... But realistically it's just a puzzle game where you try to get villagers with no story, personality, individuality, or unique characteristics whatsoever from point A to point B utilizing a physics based, fully manipulatable environment.The game: You build sand castles and bridges, try to keep the water and lava out. No enemies, no plot, no advancement, just different levels with different scenario puzzles.Yes it's kind of fun, but not a great game, it could have been a lot better, like Black & White was.			"

You could wreak so much havok! But no.Even though this game had promise it missed the mark.Having said that the 'crater in a volcano' world was quite fun and, I think, the best in the game.If you could get this game for under $5 it would probably be worth it, but much more than that, I suggest purchase another game.

												I have the PC version and after playing 5-6 worlds, I simply couldn't stomach anymore. It was too difficult getting the movement to work with mouse and keyboard. The controller version might be better, but the PC controls and camera are really bad.I also felt the worlds began to become very repetitive. The gimmicks differs between the worlds, but in the end you either move sand/water/lava to rescue your villagers and put the water/lave/sand somewhere else to block the hazard that controls the current world.I never felt like a 'god', more like a janitor.I don't mind using Uplay, but this game does seem to have a problem with Uplay. After I set my Uplay client to start in offline mode and play 'From Dust' in offline mode, the problems disappeared and I could play the game.			"

												The game itself is great... the fact that Ubisoft put it's Uplay DRM back in this means everyone should stay as far away as possible from this! Definitely can't recommend it with Uplay. In fact, this is the SECOND freaking game I can't access anymore because of their stupid Uplay stuff (the other being ACIII, a game I've logged 20+ hours in, yet can't finish because apparently it got magically removed from my Uplay account).As a result, I won't be buying any Ubisoft games with Uplay anymore, because apparently either my account got hacked or Ubisoft regularly messes up big time with no way for me to get my access back.Consider this a fair warning for anything involving Uplay. It's a shame though, because From Dust itself is actually quite an amazing god game / puzzle game.			"

												In order to enjoy this game, you must give it some time at first. This is a God game where you can manipulate elemants, you manipulate these elemants in order to get your tribe settled to a village. You manipulate the ground below them in order to clear paths for them, so they can continue spreading their knowledge across the land. I would have to say that this game has fantastic replayability due to the fact that you can finish a level differantly each time you play it.The description of the game I've given in the review is a very basic description, give this game a try yourself, you must see the beauty this game has to offer with it's stunning visuals.

												Even though I personally like this game, I will try to stay as objective as I can.I am recommending this game because there is nothing like this out there and it is worth experiencing. BUTThere are lots of CONS:-	Game is super short.-	The controls are unfriendly.-	Can’t skip scenes.-	No depth, no challenge.-	Only thing worth seeing is the physics.Seems that this game was a let’s-release-a-game-with-cool-physics” but nothing else. It is a lot of fun to play with the elements and see how you can affect the world. But that’s it.As far as all the negative comments concerning UPlay: ignore them. UPlay is UPlay, and From Dust is From Dust.  Even if UPlay were so bad (entering a key and logging in, not a hate-trigger for me), they are two completely unrelated things. So, if the game is on sale and you enjoy god-like games, physics/cause-effect, give it a go. I personally felt like “is that it?” at the end. So expect that if you like these sort of games.But still, the concept is good and this is the only game out there where you can manipulate the world like this, and it’s fun. So + for me. "

From Dust is infected with it, ruining the entire game. Ubisoft will tell you that it's okay, now the game is patched, you can play offline and never expeirience a breakout or interruption. What they don't tell you is you must keep Uplay installed and authenticate all the time. The last time I signed in after a long absence ""From Dust"" was no longer in my games library on Uplay... as much as I enjoyed the game it simply wasn't worth the time and frustration for me to deal with Ubisoft to fix it.Until you can trust Ubisoft to release a copy of From Dust without UPlay AT ALL... it simply isn't worth your time.

It can last longer if you REALLY like playing with the tools it gives you, especially on the unlockable sandbox, but at the time of writing this the game is over three and a half years old and is still the price it was at launch, which was too high then. If this goes on sale for $5 it's an easy purchase as long as you go in thinking of it like a toy  instead of a game.			"

												I love this game. It has fantastic atmosphere and it just looks and feels great. It is a story that is not directly put in words or told to you. It is an experience. A journey.You act as a god of a tribe assisting them in their search for their ancestors. The gameplay is really interesting and is based entirely on modifying the terrain in various ways and it works really well. The gameplay revolves around grabbing materials and objects and moving them elsewhere. It sounds boring when described but it very satisfying in-game.There are also tsunamis that cover the entire map, and spontaneous volcanoes to mess up your finely tuned plans. Sometimes the game gets seriously difficult. I remember trying to beat a few levels for several hours.The graphics are stunning and it has good replayability. I've played the game through twice and it's really easy to pick up waste a few hours every once in a while. After you beat the game you unlock a sandbox mode where you can create your own small world. (So much fun!)It seems that Steam did not record all those hours (~40) I've played this game.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 4/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 4/5Aesthetics: 5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Music: -/5 (I don't remember it well enough to rate.)

So i thought this was going somwhere but once you beat the first level its the same.the same thing over and over and it just eventually becomes impossible.If you want a real progressive game where your people actually have some sort of prospects of survival get godus..thats what i wanted when i bought this and i got this. but now i have godus.I conclude...

												I enjoyed the game itself, but have always strongly disliked the Ubisoft client. Really don't think it should be necessary to sign in to a secondary service on a steam game... Haven't tried using the service in perhaps over a year, so it's possible things have changed, though I doubt it.So I recommend the game itself, but if you also don't like the ubisoft client, then don't get it.

												I love this game. It has fantastic atmosphere and it just looks and feels great. It is a story that is not directly put in words or told to you. It is an experience. A journey.You act as a god of a tribe assisting them in their search for their ancestors. The gameplay is really interesting and is based entirely on modifying the terrain in various ways and it works really well. The gameplay revolves around grabbing materials and objects and moving them elsewhere. It sounds boring when described but it very satisfying in-game.There are also tsunamis that cover the entire map, and spontaneous volcanoes to mess up your finely tuned plans. Sometimes the game gets seriously difficult. I remember trying to beat a few levels for several hours.The graphics are stunning and it has good replayability. I've played the game through twice and it's really easy to pick up waste a few hours every once in a while. After you beat the game you unlock a sandbox mode where you can create your own small world. (So much fun!)It seems that Steam did not record all those hours (~40) I've played this game.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 4/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 4/5Aesthetics: 5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Music: -/5 (I don't remember it well enough to rate.)

												While it may look like a god game on first glance the mechanics of it remind me very much of puzzle games. You control ""The Breath"" which allows you to manipulate earth, water and lava and do all sorts of crazy elemental stuff, but it all boils down to getting the tribe people to the next village and protecting them from other elemental forces like tsunamis and volcanoes. It's puzzle solving rather than world building.It might not be the god game you're looking for but it's still fun and worth a try.			"

Level after level I kept wanting the game to open up, instead I got a series of small challenges. Maybe I didn't give it a fair chance, maybe it just wasn't what I wanted.			"

												Didn't take long to beat, but by far one of the best games I have played, You are god, trying to save tribal people who worship you, saving them from destruction. This game is a bit puzzle, godmode, and just fantastic animations and graphics. I highly recommend buying this game.			"

												This short game will have you hooked for a long time. Guide your villagers through their world , as their God you will learn to control the elements to expand thir territory . The real star of this game is the amazing physics . If there is water in the way , build a passage by moving earth from another part of the world and marvel as the water parts . Is lava troubling you ? Why not surround it with a lake or use water trees to control the flow of molten rock.Although the game is only about 15 maps long but you will find yourself replaying them over and over just for the sheer fun of it.

												Excellent and challenging non-violent game. You must figure out how to provide for your tribe and how to lead it across various terrains  and avoid numerous environmental dangers. Requires analytical skill in order to access best way to get the job done. Play gets progressively harder as different dangers from land, sea and plants appear. You must settle new villages next to the totems in order to unlock new powers for your avatar.  Lead your people across the land following the path of the ancients while gaining power and abilities. Non-violent and age appropriated for the entire family.			"

Yet it is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences I’ve had in gaming. I played it countless hours on my 360 before it croaked and I bought it again on PC because I genuinely missed playing it. 5 out of 5.			"

												DO NOT BUY.You might want to know if this is a good game or if you can blow off some boredom with it. I can't tell you, as of writing this. I have 47 minutes into this game. Those 47 minutes? Spent trying to get through Ubisoft's stupid DRM and when you're finally passed that. Pray that you're lucky because your game could crash at the opening scene. That's what happened to me and two other friends and after hours of trying to find a solution. There were none. So who knows if this is good but if you ever buy it. Don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												This was a fantastic experience. I was sorry it was over. The Uplay thing is a nuisance but I needed it for Far Cry 3 and a few other games that were good so I don't see why people make such a fuss and work so hard to drive other players away. From Dust worked fine for me. Shaping the terrain to change the flow of lava and such is a new kind of thing in gaming so I went to the many youtube videos that show how its done and got lots of good tips to finish all the levels. Other levels could be solved using logic. There's not much replay but there could be if they let people create their own levels in workshop.			"

												Very fun in it's own right, very amazing gameplay but a story you won't even notice. The main story tries to fit in between levels and in bits that aren't shown as you play. The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you♥♥♥♥♥that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that. Still a great buy for it's fun value but nothing on replayability.			"

												Fun for a four dollar puzzle game. It skirts the line of being a tech demo instead of a full game though. There's only one, fairly long and unskippable, cutscene after every stage. I would have liked to see at least twice the number of story missions, some variety in people, and a mind bender or two for the puzzles.Overall, good buy when its on sale, not so much for full price. There's little story, limited variety, and irritating controls at times. On the other hand, it's absolutely beautiful and fluid dynamics play very well into eachother. The challenge mode adds much needed objectives to test your understanding of the mechanics.			"

												What's the matter, villagers? Can't you pick up lava? I CAN. :DFrom Dust is a God-Game in the same style as Black & White, only without the annoying ""Oh, your creature just ate half your village. Oops,"" bit. You control ""The Breath"", a god-like being with the power to pick up dirt, water, and the LIFE BLOOD OF THE MOUNTAINS. It's your job to protect ""The Men"", a sort of tribal people with spiffy masks.The world in this game is FANTASTIC. Water flows realisticly and wipes villages off the map. Dirt piles up and settles just like if you were a kid playing at the beach. Lava cools into rock when it's not setting fire to everything ever.The AI is a bit crap, though. Many's the time I've created a safe path from one village to another, only for the villagers to take a path right toward the river of molten rock, and THEN proceed to complain until I redirect the flow. But, it's not so bad that it breaks the game.tl;dr, buy the game, it's fun. Cave Johnson, we're done here.			"

												This was a fantastic experience. I was sorry it was over. The Uplay thing is a nuisance but I needed it for Far Cry 3 and a few other games that were good so I don't see why people make such a fuss and work so hard to drive other players away. From Dust worked fine for me. Shaping the terrain to change the flow of lava and such is a new kind of thing in gaming so I went to the many youtube videos that show how its done and got lots of good tips to finish all the levels. Other levels could be solved using logic. There's not much replay but there could be if they let people create their own levels in workshop.			"

												This game is easily a good time killer but watch out for losing site of your priorities having fun with the sand and water mechanics. I spent a lot of time making pools and lakes and making them drain from one place to another for pure entertainment even though it was not my objective. Basically you have to get your tribe memembers  from point to another to create small villages, make sure the land becomes lush with greens, and finally getting them safely to an exit. You use your powers as a god to take control of the elements to change the very shape of the land your tibe member are currently inhabiting. Pick up and drop sand to make a crude land bridge or drop water on some vegitation which has caught fire due to the constant lava flow from an active volcano or have your tribe members grab totems to protect you from raging a tsunami. There are intricate ways the game dev make use the landscape and element mechanics to insure getting your tribe memembers to saftey will not be easy.			"

Who could pass up a $14.99 game with good reviews? - - - - CONS: 1.) They used the same cutscene between each board. 2.) The didgeridoo music is EXTREMELY annoying. It gave me a severe headache after about 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and turn the music off. 3. On most boards, if you make a mistake, more often than not, you have to restart it because you've done too much damage to the landscape. - -- All in all, not a bad buy. Pick it up if you have a few extra bucks.			"

												I thought the game would have more depth.  Honestly it gets boring fast.  It's a good casual timesink, but there's really not much of a challenge or story.  It's just a simple little physics celebration.  I don't know how the guy that made Out of This World ended up making something so drab.Ubisoft installs ""Uplay"" which is a wannabe Steam browser that runs on top of everything to play this game. I'm going to avoid all Ubisoft games from now on.  You need an account name and password, and it tries to keep track of games you've purchased, except half the time it screws up or bugs out.  It was designed by a team of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys and doing a quick google search nets you thousands upon thousands of hate filled sites, blogs, and forums full of people boycotting Ubisoft.  I already bought the game on STEAM.  Why do I need yet another spyware ridden DRM pile of crap running on my computer?			"

												Fun for a four dollar puzzle game. It skirts the line of being a tech demo instead of a full game though. There's only one, fairly long and unskippable, cutscene after every stage. I would have liked to see at least twice the number of story missions, some variety in people, and a mind bender or two for the puzzles.Overall, good buy when its on sale, not so much for full price. There's little story, limited variety, and irritating controls at times. On the other hand, it's absolutely beautiful and fluid dynamics play very well into eachother. The challenge mode adds much needed objectives to test your understanding of the mechanics.			"

												It’s a poorly made port of an Xbox game. The graphics settings are a joke. It’s locked at 30 FPS and it can’t really be controlled by M&KB so a Gamepad is strongly suggested. Yet it is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences I’ve had in gaming. I played it countless hours on my 360 before it croaked and I bought it again on PC because I genuinely missed playing it. 5 out of 5.			"

												DO NOT BUY.You might want to know if this is a good game or if you can blow off some boredom with it. I can't tell you, as of writing this. I have 47 minutes into this game. Those 47 minutes? Spent trying to get through Ubisoft's stupid DRM and when you're finally passed that. Pray that you're lucky because your game could crash at the opening scene. That's what happened to me and two other friends and after hours of trying to find a solution. There were none. So who knows if this is good but if you ever buy it. Don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												Its hard to pinpoint From Dust into one particular genre; part strategy, survival, adventure and even micro-management rolled into a lovely, meaty game which will both frustrate and fan your involvement from the word go...I really cannot think of a game which sits in the same catergory as this except maybe on the borderline of Lemmings, this game is unique to say the least but a word to the wise....be patient because the game can really get you thinking and you can still be washed (!) away...

The control is a little bit clunky but unless you play the hardest challenges it shouldn't be a problem.Unfortunately no one can be told what Dust is, you have to see it for yourself. See the volcano rise out of the ocean, see the tsunami sweep away all and forever change the map. See the awesome power of the ancients as they master the elements.I'm serious do not miss it.			"

												From Dust is a gorgeous game with an interesting concept of playing god and encouraging the growth of your tribe as it recovers its memories and re-establishes itself.  The controls are a bit difficult to get a grasp on at first but are easy to use once you have the hang of it.  The game itself is visually stunning with detailed shots of the landscape and your tribe.  However, the game has been difficult to play for longer than bursts of ten or fifteen minutes without those same beautiful visuals slowing and eventually freezing my computer until the game shuts down or has to reboot.  My computer has never had these kinds of problems with games before and I am usually patient enough that if I can get a good amount of play time in then I don't mind.  From Dust, however, shuts down too frequently to really do much in a playing session.			"

												This game is a great experience, I think that's what it is.It's not the game of the year. But it's really something new, the control scheme is a bit akward, sometimes you have to play with your camera a lot because YOU ARE and your camera is tied to you. So yeah it can be slightly frustrating in a couple of levels however it's all part of the design.This game is not difficult at all, this game is a refreshing experience, a new way to see god games.  Two third god game, one third puzzle game maybe. 7/10 worth buyingNB: I see some people talking about problems with Uplay. No issues over here and you can play offline.			"

												From Dust is a god game, but not in the way that you might think. Instead of leading a civilization into expansion, you're instead trying to guide them through the world, ""fighting"" against the forces of nature themselves.Tech-wise, the game looks gorgeous, and more importantly has this fantastic physics system in which fluid and dust settle realistically. This is important, because those are what you'll manipulate most of the time, be it to open a path, to let forest spread, to stop fires, whatever is needed. It's an experience unlike any other game out there.However, as much as I like it, I have to say that it's best to pick up the console versions. For a very simple reason, the PC one brings the uPlay DRM, a highly incompetent piece of software developed by Ubi that has a 50/50 chance of denying you the game you just bought. Myself, I had to spend just under an hour tinkering and watching ""update"" bars fill up before the game worked. Even if it was worth the trouble in the end, this sort of abuse with your honest customers is simply ridiculous.If you do want to pick it up on PC anyways, good luck, and have a pad ready. K&M controls here are a love-or-hate thing, and you might want to try both out to see which suits you better.			"

												A very nice sandbox-game handling with water, lava, sand and rock. Growing vegetation and different types of trees can transform your terrain. Threats like tsunamis, forest fire, rain and erruptions are also to be considered. The forming of the the terrain is not static - it lives, it forms itself, you can influence quite everyting.All in one this mixture of populous and lemmings makes me feel playing a good old game BUT at the moment there some issues/negativ points (28.08.2011):- only a bunch of missions (5 hours)- grafix are not optimised for PC, no grafix options - you see poping up trees when you zoom in- no MP, no editor - I've read there will be an update, if the game sells wellNevertheless this is a refresher in that genre of game - it's a very enjoyable game with some moments hectic pace but not at all a stressful game.

												Seems alot cooler than it really is, extremely lackluster. 45% recommended 55% not Before I bought it, I originally thought it was a god sim, but all you do is pick up a small amount of 1 of the 3 kinds of  elements (water,sand,lava) and drop it somewhere else. Such as picking up sand to block a wall of water, or sucking up some water so the uncontrollable villagers can make an uncontrollable village. Basic Gameplay: Once you make it safe, they will create this little outpost that generally gives you some kind of element manipulation buff such as evaporating all the water on the map. The outposts dont change at all. They only have to be protected from the elements. Your objective on every mission is to inhabit every outpost to proceed. Each mission has some sort of unique obstacle that sometimes requires thought to beat. Inbetween these missions you are  rewatching the same cinematic over and over. Thinking about it, it feels like an antfarm sim because you move elements around while you watch the ants do their own thing. Missions are easy. It is a good idea, 'meh' execution. Price should be somewhere around $10, $15 is steep. Pick it up on sale. One of those games that I dont regret playing, but should've passed on.			"

Changes your visionFrom Dust contains great part of the world vision used by mankind to explain its surroundings in pre-christian era: the spoken tradition. Hidden within its storyline and in the bonus tales unlocked, one is able to understand how some of our ancestors saw the world and how they believed they could control it: how their traditions of music and ritual kept their minds tranquil against the perils of natural catastrophe and wild dangers.Not only that, the game is work of art, comprising beautifully executed music, masterful narrative and astonishing visuals, all capable of arousing a sense of longing, of belonging to that ancient past.

												I preordered this game years ago. I played it all the way through with 0 issues in the first couple days of release and loved every minute of it. The gameplay is amazing simple yet super enjoyable. It's a digital sandbox. There really should be more games of this type coming out. Until then, definitely try this one out. Sure, it requires UPlay but don't listen to all the complainers that say it's unplayable. I just redownloaded it an hour ago, had the UPlay crash bug and figured out how to play within 5 minutes. It took almost no effort. They're just being lazy. It's a fun game to mess around in and just relax. I completely recommend it even with the burden that is UPlay.			"

												A pros and cons list about the game itself. Enough♥♥♥♥♥♥has already been said about Uplay.Pros:- The physics engine works beautifully. Making an island, topping it with a volcano then dowsing it with a monster tsunami is rarely this satisfying- Stylish, chill and with gorgeus graphics- audio and atmosphere- Straightforward game mechanicsCons:- The mouse (""the breath"") control takes some getting used to (bad console -> pc port)- Idiotic tribesmen (will blissfully run into the path of an oncoming lava flow or get stuck on a slope and refuse to budge)- campaign is a bit short- Locked 30 fps is a little annoying- (Uplay, if it gives you trouble)Overall, probably best god game I've played so far. 7/10			"

												Overall, this is a good, relaxing game with a good story and interesting set of characters. There are short periods of time pressure that make it fun, and I enjoyed interacting with the environment in the course of casting spells. I'm on the fence about recommending the game, because I eventually gave up on one of the later levels. Thinking back to when I played this game over a year ago, I recall most of the time was spent picking up water and dirt and wishing that I could hold more ""in my hand"" before having to dump it. It made it frustrating. I'm hiding the game from my library because I won't go back. That being said, I did enjoy the few hours I spent on it, and the graphics were thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												If you enjoy redundant layers of DRM/login/moreDRM then this is exactly what you are looking for. Ubisoft requires you to login to ‘UPLAY’, Oh BOY! Christ, will these products of incest ever learn that after we pay them for a game we don’t want them to crawl up our asses and demand 37 layers of DRM? Perhaps we could use some service that already is secure but not obtrusive, I dunno, something like steam. Boy, that would be handy to have a service like steam to validate a game.Is ‘From Dust’ good? Who gives a ♥♥♥♥, one more potentially good game ruined by a room full of fat old corporate sycophants who all slap each other on the back for a job well done. Ubisoft if joining my list of EA and THQ, well done jackasses!			"

												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												Summary: From Dust is an excellent gaming experiment of sorts that cycles back on itself with its brief yet enjoyable campagin.  You play the rold of a god-esque figure that controls the elements and minimally commands your tribe to do tasks (just some simple ""go here and go there"".  The gameplay is fairly simple at the core though in later levels there is more thinking and fast adjusting/reacting required to ensure the tribes survival.  The learning curve is fairly steady as it adds elements or powers into the mix but I will say near the last level is a bit of a jump in dificulty compared to previous levels.   Graphics:  This game came out 4 years ago from writing this (Aug 17, 2011) and the charm and style still holds up strong.  The dynamic effects are convincing and the character design is interesting.  I do wish they had more animals that appeared to diversify the map but since this is a fairly minimalist game it works as is.  Ocasionally the tsunami effect would catch my attention because of a steap drop off or rise in the water that looked bizarre like a wall of water instead a wave but it is what it is.  Gameplay: Simple and intuitive (played with a xbox 360 controller-needed to be enabled in settings each time)  mainly you are just picking up and putting down materials (sand, water or lava, ocasionally plants or totems as well)  The game is a lightly guided sandbox of sorts where you sculpt the land by changing the flow of rivers and lava flows in order to help a tribe of people reach the exit to the level, this must be unlocked by building all of the villiages on the map which are placed on totem locations.  The level design is spot on with these totems being placed in locations that require you to use different elements and tasks to navigate your tribe but the downside is the AI for these tribe members sometimes cripples gameplay.  I encountered them all to offten crying for help because they weren't satisfied with a path to take or a height difference near them requiring some extra sand raising or lowering until satisfaction.   These poor tribesmen (and women) would also freeze up in terror next to flowing water or lava instead of trying to avoid it which often lead to their demise.Story:There isn't a strong narrative here, essentially the tribe is wondering through different areas/realms with the story cycling back on itself toward the ened.  I will give them kudos for making it work though since the focus here really is just the sandbox gameplay and the minimal aproach they took works fine.  Note:Many slam this game for Uplay issues, I don't think this is fair because Uplay isn't the game.  I am not a fan of running through steam to run through Uplay but it just is what it is, the artists and creatives that shelled out heart and soul into this game created something worth experiencing so don't let the game industry politics soil it for you.

Bienb que l'IA ne soit pas trop un problème la majeur partie du temps, ça devient une grande frustration dans certaines phase où certaines action doivent être faites avec une feunêtre temps très réduite.- Les contrôle sont parfois horribles... Encore un portage PC fait à l'arrache. Ca ne pose pas de problème sur console mais c'est horrible où les contrôles sont délicats...- Obliger de passer par la plateforme de Ubisoft pour lancer le jeux >_< En plus elle met des plombes à démarrer...Malgrès quelques coup de geules le jeu vaut le coup juste pour tester sans être extraordinaire pour autant.

												I really like the idea of this game but it has graphical and longevity issues.First off the textures are beyond bad on this game. It's like looking at a 640x480 game zoomed in to a 50'' screen, that's how bad it is, so it will be really noticeable if you look attently (fortunately you don't have to play a lot of time, it's short), that being said it's a straight up port from the consoles.The game concept is really interesting, but it's really simple, for a god game if you have almost no power at all over the world. Basically controlling the ""forces of nature"" (lava/water/land) around your island, e.g. building natural barriers to block tsunamis/volcano eruptions, creating bridges to block rivers.It has a simple campaign format where you play maps with an increased number of powers each, but there's not much of a change in between each, and almost no interest to move on.After a while it just gets old and tiring and the lack of good sandbox game features make it pretty stale, I'd say get it if you like the idea of the game, which is pretty much terraforming an island, but don't expect a sandbox game like black&white.

												Beautiful little game that's got some fantastic mechanics here. The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.The gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.The game is, though, far too short. It feels more like a tutorial campaign. What little is there is very nice, with great music and atmosphere. If in future the mechanic is expanded upon, that's something I'd definitely pick up. For now, this is a great game that's on sale often enough, and is definitely worth a shot when it's at about half the asking price.			"

Requires analytical skill in order to access best way to get the job done. Play gets progressively harder as different dangers from land, sea and plants appear.

												Nice graphics and original storyline, but a god sim this ain't, as it claims to be.  This glorified puzzler has some nice features and original ideas, but the levels are somewhat short and there's not much to do in them, fancy game physics aside.  All right if you're into puzzle games, but anyone expecting something along the lines of Black and White or Populous will be left disappointed, as I was.  Seen better, much better.			"

												I'm going to give this a HUGE thumbs down. I've ahd this updated for a few years (doing updates whenever able) and even re-downlaode donto a new laptop. However, UPLAY crashes every single time I try to play this game. therefore, 0 of 10 stars for this. It' dbe nice getting some support - as that will greatly affect my rating and m yopinion of this game... one of the few that looks awesome from the clips on the store page.			"

												Though I only have some 22 hours in on this game it's still one of my all time favorites. It is challenging at times, but also greatly amusing taking sand for instance until there's only rock left underneath then depositing it somewhere else maybe to change the flow of a river or taking water and dumpinjg it somewhere then watching it splash and flow as real water would. This game is very unique in that I've never played another game like it. The graphics are gorgeous as are the effects.My only complaints is that there isnt a sandbox mode(or at least wasnt the last time I played) which I think would be more entertaining than levels with an end goal. I also think it would be cool if they would have more of a society or city building aspect that you would then have to protect from the elements (There are villagers you have to protect, but their society doesnt develop much past small villages). Finally I'll say that while I like this game I would definitely wait until it's on sale because while it is worth buying it's not worth $15 especially considering I got frustrated with it after 22 hours ($15 dollars to me should give a person at least 96 hours worth). Though if you like a challenging game that will get you frustrated to the point where you have to take a break (like old school games from when I was a kid) only to come back with a new strategy and beat the level then you'll like this game. I personally prefer more relaxing, less challenging games, but there simply isnt any other game like this.Still it's a great game if you're a connoisseur!			"

												This game is full of interesting scenarios. It starts you out fairly simple, but eventually leads you to repelling entire oceans in order to keep a meager hold on your civilization. I have not taken the time to beat this yet, as the later levels are frustratingly difficult.It's only downside is that the pathing of the A.I can be a little silly sometimes, taking a longer - and thus more dangerous - route simply because a little of the dirt you so carefully placed was too high for him to climb.I say that everyone should at least try this game and then decide from there if you want to buy it or not. :D			"

												From Dust (  ) was on sale on Steam the other day and it looked interesting enough to pick up for $5 and so far I’m really enjoying the chance to play around with dirt and water without getting gunk under my nails.Some levels have you rushing to accomplish things in a hurry under a time limit, but most (so far) seem to allow one to play around at one’s leisure. I love making rivers and helping the plants grow across the maps. The tribal lore is interesting too, I rather like the tales of the plants and animals.On the down side, the levels load before the dramatic entry music finishes, creating a jarring moment where it should have been a nice fanfare entry, and one can’t interact much with the tribespeople. I’m wondering if the loading time music cutoff is because I've got it installed on an SSD and it might behave better on a traditional (slower-loading) platter drive.These are relatively minor though. It’s really about playing with the landscape like a helpful, mysterious deity. If you, like me, enjoyed spending hours playing with dirt and water as a child, you might rather dig From Dust. "

												From Dust is an entertaining game that stands out from similar civilization-type games in that you have to craft the land to assist and protect your native people as they go from increasingly inhospitable locations in an effort to find their Ancients who created their world. The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.The real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.I also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.8/10			"

												A very quirky god game which I bought on the strength of the author's nostaligc back catalogue. Its a god sim in which you rise and fall the earth/rocks/water to build small civilisations but are at risk of fire, floods and natural disasters. In many ways, the technology behind the game is more impressive than the game itself which is kind of odd and perhaps a missed opportunity? It's not a game that will thrill you, but if you like unique and different then its worth a look if the sales are on. There are some annoyances, like the inability to skip the cut scene intros to each level, but its a solid 7 out of 10.			"

												I have to admit despite all of the ""gamer rage"" against this game, it really is a neat novel game that is a lot of fun.  I no longer have the ""beast"" of a gaming rig I used to and the game ran flawlessly.  Who really cares if it has an ubisoft loading screen? 99% of people who buy games on steam have a permanent internet connection anyways, so does it really matter if it requires one?  Not really.  The game is well worth $10, maybe not $15, but definatelly $10.  It is alot of fun and frankly as quickly as I figured out the levels I want to play more more more!  Great game and despite all of the ""0h n0e2 DRM!!!"" people the game is, in my opinion, a success!!Buy it, but wait until it goes on sale again!			"

												Though I only have some 22 hours in on this game it's still one of my all time favorites. It is challenging at times, but also greatly amusing taking sand for instance until there's only rock left underneath then depositing it somewhere else maybe to change the flow of a river or taking water and dumpinjg it somewhere then watching it splash and flow as real water would. This game is very unique in that I've never played another game like it. The graphics are gorgeous as are the effects.My only complaints is that there isnt a sandbox mode(or at least wasnt the last time I played) which I think would be more entertaining than levels with an end goal. I also think it would be cool if they would have more of a society or city building aspect that you would then have to protect from the elements (There are villagers you have to protect, but their society doesnt develop much past small villages). Finally I'll say that while I like this game I would definitely wait until it's on sale because while it is worth buying it's not worth $15 especially considering I got frustrated with it after 22 hours ($15 dollars to me should give a person at least 96 hours worth). Though if you like a challenging game that will get you frustrated to the point where you have to take a break (like old school games from when I was a kid) only to come back with a new strategy and beat the level then you'll like this game. I personally prefer more relaxing, less challenging games, but there simply isnt any other game like this.Still it's a great game if you're a connoisseur!			"

PRO:The primary mechanic of manipulating the land is wonderfully executed. Every level is creative and interesting and I never felt like I was just repeating the level before it. This game gets top marks for game design.Furthermore, the presentation is top notch. The water and lava flow beautifully and everything is tied together nicely with a distinct visual style.CON:The problem with this game mainly comes from the fact that it was designed for consoles and poorly adapted for PCs. The mouse vertical/horizontal axes control a little pointer that tracks the terrain rather than the screen, making it needlessly difficult to click things on uneven ground.The game is also filled with unskippable cutscenes. Between levels you repeatedly watch the same cutscene. The scene is only about 60 second longs, but it's still annoying. Also, periodically in a level the game takes control of your camera to slowly pan around the new objective, even if you've played that level before and already seen the cutscene. It breaks the flow of the game and, worse yet, the world doesn't pause for the cutscene. I've lost villages while my camera was seized from me. It's not the end of the world, but it's a ridiculous thing for a game studio to overlook.This combined with the mouse issue leaves me sorely disappointed in Ubisoft's user interface design. Do they have a QA department?There's also no real story to speak of. You just follow a tribe around different levels. The lack of story doesn't seriously detract from the game, but a quality story or just some kind of world building would have certainly added to it.SUMMARY:That said, the game is still engaging and unique. It's short*, but that's just because it's all quality content that they didn't pointlessly recycle (unlike 90% of all other games out there). If you really want more after the ""story"", there are challenge maps.You've probably never played a game like this before. It's worth it on that basis alone. Better still, it's actually quite engaging. This is the best game I've played from Ubisoft that I can remember.* I consider short a pro, since I don't have 100 hours to blow grinding. But I understand that other people feel differently. If you like long games, don't let this game being short dissuade you.			"

												Do NOT buy this game in its current state!  Not only is it an absolutely terrible console port (no video options outside of resolution, capped at 30 FPS, god-awful mouse and keyboard control, and much more), it is poorly optimized and includes Ubisoft's infamously terrible DRM.This would merely be 'bad' (and, really, expected of Ubisoft's PC releases) if not for the fact that Ubisoft outright lied to its customers about what kind of DRM it would have.  An official post on the official forums explicitly and pointedly said it would not have this DRM.  Furthermore, it was not revealed until after the game was released that it would only run on a very limited number of GPUs.This is a perfect example of what a company should not do to gain fans, especially among the somewhat picky PC crowd.  A beautiful game with an interesting concept and low price tag marred by what is quite possibly the worst port ever, with the 'features' of draconian DRM, shoddy optimization and unnecessary UPlay.

												This had much less content than I expected, wasn't that fun, and was hard to control.  It had really impressive tech, which led to some challenging emergent behavior at times.  The AI was finicky and would get stuck or not do what I wanted, and the portrail of the tribal people seemed a little racist.  Apart from completing the ""story"" mode, the overall objective of the game isn't communicated well, and I didn't know if I finished or not.  It did sometimes have a soothing sandbox feel to it, but it was mostly tedious and it was hard to care about this game at all.			"

												In general I like the game. However, the gameplay is a bit repetitive: manipulating water or some other liquid that in more than a foot will stop your people. It seems the game is more about stopping the elements from killing your people rather than seeing what you can do with them. The concept is intriguing which was the selling point of the game for me. Not the best puzzle/god game I've played, nor is it the worst.I wouldn't mind whatever discussion comes about due to this review.			"

												From Dust is somewhat of a god game. You play as invisible force of nature that goes around sucking up things like sand and water which you can then re-distribute as you please. The object of this game is to save the village people from things like tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. After you save the village people, you must safely guide them to a totem, which they dance around for a bit, magically creating another village which you'll have to protect as well. I say ""somewhat of a god game"" because for a ""god game"", your powers are very limited and initially very cool, but as you dive deeper into the games mechanics, you'll wonder what is so god-like about your character. This is a game you will either love or hate. Keep in mind, there is NO GRAPHIC SETTINGS MENU in this game. You can't change the texture quality or shaders or anything of that sort. If your computer isn't very good. Stay away from this one. Fans of this genre will love this game, while others may not.			"

												This game is honestly really cool. The campaign takes you through the journey of the people that lost the knowledge of their ancestors. It's very fun creating your own islands out of nothing. The game also has a very intelligent environmental system. Rivers will carry sediment down stream and expand the land, lava will steadily flow from erupting volcanos and cool to create rock. You can also change the weather! If you add too much water at a very high altitude, it will actually start to rain! This game does a very good job at creating the ultimate living sandbox. I'd recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Overall. 4 of 5 stars.I loved this game. I've had some of my best moments introducing friends to game using this one. I dont know how the game is typically marketed but I say its a puzzle game, and you have to do a specific set of thing to get your tribe (or whatever) from one mission to another. After you beat a level you can go back to completed levels to mess around and I tend to have the most fun messing around. On the otherhand the interface can be frustraingly difficult to work with (enough so that I've had people give up before getting past the 2nd level) and a lot of people wont have fun playing because of it. The AI of the units you have to control tends to leave them standing at cliffs and rocks that are difficult to cross waiting for the people to make them a path over them instead of walking around them on the simpler path and on some occasions they wont take a control point claiming there is an obstruction when they are standing right by it. The only game mode is the puzzle mode starting you off in increasingly more dire situations which can make play exhausting.  "

												This is a unique game which conceptually is very good. Go to YouTube and look at some gameplay and see if you like what you see. The story and idea are unique. The I will say this, the camera mechanics are horrible, and there is little you can do from the configuration to change it. Your screen wil start wandering if you don't heve the retical in dead center. It is a shame it was not more popular, as this probably would have been fixed with a patch. It is still a fun game.			"

												I recommend NOT TO BUY this! Game is interesting and could have been fun, but comes with Ubisoft's disgusting 'uplay' 3rd party DRM interface. It is ugly, insecure (30 Jul 12 - uplay browser plugins, stealth install and serious security vulnerability) and serves up ads you cannot block. I will never ever buy another Ubisoft game again and I recommend you join me in blacklisting them.Remove uplay plugins from FF: about:config and set plugin.expose_full_path TRUE, then about:plugins to see the full path; then physically delete them from where they live on your hard drive.

												This game is a ""God-style"" strategy game. Each level/map consists of completing a terrain puzzle to capture control points, which opens the ""portal"" to the next level. The terrain physics are fun, but this game is too easy and short for me to really enjoy it. The puzzles are too simplistic. In each level you have only a small set of powers available to you (which can change from map to map) which you use to adjust the landscape of the level to complete your puzzle. In my first playthrough of the game, there was only one level I had to stop and think about how to solve. I was expecting more difficult puzzles from a god-mode game and more interesting maps. The landscape is not as ""pretty"" as I would expect from a game focused completely on *the landscape,* so I was expecting the art in this to be a bit better. It's not bad...just not what I think it should be for a game all about the ground and things coming from it. I was deeply disappointed in the last level of the game.[[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]The very last level is all the level building tools now opened to you as ""god"" to build a world for your people. There is no challenge. You just throw some dirt down. How is that a good last level for any game like this?? There is no puzzle and no challenge here. Why did you ""teach"" me different ways of manipulating the lava, water, and rock mechanics and then not have some kind of ultimate challenge level that requires I use my knowledge gained from all the prior maps? [[[[[[[[[[/END SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]Kind of a let down. Not sure why this game got as high a rating as it did from critics. I got maybe 4-5 real play hours out of this.			"

												Beautiful little game that's got some fantastic mechanics here. The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.The gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.The game is, though, far too short. It feels more like a tutorial campaign. What little is there is very nice, with great music and atmosphere. If in future the mechanic is expanded upon, that's something I'd definitely pick up. For now, this is a great game that's on sale often enough, and is definitely worth a shot when it's at about half the asking price.			"

												6 hours game time. Finished the game. It's sad, especially since this game is actually quite amazingly beautiful. The ebb and flow (and the destructive force) of nature is artistically rendered. I found myself cheering on my little settlers as they tried to outrun a tsunami and also yelling at them in anger as they stupidly run towards a lava flow - all whilst trying to scoop up some of the enivronment to delay their impending doom. I'd rate this 8/10 if the game was cheaper or a LOT longer, but unfortunately the hype, cost and length of this game gets it 4/10.			"

												In general I like the game. However, the gameplay is a bit repetitive: manipulating water or some other liquid that in more than a foot will stop your people. It seems the game is more about stopping the elements from killing your people rather than seeing what you can do with them. The concept is intriguing which was the selling point of the game for me. Not the best puzzle/god game I've played, nor is it the worst.I wouldn't mind whatever discussion comes about due to this review.			"

												From Dust is somewhat of a god game. You play as invisible force of nature that goes around sucking up things like sand and water which you can then re-distribute as you please. The object of this game is to save the village people from things like tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. After you save the village people, you must safely guide them to a totem, which they dance around for a bit, magically creating another village which you'll have to protect as well. I say ""somewhat of a god game"" because for a ""god game"", your powers are very limited and initially very cool, but as you dive deeper into the games mechanics, you'll wonder what is so god-like about your character. This is a game you will either love or hate. Keep in mind, there is NO GRAPHIC SETTINGS MENU in this game. You can't change the texture quality or shaders or anything of that sort. If your computer isn't very good. Stay away from this one. Fans of this genre will love this game, while others may not.			"

												Ever wonder if nature was ever in your grasp? how about within your control?Go back to ancient times once more to discover a lost civilization capable of moving lava, raising tides, planting plants (I know sounds ridiculous), and makeing land. Sounds fun right? Being able to be god and create nature with your grasp. Here's the catch, before your god your weak. A Pathetic little, nearly insignificant person who can't even control nature. So in order to become a so-called-god. (At least I think I was a god).One must verge onwards!Through raging tides!Mountainous volcano's!Unforgiving Floods!Horrifying Fires!Honestly, the dust at my shoes accumulated so much I find it so unappealling. But for this game. I highly enjoyed it, it offered a breath of new originality, gameplay, and most of all ingenuity. The story would be average at best, if you're looking for a small time get-a-way from AAA titles. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a new life, from the seriuos pace of high rated games. And just for kicks out there, The Dust at my shoes originated from somewhere, it's just I forgot where. Although... the game does provide a good measure of mental working through the brain into working out it's kinks (if you know what I mean). I wouldn't coonsider them really puzzles, like that of Portal, but it provides the brain with yet another mental work, that should at least be enjoyable to any Dusty New-comers.From Sea to Land to Fire and now Dust...7.4/10			"

												I was quite excited for this game, even though it is from Ubisoft.  I was hoping for something creative and sandboxy, but it ends up being extremely linear and you can only play with what they want you to play with.  There is no sandbox mode, just a somewhat frustrating story (Like when you get to the fire tree level) and challenges (which are only unlocked by playing the story mode.The game looks terrible on PC..  Very limited graphics options and 30fps cap.  It doesn't seem to run very smooth for me either.  My biggest issue with From Dust are the controls.  It doesn't have the typical RTS type feel.  Your curser is very sluggish with all the objectives that require quick mousemovements, it is very frustrating to get your ""breath"" from point A to point B.  Also, you move both your curser and the entire screen with the WASD keys, while moving your mouse only gives you a small amount of room to play around before the entire screen moves.  Wait for deal, no more typing room.			"

It is ugly, insecure (30 Jul 12 - uplay browser plugins, stealth install and serious security vulnerability) and serves up ads you cannot block. I will never ever buy another Ubisoft game again and I recommend you join me in blacklisting them.Remove uplay plugins from FF: about:config and set plugin.expose_full_path TRUE, then about:plugins to see the full path; then physically delete them from where they live on your hard drive.

												This game is a ""God-style"" strategy game. Each level/map consists of completing a terrain puzzle to capture control points, which opens the ""portal"" to the next level. The terrain physics are fun, but this game is too easy and short for me to really enjoy it. The puzzles are too simplistic. In each level you have only a small set of powers available to you (which can change from map to map) which you use to adjust the landscape of the level to complete your puzzle. In my first playthrough of the game, there was only one level I had to stop and think about how to solve. I was expecting more difficult puzzles from a god-mode game and more interesting maps. The landscape is not as ""pretty"" as I would expect from a game focused completely on *the landscape,* so I was expecting the art in this to be a bit better. It's not bad...just not what I think it should be for a game all about the ground and things coming from it. I was deeply disappointed in the last level of the game.[[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]The very last level is all the level building tools now opened to you as ""god"" to build a world for your people. There is no challenge. You just throw some dirt down. How is that a good last level for any game like this?? There is no puzzle and no challenge here. Why did you ""teach"" me different ways of manipulating the lava, water, and rock mechanics and then not have some kind of ultimate challenge level that requires I use my knowledge gained from all the prior maps? [[[[[[[[[[/END SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]Kind of a let down. Not sure why this game got as high a rating as it did from critics. I got maybe 4-5 real play hours out of this.			"

												Some people deserve to die.In the case of 'From Dust' its your♥♥♥♥♥♥head worshipers. How they die is up to you. This game is really great if you just wanna sit there and watch a landscape change. Lava cuts canals through the land like a fifteen year old with a razor blade, Tsunamis wash in and drown countless masked villagers like so many forgotten toddlers and fire tears through bark huts like a fat women at the buffet. its also got a neat puzzle solving aspect to it. The only problem with the game, however, is that unlike other god simulators (Black and white 1 & 2) you can't directly interact with your villagers. Where in Black and white you could cathartically hurl idiot villages against♥♥♥♥♥♥because they angered you, in 'From dust' all you can do is sit and watch and hope they dont develop better path finding before the next tsunami hits.

												Let me start by saying: From Dust is not a god-game and shouldn't be considered as such. It is not Populous (to which it has been compared to in various reviews) or Black & White or even Dungeon Keeper. And this is why people hate From Dust, they compare it to the wrong genre. Although you can't slap your people on the face, drown them intentionally or crush their homes and dreams (well, you can, but then it's game over) From Dust does have similarities to these titles. It has puny little humans and an omnipotent player that controls the surroundings and as such, indirectly also these puny little people. And it is beautiful and it has a physics engine unlike any other game. But in my view, From Dust is most reminicent of Lemmings: guide your people (the puny little humans) to safety via manipulation of the world around them. Raise the earth to create a bridge over water or drain a pond. And it is actually pretty cool. A bit repetitive in the long run perhaps, but a nice niche game.			"

												I haven't been unable to run it the first time I got it, but one day I had a huge hangover, decided to give it a try and it ran without problems. I finished in two days:The gameplay is basically a Lemmings in 3d with the ability to sculpt the Earth.  Physics on the engine are pretty impressive, you get a sense of gravity, mass, erosion, etc. Art fits great, shammanic vibes, tribes are interesting and it's all well rounded with a very organic music and sound effects.Controls could do way better with M+KB, it seems that it was designed to play with a gamepad in mind. In any case, most of the time you'll be just clicking and pressing 1,2,3,4 and/or spacebar.It feels like it was going to be bigger, to me it felt short, I really wish there were more content available. The last levels were great. I'll give it a 9/10 "

												Do NOT buy this game in its current state!  Not only is it an absolutely terrible console port (no video options outside of resolution, capped at 30 FPS, god-awful mouse and keyboard control, and much more), it is poorly optimized and includes Ubisoft's infamously terrible DRM.This would merely be 'bad' (and, really, expected of Ubisoft's PC releases) if not for the fact that Ubisoft outright lied to its customers about what kind of DRM it would have.  An official post on the official forums explicitly and pointedly said it would not have this DRM.  Furthermore, it was not revealed until after the game was released that it would only run on a very limited number of GPUs.This is a perfect example of what a company should not do to gain fans, especially among the somewhat picky PC crowd.  A beautiful game with an interesting concept and low price tag marred by what is quite possibly the worst port ever, with the 'features' of draconian DRM, shoddy optimization and unnecessary UPlay.

												Very innovative game. The nature effects, such as the crashing of waves on the shore, flow of water down a natural river, and flowing lava are amazing. The story mode is challenging and requires you to spend extra time on the map to fully unlock all the story/challenge 'memories'. Sadly, this suffers from bad console port syndrome, as there are some graphical anomolies, sound weirdness, cutscenes abruptly ending, and some control weirdness. The game is still very playable and lots of fun. I would've liked to see a sandbox mode, where you can start with a blank slate and just start building your own land mass and/or make your own maps to challenge friends. Definitely worth the price point. I estimate the game story mode takes about 4-5 hours to complete.			"

												On paper, the concept behind From Dust is filled with promises. A simulator where you can manipulate terrains on a whim? Groundbreaking! But despite its enormous potential, this title ends up offering too little.From Dust is no more a simulator than it is a puzzle. In its (short) story mode, you are tasked with occupying totems scattered throughout several islands. Your opposition comes from the destructive forces of storms, tsunamis, and magma. Against these, you must utilize your godlike abilities to construct a safe haven.Outside the campaign are dozens of challenge maps. Here, you are given a limited set of abilities with which you'll use to accomplish an objective, be it migrating tribes or saving them from extinction.Once the campaign and challenges are completed, that's it. There is little to no reason to replay this game unless you really enjoyed it. The unreleased map editor would've gone a long way to making this a lasting title, but alas, it isn't one.Grade: B-			"

												This game is honestly really cool. The campaign takes you through the journey of the people that lost the knowledge of their ancestors. It's very fun creating your own islands out of nothing. The game also has a very intelligent environmental system. Rivers will carry sediment down stream and expand the land, lava will steadily flow from erupting volcanos and cool to create rock. You can also change the weather! If you add too much water at a very high altitude, it will actually start to rain! This game does a very good job at creating the ultimate living sandbox. I'd recommend this game to anyone.			"

None of the levels are terribly difficult. The controls leave  a bit to be desired and the lack of video options (the game looks low-end hd and doesn't scale) is a poorly conceived corner to cut. _______________________________________________________________________________Don't buy it yet.

												Summary: From Dust is an excellent gaming experiment of sorts that cycles back on itself with its brief yet enjoyable campagin.  You play the rold of a god-esque figure that controls the elements and minimally commands your tribe to do tasks (just some simple ""go here and go there"".  The gameplay is fairly simple at the core though in later levels there is more thinking and fast adjusting/reacting required to ensure the tribes survival.  The learning curve is fairly steady as it adds elements or powers into the mix but I will say near the last level is a bit of a jump in dificulty compared to previous levels.   Graphics:  This game came out 4 years ago from writing this (Aug 17, 2011) and the charm and style still holds up strong.  The dynamic effects are convincing and the character design is interesting.  I do wish they had more animals that appeared to diversify the map but since this is a fairly minimalist game it works as is.  Ocasionally the tsunami effect would catch my attention because of a steap drop off or rise in the water that looked bizarre like a wall of water instead a wave but it is what it is.  Gameplay: Simple and intuitive (played with a xbox 360 controller-needed to be enabled in settings each time)  mainly you are just picking up and putting down materials (sand, water or lava, ocasionally plants or totems as well)  The game is a lightly guided sandbox of sorts where you sculpt the land by changing the flow of rivers and lava flows in order to help a tribe of people reach the exit to the level, this must be unlocked by building all of the villiages on the map which are placed on totem locations.  The level design is spot on with these totems being placed in locations that require you to use different elements and tasks to navigate your tribe but the downside is the AI for these tribe members sometimes cripples gameplay.  I encountered them all to offten crying for help because they weren't satisfied with a path to take or a height difference near them requiring some extra sand raising or lowering until satisfaction.   These poor tribesmen (and women) would also freeze up in terror next to flowing water or lava instead of trying to avoid it which often lead to their demise.Story:There isn't a strong narrative here, essentially the tribe is wondering through different areas/realms with the story cycling back on itself toward the ened.  I will give them kudos for making it work though since the focus here really is just the sandbox gameplay and the minimal aproach they took works fine.  Note:Many slam this game for Uplay issues, I don't think this is fair because Uplay isn't the game.  I am not a fan of running through steam to run through Uplay but it just is what it is, the artists and creatives that shelled out heart and soul into this game created something worth experiencing so don't let the game industry politics soil it for you.

												This game is very weird. Totally didn't expect it. You have your little villagers that you send to one of four totems in each world.  Once all four totems are settled, you can move onto the next level. What makes it hard is the tsunamis, volcanos, flooding, and such that destroys your villages. You have to pick up sand from around the map and create walls and pathways over rivers to get to the totems. The game is about not managing the villages themselves like a civ game, but more protecting them by redirecting the elements.It wasn't bad, but I only got a few hours out of it. If it's cheap, I'd get it. You don't get the 'free to create' sandbox by the end though, and I had enough of the game once I got there.			"

												Seems alot cooler than it really is, extremely lackluster. 45% recommended 55% not Before I bought it, I originally thought it was a god sim, but all you do is pick up a small amount of 1 of the 3 kinds of  elements (water,sand,lava) and drop it somewhere else. Such as picking up sand to block a wall of water, or sucking up some water so the uncontrollable villagers can make an uncontrollable village. Basic Gameplay: Once you make it safe, they will create this little outpost that generally gives you some kind of element manipulation buff such as evaporating all the water on the map. The outposts dont change at all. They only have to be protected from the elements. Your objective on every mission is to inhabit every outpost to proceed. Each mission has some sort of unique obstacle that sometimes requires thought to beat. Inbetween these missions you are  rewatching the same cinematic over and over. Thinking about it, it feels like an antfarm sim because you move elements around while you watch the ants do their own thing. Missions are easy. It is a good idea, 'meh' execution. Price should be somewhere around $10, $15 is steep. Pick it up on sale. One of those games that I dont regret playing, but should've passed on.			"

												The single main negative point first.... this game does use Ubisofts online DRM service, but beyond initially registering your key (which itself is a simple ""Enter key here"" box so not an elaborate task), you just need to be online to launch.The game itself can be summed up in alot less words than the DRM system, ""A lot of fun, providing you got the imagination to enjoy sandbox games"". If you can't play a game without some gruff chap on the radio going ""Get your♥♥♥♥♥to the neon pink arrow scum!"", don't even bother thinking about this game.The physics on the geology shaping is well done, the graphics are fantastic in places, not so great in others (Console port after all) and regardless to what the trailer may give the impression of the weather sequences are NOT cutscenes, they're realtime events going down that interact with the world as you have shaped it.Just don't go experimenting with volcanos... that often leads to everyone dead in fiery badness :\			"

Please look for his original post to get the game working again.The game was much better before the Ubisoft DRM update.

												This game is fun, but short.  It claims to be a god game, but don't go in expecting something like Black and White, Populous, or Sim City.  In many ways this is more of a puzzle game.It fun enough, I have fired it up and worked through it a couple times.  Currently, i have 11 hours of game play on it.  I recommend, but consider you will likely beat it in well under 10 hours of game play.			"

												From Dust, a game that has no need for words. Besides the refreshingly ingenious mechanic of controlling the ""breath of life"", shaping and creating the planet as you will, it is just beautiful to see the land turn from rough wilderness to flourishing areas of vegetation and frightful to see it vanish into flames or drown under huge tsunamis... So better not stand in awe for too long, otherwise your native inhabitants will meet the end of their civilization pretty quickly.+ Plainly beautiful graphics, even in 2016+ Ingenious mechanic+ Great god-game experience+ Adequate learning curve+ Interesting challanges and collectibles - Uplay integration "

												My recommendation is DO NOT BUY.If you didn't notice in the fine print:3rd-party DRM: Ubisoft Online ServiceThat's UPlay, Ubisoft's always-on DRM with a separate patcher (for the DRM), separate updater (for the game) and separate account and login. I haven't managed to get to the actual game part yet thanks to all the Ubisoft crud and hoops they want you to jump through before they will allow you to load the game.(And yes, you will see three separate ""Now patching..."" prompts with progress bars before you get to the UPlay login screen.)As a side note, the UPlay username ""WhyDoIHaveToDoThis?"" is already taken. So are ""WhyGodWhy"", ""WhyDoIBother"", ""UbisoftAreIdiots"", ""UPlayIsStupid"", and ""KillMeNow"". At that point I got bored and mashed the keyboard. So look me up, I'm sazwethiujolk on UPlay. (Also, UPlay requires your birth date but limits it to an earliest year of 1910, requiring those of us born before that date to lie in answer to the question.)			"

												TL;DR: *DO NOT BUY THIS GAME*The game is brilliant, it's a lot of fun and the main game mechanic is fresh. It really revolutionized the repetative RTS schema of gameplay. While I could play it (pre Uplay) I had a lot of fun. I can no longer play this game, it won't load past Uplay crashing.UbiSoft's ""Uplay"" DRM makes the game unplayable (as in IT WONT START). I bought the pre-order and have recently re-installed it to check out the flak that Uplay is getting. It doesn't run because of UPlay. UPlay crashes immediately, I can't even log in to it. If you were also bent over the table by Ubisoft, please join me in a boycott of all future Ubisoft products.			"

It's a sort of puzzle game where you control sand, lava and water to shape the land to help lead your little tribesman to totems.The game leads you to different set pieces with volcanoes or geysers here and there.Overall, it's a soothing game that left me satisfied. It could probably be much more than it is though. The physics engine is a whole lot of fun.			"

												From Dust is an entertaining game that stands out from similar civilization-type games in that you have to craft the land to assist and protect your native people as they go from increasingly inhospitable locations in an effort to find their Ancients who created their world. The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.The real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.I also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.8/10			"

												I love god simulators, and once upon a time, this game gave me some satisfaction. Then the game required Uplay, then it couldn't run at all.I've never seen a game become more broken with age like this game has. Every level feels identical, bar having maybe one different obstacle or challenge. Transitions are repeated, the story is non-existent, and did I mention this game is broken? I played this game years ago when I was a kid, and it ran fine. It ran a bit slow on my laptop, but it functioned. I could get by. Here I am on a superior laptop years later, and the game crashes on the first level.Ubisoft... ya're eff ups; everywona ya. You broke god. Not just any god. Me god. Me. To be fair, I'm 90% certain that beating the final levels of this game wouldn't have given a satisfacting ending. And the only reason I couldn't get that far was because the later levels had so much crap going on at once that it overheated my laptop. It was the first, and one of the only games to do that.			"

												Ever since Black&White, I have waited for a new game where you get to be a god. I mean, who doesn't want to be the one who controls mother nature? The game gets off at an easy start, to get you comfortable in controlling, how to shape the nature. For example, by making a new path over a river by dropping sand. Throughout the game, you get to help these ""citizens""... (or whatever you wanna call it) ...to build villages. But in order for them to survive, you need to control and keep an eye on the nature, so they won't get killed by, for example, a flood.As you move on in the game, you get to control more and more elements of the nature, as the missions allso gets even harder.In the long run, this game is awesome! You get to be a god, with small people who rely on YOU to keep them safe on their journey.Downsides:There's only one (1) cinematic, that you get to see between every new mission/map.The camera view controls could be more sensitive.

												这个游戏真是相当有意思，控制地形帮助土著居民获得totem很是太有创意了。而且游戏效果做的相当不错，水的波纹做的很真实。游戏难度不高，但是后面几关难度不低，我重新开始了好几遍才过了。另外游戏控制有点别扭，有时候鼠标快速移动之后还得等镜头跟上了才好操作。而且土著寻路路线有时候让人很蛋疼。。。但是瑕不掩瑜，这个价格对得起它的游戏性。meta76我觉得低了，怎么也有80左右。			"

												This game is kinda a cross between a sim game and a puzzle game.  You have to manipulate the environment in order to allow your little people to build villages and ultimately unlock a doorway to the next level.But you have to protect the villages and villagers from all sorts of natural disasters like errupting volcanos and tidal waves by building walls with rock and sand, or helping your shamans get protective songs for the villages.My only complaint about the game is that the campaign mode seemed a bit short.  I am currently working through the challanges though which is all puzzles and beating the clock.			"

												Dear Ubisoft,From Dust is a great game. I've been played it on Xbox 360 and loved it, but it crashes on the harder levels almost every time. Now I bought the game for PC over Steam, thought I could now enjoy the game to its fullest. But not with you Ubisoft, you got a nice trick to keep me from playing called uPlay (how ironic), which crashes EVERY time i want to start it.TL;DR You want me to install and use your DRM, which is idiotic, but i can live with it. But then your Software did not even work, what makes it impossible to play the game I purchased. Sincerey,a concerned user			"

												U-play is terrible, most people know that, but since this is a review of the game itself I'm going to be looking past that for those who are just interested in the game.From Dust is beautiful, it can be challenging without being so difficult as to be stressful which I feel would detract from how pretty this game is. The mechanics are nice, and honestly some of the sounds in the game are downright soothing. I also found that while occasionally I'd get frustrated when the villagers made poor choices with their route, in general I actually wanted to protect them, again because the game isn't rage-quit inducing.So yes, I'd recommend the game itself, but due to the compulsory U-play I most likely won't be playing more now that I'm done with the main story since I just want rid of U-play. As with many others I purchased this game when the U-play DRM had been removed and then I went back to it and it was there. It's sad really that such a wonderful game is let down by something like this.TL;DR: From Dust is good as a game in and of itself but obviously U-play is rubbish.			"

												The single main negative point first.... this game does use Ubisofts online DRM service, but beyond initially registering your key (which itself is a simple ""Enter key here"" box so not an elaborate task), you just need to be online to launch.The game itself can be summed up in alot less words than the DRM system, ""A lot of fun, providing you got the imagination to enjoy sandbox games"". If you can't play a game without some gruff chap on the radio going ""Get your♥♥♥♥♥to the neon pink arrow scum!"", don't even bother thinking about this game.The physics on the geology shaping is well done, the graphics are fantastic in places, not so great in others (Console port after all) and regardless to what the trailer may give the impression of the weather sequences are NOT cutscenes, they're realtime events going down that interact with the world as you have shaped it.Just don't go experimenting with volcanos... that often leads to everyone dead in fiery badness :\			"

												Seems alot cooler than it really is, extremely lackluster. 45% recommended 55% not Before I bought it, I originally thought it was a god sim, but all you do is pick up a small amount of 1 of the 3 kinds of  elements (water,sand,lava) and drop it somewhere else. Such as picking up sand to block a wall of water, or sucking up some water so the uncontrollable villagers can make an uncontrollable village. Basic Gameplay: Once you make it safe, they will create this little outpost that generally gives you some kind of element manipulation buff such as evaporating all the water on the map. The outposts dont change at all. They only have to be protected from the elements. Your objective on every mission is to inhabit every outpost to proceed. Each mission has some sort of unique obstacle that sometimes requires thought to beat. Inbetween these missions you are  rewatching the same cinematic over and over. Thinking about it, it feels like an antfarm sim because you move elements around while you watch the ants do their own thing. Missions are easy. It is a good idea, 'meh' execution. Price should be somewhere around $10, $15 is steep. Pick it up on sale. One of those games that I dont regret playing, but should've passed on.			"

												You can't actually play this game through steam, there are specific convoluted steps you must follow to get this game to run.I took me a while to finally find instructions on how to get the game installed properly, I will do you a favor and link the instructions I found:


A guide to the game and how to get it started 
A Guide for From Dust

			This guide will teach you first how to get the game working and then after that (eventually) it will give you a walkthrough on how to beat the variouse levels.		


But I never actually got the stupid game running since Uplay would crash every time I tried to start it. It looks like a really fun game but Uplay is a horrible platform and Ubisoft	doesn't care about their customers enough to do anything to help them. all they want is your money$$$Hopefully you have better luck getting this game running, but since I wasted 2 hours of my life unsuccessfully trying to get this game running, there is no way i can recommend anyone else to even try.

												On paper, the concept behind From Dust is filled with promises. A simulator where you can manipulate terrains on a whim? Groundbreaking! But despite its enormous potential, this title ends up offering too little.From Dust is no more a simulator than it is a puzzle. In its (short) story mode, you are tasked with occupying totems scattered throughout several islands. Your opposition comes from the destructive forces of storms, tsunamis, and magma. Against these, you must utilize your godlike abilities to construct a safe haven.Outside the campaign are dozens of challenge maps. Here, you are given a limited set of abilities with which you'll use to accomplish an objective, be it migrating tribes or saving them from extinction.Once the campaign and challenges are completed, that's it. There is little to no reason to replay this game unless you really enjoyed it. The unreleased map editor would've gone a long way to making this a lasting title, but alas, it isn't one.Grade: B-			"

												Having played on other platforms and Steam when it came out the game is pretty good, quite simple but original and fun none the less. I would recommend buying on a console rather than PC . Even the steam version requires you to log into UPlay before launching for an extra un-wanted piece of DRM. As of December 2015 UPlay fails to load properly and consequently the game can't start, it looks like this has been an ongoing issue fora while now. There is a work around for this on the Steam forums but it's a pain to have to work through to play something which is already registered to Steam!!			"

There are short periods of time pressure that make it fun, and I enjoyed interacting with the environment in the course of casting spells. I'm on the fence about recommending the game, because I eventually gave up on one of the later levels. Thinking back to when I played this game over a year ago, I recall most of the time was spent picking up water and dirt and wishing that I could hold more ""in my hand"" before having to dump it. It made it frustrating. I'm hiding the game from my library because I won't go back. That being said, I did enjoy the few hours I spent on it, and the graphics were thoroughly enjoyable.			"

												Summary: From Dust is an excellent gaming experiment of sorts that cycles back on itself with its brief yet enjoyable campagin.  You play the rold of a god-esque figure that controls the elements and minimally commands your tribe to do tasks (just some simple ""go here and go there"".  The gameplay is fairly simple at the core though in later levels there is more thinking and fast adjusting/reacting required to ensure the tribes survival.  The learning curve is fairly steady as it adds elements or powers into the mix but I will say near the last level is a bit of a jump in dificulty compared to previous levels.   Graphics:  This game came out 4 years ago from writing this (Aug 17, 2011) and the charm and style still holds up strong.  The dynamic effects are convincing and the character design is interesting.  I do wish they had more animals that appeared to diversify the map but since this is a fairly minimalist game it works as is.  Ocasionally the tsunami effect would catch my attention because of a steap drop off or rise in the water that looked bizarre like a wall of water instead a wave but it is what it is.  Gameplay: Simple and intuitive (played with a xbox 360 controller-needed to be enabled in settings each time)  mainly you are just picking up and putting down materials (sand, water or lava, ocasionally plants or totems as well)  The game is a lightly guided sandbox of sorts where you sculpt the land by changing the flow of rivers and lava flows in order to help a tribe of people reach the exit to the level, this must be unlocked by building all of the villiages on the map which are placed on totem locations.  The level design is spot on with these totems being placed in locations that require you to use different elements and tasks to navigate your tribe but the downside is the AI for these tribe members sometimes cripples gameplay.  I encountered them all to offten crying for help because they weren't satisfied with a path to take or a height difference near them requiring some extra sand raising or lowering until satisfaction.   These poor tribesmen (and women) would also freeze up in terror next to flowing water or lava instead of trying to avoid it which often lead to their demise.Story:There isn't a strong narrative here, essentially the tribe is wondering through different areas/realms with the story cycling back on itself toward the ened.  I will give them kudos for making it work though since the focus here really is just the sandbox gameplay and the minimal aproach they took works fine.  Note:Many slam this game for Uplay issues, I don't think this is fair because Uplay isn't the game.  I am not a fan of running through steam to run through Uplay but it just is what it is, the artists and creatives that shelled out heart and soul into this game created something worth experiencing so don't let the game industry politics soil it for you.

												这个游戏真是相当有意思，控制地形帮助土著居民获得totem很是太有创意了。而且游戏效果做的相当不错，水的波纹做的很真实。游戏难度不高，但是后面几关难度不低，我重新开始了好几遍才过了。另外游戏控制有点别扭，有时候鼠标快速移动之后还得等镜头跟上了才好操作。而且土著寻路路线有时候让人很蛋疼。。。但是瑕不掩瑜，这个价格对得起它的游戏性。meta76我觉得低了，怎么也有80左右。			"

												It's a very overproduced Puzzle Game, not a Simulation, not a God Game. The puzzles aren't overly complex, and in fact difficulty stems not from figuring out what to do, but actually managing to do whatever has to be done while battling against the controls and mechanics that are inaccurate and indirect at best, but had to be so the game could flaunt its all-style presentation with unfortunately little substance. It's pretty to look at, has a lot of flair and some nice extra things to find that give you a little blurb of text full of pathos, but the core game is.... well, there's very little game here, since, again, the puzzles are shallow and its all in the menial ""work"" of executing what you want to do. You might aswell go play darts with a friend or something, except unlike playing this Singleplayer game, there'd actually be some investment in the competition and your own performance other than simply killing time.

Changes your visionFrom Dust contains great part of the world vision used by mankind to explain its surroundings in pre-christian era: the spoken tradition. Hidden within its storyline and in the bonus tales unlocked, one is able to understand how some of our ancestors saw the world and how they believed they could control it: how their traditions of music and ritual kept their minds tranquil against the perils of natural catastrophe and wild dangers.Not only that, the game is work of art, comprising beautifully executed music, masterful narrative and astonishing visuals, all capable of arousing a sense of longing, of belonging to that ancient past.

												TL;DR: *DO NOT BUY THIS GAME*The game is brilliant, it's a lot of fun and the main game mechanic is fresh. It really revolutionized the repetative RTS schema of gameplay. While I could play it (pre Uplay) I had a lot of fun. I can no longer play this game, it won't load past Uplay crashing.UbiSoft's ""Uplay"" DRM makes the game unplayable (as in IT WONT START). I bought the pre-order and have recently re-installed it to check out the flak that Uplay is getting. It doesn't run because of UPlay. UPlay crashes immediately, I can't even log in to it. If you were also bent over the table by Ubisoft, please join me in a boycott of all future Ubisoft products.			"

It could probably be much more than it is though. The physics engine is a whole lot of fun.			"

												From Dust, a game that has no need for words. Besides the refreshingly ingenious mechanic of controlling the ""breath of life"", shaping and creating the planet as you will, it is just beautiful to see the land turn from rough wilderness to flourishing areas of vegetation and frightful to see it vanish into flames or drown under huge tsunamis... So better not stand in awe for too long, otherwise your native inhabitants will meet the end of their civilization pretty quickly.+ Plainly beautiful graphics, even in 2016+ Ingenious mechanic+ Great god-game experience+ Adequate learning curve+ Interesting challanges and collectibles - Uplay integration "

I haven't managed to get to the actual game part yet thanks to all the Ubisoft crud and hoops they want you to jump through before they will allow you to load the game.(And yes, you will see three separate ""Now patching..."" prompts with progress bars before you get to the UPlay login screen.)As a side note, the UPlay username ""WhyDoIHaveToDoThis?"" is already taken. So are ""WhyGodWhy"", ""WhyDoIBother"", ""UbisoftAreIdiots"", ""UPlayIsStupid"", and ""KillMeNow"". At that point I got bored and mashed the keyboard. So look me up, I'm sazwethiujolk on UPlay. (Also, UPlay requires your birth date but limits it to an earliest year of 1910, requiring those of us born before that date to lie in answer to the question.)			"
