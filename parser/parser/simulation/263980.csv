												Put a quarter into the arcade machine and play this one. Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale.

												Ok, let's be honest: I bought this game for 0,19€ and thought it would be 'okay' for a couple of minutes, I'd grab the cards and then it would disappear in the library, never to be looked at again. After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour. Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet. Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!

												Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too. Not to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.			"

												Bought it for 17 cents during the summer sale, and out of all the games I bought (Garry's Mod,  etc.) this was still my favorite. Very platform-y, and not only has great music but also great visuals. Would higly reccomend to anyone. Best 17 cents of my life.			"

												Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat. The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything. The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.

 About Out There Somewhere Game starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix. Gameplay	The puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.Graphic	It's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All in All Out There Somewhere is a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep 	 "

Basic InformationTitle:  Out There SomewhereDeveloper:  MiniBossPublisher:  EQ-Games, MiniBossGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionOut There Somewhere is a 2D platformer that emulates the classic side-scrolling action of older titles while offering a breath of fresh air in the almost entire absence of platforming sections.  The story is all about a stranded astronaut trying to survive. Quite odd for a platformer is the lack of many enemies as well. You will mostly teleport here and there with ocassional text based dialogue pop-ups. This is definitely more an experience about exploration than combat and avoiding obstacles. Even if the game is rather short it felt a bit boring at times. It features simple graphics and sounds but for its price point and considering the inclusion of Cards and Achievements, the game is ultimately worth trying out.Strong Points+ Plenty of collectibles.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Unbalanced difficulty.- Too short.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer.

												Out There Somewhere is a nice platformer where you initially drive a spaceship, then you explore a planet full of weird aliens, and finally you get into your spaceship again for the final confrontation.You can beat the game in well under two hours, and as far as I can tell there is not much replay value (unless you want to collect the several achievements that Steam lets you collect). I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!

Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.

Short story, unusal game mechanics, pretty good soundtrack. But I don't know, there is something wrong with jumping... Sometimes you just can't jump again after using a teleporter and it's really annoying. Actually this game is about teleporting and reaching new grounds. "

												Out there somewhere is a nice platformer with a decent ""old-school"" feel -- it's not a strained and missed attempt to cash in on nostalgia for ""retro"" games; quite the opposite it feels and looks solid like all the parts belong where they are. The platforming can be pretty challenging at times due to the addition of a teleport gun gimmick that teleports the character to wherever the bullet lands. Add in conservation of momentum across teleports, ability to shoot multiple tele-bullets at a time, and special beams of light and you get some neat platforming! Akin to old platformers the game world has its share of secret rooms and hidden bonuses that await the daring explorer. Also monsters and other baddies, a big bad boss, and two space shmup sections! Overall a pretty short experience -- around 1 hour for a casual experience, or under 20 mins for a speed run -- but between the secrets and a speedrunning challenge there's enough to warrant an extra play or two.

												I have to say, this may verry well be the best $.49 I have ever spentPros-Amazing teleport mechanic-Good difficulty curve-Great Music-Treeman-Overall gameplay is greatCons-It's short-Bats-somewhat annoying combat systemBartle TaxonomyKillers: Not the best game for these guys. You only get one gun, and it's not that powerfull. Not the best game for this type of player.Achievers: Many achivements and ingame collectables to get. A great game for this type of player.Socialisers: There is some interaction with aliens, but not a whole lot. Most aliens only have one line. There won't be much of any replay value for this type of player, but for the first time through it will be decent.Explorers: Explorers should have a great time with this game. When playing through it, I often saw places I couldn't reach from my current position and thought ""How can I get over there?"" There are many hidden places to find. This type of player will have a great time with this game.Score:7/10Make the combat less annoying, have more interaction with aliens, and make the game a bit longer. These are the only complaints I have about this game. However, for it's price, I highly recomend this game.			"

												A nice little game, I got a copy early but never actually got around to playing it so I figured I'd do that now.What is it?Well it's basically a semi-portal metroidvania. You have a teleport gun that moves you to where it shoots, with it carrying over momentum so when you jump it keeps your speed. That being the core mechanic of the game it does it very well. You have to utilise you teleport gun along with various world objects to get around.Is it something I like? No, it's really not my style of game.Is it something I'd recommend? Definitely, it is a very solid platformer with an emphasis on timing. Don't let the chep price fool you, it's certainly worth a lot more than they are charging.			"

												A fun, charming and creative puzzle platformer. It pushes the creativity of its teleporting mechanic very far. Only lasted about an hour but it was really enjoyable.This game is a bit challenging and forces you to think about what you're doing. One thing I loved was that failing a level didn't have a lengthy game over screen, or a splash. It would throw you right back in which kept the action up. And even if was only 3 or 4 enemies I also liked that the game had some combat. I'd love to see the idea expanded. I think there's a lot of hidden depth in the teleporting mechanic that the developers didn't exploit this time around. This is a  great game that's worth a try.			"

Then one day I fired it up, saw it was a terrible side-scrolling space shooter, and uninstalled it.Except...that is a fake-out, as anyone who has played for more than a few minutes knows, and once that is finished you get to play through a brisk but still roundly enjoyable (and adorable) kind of simple platformer-meets-Portal.  Well, teleporting, not portals, but it certainly calls that to mind.The pixel art is gorgeous, the soundtrack matches perfectly, and it will probably make you feel smart when you figure out some of the trickier puzzles.  Totally worth 19¢.  I daresay I would pay upwards of DOLLARS for it!			"

												After beating the game several times, I gotta say I feel bad I got this when it was on -96% sale.This was a surpisingly good indie game to me. I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.The game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.You accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?Graphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over. Music is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!Gameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.As an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.Puzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of ""Oh! Now I see it"". Overall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!Final Mark: 7.5/10			"

												TL;DR - I know my play time looks insane. You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title.			"

												This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.

												Holy ♥♥♥♥. When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit ""new game"" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating. Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes. So what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10			"

												I love this game, i recommend you buy it, now. Here is why:- really good soundtrack.- nifty pixelated visuals.- a well use of a simple game mechanic. It was so fun and enjoyable figuring out how to get to the other side.- smart and thoughtful level design.- it has a game of thrones reference.- perfect length, not the ""are you serious?! Is this the end of it??"" short, and not the "" finally i finished this game i was getting bored "" long, it was just perfect.- it Costs 4 SR ( $1 ?), it should be more.- good soundtrack. Really good.- damn grigori is still ...looking forward to your future work.			"

												Low-res puzzle platformers are almost literally a dime a dozen now but Out There Somewhere manages to stand apart by being polished and clever with its core mechanic. That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.			"

												Although the story is not something that will take hours to go through, this game is worth the price. It is a kind of game that you will replay—it has achievements that you likely cannot get in just a few playthroughs. There are hidden easter eggs to be found as well. The soundtrack is fun and the graphics are rather nice too. I've played through the story once and know I will several more times as well, for I still have things to find and achievements to get. This is a pretty good platformer + puzzle game.			"

												Short, but enjoyable.I beat ""Somewhere Out There"" in about an hours time, but by no means to completion. Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway.			"

												Just finished the game, fun but way too short let's get into the pros and cons.Pros:- Really fun- Good dialogue here and there on the planet - Music is really 8-bit let's get it on!- Graphics are cool- The mechanics are fun and somewhat original- Frustrating puzzles...Cons:- FRUSTRATING PUZZLES. (jesus I love them but i hate them at the same time......)- Too short, way too short..- What makes the game take long are the puzzles and the time you get stuck in them but if you are quick to do them it's too short.- Space battle is just 1/5 of the game, it could have more space battle in order to make the game a bit longer as wellOverall:Fun game, good art, good music, good mechanics. All in all I recommend it's a fun game to pass some time tho it is a bit short it is still fun and still worth the money.Score:8/10			"

												Definitely feels like cave story so far - looks good,. worth 19 cents even without the trading cards. Possibly more. Worth getting while the special promotion is up and running,.Too early for me to tell if the whole game is worth 5$ or more, but it's looking good so far.edit1: A bit further into the game, it will get harder, but not by so much that you'll bash your head on the keyboard. Some of the puzzles can even be ""cheated"" by completing them with a bit of clever jumping to avoid the way they were ""intended to be solved"".Some reviews will claim it's about 90 minutes worth of gameplay,. and at the speed that these puzzles are getting solved I'd say that seems about right. Still 19 cents for an hour of something new is good,. but I wouldn't pay 5$ for it. So, get it while it's on discount, or in the next humble bundle.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience.			"

Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything. Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger for moreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours.

												Very short little game that has a few nice ideas and an overall good quality (if you are not already fed up with pixel art and chiptunes). It could have been longer and more generous (the end is kind of abrupt) but I feel that it would have overstayed its welcome given that it has not the scope of a true metroidvania.Anyway, it offers a good couple of hours of puzzle/platforming with a sensible difficulty curve. Thus, with the original price tag, I truly recommend waiting for sales.			"

-Quick Review-Out There Somewhere is a 2d puzzle platformer with a hint of old arcade-space-shooting at the start and end, making the nice sandwich, which is ""Out There Somewhere"", developed by MiniBoss and released Mar 14, 2016.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist: Small-pixel-man-with-goldfish-bowl-on-head. Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. (Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?) While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.

Gameplay: The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death (For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.), the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.But I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.

So once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average (Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets).While I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.Conclusion: As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.

												This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be ""surprising"", in some way, reaching escape velocity from ""generic platformer"".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!			"

												TL:DR, this game is great for its price. Granted, you'll only get ~5 hours of enjoyment from this but it is still pretty fun.The gameplay is very unique. I haven't seen anything like that in any other game I've played. It got me thinking really hard in the middle (though in the end, it got pretty easy to figure out.The story left quite a bit to be desired, with little to nothing explained about the characters. I leaned more about the main character from watching the trailer posted here than I did playing the game.The game itself felt... incomplete for lack of a better term. Right when I was having fun solving all the puzzles and finally getting the hang of it, the game cut to credits.While the game is short, you have to keep in mind that it is $2. It was a very fun and unique experience to me. I really hope the developers go farther with the gameplay ideas in future projects.			"

												For a game I paid about $0.20 USD for, I got 75 minutes or so of fairly straightforward puzzle-platformer-with-teleport-gun gameplay.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was lackluster either, which is a plus really considering the price and what someone might expect from the saturated indie platformed genre.  I didnt feel like my time was wasted and I had some fun with it.  I dont particularly like chiptune / bit-aesthetic music. but it was pretty catchy and pleasant to listen to.  The NPC character sprites were also pretty well animated which is a good touch as well.Some players I see complaining about the control scheme.  I could see it as a problem for some, but I'm used to a few similar games so I handled it pretty well.  I didn't test a controller but with the Steam Controller API I don't think it should be much of a problem if you want a custom mapping.All in all, it was good!			"

												Out there somewhere tries to make up for being incredibly short (<2 hours at best) and linear by being teeth grindingly hard. The entire game revolves around mastering trick jumps......and that's about it as far as game play. The only real indication  of it being ""inspired by"" metroid or cave story lays in the graphics and sound. The game looks and sounds great but there just isnt enough game to go with it.			"

												This short platformer's got soul, a cool 8 bit soundtrack and tight controls.I'll skip the story and let you figure that one out for yourselves. The core gameplay consists of platforming, shooting things and using your teleport gun to... well teleport around the place and get over obstacles. There are collectibles scattered all around the place which help you progress more easily and help with the final boss battle.The soundtrack compliments the mood that the artist has set here; marooned on a strange planet of slug creatures, now stop crying, take that teleport gun, fix your ship and get revenge! It's an incredibly fun experience although it is rather short. My first playthrough took me a little bit over an hour and 30 minutes to complete. Second was a bit over 40 minutes and the last speedrun was just under 20 minutes.I wouldn't hesitate getting this game even at full price though I must note that it was on sale with a hefty -96% discount when I bought it.

												This review is going to be a little bit unfair, but then I feel I was misled. At the time of this writing, the ""About"" section describes this game as ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid"", and it's tagged as a ""Simulation"", ""Strategy"", and ""Metroidvania"" game.It is none of these things. This is a short, hard, linear puzzle platformer, with brief side-scrolling shooter bookends. The game as it is is pretty okay, and I got it on sale, but I spent my entire playtime wondering when the game map was going to open up and I was going to start getting interesting upgrades, which never happened.Bottom line, misleading store page, thumbs down.

												Well, some pixels here and there, few will love it instantly, few will hate, and the rest? Well, they will land on the planet and will die a lot, just because it is fun, challenging and rewarding once they'll master controls and tricks. Storyline isn't complex but it's not a bad thing for Out There Somewhere and yet you feel good once you make progress, and notice as sprites changes. When you found out the pattern of combined challenge and exploration you improve with controls and tricks and overall game experience gets better and better, because every part of the game is like a puzzle, once you start getting whole image game becomes great. Out There Somewhere is casual platformer with nice pixels and enjoyable chiptunes which can take up few hours to complete, depending on your teleporting performance. Play it in a spare moment and you won't regret time spent on Out There Somewhere. Sequel would be nice, tho. 9/10			"

												This is a fun but short platformer/shooter.I appreciate that the developers used multiple game modes.  This is tough to do, and normally one of the game modes feels tacked on.  In this case the platformer is the more developed of the modes, but the shooting sequences are not bad.The art is nothing to write home about, but the gameplay is fun and that is what matters.

												I purchased this game for $0.19 and I could say that it's worth at least this amount, but it is most certainly not worth the full price. Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).This is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.While aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.

												A really nice and simple puzzle platformer done in the 16-bit style. It is fairly easy and short, controls are easy to learn and responsive, but the puzzles do requier some accurate timing skills, so it's not trivial to play through. There's also a small shoot-em-up minigame done in the same style. The graphics and music are very nice and fit well to the overall retro atmosphere.Even it costs practically nothing the game is way too short and leaves you wanting for more.

												Out there somewhere is a really interesting 2D platfomer where you have to use a portal gun to move on to the next level. The game has a really great soundtrack and overall a pretty interesting idea. It has a pretty boring story but that's ok in my opinion.The big reason why I can't recommend this game is because of it's ""portal jumping"" mechanic, in the game you can't double jump so what you have to do is shoot your portal gun towards the wall and than jump in mid-air. It's very difficult to control and really hard to master. So a large part of this game is really just trying to get to a certain platform by portal jumping, with not much else going on.I got this game for about $0.51 when it was on sale so I can't really complain too much, but for me this game is definitely not worth the $2 price tag. Maybe if you're overflowing with money than this might not seem like that big of a deal to you, but for those of us who are on a budget and don't have too much cash than spend your money on something else "

The Short:-Short and sweet way to get your platforming fix.The Thick::Pros::Interesting platforming dynamics made possible with unique teleport gun.Short enough to enjoy entire game in single play session.Priced fairly for what you get out of it (right now it is 1.99 USD and can be bought in indie bundle as well)Enjoyable throughout.::Cons::Really short. I continued my save file after the credits rolled in disbelief that the end came that quickly.NPCs are obnoxious. Most of them have nothing important to say and just get in the way of the gameplay flow.The platforming portion of the singular boss battle can be forced to only use his first two attacks simply by getting enough (like 3) attacks off on him during each cycle. This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts. The shoot-em-up section of the boss battle is doable without upgrading the ship.Spoilers: Forced cliffhanger ending where the villian is still ""Out there somewhere.""Random Thoughts:I dunno... this game really makes me wonder if the developer didn't have a strict plan for what they wanted to make. The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...Everything points to that theory:An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-buildingStylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutsceneProgressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it doesSee final item on Cons.I do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring... I just think this could have been a great game. I'm disapointed not in the game, but in Miniboss for creating such a small game out of a concept with plentiful potential,			"

 Out There Somewhere It's a small game, but bunch of Fun you'll have. :) GamePlay: The gameplay is as simple as the game is and yet sometimes challenging. At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!Teleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.Normal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.This is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)I love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Graphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Story: The Story is also well made. ""Brevity is the soul of wit!"" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.I really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Leveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!There are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)The normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑I don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks. I nearly love all of them and for a good reason. If you wanna take a look at the main Theme:  Menu Theme ★ ★ ★ ★ ★The summary is, I would buy it again and the most time it is in sale for less than 30c. xD Get it. It's worth to play!★ ★ ★ ★ ★			"

												I stumbled upon this game as was searching through Steam for something to play - and I'm *so* glad I did. The art grabbed my attention, as did the very positive reviews, so I checked it out. Here's what I think:PROS--------------------------------------------- Excellent gameplay (it's so cool that people are *still* finding new things to do with platformers. I love it! ^_^ )- Tight controls. I never felt overwhelmed, and that's a good thing.- Great art! (though I'm not sure why the backgrounds were moving underground - maybe to keep things visually interesting >_< )- The tone, feel and setting are all really good.- The pacing is just incredible. I started playing it saying, 'I'll just play it for a little while', and the game moves at such a pace that I found myself playing for far longer than I thought. I beat the game in two sittings! I love games that can grab your attention and keep it like that.- The characters and puzzles kept me glued to my chair. I tell ya - there's something great about this game. Once you start - you don't want to put the game down!- Frequent checkpoints that enforce the fact that you're always making progress.- I also really like the fact that the last boss, while challenging is not SUPER-HARD-OH-MY-GOSH-YOU'LL NEVER-BEAT-THIS that so many platformers end with. While challenging, the game is more fun than hard - and I like that a lot.CONS----------------------------------------- The music, while good, never really connected with me. I still listen to the 'Shovel Knight' and 'Super Mario 3D World' soundtracks, for example. But here, nothing really jumped out. The music is not bad - it just didn't stand out to me.- While the controls felt fair, there were a few parts that I thought the difficulty curve was a bit steep. Reflecting back on it, I think it's because the devs wanted to put in as many different puzzles in as small a time frame as possible. I never got stuck or had to look solutions up online (which is great!), but smoothly transitioning from one puzzle to another sometimes felt a little weird. Maybe that's a nitpick. Just thought I'd mention it.- At a little over two hours, the game is *short*. What it lacks in length, it more than make up for in variety and fun, though.OVERALL----------------------------------------I was really pleasantly surprised with 'Out There Somewhere'. The pacing was excellent, the art was really fun and quirky and the platforming action kept me coming back for more (and kept showing me things I'd never seen before - so I loved that). I loved the fact that I went into this 'blind', so everything it showed me was a surprise. Love it! I had a great time and I look forward to seeing what else the devs have made. Bring on more great games! :)FINAL SCORE---------------------------------------8.5 out of 10			"

												A short but very replayable game, especially for speedrunners and achievement hunters. The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways. Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer.			"

I would say it is Portal as a platformer.  8/10.(Only 6 mins on record because i played it offline, in game time 236 mins)			"

												Puzzle games don't have to be difficult to be stimulating. Out There Somewhere keeps my brain stimulated with constantly changing and quality music, scenery, and puzzles. It doesn't revolutionize, but it's still a very polished and solid experience. I think full price is asking a bit much for the short length, but you know how Steam works. Add the game to your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale for around $1.99. I for one, got it on sale for $0.19. Needless to say, totally worth it.			"

												Very much recommended for the price. Sure the game is short, but with an amazing soundtrack and fun speedrunning challenges it is worth it. The ""Portal"" concept in a 2D Platformer works brilliant, though it could've been used in way more fun ways. Like I said, it's worth for the small price and has some cool achievements to unlock. Recommended.			"

												I forgot what this game was about or how much I had paid for it. Decided to boot it to see what it was about and was welcomed with a shmup. Nothing all that exciting but it did look nice. Then you're introduced to the bigger part of the game, which is a puzzle platformer of sorts.I was immediately very impressed by the quality of the game, visually first then everything after. The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$. And I'm fairly certain I bought it on sales.I don't really feel like playing through it again right now but it was a lot of fun while it lasted and if you are up for it, you can complete more than one playthrough to get more hidden stuff. It's well, well worth the 1$, very short but very high quality.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no pointless fillers, this game doesn't try to make up for what it lacks in content by throwing tedious stuff in. Just the essential, just what you need to have fun.			"

												I can only recommend this game at the price I got it at, $0.19. At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not. The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be. There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay. When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end. Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.			"

												I can recommend this game, but not at the price they're charging. The game is extremely short - one or two hours long. It feels like it's over just as soon as you've figured out how to play. The controls are interesting, but they don't feel all that tight. (They're not bad, but not great either.) The graphics, sound, and music get the job done but aren't particularly compelling. The level design is pretty decent, but not great. There is some mildly humorous dialog. All-in-all, it's a decent game, but it's just so short.Get the game if it's on sale, maybe.			"

Product received for free
												A space metrovania game. I believe i got this game for free as a gift from a friend if i recall.Anyways this game is quite short. Notice my time above the review? That is how long it took me to beat the game. Be aware i probably did not find every secret or searched the levels extensively.One thing i found annoying about this game was the fact on some maps your forced to go only one way, even though the game is clearly meant to be like a metrovania game that should let you go back to older maps, but some maps it is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.Because of the way the maps are, i cannot recommend this game. Playing it again got very repetitive very fast. If your into these type of games, this might be fun for you...but due to shortness, very difficult traversing maps, and also, the music was a bit bland to me.			"

												One of the most adorable indie platformers I've played.Out There Somewhere gets all things right. You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.Most of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the ""end"" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.Out There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts. The game's atmosphere and (retro) music are just too adorable for that.The game can be completed in ~2 hours. And while it may not be a game that will keep you coming back for more, unless you're an achievement junkie, you can rest assured that it will provide you with few hours of pure, retro platforming fun!

												Simple and short but extremely fun and creative little platform/puzzle game. This game was made by a very small team, and it's a really impressive achivement! You've got an extremely limited move set - you can jump around, you can fire a teleport beam, and you eventually get a blaster - but you'll use that limited move set in a wide variety of funny, clever, unexpected ways. There were so many times where I thought, ""Oh, this trick move won't work"", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that! You can wait for one of those super cheap sales if you like, but this is an awesome little game at any price. In fact, this is probably one of the best deals on Steam, bar none.			"

												I picked this game up for about 20 whole cents, and boy, can I ever say it was worth it.My first playthrough lasted me about an hour, but at the end, I felt satisfied. Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			"

												A superb little game. Far more deserving of an indie game award than most that that actually receive them.Don't be put of by the 8-bit retro visuals, or the overly cheap price tag. It is excellently designed and play tested to perfection. Unless you try to obtain all eleven cores you won't see just how true this is or how devious the developers have been!Skill, not luck, rules in this game. Those who say otherwise are, in my view, mistaken... Experimentation is encouraged via ""seemingly"" generous save points and it's best achievements will encourage you to play it several times with various completion aims in mind.Five hours of real entertainment(if you push yourself to unlock all of it's secrets), something you don't always get from games costing many times as much!

												The game is not too easy, but by no means is hard, the game can be picked up by just about anyone and be enjoyed.The only thing that I don't like about the game is I can't imagine paying the full $4.99 for it.Granted I bought the game at the extreme summer sale discount, the game is incredibly short, I finished the game in a little over an hour and by no means was trying to speed run in any way. This gave me a very unpleasant ""this is it?"" moment by the time I encountered the final boss, leaving me wanting more from a game that is by all accounts incredibly fun, the teleport mechanism is used extremely well, almost addicting, a shame it was over so soon.The hidden items are a bit tricky to get but worth it as they make the final boss extremely easy, and too easy at that if you want a real challenge, so I'd avoid them if thats what your looking for.Now my review may seem to lean on the negative side, but I would still recommend this to anyone as a fun time waster, but at the same time I'd recommend they get it while its on sale.

Pros- A fun game overall- Not too hard, good for casual players- Trading cardsCons- Doesn't last very long (maybe 2 hours, 3 hours max)- Has very low replay valueOverall, do not miss this if it's on sale. If it's at its full price of 5 dollars, consider waiting for a sale. 5 dollars for maybe 5 hours (assuming you do 2 playthroughs, which is already doubtful) is kind of expensive. 19 cents for 5 hours is a great deal, especially when you can sell the cards if you really want to.

												Nice short platformer game that is very casual. You get ship wrecked and you find things so you can fly your ship again.The difference that this platformer brings to the table is that the main character uses a portal like gun, when the bullet hits certain surfaces you get teleported to that location. This added in some puzzles to the platforming and made it more unique. +Retro art if you are into it+Nice mechanics +Easy to pick up and play+Why walk when you can shoot a wall-Music gets repetitive-Dialog is not even worth mentioning-no replay value(at least I do not feel like its worth doing speed runs)All in all the price for this game is probably not worth it since you can get more fun games or more ""value"" games that take longer to beat. If you can get it for like a dollar, you might as well get it to support the dev and enjoy this nice short game. "

I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			"

												 It is a short game but really enjoyable with a unique mechanic. If you are a fan of platformers but are turned off by the hard/impossible ones this is an easy pick up. Decent challenge, it will make you think but you won't be throwing your controller at a wall. Achievements add a challenge and a few replays before it is exhausted.Even at the regular price I highly recommend this game.			"

												Very nice and short game. The core ideas behind it are nothing we haven't seen before, but the gameplay and the mechanics are really well implemented and they're fun to play with. The only thing I did not like so much is that it was a little too short and that it was really easy to beat. I never really needed to look for info online or anything like that, and each screen took me at most just a couple of deaths before achieving it. Expect to beat this game in about an hour. For the price it usually gets on steam, however, this is a no brainer.I got all the achievements but one which is impossible to get because of a bug (Please, fix it soon, devs!). The truth is that I wasn't expecting much from this game and what I found instead was a really neat little adventure that I enjoyed a lot. I really recommend trying this game out. It's cheap, it's great and t won't take you too long to beat. Definitely worth it :)			"

												NOTE: I have received this game for free by Free Games. I was asked to spread the joy of this game if I personally enjoyed the game. So that's where you, the reader, comes in....A very small, yet very awesome game! I'm sad this game is quite short (1 hour to complete it), but there are, of course, secrets, puzzles and secret puzzles on your way. There is also a small batch of achievements waiting for you to unlock. So you might be sticking longer on this game when you want to go 100%.The greatest thing I like of this game is the gameplay which reminds me of:- VVVVVV- Portal- Risk of RainIt's so lovely to wander through the game. Everything feels so smooth and fitting, even the OST. Favorite thing of this game: Player walking animation.As said, the game is short and the mechanics are simple, but for 1 euro you should definitely buy this game!Rating: 8/10			"

												When Steams summer sale was going, I decided to buy lots of 19 cent games, because why not. Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption. When I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths. Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän. Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan. Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa! Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases "

												Somewhat simple to solve plattformer. In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)Its still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the ""all your base are belong to us""esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.So: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.			"

												Not bad at all. Seeing the retro style graphics, you might think that this is one of those trash indie games that people make to grab some quick cash (I don't hate retro or 8-bit graphics at all, its just that this is overused to make lots of trash games found across steam). Level 1 further fuels your doubt with the old space shooter thing.But the idea of the teleport gun introduced in level 2 makes it a rather unique platformer with an original concept. This together with the throwaway price makes this a recommendable buy.Also has trading cards and achievements.			"

But no, it turned out really was the end, and Steam says I only played 56 minutes.Also, don't be fooled by anyone who says this draws inspiration from Super Metroid. It absolutely doesn't.

Much like Shovel Knight or Momodora, this is a modern game that looks and plays like one of the classics.The game's hero is a fighter pilot who is shot down during an epic space battle.  After crash-landing on a volcanic planet populated with friendly talking snails and strange tree-men, he ventures off, armed with a teleportation gun, to repair the ship and rejoin the battle.  Along the way, there's a few health upgrades and maybe even a weapon or two to help survive the baddies; there's also 11 hidden ship upgrades to find.While the platforming elements and the game's retro aesthetic are both great, the real star of the show is the teleportation mechanic.  Your primary trigger fires a slow-moving bolt of energy that instantly transports your character to the point of contact when a surface is struck.  Using this competently is necessary for getting through the game.  The really exciting bit, though, is the teleportation gun conserves momentum, just like Portal; beginning a leap just before your energy bolt hits something, for instance, means you'll still be traveling upwards after being teleported.  Mastering this makes for very satisfying gameplay, and abusing this mechanic to go as high or as far as you possibly can also lead you to secret areas or shortcuts that you wouldn't otherwise find. This game isn't very long, and while it's not a total cakewalk, the level of challenge is relatively low.  My first playthrough took about 90 minutes, and that was with a lot of optional exploration and puzzle-solving.  My second playthrough was a 100% playthrough, and took a little over an hour.  After learning the game's layout and mechanics, a speedrun will take not much more than 15 minutes.However, while not long, this game is really quite fun, and totally worth the very reasonable asking price.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it. "

I mean, to be frank I would have never tried the game if it were more than a buck, but now that I have, I'd gladly buy some dlc that was more expensive than the game itself. Cut out the shmup and just make a whole game out of the teleport mechanic puzzle platforming and I'd play the hell out of that.			"

												Short but sweet and easy on the wallet. If you want a game you can beat around 1h then this is a game for you. The game have you explore an alien planet where you need to locate a new power source so you can get away from the planet. The main focus of the game is exploration and teleporation and both goes hand in hand rather well. Defenately something you need to play for yourself if you enjoy indie developed games.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a neat little 2D Game. You can compare the design to the Metroid games and all in all the game structure really reminds me of ""You Have To Win The Game"", what is, by the way, a really nice game.A short assessment by myself:Story: 8/10   It is the classical ""Hero-Kills-Evil"" concept as it is in Megaman. Yuri is Megaman and Gregori is Dr. Wily.Soundtrack: 100/10 The soundtrack fits perfect and is just genius.Level Design: 10/10  It reminds of Metroid as I mentioned before.Controls: 5/10 The control is the only thing I want to criticize. I highly recommend to play this game with  a Game Pad, because it is a little bit awkward with the keyboard. (Compareable to ""Super Meat Boy"" + Keyboard"" just worse...!)Difficulty: 10/10 Although you cannot adjust the difficulty in the game options you are able to play this game without getting frustrated. There are maybe some points where it can take a minute longer than usual but all in all the game is quiet easy.But it gets much more difficult when you try to find all cores or try to collect all steam achievements.

												Great little game.  Reminded me a lot of La Mulana (to a degree), VVVVVV (to a degree), Knytt Underground (to a degree).  Simple platformer with some nice mechanics that lead to a game that you play 'screen by screen'.  Each screen provides a puzzle to beat.  These puzzles are usually fairly straightforward and I only had a couple of screens that gave me trouble (but which were very easy once the solution hit).Takes as little as 20 minutes to beat (there's an achievement), but expect about 60-90 minutes if you start hunting down the hidden areas / achievements.

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).			"

												a short, adorable, little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich.The first thing you'll notice are the cute animated cutscenes. They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEMYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content.

The game focuses mainly on the use of a portal gun to deal with various, some relatively challenging, physics-based puzzles. While the game is somewhat devoid of much of a plot line, I could look past it with the humble attempts at humor and the nice aesthetics in the 16-bit graphical style.

There is some Cave Story influence in the art direction and some of the screen.I would recommend this game because its a good time filler for intermediate and advanced platformer players.			"

												Great little game.  Reminded me a lot of La Mulana (to a degree), VVVVVV (to a degree), Knytt Underground (to a degree).  Simple platformer with some nice mechanics that lead to a game that you play 'screen by screen'.  Each screen provides a puzzle to beat.  These puzzles are usually fairly straightforward and I only had a couple of screens that gave me trouble (but which were very easy once the solution hit).Takes as little as 20 minutes to beat (there's an achievement), but expect about 60-90 minutes if you start hunting down the hidden areas / achievements.

 SPOILER ALERT	I feel like that game is really worth the price... best spent 19 cents on a game. The Story	Humanity is in peril, Allies receives a signal that the notorious villain Grigori is attacking again and decide to call Yuri - our hero for help.As he sets out to fight Grigori, his ship gets destroyed and he sees Grigori landing on an unknown planet and he decides to follow him without any other choice since he crashes on the planet.As soon as our hero lands he sees that Grigori has imprisoned the intelligent life on this planet.          He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good. Gameplay	The game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage. Pros.	+Great pixelated art                 +Great music                                +Alot of replay value+Memorable protagonist+Fluid Gameplay.+Alot of secret collectibles.

Wasn't expecting much from the other games because retro platformers have been done to death and aren't really my thing.

But maybe it's not for you....idkFor those people who like platformers mixed with Portal and Super Mario (like me) then definitely buy this game! That price for so good 8-bit music and an RPG/Platformer that is very fun is unheard of! And it's so addictive, I LOVE IT! Gameplay is a bit short but come on. Everybody knows it takes a while to make a game! If you loved Portal and played it every single day but you got bored because you finished the game, or if you missed the good old days when Super Mario was a big thing, or do you just miss amazing, fricking awesome space games, or do you just wanna play a really good platformer?

I had to set my own from the start of the game, but once I got use to it it was fine.-I found the boss fight nearly impossible with keyboard controls because I was trying to dodge things while flying in all directions with arrow keys, and I had to also focus on shooting him with a different button.

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

												Great story and fun puzzle playthrough, but here are the things that really bugged me about the game:-Can't go to options while in game, have to save and exit and then you can access them at the main menu.-Doesn't have very good keyboard controls. I had to set my own from the start of the game, but once I got use to it it was fine.-I found the boss fight nearly impossible with keyboard controls because I was trying to dodge things while flying in all directions with arrow keys, and I had to also focus on shooting him with a different button. It would have been much easier with a controler.Besides all of that, it is a great little game, with interesting mecanics and good puzzles that aren't too difficult. For the current sale price of 0.19 cents, it's definitely worth it.			"

												The puzzle is quite good. The music is pretty addicting. The story is that casual but short one. All in all, the game is worth every penny. Too bad is only 1h and something long. But for a Brazilian game (first time playing and liking one), is so cool. I can't say how cool this game is. The music is stuck in my head. It would be good it they add a continuation. Like different planets. Some areas I got stuck thinking what to do in order to pass, but I made it without cheating (looking online). This game needs more players.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a VERY good game, one of the best in my library. First the price to gameplay ratio is amazing. I have eight hours in this game, thats 10p an hour, and then there's the gameplay. The puzzles vary in hardness, but a lot of this requires high reaction time.

PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357 "

												The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.The story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow. The gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works. The absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.The game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game. If you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee.			"

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

												TL;DR This game is gold. Cheap gold, at that.It’s a delightfully simple platformer that is much more of a “puzzle platformer,” if such a thing exists. The game mechanics are very simple and the controls are nicely tight.The game mechanics involve avoiding various obstacles (the usual, lava, monsters, projectiles, although there are very little and it’s more trying to get around the level than dodge), and using your Teleport Gun which may or may not have been stolen directly out of Portal or something – I don’t know, as I haven’t played Portal. Whatever its origins, it’s quite an interesting mechanic as it conserves speed, meaning that if you have enough space (and are required to do this twice) you can climb up an entire screen.The game has nicely low quantities of threats, focusing far more on actually getting to the next stage – especially as you only get something that can actually kill mobs mid-game (and if you head back to that screen, they respawn) You can afford to misjudge a jump or a teleport and nothing bad will happen, really – there’s checkpoints on most levels, and when there isn’t it’s usually because there was a checkpoint at the end of the previous one (“level” is an odd word to use, “screens” is much better).Surprisingly, the game does not through absurdly large quantities of obscure once-use-only bricks at you that you see in two levels and then never again. The only example is the “Mirror” block, which reflects your teleport bullet horizontally; this appears in three levels and then is completely forgotten about; rather amusingly it’s possible to complete those three levels without using the mirrors anyway.There’s two other unwritten rules of platformers this game breaks:- The final boss has only two, not three phases (three is a magical number in video games)- There is no screen whereby “Jump over the lava pits” / “Jump repeatedly onto platforms”Speaking of bonus sections, despite being a rather memorable platformer whereby the main challenge is routing, meaning it’s much easier the second time, the game has surprisingly large replay value (for a simple platformer). It took me an hour and a bit to beat the game the first time, but I continued to complete it about five more times (and a good deal of that was in Offline Mode, so that’s why the playtime is so low). The game has this high replay value thanks to a large quantity of bonus sections (on your first playthrough you probably won’t go through about 1/3 of all the screens), which are accessible from the get-go but you haven’t learned the ins and outs of the teleport gun yet. And because the game knows that it’s going to be easy and a bit of a slog, it makes the game easier for you – these bonus sections contain three types of useful stuff. It’s also got interesting, not grinding, achievements which is always something worth noting – and also ones that you probably won’t unlock by accident whilst merely idling through. Most achievements are either “Grind grind grind” (e.g. AOE2’s “Win as Civ X 1000 times for EVERY SINGLE CIVILIZATION (about twenty of them) or “Play the game” (e.g. Terraria’s “Chop a tree! Make an anvil! Find a chest!), and it’s nice to see some achievements that you not so much have to actively think about getting – it’s more they don’t happen by accident. If you explore lots you’re bound to get a good deal of them.This is also the only game whereby I have been able to stunlock the boss thanks to some exploits in the boss AI, as well as fire more bullets than the final boss does – however, this requires intensive exploration. When you fight the first phase of the boss, despite only having one life his attacks are easy to dodge when you know how (although I spent a solid seven minutes dying repeatedly until learning how to dodge) – when you have four and a machine gun it does become a bit of a joke. Still, it is a lighthearted final boss in line with the light difficulty of the rest of the platformer. It’s more puzzle than run ‘n’ gun, although not much “running” happens anyway.The difficulty curve is very nice, probably slightly too slow – but the game is very lighthearted and not meant to be insanely difficult. The game gives you a decently large quantity of hints in the game on tips of your teleport gun, but not enough to be an insta-win and also low enough to keep me occupied on a single screen for about ten minutes before finally working out what to do.Progression is extremely linear with the exception of about three cases, which is a bit odd as this game would have lent itself to a multi-route system extremely well. The soundtrack is merely “good.” What stops it from being “excellent” is the fact that the composer had so many nice melodies, nicely hummable in their own right, and just lumped them all on top of one another in certain sections. To call those parts of the music “busy” is an understatement, but one track – Surface – doesn’t do that nearly as much and is much nicer to listen to. If the soundtrack was a little more… heh, a little more ‘empty’ in places (only in places) it would be “excellent.”Oh, and the game has precious little plot, enough to give you information on what’s going on but nothing particularly huge – but unlike some platformers, it doesn’t throw you into wacko things that should never have existed (why are there so many homing rockets and landmines in some icy mountains? Who put these all there and why is there a convenient route through them instead of an impassable barrier – that’s Airscape for you). So that’s nice.And to top it all off, I checked the Store Page’s price.$1.09 NZD – and that wasn’t on sale. It wasn’t on sale. Amazing.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												This is a ""puzzle platformer."" While it also includes elements of a metroidvania (you collect 1 power-up to enable access to more of the zones, as well as a few health/ship powerups), I would prefer to compare the game to VVVVVV, Cave Story, and Portal 2.The sounds and graphics are throwbacks to Nintendo/Super Nintendo era, which is more than adequate for a 2d ""pixel-perfect"" platformer. As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable. This game is about puzzle-platforming.Play control is super-tight. Any errors made are completely your fault.The biggest drawback to the game is its length. It is extremely short (a speedrun of the game should take you between 12-20 minutes). This isn't necessarily a negative--there are only so many ways to do the same kind of puzzle before it becomes tedious, and the game avoids that by not padding the game out.			"

The pixel art is detailed and music is fantastic, the levels felt alive as I was going through them. The only downside to this game is that it's very short.

												Hoooly crap this game is SO good. i cant believe its this cheap. If you like Portal and platform based games, this is for you... Because this game is basically the combination of those. If you want to spend a fun hour or so, but dont want to spend too much money, this game is for you; And even then, if you really like it (like me), you can try to complete achievements or speedrun (or both) which is what I do. The game itsleft lasts for 1-2 hours, (which is completely worth your money taking in account how cheap it is btw) and if you are a completionist or a speedrunner like me, this game can easily give you up to 10 hours of fun or even more. And its not just the play time; its the play value... Every single minute of this game is just pure fun. Its cheerfull, clever, it has perfect pacing and makes and its puzzles never get too easy or too hard. TL,DR: Amazing game, incredibly fun and unbelievably cheap. Give it a try, Im sure you can spare the money, I promise you wont regret it.			"

												This game is great! It's short and sweet for a quick playthrough, but very enjoyable. The soundtrack is neat and I like the art direction.It's a mini adventure platformer, where you carry a little teleport gun and use it to solve jumping puzzles, mostly. There's minimal combat, aside from some shooty bits. I beat it in a little over an hour on my first playthrough. There are achievements to unlock that can extend your time with the game, if you're into that sort of thing.It's pretty simple, but that's a lot of its charm. It has gamepad support and I got it for a quarter. What's not to love?			"

												TL;DR This game is gold. Cheap gold, at that.It’s a delightfully simple platformer that is much more of a “puzzle platformer,” if such a thing exists. The game mechanics are very simple and the controls are nicely tight.The game mechanics involve avoiding various obstacles (the usual, lava, monsters, projectiles, although there are very little and it’s more trying to get around the level than dodge), and using your Teleport Gun which may or may not have been stolen directly out of Portal or something – I don’t know, as I haven’t played Portal. Whatever its origins, it’s quite an interesting mechanic as it conserves speed, meaning that if you have enough space (and are required to do this twice) you can climb up an entire screen.The game has nicely low quantities of threats, focusing far more on actually getting to the next stage – especially as you only get something that can actually kill mobs mid-game (and if you head back to that screen, they respawn) You can afford to misjudge a jump or a teleport and nothing bad will happen, really – there’s checkpoints on most levels, and when there isn’t it’s usually because there was a checkpoint at the end of the previous one (“level” is an odd word to use, “screens” is much better).Surprisingly, the game does not through absurdly large quantities of obscure once-use-only bricks at you that you see in two levels and then never again. The only example is the “Mirror” block, which reflects your teleport bullet horizontally; this appears in three levels and then is completely forgotten about; rather amusingly it’s possible to complete those three levels without using the mirrors anyway.There’s two other unwritten rules of platformers this game breaks:- The final boss has only two, not three phases (three is a magical number in video games)- There is no screen whereby “Jump over the lava pits” / “Jump repeatedly onto platforms”Speaking of bonus sections, despite being a rather memorable platformer whereby the main challenge is routing, meaning it’s much easier the second time, the game has surprisingly large replay value (for a simple platformer). It took me an hour and a bit to beat the game the first time, but I continued to complete it about five more times (and a good deal of that was in Offline Mode, so that’s why the playtime is so low). The game has this high replay value thanks to a large quantity of bonus sections (on your first playthrough you probably won’t go through about 1/3 of all the screens), which are accessible from the get-go but you haven’t learned the ins and outs of the teleport gun yet. And because the game knows that it’s going to be easy and a bit of a slog, it makes the game easier for you – these bonus sections contain three types of useful stuff. It’s also got interesting, not grinding, achievements which is always something worth noting – and also ones that you probably won’t unlock by accident whilst merely idling through. Most achievements are either “Grind grind grind” (e.g. AOE2’s “Win as Civ X 1000 times for EVERY SINGLE CIVILIZATION (about twenty of them) or “Play the game” (e.g. Terraria’s “Chop a tree! Make an anvil! Find a chest!), and it’s nice to see some achievements that you not so much have to actively think about getting – it’s more they don’t happen by accident. If you explore lots you’re bound to get a good deal of them.This is also the only game whereby I have been able to stunlock the boss thanks to some exploits in the boss AI, as well as fire more bullets than the final boss does – however, this requires intensive exploration. When you fight the first phase of the boss, despite only having one life his attacks are easy to dodge when you know how (although I spent a solid seven minutes dying repeatedly until learning how to dodge) – when you have four and a machine gun it does become a bit of a joke. Still, it is a lighthearted final boss in line with the light difficulty of the rest of the platformer. It’s more puzzle than run ‘n’ gun, although not much “running” happens anyway.The difficulty curve is very nice, probably slightly too slow – but the game is very lighthearted and not meant to be insanely difficult. The game gives you a decently large quantity of hints in the game on tips of your teleport gun, but not enough to be an insta-win and also low enough to keep me occupied on a single screen for about ten minutes before finally working out what to do.Progression is extremely linear with the exception of about three cases, which is a bit odd as this game would have lent itself to a multi-route system extremely well. The soundtrack is merely “good.” What stops it from being “excellent” is the fact that the composer had so many nice melodies, nicely hummable in their own right, and just lumped them all on top of one another in certain sections. To call those parts of the music “busy” is an understatement, but one track – Surface – doesn’t do that nearly as much and is much nicer to listen to. If the soundtrack was a little more… heh, a little more ‘empty’ in places (only in places) it would be “excellent.”Oh, and the game has precious little plot, enough to give you information on what’s going on but nothing particularly huge – but unlike some platformers, it doesn’t throw you into wacko things that should never have existed (why are there so many homing rockets and landmines in some icy mountains? Who put these all there and why is there a convenient route through them instead of an impassable barrier – that’s Airscape for you). So that’s nice.And to top it all off, I checked the Store Page’s price.$1.09 NZD – and that wasn’t on sale. It wasn’t on sale. Amazing.			"

												This is a ""puzzle platformer."" While it also includes elements of a metroidvania (you collect 1 power-up to enable access to more of the zones, as well as a few health/ship powerups), I would prefer to compare the game to VVVVVV, Cave Story, and Portal 2.The sounds and graphics are throwbacks to Nintendo/Super Nintendo era, which is more than adequate for a 2d ""pixel-perfect"" platformer. As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable. This game is about puzzle-platforming.Play control is super-tight. Any errors made are completely your fault.The biggest drawback to the game is its length. It is extremely short (a speedrun of the game should take you between 12-20 minutes). This isn't necessarily a negative--there are only so many ways to do the same kind of puzzle before it becomes tedious, and the game avoids that by not padding the game out.			"

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			"

												This will sound like a very strange criticism, but the game is too dark. My IPS monitor is calibrated for accurate colors and brightness and this is the only game where I can't make out what's what. Many tiles are dark violet and are almost indistuingishable from the black background.I could make the monitor brighter, but then I would have to calibrate it back again after I finish the game.Other than that it's a simple metroidvania where each room is a puzzle (or a series of puzzles). But without ruining my screen calibration it's unplayable for me.			"

												This game is very interesting.The story is about a space cop who is hunting a villain named Grigori. But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore.
