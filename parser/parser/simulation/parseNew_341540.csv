Early Access Review
								I love  psychedelia, either in   music,  art or playing psychedelic looking games, unfortunately I was quite disappointed in TRIP: Steam Edition after experiencing it  for nearly 10 hours in bite-sized chunks over the last 24 hours since I purchased it; that is,  at least in its present state.  As it is early access I may change my  opinion  as time progresses, but that will depnd on what the developer does for the game.    It says the artware  is an open world  environment;  for me that conjures up   the thought that you are able to explore every part of the  world you find yourself in. Sadly  I found there were many places I wasn't able to explore, for example  trying to  get   from many places   via hills, you aren't able to climb anything steeper than about 45 degrees, this  basically locks off  loads of  area of the world so far created.  I tried for hours to find ways to access  certain area's, but   was always held back by the inability to climb anything too steep.  The actual  artware/game (I include game because  Steam imply that its also a game  when it asks the question,   'Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?') is basically an exploration game, nothing else, just wandering around looking at the weird  shapes and colors.  For  several minutes I found this  quite exciting and stimulating, but  eventually  found it a little bit too much  after  an hour of wandering around.   I was determined to contine, but had to break the experience up into  chunks.I know the developer has said they intend expanding the game and adding different worlds.  I'm sure   those additions will add a little more interest.  also they said    that  the game was a  visually tantalizing open world artware that culminates the player to relax and enjoy a safe enviroment for them to explore at their own pace and that there are no objectives, no rules, just beauty and art.  Yes, I can agree with that, it  does   definitely help you to relax, but   why are we calling it a game , or   more  truthfully  selling it as a game.  As a piece of experimental  artware, I'd be happy, but I  wanted a game..  Okay, I read the  description and still purchased the 'artware'.  Still I wasn't expecting it to   be so tedious.  Lets hope the additional content the developer has promised will  materialize and expand on what's already here and in fact evolve it into more than just artware; lets see an artware based game  with  some substance to it.for example:I really think think  the game/artware  needs a little more than just  more places to explore.  We need   some incentives to carry on exploring the world; maybe some  puzzles to unlock hidden area's, mini games,  or even a mode  that allows   some sort of co-operative play or PvP.  These would certainly add interest and  IMO would  increase  the  numbers buying this game   three fold or more.Thankfully the price of the game even without the   initial release  discount  is quite cheap at Â£4.49 (probably even cheaper in the US), but, unless you really like   games with little content apart from weird, colorful  and pretty visuals, I'd steer clear unless it goes on sale or   the developer   adds some thing more to do  apart from wandering around.  To be honest, I can't believe I've spent 10 hours on this game.  (Maybe   I was enjoying myself so much i didn't realize the time, though it's more likley I fell asleep at times at  the keyboard.  :)To the developer.  If you do read this,  I'd like to say, I really want to like this game,  the color palette you've used is excellent, the visuals are pretty awesome  and the game has loads of potential, but  please please please  add some  content (some examples quoted above)  that gives the player an incentive to carry  on playing, or at least add  the ability to interact with other players or NPC's, maybe  make the odd characters and animals (eg the camel) that I found in game  actually  animated rather than just statuesque.  I really did loved  the   visuals and look forwards to seeing more, but I can't recommend this to my friends as it stands.			"

Early Access Review
								As the title and screenshots already suggest TRIP is pretty weird. The only thing you can do in this 'game' is walk around on a map and checkout all the colourful surroundings and objects. Some objects move up and down but other then that there are no real physics of any kind. Because apparently one of two developers quit working on the game so all his concent has been taken of the game, although it could be just a lame excuse to say the game is not finished AT ALL. For instance there's hardly any sound in the game, the only sound I found was right at the beginning. There are items you can pick up but don't let that fool you. The items don't do anything and they probably never will.The game looks like (and probably is) it has been made in a few days, the developers just created all the random stuff they could come up with and put them somewhere in the game without any real idea behind it.According to the developer the game has been in development for at least 2 years which, in my opinion, is a long time to come up with something like this. So... Yes the game is still in Early Access but... do you really believe the developer actually comes up with NPC's and quests ? If so, I would happily change this review but for now I would stay away from this one.  "

												Very beutiful. Some people say that the music and sound is lacking and I agree, but it seems to accentuate the finess this game somehow supplies. (fyi, there is no sound but for a couple of notes here and there). If you are looking for somthing exciting, find another game. This is like going to a gallery of art. I reccomend playing this in a quiet, bright room with a window.This is definatly a game to play. However, the price is disgustingly high. This game is only worth under a dollar. So buy it when it is on a MAJOR sale and enjoy!EDIT: Added sound, cannot pick up secrets tho			"

												A highly underrated experience. The atmosphere is absolutely incredible and it makes for a thought provoking late night experience. If you are looking for music to pair with the game try any of the following albums: Zaba - Glass Animals, Lonerism - Tame Impala, Liminal - The Acid, Nothing Lasts... But Nothing Is Lost - Shpongle, Entheogenic - Entheogenic. Any of these should transform an already wonderful experience into something even better			"

												I would recommend this game if it were to become open source, i feel the game is more of a map, a well designed and creative map that is still unfinished. for instnace theres collision making invisible walls and no collision at all on some walls where there should be. but if it were open source and people could bring in grappling hooks or tag game modes or ways to change the mechanics to enhance gameplay for exploration the game could be fun from the ability to move around alone, but so far it feels like an unfinished class project form a highschool beggining coding class that just started placing blocks on unity.

												I can appreciate art, but in this case, I can't. Here are some basic points:Visuals: Terrible. Some games thrive from their simplicity by compensating with an amazing experience. There is no amazing experience here to make up for these simple geometric shapes scattered across a field.Music: Repetitive. Of the four levels I visited, the music was all very annoying. A couple of instruments, some high pitched and simply annoying.Gameplay: Jump, walk, and... that's it. You can explore these canvases and apparently there are items but I'm not about to spend more than 10 minutes exploring this utterly boring game looking for something that may or may not make it interesting.It's a boring game (other might try to call it an 'experience' or a 'work of art', but at the end of the day it's a game) and it's not worth anything near $7. I'd recommend it at the low price of $0.01, but only if trading cards become available so that you can make a profit.To the developers, why did you put this on Steam? In all seriousness, it's great to have independent developers out there making games and expanding the world of video games. It's great to have you guys developing. But this is what you wanted to put out for us? This is hardly a game at all and even as a piece of 'art', it has almost nothing to offer.			"

Early Access Review
								I played a non-Steam version of this game for an hour and then decided it wasn't just that I was experiencing this Trip for free. [Insert Drug Dealer Joke]The game is a walking simulator. The pull is the world. The gamer-oriented object (thus far) is to collect sprites. I qualify that last point thusly because the dev has expressed that the intent IS more of an [footnote] interactive art installation [end footnote], rather than a trippy ""game,"" per se. I have heard, however, that the dev is seriously considering tweaking the vision into a form more akin to ""game"" - what I've heard suggested that it might become something like Pokemon Snap. Research and observe the structures and creatures; use a camera and take notes.There is currently no music. There are too many invisible walls. The lack of a sprint is to the players' advantage (more time to explore); however, I think different means of locomotion might add to the experience. Crawl, slither, fly - whatever. Just give us some curve balls that will provoke further ""Woah""'s. If the screenshots interest in any way - If ""walking simulator"" isn't a bad word to you.There should be no hesitation to Trip.[footnote] From the few posts I've read pertaining to Trip: Steam Edition, the players complain about that lack of interactivity. You truly do just walk around, marvel at the sights and collect those sprites, should you find them. As a free non-Steam game, that's not really a valid complaint; it's being called a game is not called into question because there IS some sort of interactivity. A free trip to a fantastic virtual world. With it being sold for money, of course people will expect more. In general, from what I've seen, walking simulators that live up to the name usually have Mixed user ratings. But. Those that have a gimmick are more well-received.The Stanley Parable; truly a walking simulator. Due to it being so unique, the positive reviews outweight the negative. With Trip, the uniqueness is strictly in the visuals. There are other comparable games to it, like FRACT OSC and NaissanceE and Kairo - these are first-person puzzlers with an abstract style. Trip is all about the abstract.Might seem like I'm subverting my recommendation with this cyclical talk, but I contest that Trip is worthy of patronage, so as to further fuel the vision, whatever it amounts to. Personally, more of the same with no further ""gamey"" mechanics implemented would be fine; I would then hope for an open world, but... I just want this game to succeed; at least as a walking simulator, (I think) it has more substance than most... my saying so challenges the definition of ""substance,"" but the abstract has that effect.
