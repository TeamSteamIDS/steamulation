												A fantastic concept not fully realised.Pros: + beautiful graphics+ Interesting micromanagment+ tool tips almost everywhereCons: - Tedious late game- terrible UI- no roster management- no auto pause function- no character progression- limited roster- limited contentI feel this game could be really, really good. Unfortunatley, it's just not. In the few hours that I gave it I fought the UI more than the mechanics, I exhausted the incoming roster of adventurers and by the time I got bored I had more money than I knew what to do with. Stats don't seem to mean anything and neither does equipment. I'm not totally panning the game though, the graphics are great and the management systems are sound. I just feel it needs more effort in a lot of areas.			"

												I 'beat' the game, but after getting over the hurdle of your first trade guild it's just going through the motions.A good basis for a game, and it's not buggy or poorly designed, I just feel like it wasn't taken far enough to be compelling.More hero customization and more variety in obstacles would have gone a long way, and the guild hall customization was completely moot after the first trade guild (you just build everything and set the upkeep to max then forget it for the rest of the game.)Worth a couple of bucks, but don't stress yourself sticking through to the 'end', when you start to feel bored that really is all there is to it.

												I love this game. It's a very unique management game that makes me recall the recent 'RPG Manager' except that this one is far more polished. The graphics are exceedingly pleasant to the eye, especially that of the 'Kitchen' and 'Mess Hall' which look outstanding when positioned next to each other. You manage the heroes and send them out to different provinces to adventure and bring back the loot which you use to pay wages and expenses. There is a small amount of micromanagement in terms of economics and producing items etc and the rooms you can build vary between about 8 or so different types so I assure you there is allot of replayability but the icing on the cake has to be the games sountrack which comprises of some well crafted middle ages folk music which I will have to aquire as background music for later DnD sessions with my mates. In all I would recommend for the sound price of £4 of less that it is currently marketed at.

												Guild Commander is a game with an interesting concept, that sadly falls flat in the execution. While I will insist that the concept is pretty good and can work to become a very good game, full of interesting interactions, intrigue, and many enjoyable hours, this is not the game that will do justice to the concept of managing an adventurer's guild.While the graphics are pretty good looking, and I am a sucker for isometric stuff that also manages to look pretty decent, there are a few too many problems with this game to make it worth spending time, money, and effort on. To continue on with graphics, your entire gameplay area is your guild hall. No, you can not build the building itself, you only have the rooms there which you can fill up in different, but still pre-determined ways.  Characters do not move around in your guild either, they merely teleport to their destination. You can not zoom out to see your entire guild hall at once, and to find anyone in it is a pain due to how close the camera is. This is less about being a guild commander, and more about being the guy who rents a pre-made guild house and then just waits for something to happen.In short, there is no interaction.You can send out your adventurers to other regions, but at no point are you shown any of this. You do not even have a map of the place, and the explanation on how to do things has basically shown you the entire game. There is only so long that you can look at a building in which nothing changes before you become bored, and while the vaguely humourous adventurer names and tooltips help you dull the monotony of not doing anything, they do not solve the problem. I was reminded of Progressquest, the game about waiting. Except in this game your adventurers do not even level up. Aside from their equipment, nothing about them changes. The list of things that could have gone so much better just goes on and on. Equipment is useless, especially if you consider making some yourself. You have no control over your adventurers aside from sending them out once or twice a month, and even that takes 3 or more clicks if you want to send them to some place that can actually use them. Adventurer's stats recover both too fast and too slow, depending on the situation, and it overall just lacks gameplay.This is more of a waiting game, or perhaps an interactive screensaver, which requires that you keep clicking it or it will give you a gameover. Interesting concept, but sadly it is all just squandered potential. Guild Commander is not something I would recommend to anyone. Not to people who are fans of strategy, nor to simulation fans, and most certainly not to anyone who wants to build or be creative. This game does not offer that - though I am still not sure what it *does* offer.			"

												I haven't played all hours, i left the game on while i made some constrution work at home, and later had dinner and watched a movie. I was in no hurry to get back to the game.I'm at week 37 day 1. And all heroes maxxed out, so mutch gold i don't know what to do with it, so i haven't finished the game yet, and i don't know if i will. It seems it's just a waiting game at this point. Waiting for the last wave so the game can finaly end.I would not recomend this game if you want more then a couple hours of fun from it.Simple mechanics, provinces have different states. Your goal is to get them all to prosperous and survive a last wave that attacks a province i guess. (haven't finished yet)You can upgrade your heroes by telling your blacksmith to craft weapons and armor, that you can equip on your heroes. And there is a genereal training for them aswell in a few steps that improves stats, not that mutch i maxxed out training in the first minutes of gameplay. The heroes have no exp, levels only items that improves stats.You wait and send some heroes to provinces not nowing what you are doing in the beginning, and later you build a few trade guilds. The game gets easy with the cash flowing in, you start getting better eq for your heroes and after a while all is good. You sit around and wait and once in a while a province gets attacked. You send your heroes there by selecting locations in a drop down meny for each of the heroes you want to send. Then you can enjoy watching a green 3 digit number increase from a few hundred to 1000.Repeat watching the digit slowly increase, and click on all of the drop down boxes to send each individual hero, and thats the game.The character depth is a few lines that heroes randomly say from time to time, most of the time, your heroes are represented by a digit next next to the province name. Mechanics are not that good, if you want to let your heroes chill at the base then all your healing facilities are occupied and the heroes you need to use will take ages to recover, so you are forced to send your hereos to provinces all the time to keep the guild empy for the ones that return and need healing.The game needs more dept, it might be something you can play on your tablet while being forced to watch a bad movie or something. But i would not recomend a buy if you don't have the money to spare.			"

												Interesting, but a bit unbalanced and boring after you found out what to do. At first I lost two games in a row without a chance or an idea how to suceed. Then, I stopped thinking about any RPG-Stuff and just focused on not loosing to much money. Also I sent my members to one province at a time until the enemies were defeated. After rescuing 2-3 provinces you should be out of trouble and might establish your first trade guild. Then it's just ""repeat, repeat, repeat"" and you will win the game. Sadly you don't get enough explanation: how does equipment, armor, etc. ""really"" affect ... what exactly. Does it give you an extra on strength or health (you can't see a change in the bars of your characters). Does it help refreshing the skills? I don't know. Also: how do equipment, status of the province etc. effect the gold your members are making ... and so on. You have several ideas what might have an effect on something, but you don't know noting John Snow. Concering the gameplay experience: At first it's just stress and you are just clicking as fast as you can to send your members to the next province without any thinking (which is boring...). Then, after getting the heroic status and defeating enemies as soon as they appear, you are just waiting for something to happen and it is boring again. Now, I am waiting for the Necro Lord to attack, but I am under the impression that my stabilisation of the provinces was too good, as there is a 0.0% probability of a calamity and nothing happened for ~20-30 minutes. I reasearched everything, I recruited everybody, every province has maximum status and there is nothing much to do, except for sending 1 or 2 guys to every province every 2-4 minutes. I bought the game because I was somewhat curious. I expected nothing more than I finally got. The game isn't expensive and does not promise more than it will keep. If you don't mind to pay 5€ you might buy it and have a look at it, but if you  have to really think about which game you might afford and which not... just don't buy it.			"

When you open up the read more section on the Steam page the Gameplay section starts with “This is a small simple game”. That sums up the game in a nutshell, a resource management game which has been reduced to small simple task causing gameplay to become tedious in large portions and while you could say to take it in small steps, with playthroughs lasting for 2-3 hours it’s a hard game to come back to.It suffers from limited options when it comes to what you can do for your heroes and the control you have over your guild. There are no internal guild strifes, no camaraderie between guild members and what you end up with is a blank slate of stats in which you push the square peg through the square hole to get the optimal result. It also has a huge amount of RNG similar to something you’d see in a roguelike. The difference here being that you have so little control over your actions and because the RNG is non-reactable it causes more pain than it does pleasure, entire playthroughs can be ruined depending on where and when the calamities hit and the type of heroes your Guild can recruit. The high points would include such things such as a good though generic graphical style and tooltips for everything so you’re never lost, though they get overshadowed by a repetitive experience which while unique isn’t as stimulating as I would have hoped for.In a way it’s like a cake without flavour, it has the right stuff in it to make a suitable cake but lacks all the extra flavour that makes the cake stand out from the rest and making me come back for more. I just hope this style of game is expanded upon through this developer or another, management of people in a guild/fantasy setting is a game grouping we barely see and really has unlimited potential.

												In the end, this game has a very niche audience. While I myself can't necessary say that I would keep on playing it, those who like very finite detailed controlled over a simulator will enjoy the level that this game has to offer. The ability to pause is almost necessary to be able to control your guild to a great future, but for those who are looking for a faster experience, will skip over that and suffer for it. That's why I say it's a very niche audience: you'll either like it for that, or you won't.I go more into the details of gameplay and first impressions in a video here:

			Guild Commander attempts to be a management simulation game, dealing with heroes fighting evil in the land. On Steam Here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/337220/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if...		

	Guild Commander is a Sim game of controlling a guild and sending out heroesthat feels more like a time management game, a happy dream of an accountant.The game provides a large variety of tutorials that can help you as you go throughthe game.	The game has a time system, and you earn income by sending your heroesout on quests. Gold is spent rapidly on rooms you can add to your guild, and your gold is depleted daily in order to maintain those rooms you have added.  The longer the heroes are gone stay in the guild, the less gold is earned daily, and the longer they are in the guild, the more money and resources they drain from you. The gamefails in its base management, and can get boring as you watch your heroes comeand go, but have no control over the individual money spent.  It becomes moreabout getting your heroes out of the guild hall ASAP, so they don't bankruptyou.	There is no management over what actions your heroes take; there is noway to cancel their quest and call them back, and despite putting them inprecarious positions, I have yet to experience a hero dying.  There is nopersonalization of the characters, which takes away from immersion into thegame.  You don't feel like your character is growing and improving;  they become more of an impersonal number.	The continual repetition of  tasks makes this game boring.  It is moreof a money management game than anything else.  It feels like it doesn't haveany depth;  more like how to manage money dumps.  There is no challenge; exceptto stay awake while you play it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												I can see what the game maker wanted, I can see what he intended but it fails sadly.The over all management of the heroes and rooms are to clunky to actually be good.The Heroes are not unique enough, the story is lacking and the list goes on.If the game was ""slower"" in event build up with unlocking of more crisises and so on giving the player time to actuallybuild up their forces and improve their heroes at a better pace it would be more fun.Storyline quests and the like would have improved the game alot, as it is now it is sadly worse than It is a Wipe which is also a ""guild management"" game and I hated that game.

												This is the sort of game you love to hate. It's gorgeous to look at, it's simple enough not to become a drudgery, yet it becomes really repetitive and boring in the mid-to-late game. It's not difficult by any means once you get the hang of it, and even though the in-game tutorial is miserable, there are already guides on Steam Community which are great at explaining ""do""s and ""don't""s.Now, taking into consideration its price tag I can't really see the ""lack of content"" other people are complaining about. It's advertised as ""short and sweet"" and with ""no dark depressing story"", and frankly, it delivers that 100%. Is it repetitive? Hell, yes! But at least it's not trying to fool you with a load of bull like ""intricate story"" or ""deep character progression"".Yes, you'll mostly play this for 3-4 hours max at the beginning then shelf it and go back to it for a couple of hours every month. But then again, it's exactly what a game that costs less than breakfast at Starbucks is supposed to do.			"

												When I first saw Guild Commander on Steam I thought I had found a perfect game. On paper the game sounded amazing.The learning curve is insane, and the small video of the developer stumbling through the mechanics doesn’t help at all. But around the time of my third guild, I figured the system out. Once I knew how the game worked I started to have some fun. There’s no real progression in Guild Commander, troops will show up with a set of stats, and that’s it.Guild Commander is a fantastic concept that completely falls flat in execution. I wanted to like this game, but the more I played the more I came to dislike it. It feels empty, like it’s a prototype. The game can be fun when you get into that swing. But it doesn’t last. It’s a game you’ll enjoy for an afternoon at the most.THE GOOD- Lots of things to manage- Nice graphics and music- Fills a nicheTHE BAD- Unintuitive UI- Poor mechanic explanations- Once you figure out the mechanics there is little challenge DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												This game is the closest I've ever seen to the guild simulator I've always wanted to play. It's simple, it's fun, it's short. I wish it was a complex resource management game with the depth and lore it deserves, but that's unfair.But it wasn't promised to be the next blockbuster hit. It's less than five bucks. And I enjoyed it until the endgame. Other reviewers I feel are being too harsh: This was advertised as a ""short and sweet"" game you can finish in a few hours. And it delivered it precisely. I would reccomend this game, even if only to drum up interest in an even better one.			"

												Pretty fun game though limited in breadth and execution.   The concept of managing a guild is an interesting one; possibly the only one on steam I would wager.  Initially all the mechanics are just thrown in your face and it was amusing to work through it but then when everything gets figured out it boils down to sending the right guy to the right province to maximize income.  You could end the game right there, except you can't because if you provoke the necrolord without maxing out your fame, you're basically toast, making the mid-end game tediousness unavoidable.    But a fun game for what it's worth.			"

												Guild Commander essentially tasks you with seeing to your guild members' needs and sending them out on quests to keep the many provinces from falling to the enemy.  You can construct rooms which, in turn, produce an imaginary resource (strength, energy, etc.) which is then distributed amongst all your guild members.  There are some other hidden mechanics not explained all that well and you'll probably fail horribly your first time out like I did.  Assuming the game takes two-three hours as advertised, I do believe $5 is a fair price to ask considering that some $60 FPS's feature 4-5 hour linear campaigns. Your guild hall will have the same layout from game to game, so there's not a lot of replayability (though I would probably still enjoy coming back anyway from time to time).  Had this game been any more than $5, I wouldn't have been able to recommend it.  Hopefully some future patches will introduce more variety and customization, though I'm not sure if that'll ever happen.

												The game is fun and meets my expectations.      It can use more content though (Expecting free content.) Unless a large DLC then I say charge 1/3 the price for it. This game though being fun can use some needed additions to gameplay.      The game can often be waiting doing nothing or throwing guild members at armies hoping to topple them. This works and with the addition of creating trade guilds, training, making items, and supporting local guilds it adds more layers and play. But sadly this all feeds back to improving the same aspect. In the future I would say the developer should look into board/card games like dominion for ideas to add more flair and possibly more mechanics to keep the player engaged without pushing them to hard. I would say the game reminds me of a board game, and even know it needs more content the price currently as of posting $5 is worth what you get currently and there will I hope be more to come.			"

												I played it for awhile there is a small learning curve to not be afraid of, however I found it an enjoyable game for the small amount that is being requested for it. If you want to challenge yourself with hard difficulty and such you will be looking at about 5-7 hours of gameplay which is about average for a 5-6 dollar game. The game itself is mostly a strategic accounting style of guild management the little bit of voice work can be amusing at times and after losing your first few campaign attempts (you will lose your first few) it is satisfying enough to beat the game.The only cons I would truely be throwing out on this game is your inability to control who you recruit (they just kind of show up and you take them or wait), your inability to remove people from your guild, and the time it takes to actually reach the last boss. The last about 15 minutes of the campaign waiting for the boss will mostly be pistol whipping people you are used to beating by that point while you build up your campaign meter. (Thankfully however there is a button recently put in to allow you to just attempt fighting the final boss...make sure you are ready!) All in all I found this game to be enjoyable enough for the cost I am probably going to give it another playthrough on hard at a later date I would like to see more from it but it is at least worth the cost of admittance.

												After beating the game, I feel I can chip in my two cents about it.Story, setting and general content has been covered by the product description and other reviewers, so I'll refrain from going through all that again and instead focus on the good and the bad.PROs+ Quite a unique setting - only other game that comes anywhere near it seems to be Kairosoft's Dungeon Village+ Decent graphics for such a small game - no great animations, but the texture quality is really okay+ Light-hearted humor - I love me some smiles and chuckles while playing+ Actually really nice music - normally, I'll turn of music within minutes. Here I didn't. Says something, at least for me.CONs- Lack of variety - it feels kind of repetitive to organize your heroes and thus makes the game very shallow- Becomes a drag after the early game - after you research everything and equip your heroes, you spend most of your time waiting for the next thing to happen. Which often felt to be too long.- The end - while I didn't expect much of a story (and didn't get one), the end was very... unsatisfying, especially after the long and forced wait until it actually triggered.Conclusion:It actually feels difficult to give a simple ""yes or no"" answer to the question whether I recommend this game. It has its weaknesses. Annoying and very time-consuming weeknesses. It lacks depth in terms of content and possibilities. If you're into complex simulations, steer clear of this, you'd be disappointed.However, if you're looking for a quite entertaining simple little pastime in a unique setting, you'll probably get your money's worth. I feel like I did. That's why it gets a thumbs-up from me. "

												Some bugs and problems with design (character stats can be increased, but the increase can't be viewed; inventory management is cumbersome) but for the price, a nice little game.			"

												Great game!Of course the game is tedious. ""This is a small simple game.""Incredibly cheap, simple and fun to play for 5 - 10 mins at a time. "

												This game is a number runner.  You watch numbers and bars tick up and down.  The graphics are glorified combo boxes to be selected once per game and then forgotten.  You fast forward to the the important parts, pause, and then fast forward again.  Right now, bars and numbers without a lot of levers and buttons.I'm into these games, love them.  However, it's not for everyone.  Also, it's early access with a lot of easily programmable room to grow.What would make it better?  Interactive rooms.  Ones that you could do upgrades to or assign idle members to.  Something with the room other than making it a combo box to be selected.  You can't even change / upgrade the room, so fire and forget.  Items:  Items are very hit or miss.  There is no negative reason to use an item other than it doesn't give you the right stats.  You normally end up spamming a single item for everyone with few exceptions.  On that subject, low-tier items are a complete waste of cash.  Finally, every unit can use every item.Characters:  Characters don't seem to have an individuality.  Like I said, numbers and bars.  They don't die.  They can't die.  You don't have any personal connection with them.  Engineer Eddie #1 is almost identical to Engineer Eddie #2.  Don't wanna hire a dude now?  He'll come back later.  No levels, no stat change, no death, no change.  I would like to see the flat characters become round.Ultimately, this game is in need of more levers and buttons, which are easy to add.  Either that or change the name to Stat Commander.			"

												I personally don't find any part of this game fun.  At all.  Not even close to what I thought it would be, it's basically a crappy status bar filling simulator hidden behind the guise of a fantasy guild management game.  Don't waste a cent or a moment on this.			"

												I knew this game was gonna be garbage, but I bought it anyway to support GTGD. Try checking out his tutorials, if you have any interest in learning C# in Unity3d. You would have to be looking at this game from a coder's point of view, to appreciate whats really going on.			"

												Well, I am afraid I have to agree with the majority of the reviews I have read thus far. At first, when you aren't sure exactly what to do, this game is hard, way too hard, in a way that can only be attributed to sheer randomness. Sometimes you won't have any calamities, sometimes you will get a new calamity each day. Your soldiers regain stats far, far too slowly, and you just don't make enough money to support full room quality.But then you play for a bit, get a handle on things, buy the (small quantity) of training and items, get all your heroes, and then.... nothing. There is nothing to do but sit around and wait. Wait for your heroes to come back, wait for the next calamity, wait for whatever brings the end of the game (I got bored and stopped waiting, honestly.)So much potential in this premise, and this game has done nothing to reach for that potential. Why can't you customize heroes? Why are there no real animations? Why is there no story? Why is there no anything? Why does the gamer experience center around sitting back and twiddling your thumbs?

												Management sim that oversees sending off strong heroes to fortify provinces, in order to bulk up for the final encounter, quite like in FTL: Faster Than Light. Mostly covers running a profitable guild with slider-focused gameplay like Democracy 3, but also throws in random elements, requires constant vigilance over regions and has sufficient RPG side content to try different play styles; all for a small price.

												This game is interesting, pretty fun to play it once. Sadly the game lacks replay value and is very short.I recommend it for anyone who don't know what to do. It should keep you interested for an afternoon/evening. It's a shame there is not more content. The game could have been much more! Hopefully the developer will make a new bigger game using what he has learnt about this one.			"

			Guild commander is a resource management game setting in fantasy world where you, as the title says command a guild. In this first impression gameplay we will take look at this and we'll see what it...		

It is quite pretty and I love the feeling it gives through its presentation.The humour sells it for me, as I would not usually touch games like these due to a lack of interest.If you love resource management games then you'll like it.			"

												I was going to write positive review - the game has limited gameplay options, but it is not buggy, good looking and adequately priced. So you, in theory, can get few hours of joy and then uninstall it peacefully. But after playing the game for 4 hours, most of which was very repetetive, it still continues and does't tell when the end will be. I am giving up, uninstalling and not recommending this game.			"

												This game seems like a really poor port of a game one would play on a tablet, with its only saving grace that there are no microtransactions. It becomes monotonous after a couple of hours and I found myself easily bored.Edit: It would appear I've only played minutes, but the game made me feel so bored it seemed like hours.			"
