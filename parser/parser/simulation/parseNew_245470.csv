												After a close call I entered office of the U.S of A. with my party, The Sixth Division.  I immeidiately raised the army and police forces arming all officers.  My ministers and liberals resented me for this and so I replaced them all with hand picked fools to run my government. At this time my popularity was low. I then made the death penalty common for small crimes and made sure all police officers were armed with submachine guns. I then saw that a group called the Black Power Group were starting to hate me and so I passed a race discrimination act making sure rascism is illegal. I then made joining the army mandatory and increased the borders and spy networks to the maximum. After surviving five assasination attempts from the socialist party thanks to my secret spy network, the ""Hapstepo"" a group of black extremists broke into my office with machine guns killing me and everyone in my party and on my board.  Very, fun. 10/10 Great game! "

												After a landslide election victory, my party, ""The Fourth Reich"" set about creating a dedicated fascist state in Britain. It was somewhere around the time I introduced mandatory national service, dismantled the Health service completely to fund my secret police, and forced creationism on my people that I began to start enjoying the game. After careful consternation, I conducted a total purge of my cabinet of those who were unsympathetic to my cause, resulting in most of my ministers being reckless incompetents who couldn't tie their own shoes, let alone conduct public office. With hatred of my party running at an all time high, I decided to appease the populace by cutting income tax. Unfortunately, in order to afford this tax break, I had to also cut education funding, resulting in my popularity decreasing even further with the unwashed masses. Shortly after, I was assassinated by members of the Wildlife trust, as my disastrous environmental policies that I brought in to encourage the exploitation of Britain's natural resources resulted in an epidemic of mad cow disease. I then restarted and began The Fifth Reich. 10/10.			"

												I've just come to the end of my third term as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, producivity is at an all time high, there's trillions in the bank and the Tories have been all but eradicated. Not to say there haven't been troubles along the way; the boost in productivity, along with my relaxing of border controls caused an enormous influx of immigration, which in turn lead to racial tensions, riots and the development of ghettos. In many areas, the depth of Democracy 3 is staggering, it just seems such a shame the in other areas it just feels so lacking. All that immigration, the riots, the ghettos, didn't actually change my population, didn't increase the number of poor people in my country and didn't harm my popularity. The opposition had nothing to say either, they just quietly resigned. My ministers have no discernable personality, they have sympathies and desired jobs which affect how well they create your political capital but do nothing themselves, there was no pressure on the welfare minister when my country was ridden with ghettos, my foreign affairs minister had nothing to say when an British island was invaded in the pacific.Elections, also, lack any real depth. No build up, nothing of opposition policies, no campaigns, no debate no tension. Just a bar chart on polling day and that's about it. No electoral map, no fighting for seats, only ever two parties. For a game with such a strong cental simulation it lets it self down in the details and doesn't inspire me to play any further.All in all Democracy 3 is fun for a while, but is too easy and lacks the depth throughout to justify the £18.99 price tag. For a fiver I would say it's worth a pop, but at the moment just feels too much about moving sliders and not enough like leading a nation in the world.For me to buy Democracy 4 it would need- Multiple political parties with clear political agendas.- Far, far more in depth elections, facing difficult questions from the electorate.- More personality from ministers and opposition parties, maybe a touch of ""Yes, Minister""- More international involvement. No other nations are mentioned at all. "

OverviewDemocracy 3 is a government simulator and an internal politics simulator. You step in the shoes of the leader of a chosen country and administer it, change taxes, modify the enforcement of a current law, introduce new ones, or remove them altogether. Every action you make has its consequences, be they good or bad. That is up for you to decide. How will you run your country?Pros: Very In-Depth - Even though the interface looks simple and clean, with almost everything being just bars and icons, don't be fooled. There is an enormous amount of micro-management that goes on behind the scenes. Everything you do has a chance to change something, by a calculated, statistical margin. Every group of citizens has thoughts of their own, and the focus group gives you an incredible view of each persons thoughts, opinions, and political affiliations. There are also numerous charts that are automatically generated each term, that show you different things like income, expenses, rise or falls in certain areas such as crime, unemployment, or healthcare as well as what policies or events affect them and by what percentage. I am impressed of the level of detail that went into this simulation. Lots of Choices - This game operates by making, removing and modifying policies. And there are loads of them. How you change these policies affects how your country works, and the level of customization is great. Will your schools teach Creationism or Evolution? Will you favor Oil or Clean Energy? Will you fight crime or promote it? Will you set taxes on product categories? Will you offer subsidized services such as transportation, education and healthcare? It's up to you to decide - all that by adjusting sliders! Beautiful Interface and Decent Music - The gameplay aspects may be complicated, but the interface is not. Everything is beautifully labeled, and divided into categories, and the interface is clean, minimalist and very intuitive. Navigation is a pleasure and the nice ambient music provides a relaxed atmosphere for you to play in. Everything is color coded, charts and other analytic data is easy to read, an overall great interface. Sandbox - In a simulation game, this is a must, and Democracy does follow the rule. You can alter the game settings to your will and change aspects such as what kind of governments your country has, if you can make changes based on your political capital, if you are prone to assassination attempts by opposing extremists, if voting is compulsory or not, whether or not you can be the victim of natural disasters, how long your terms are and how many terms are you allowed to have and many more. You can choose if you want a challenging run in order to try and save your country, or a relaxing dream of the perfect country. Steam Integration - The Workshop is a great place to lengthen you play time, as people are creating numerous policies, country presets or other mods for the game. The Trading Cards and Achievements are also nice incentives to play more and try out new play styles when managing your country.The Cons: No External Relations - The game mentions foreign relations lots of times, but does not quantify it. You don't know which countries like you, which don't, and how that affects your own. Generalization - It sometimes feels like you are running a city, not a country, because the stats you are given are averaged across the population. You don't have things like reports based on certain areas, rural or urbane, poor or rich towns, reports on counties etc. This is mainly because you can choose to run one of several countries, or make your own via the workshop, and that individual statistics like those would be harder to manage and calculate, but it would have been a great feature that would make this the ultimate political simulator. DLC that should have been free - I will start with the disclaimer that I do not own any of the DLCs, but from other reviews and reading their description, I'm not inclined to pay money for them. Sure, they add a few very interesting concepts to consider into the game, but are not so major they require an extra payment. ConclusionThis is by far one of the most complex and interesting text and charts based game I've played with enough replay value to start as a sandbox enthusiast and end as a well-read political analyst. I recommend it to anyone interested in politics, or moral decisions in government policies, and who want to play ""god"" with their fictive version of their country. Although, considering the price, I'm kinda on the fence on this one. It is really enjoyable but I wouldn't pay the full price for it. If you are not convinced you'd enjoy this game, wait until a sale. I got my copy for 4,53€.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page! Link to the right!Jad's List - Curator Group "

												Wow, running a country isn't what I expected. Rather than killing badgers and being insulted by the Daily Mail like a real politician, I spent my first few years as Prime Minister removing the country of all crime. Surprisingly, this worked. Only it turns out that the selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ public wouldn't vote for me until I fixed things like equality and massive horrible poverty, the greedy whining ♥♥♥♥♥.But hey, I managed to pull that off pretty okay, just barely scraping through the election. All was going well, until people started to ask how I was going to pay for all those extra police and terrifying murder drones I'd use in my war on crime. Turns out I couldn't, and was forced to raise taxes to a horrendous degree in an attempt to maybe pay off some of the debt, but before I could manage that I was murdered by capitalists.Politics are hard.But anyway, it was only a few attempts later that I managed a 20-year long run as Prime Minister, winning landslide victory after landslide victory as I turned Britain into a socialist utopia. After fixing every problem ever I got a bit bored and tried to create a facist dictatorship, but instead I eradicated poverty by mistake. Woops.Politics are easy.So I guess the point of this stupid ramble is that it may have gotten pretty easy pretty fast but at least it was interesting.			"

												You really play more of a democratically-elected dictator whose only real limitation is ""Political Capital"" -- a currency used to enact policy change. For example, raising taxes costs a great deal of capital, while lowering it cost less. Capital refreshes each turn. The large problem with this system lies in the fact that the capital cost does not scale with the amount you change a policy. Raising taxes 1% cost the same as raising it 70%. This makes the process seem trivial.In addition, because there is no Congress or Parliament to negotiate with, there is little strategy involved. The core gameplay revolves around moving sliders around and watching numbers change. In real life, an attempt to introduce universal healthcare would involve a bill which included both the funding for health services and accompanying taxes to pay for it. Here, the process would take several turns since I would need to use up my political capital separately on each individual part of the process.The result is a remarkably shallow experience. No trying to get the votes for a bill to pass, no negotiation, no managing the media. Even the sliders can sometimes feel incomplete -- you can't individually control the income tax for different income levels. The core of the experience is seeing how the programmer thinks the nation would react to different numbers. I can't help feel there could be more to it.			"

												While this is does act as a very basic simulation of the many policies and group affiliations found in politics, the fact that it lacks any randomness and produces predictable obstacles for you to overcome makes this a one-time play through that would offer a few hours of interest... for $25.Basically the game is this. You create policies, and they are always passed. There are never any obstacles that interfere with your political decisions, even if the world hates you. The policies have a linear and very calcuable effect on the different voter affiliations. Sometimes they have consequences. You pass other policies which counter-balance those consequences. Ta-daaa! That's it. Once you hit a nice stride, you just keep hitting next turn until you end the game. Why don't you set your difficulty higher??? With my difficulty bar set high, using one of the most difficult countries in the game (USA), I had no political opponents, no groups that wanted to interfere with me, nobody to say ""No"" to the policies I would try to pass (as saying No is not even a mechanic in this game. Obama would love it.) My entire cabinet could be made up of Socialists and I could repeal every Socialist policy in the course of one day and no one would stop me or tell me otherwise. That... is where this game falls dramatically short. And also your cabinet does not randomly generate, so you end up with the same stuffy people every single playthrough.That said, the developer does seem to make lots of changes to the game, and he may be receptive to feedback. If this game was $5, I would highly recommend it and even take it upon myself to offer constructive feedback. But paying top dollar for a game that feels like it belongs on a flash website leaves me bitter.			"

												Democracy 3 is a turn-based strategy game stripped down to its barest elements. Think Civilization V but without the world map. Democracy eschews almost all visual flare in favor of numbers, charts, and graphs. As a government simulator, it makes sense that most of your time is spent pouring over facts and figures, even if that seems to fly in the face of video game logic. It also makes sense that you never actually see the people you are governing. They are problems to be solved: approval ratings, social malfunctions, tax revenue. You never see the drunk or the homeless but know they exist because they’re no good for the bottom line.Assessing your nation - France, Germany, U.S., Australia, or the UK - takes place on one of the most convoluted user interfaces I have ever seen. More than five dozen bubbles litter the screen, broken up into different colors and key sections such as Tax, Economy, Law & Order, and so on. White bubbles represent policies, blue bubbles provide data on the impact of those policies, and red bubbles are situations requiring your attention.Changing a policy requires political capital which is refreshed at the start of every turn. Making a big decision requires more capital, so you won’t be legalizing abortion and removing the cigarette tax in a single turn. Political capital is used to institute new policies in the same way. Adjusting those you start out with is interesting, adding more of your own is even more fun.Experimenting with policies creates a ripple effect on your constituency. More than twenty groups of voters dynamically react to your decisions, raising and lowering your approval rating. Members of your cabinet might also become disloyal and need to be replaced. Radicals might even try to kill you.As a government simulator, Democracy 3 does a remarkable job. Its presentation and wealth of data truly makes you feel like a world leader.For every moment of fun strategizing and eager anticipation there was an equal moment spent wishing the experience was more user friendly. I felt like a president, just as promised, but I was also reminded of why I would never want the job in the first place.Democracy 3 is a game for the politically-minded. It favors substance over flair. Some players might love the added analysis required for each turn but others will find it wearing out far sooner than it probably should. The denseness of Democracy 3’s presentation is its biggest barrier and it leaves one wondering why: Was this really the best way to deliver what, at its heart, is so similar to games like Civilization? For this iteration, it seems so. If you are willing to climb the hill and submerse yourself in numbers and graphs, this might be the game for you. If not, it is probably best avoided.			"

												First impressions aren't great - this game has so much depth that the interface can be very confusing. The tutorial helps... a bit, but the best trick is to play your first game on 50% difficulty. After that, you will understand the mechanics of the game  better and can dive in with gusto again and again. And you'll want to do just that. After all, everyone knows that politicians are self-serving idiots and that we could do a better job armed with nothing more than common sense, don't we? You can build a fairer country or guarantee jobs for all. Rapidly though you find that running a country is more like weaving and pulling one thread taut will cause something else unravel unexpectedly. The game balance is great, nothing feels random, just complex. With numerous countries to run, each with their own problems and opportunities, plus workshop expansions, this game just keeps on giving. All the depth of the best of the SimCity game, without the unecessary graphical frippery.			"

												I love strategy/sim games, but Democracy 3 gets very, very, very, very, very, very, very repetitive. About 12 Random Events exist, and they keep recurring. Overall, the recipe for success is very similar across the game, whatever the country.The game makes a big point of having modelled individual citizens, but this really doesn't come up as part of the gameplay, since you're dealing with populations of millions, and the point is to make broad-strokes decisions with data summaries.The real challenge is winning your first re-election, as it gets far easier after this. The assassinations are a joke, and the most inexplicable thing I've seen in a game for a long time. Switch them off.Not worth full price; maybe worth the on-sale price			"

												Being a person interested in political philosophy and economics I could not help myself getting excited about Democracy 3 release. The earlier version of the game ak. Democracy 2 was well known, and critically acclaimed as best aviable real state governance simulation, so the expectations about new release in the series were set pretty high.Luckily 'Democracy 3' does not fail to meet them, by refreshing old gameplay and adjusting it to current world situation. For those who did not have a chance to play 'Democracy 2', what we get now is a game centered on governing some pre-set countries just after being elected for our first term. The game does not only cover impresive (and still groving) number of policies and decisions spanning from most obvious ones like setting taxes, or managing public services to much less common, but still possible gov.-made decisions like state-founding a space program, or introducing creationism theory to schools.What's important to point out, is the fact that our decisions does not hang in some kind of mythical ether, but rather influence and 'are' actively influenced by the only sovereign present in model democracies - the people. The simulation of those people, or ""the voters"", is definitely the strongest point of the game. Every person in the country is represented, with their needs, loyalties and political views categorized into some main social groups. What makes this system realy cool is the fact, that just like in realy world every person can be a member of more than one group, reacting diferently to many introduced policies, so it's not something unusual to see a groups of commuting, eco-friendly socialists on one side, and motorist, conservative capitalists on the other, acompanied by some liberal state-emplyees who also happen to be patriotic.So, as You see, satisfying all those groups may be a little challenging, buy one could ask 'why the hell do I even need to satisfy anyone' ? Well that of course is up to You, but the point of the game is getting re-elected, and You can't do it with the support of more than one social group in the begining. Of course You can slowly press on society through clever policies encouraging flow of the people from one social group to another, but this of course can not be completed in just one term, so until You'll be able to realize Your vision of a true utopia supported by pretty monolithical society composed for example of commuting, eco-friendly capitalists, You may be forced to make some realy hard decisions, and even cross Your initial ideals only to barely slip into another term in the office.Last thing requiring attention is the large amount of criticism, that centered on a called 'left-bias' in the game, openly promoting liberal/socialist views on state and economics. Unfortunately to some degree this accusations are true, with some brighter examples being 'no-gun control policy' resulting in rapid increase of 'violent crimes', or 'science founding' and 'space program' policies resulting in more and more people giving up their religion. But despite such minor flaws, there is nothing right in quite common accusation that You ""can only win this game while playing socialist"". It's just not right because the game gives You liberty to play low-tax, passive 'minimum state' and still come out victorious, with most of the population satisfied. The trick is to know the right pace for the changes, 'cause initialy, in most aviable countries, the population of state-depandant voters is just way to high to accept any radical 'laissez-faire' policies.Overaly 'Democracy 3' is definitely best state-governing simulator out there, and for quite some time it'll be. With a huge and active modding community, and acces to steamworks, it's also getting more and more complex, while alowing players to experiment with the game, being extremely fun for those strugling to create virtual environment suiting their vison of a real-life Government.

												Democracy 3, much like Europa Universalis 4 and Crusader Kings 2:- Presents you with an initially indecipherable mess of icons,- Has you spend loads of time paused while trying to figure out what action to take,- Takes some time before the gameplay appears,- Allows deep customization of your nation late-game, based on earlier long-term decisions,- Eventually becomes totally enthralling and wonderful.I think that many people bounce right off of this game because it's not flashy and there's no grand map with color-coded overlays. It's also exceptionally boring to watch / look at. That's unfortunate because it has excellent gameplay and I think it deserves attention. The interface is exceptionally good, conveying extremly complex interrelations clearly. Making a decision often has a butterfly effect across many elements of your nation, which you can clearly trace and understand. Every menu is useful and every turn is a struggle to decide which choice to take. After a few hours of analyzing bubbles and arrows you are able to deeply understand your nation's character. I recommend all the DLC as well. The game is extremely stable and only crashes when mods conflict. Speaking of mods, there are many nations on Workshop that have very unique gameplay compared to each other. Playing as Turkey is quite different than playing as France, for example. Recommended for people that enjoy grand strategy nation building games, but people that demand high-paced action will hate it.  "

												Oddly enough, this one is not about invading oil-rich Middle Eastern countries.Successfully ruling a country means juggling hundreds of factors in an effort to satisfy most of your citizens and evetually get re-elected. The trick lies in somehow dodging the very real possibility of running your country into the ground by failing economically, socially or politically, which despite the rather clear interface and streamlined mechanics is no easy job. Extreme failure in navigating the political landscape can even get you assassinated, which I believe isn't even the worst outcome, all things considered. So there you have it, Democracy 3 is a remarkably complex yet approachable game designed to challenge your gray matter.P.S. I will not get in political arguments. I will not get in political arguments. I will not get in political arguments. I will not get in political arguments. I will not get in political arguments. I will not get in political arguments.

												Overpriced. The achievements don't feel nearly as significant as they should feel. People will only like you for what you implement, not for what you accomplish. You eliminate crime and poverty, nothing seems to actually change in the game, it plays the exact same as it used to play before. How? Did people just not notice that at all? How can they just not care about that? Assassination plots are also silly, but the fact that eliminating problems has no actual consequences on the way you play is terrible. Also, it only has a two-party system, which doesn't make lots of sense since it gives you more than one playable country. It doesn't just make the game less realistic, it also makes the game simpler, you don't have to make deals or anything, it's all up to you. But, as soon as you lose an election, you lose the game and can't get elected again. It's like your party dissolves and the other one rules for eternity with no opposition ever. Democracy 3 isn't a very good game.			"

												I definitely had fun with this game - for about two or three hours - but it's not worth the current $25 price tag. At $5, okay, perhaps. But I just simply don't see much replay here, particularly since I earned more than half of the achievements the first time around. Also, I question their algorithm. Maybe I have a lot in common with the creators, but I simply governed the way that I would personally want to have the country run - and consistently got 97-99% of the popular vote. It was never even close. That seems a touch unrealistic, given that some of my policies were pretty drastic (full ban on guns, legalized marijuana and LSD, ban on creationism taught in schools, massive taxes on all fuel/junk food/tobacco, maximum subsidies to public transport). Sounds like utopia to ME, but I don't think everyone else would agree.			"

												It's too simple. There are two parties (yours and the opposition) and that is it. There's no struggling with the legislature and judiciary, no real international diplomacy or anything approaching a crisis, and no constitution at all. As the American President you can entirely ban firearms on your first day in office with no issues whatsoever. It's incredibly shallow in that respect.The other major issue is that it's all heavily Americanized, with a few British elements thrown in too. Every country plays exactly the same, just with different starter demographics. In the game Germany has two parties, despite predominately being governed by political alliances between parties that could be extremely interesting to manipulate. France on the other hand seems to have completely lost its status as a semi-presidential republic and given all of the prime minister's powers to the president. There's no element of local or provincial politics for any nation either, the US, Australia, Canada and Germany are ruled by a powerful central government the same as the UK or France.Really, there's no need to have more than one country. The rest are just skins to swap between. A properly differntiated system in each state that mirrors their own government would have been fantastic. The US trying to balance the constitution, struggles to control congress, and the power of the states themselves could have been amazing. The UK trying to keep it's separate nations together. The struggle between the president and prime minister in France. None of it appears at all in the game.The UI isn't great either. It too is heavily simplistic. You have to remember icons to find important policies, which also move within their section, and alter them. It's not a horrible thing, but it does slow everything down considerably. To enact a policy you have to open the relevant screen, get a rough idea of how ""pleased"" people will be and the costs. But you can't even see who exactly will be pleased or displeased with a policy until you have enacted it. You could push a group over the edge unintentionally and be assassinated for it, all because even vague details aren't shown until it is enacted.That's why I can't recommend this game. In reality, there's very little content. The same few events popping up over and over again. The same UI problems leading to unintended consequences. The same country with a different flag each time you play. I feel like in a perfect world with just a few changes I should have been able to recommend this, which makes it all the more sad that I cannot.			"

												There's a good game in here... it just needs a lot more added to itThe first couple of games you play are fun, but once you've experimented with different policy layouts there is very little difference between games. No matter which country you start with, you'll inevitably find your way towards implementing similar policies, because they don't offer any variation apart from starting position. The political cost for changing gun laws in the USA and Australia IS EXACTLY THE SAME despite starkly different opinions across both populations.Assassinations are far too frequent. Of the six countries present in the game, I think there's been one successful assassination in the past 100 years. This game will have capitalists shooting you for raising slightly raising taxes or have the religious hunt you for teaching evolution. It's completely unrealistic and there are better mechanics that could be implemented if the game wants to punish players for deviating from the political centre (greater opposition party funding, turnout at elections)Elections are dull (I've not tried the latest DLC), but there are only two parties. Your opponents have a name, but no idealogical background. Your own party is completely unified and presents no opposition to your agenda, however radical it may be. I'd really like to see this combined with something like Political Machine 2016, where your government's achievements could be used to campaign heavily in given states. I know this would be difficult to do for each country, but something more is needed.The measure of your popularity is completely ridiculous as well. You spend most of your first term with popularity below 15% (no matter what you implement). The final few turns before the election it will always rise to somewhere between 40-60% for no reason at all. If you're running a mildly competent administration, then you should have no issue achieving 80%+ popularity in your second term. There is no country in the world where voters are this fluid.There are a lot of policy options, but not enough. I was quite disappointed that you couldn't actually run as a communist, or suspend elections, imprison political opponents etc (things that would actually warrant targeted assassination attempts.) Even some more moderate, contemporary issues such as basic income, plain tobacco packaging, political donations, mining taxes weren't in the game.The implementation of policy is a bit clumsy too. Although using political capital sounds a good mechanic in theory, there are times such as global economic disaster where governments have to respond quickly with drastic measures. Using a global economic collapse as an example, you could spend two turns building up capital to raise income taxes, two turns to cut health funding, another two turns to increase unemployment benefits and state housing, by which time 1.5 years have passed and the global recovery is well and truly underway.I really wanted to like this game, I really tried. If you're just wanting to mess about with policy, then it's average. If you're looking for a political simulator, with campaigns, internal party politicking, parliamentary/congressional conflict (which would be a lot more enjoyable and offer a lot more replay value), then it fails.

												Since I'm interested politics and government, I can't deny that the idea of a political simulator appealed vastly to me.My first concern was that the game was going to too blatently support one political ideology, whether or not that ideology works. Of course the creator's political biases do come into the game, and not every action behaves identically to how you might expect it to work in real life, but after several playthroughs I can say with some confidence that you don't always have to follow one particular ideology to have a chance of winning.The game does a great job of creating a diverse grouping of people. Your actions have not only an effect on how certian groups feel but also on their prevelance within your country. This means slow changes usually lead the way to victory—immediately legalizing all drugs and banning the teaching of evoloution in schools will make your populice angry, but doing it over time will allow you to potentially increase the percentage of liberals and religious members in your country. Each citizen belongs to multiple groups—every decision affects the group the same way (for instance, all parents dislike lowering the drinking age) but this is balanced since it's not as strong of an effect on a liberal parent as a conservative parent, for instance.That said there are a couple major flaws. The first is that ""winning"" isn't very fun at all. You can get to the point where in every election you get 99% of the vote and the other party basically doesn't exist—by looking closer at the numbers instead of your personal beliefs, this is actually not too difficult to do. The fun of the game comes mostly in screwing up and being voted out or assisinated, and watching how some things go horrificly poorly. I abandoned most of the games where it seemed like it would never end (I was playing without a term limit, so I'd been Prime Minister for about 400 years at that point).The second major flaw is that while most things don't have an odd, clearly ideological-biased, effect, some do. Don't ever enact Luxury Goods Tax if you don't want your economy to collapse when a ""Brain Drain"" causes all of your intelligent and talented workers to leave the country. Similarly, legalizing drugs is likely to cause major drug addiction problems which wind up needing more police to counteract (this is especially fun when playing as the US, where one would hope that legalizing drugs at least initially eliminated the cost of the DEA). This wouldn't be so bad, but enacting policies that aren't already in place doesn't give you any access to the numbers, forcing you to guess what a policy will do before enacting it and dealing with the consequences or spending even more political capital, the currency of the game, to revoke it.The third major flaw is that the country differences don't matter as much as you'd hope, and in some cases make you want to change the options. The biggest change is the starting position, based on the creator's understanding of the political situation in the non-UK countries, which isn't so bad but as I mentioned before with slow changes you can shift a country from basically any starting position. Other differences (like whether or not you have earthquakes or a monarch) are actually mostly just there to decide whether or not to mix additional random events in. Term limits are pretty pointless since a term is short (it's 16 turns, where you slowly see the impact of your changes starting to take effect on each term) so you'll probably turn them off for the countries that have them. On a more minor note, it's very odd that you can start some countries (like Canada) with less than 50% of the vote were the election to be held today, since one assumes at the very beginning of your first term you just won the election.However, none of these flaws totally break the game in my opinion. Some are more annoying than others when playing, but once you get the hang of them, the game really starts to shine. It's a lot of fun to fail at making a perfect government, and a really great political simulator in a world where that's not a very common type of game. You probably already know if you want this game. If you have no interest in politics or government, you won't enjoy it. But if you love politics and government and want very badly to play a political simulator, Democracy 3 is well worth your time.			"

												An interesting, turn-based political simulation game. With thousands of components all interconnected, one decision could have consequences such as, being the target of an assassination. This game is great for those who like to spend time tinkering with different choices to see what the outcome will be, but other than that it is nothing more than a basic turn-based political simulation game, with limited visual interplay and a text-heavy content. This would probably be more for a niche player who already enjoys similar types of games.			"

												The only possible explanation for the tagline ""The most complex political game ever made"" is that Democracy 3 creators did not play many strategy games before. This game is actually pretty easy once you catch the drift and the progressive political bias, and you can get from any starting point to 90% and more on elections day.Economics are simple and redundant. Some policies are significantly better than others, and might have nearly none negative effects. Ministers do as they told, factions might be angry with you, but you can push and execute any reform without any substantial resistance. No corruption, no one undermines you, no operational issues. Government can solve every problem efficiently in a pen stroke, given enough months. You can even educate all population to accept your agenda within a few years.Yes, the decision making might be more complex than most strategy games. You have many options and lots of things to consider. However, for a game that decision making is its ONLY feature, I would expect a less simplistic mechanism. 25$ is extreme over-pricing.  "

												This is a fun little game that locks you down in a cycle of 'just one more turn'-type addictiveness. I say 'little' because I wouldn't pay full price for it. Despite the amount of work that clearly had to go into balancing all the different variables of this game, there's not a whole great deal of gameplay when you get down it it. After some initial touch-and-go difficulty, I made it through my first election, and from then on it was a pretty steady rise until I'm 10 terms in, with no unemployment, no poverty, 100% of the vote and the highest possible GDP. I say this not to brag, but merely to demonstrate that you can ace this game on the first try. In saying that, it took me 6 hours, which is as long as a CoD campaign and they ask $90 bucks for that. And it was nice to turn Australia into a profitable yet compassionate and sustainable nation.Even so, I can't justify spending $20 on something that you can buy on the app store for your phone. But for the sale price, it's wonderful. I'd highly recommend getting the DLC, by the way, as without it, I'd feel like there was too little content, even for the sale price.			"

												tl;dr Tough to not recommend, but with all the spelling/grammar mistakes, graphics problems, factual errors, and all the while carrying a price tag of $25, I have to say no. 5/10.So first some issues ranging from small to large:*numerous typos*grammatical issues*graphic and UI bugs (like where you don't see the person you are focused on, or see the same picture for all of them, male or female).*abundance of ""negative"" policy choices to spend your budget.*limited options to recoup money from taxes and other sources*incorrect economic, budget, deficit, and GDP mechanics (more on this later)*confusing start and gameplay (most of the issue with the game)*high chance to get assassinated no matter what you do*and $25 is way too high for such limited game time.So now the good:*fun experience*complicated in a good way (but can be daunting to those who want casual play)*likely adequately displays the hardship of running a democratic nation*laughably terrible results to your actions*definitely a game you can learn something fromSo the game has its positives. And like most games, there is replay value. In this game's case the replays come from playing a different party or to retry a failed attempt. I found a few playthroughs to be entertaining and I feel the urge to play more, but that is mostly because I already own the game. That having been said, I will have to overlook the very large inconsistencies when compared to real life (more on this later).There are ""future tech"" initiatives, which I'm not sure are viable, as I have yet to complete the Mars Base.. Those kinds of policies could be pipe dreams to show the futility of even attempting them, or they could be hard difficulty items to pass that require skill and careful planning. It is difficult to tell the intent of the devs with this game because of all the flaws and errors (more on this now).One really big issue is the lack of policies that do anything. There are obvious ""butter them up"" policies where you throw a few billion at putting up flags for the patriots group (which also raises their numbers) or throwing a couple hundred million at environmentalists knowing that it will make them happy but not actually accomplish anything for the environment metric. Those policies are a literal and figurative riot. But the real problems come from the policies that are designed to do something. Like all policies, it is left to the player to determine if the policy will have the desired result and it may not be obvious for many turns. But the issue lies in that the policies are almost always ineffectual (which is probably somewhat true to life), and the problem is that there is no alternative, only subsidies that make people happy and don't move the actual metric you are attempting to change.The specific metric I'm talking about is the GDP. Almost all of the policies do nothing to affect any of the issues that determine your nation's GDP and the ones that do affect employment or whatever are really not great options for economic stimulus. I don't want to get into too much detail, but basically every move you make to increase GDP has almost no effect. But if your budget has a slight deficit, your country's credit score gets downgraded. And here's where the devs get really sloppy. I was playing as the US with a deficit of $75 billion or less per quarter (so about $300B annually) with a steadily rising (domestically minded) economy and I was faced with this situation: The global economy went into a recession (while I remained strong), and yet my country's debt rating was lowered. What the F? So the rest of the world is flirting with the apocalypse and the strongest economy in the world is the one on the chopping block? I'd love to see the notes on the Moody's or Standard and Poor's meeting...""Uh, it has come to this agency's attention that we are in a global recession, but that the Americans have a strong economy based on sound fiscal policy, appropriate subsidies and stimulus, reliable infrastructure and a strong transportation network. However it appears they have a $300 billion dollar annual deficit... All those in favor of lowering the United State's credit rating out of spite? *AYE*All those opposed? *crickets*Ok, it is unanimous. The Unites States of America is hereby given the below investment grade rating of CCC. Now if there are no other points of order, I would like to adjourn for the day so that I may go home and board up my windows in anticipation of the wandering♥♥♥♥♥♥gangs. May God have mercy on our souls.""The game actually starts you at BBB, and to give you an example of an actual country with a BBB rating, that would put the United States on par with Columbia..... Yes, the ♥♥♥♥ing drug and political nightmare that is Columbia. You know who is rated right above us? Thailand. Yes, sex trafficking, military coup-of-the-week Thailand. In case you're wondering, the US is actually rated AA by the S&P (and even that is a joke of a rating considering Germany, at AAA, has flirted with negative yields). And in case you don't know if $300B is a bad deficit, the actual numbers (averaged) for the US for the last 10 years (as of writing this) is ~$790B.So needless to say there are some serious problems with the game. In fact the biggest one is right at the start. You're supposed to be this newly elected president. However your approval rating is sub 20% and just about every demographic hates you. Your own political party numbers in the low millions and the opposition party has the rest of the voters. So when you are approaching election time, you have 7 million people on your side and the other party has 118 million. I understand the methodology from a gameplay standpoint, but with no lead-in story, I imagine myself to be in the election climate of Lincoln and gifted with the polarizing talent of Donny T. It is vapidly unrealistic considering you are given a two party system to chose from and one of those parties just elected you. I wonder why they didn't think of a more balanced game that focuses on the actual 2 party system in place and having to fight over the moderates who are easily disenfranchised or led to vote for a fringe party. There is still ample room to have your national approval rating go into a free fall.I do like that the game does a good job showcasing the frustration in dealing with a diverse grouping of differing morons, but I think it fails to accurately mimic reality. A point which I think is a deciding factor for most when contemplating making a purchase. At face value, and if you don't know anything about politics, economics, social policy, psychology, or any of the other topics considered in this game, it might be a good experience. Even listing all that I've said above, it can still be fun. But with a $25 price tag and numerous spelling, graphical, and grammatical errors, I feel that this game wasn't properly QA'd nor finished. I know that it would be near impossible to make a game that adequately represents the real life world of politics AND still make it fun. However, I believe it is entirely possible to run spell check on a word processor. I do not expect games these days to be flawless, but this game is seriously unpolished. I'm willing to overlook a lot of the spelling errors, as maybe I've made some of those mistakes in my review. But for the cost of one copy of this game ($25), they could have taken the script to an English tutor at a local community college and avoided the simplest of mistakes. Concerning the rest of the game, I see potential in a great concept, but the lack of knowledge to execute it. Would not recommend at full price; might recommend on sale for <$5. A wavering 4 to 6 rating, but ultimately a 5/10.			"

												Although the core gameplay itself is decent (though dull), thinking outside the two party system in-game is very limited. Democracy 2 suffered from massive favoritism towards a welfare state. This is not the case with Democracy 3, but a new issue has cropped up. Playing as the US, the game is impossible to complete using philosophical ideals outside of the two main party philosophies. Taking on a minimalist state approach not unlike classical liberalism will see the country tank and your reelection bid completely out of reach. Anarcho-capitalism will result in your assassination. I would assume the same could be said for the opposite spectrum of full-fledged welfare/warfare statism. As such, you are limited to boundaries that can best be described as minimal government to the Republican-state or maximum government to the Democrat-state. Anyone well aware of politics presently knows this to be a very limited space between these two ideas. The reason minarchism or anarcho-capitalism is impossible in this game is simple: the game implicates that a nation's people are unable to exist without government. Nothing in the game is possible without two entities: taxation and subsidization. Removing subsidization (grants) from any industry results in virtually the immediate tanking of GDP. Granted, as much of a welfare state as the US has become (this includes the governments interactions with corporations and business hand-outs and bail-outs), things would inevitably become ""worse"" at first as everything must readjust itself to playing on the leveled field of the free market, but in this game, things NEVER  get better. If you find your philosophy comfortably on or between Democrat or Republican, you can enjoy this game. Otherwise, thinking beyond the two ""choices"" given to US citizens is not rewarded.			"

												I'd give this game a 3/10 for the following reasons+ Great interface and general view. Lots of interesting problems and policiesIt's easy to know what you're doing even though ther's lots of info to handle + Easy to learnNot so difficult to understand what's going on from the first hour or so- Fantastically poor economic and political theory1. Liberals and Social democrats are NOT the same thing, almost every policy in the game has them mixed up.Just because the Dems in USA call themselves liberals doesn't make them that, they are Soc. Dems. mostly now.2. Free trade is the centrepiece of liberal foreign policy yet they're angered when you sign a FTA?3. Taxes on the general population don't affect economy(income tax and sales tax) even though they should by affecting consumption and thereby investment.4. Liberals like a lot of the things they should dislike and dislike what they should like or are indifferent to a lot of things they care about in real life(ex. gated communities, child benefit, dip. service etc.)5. Capitalists should approve of policing and strong legal framework because of the enforcement of contracts and protection of the right to ones property6. GDP has a maximum limit, replace it with GDP growth instead.7. Labour laws are bundled into one policy instead of several like Min.wage, retirement benefits, safety regs. Would make for a much more realistic labour-regulation game8. Poor people, Rich people, poverty and the different income levels don't have the correlations they should have.9. The cost of change made to policies is not changed by the magnitude of that change(ex. raising income tax rom 40 to 45% has the same cost as raising it to 65%).10. Electoral system is rudimentary at best: implement plurality, proportional etc electoral systems to better reflect the different countries. Coalitions would be nice too. Winning elections is waaay too easy. Also reflect what offices are and are not elected. This is especially important in the US. 11. No constitutions(ex. tightening gun law is as difficult in GER as in the US)12. Legal framework should be improved with things like Legal certainty, expediency and equality.13. Capitalists dislike a lot of things they shouldn't (ex. disability benefit)14. No ability to regulate/unregulate economy properly(ex. credit, banking reserves, monetary policy overall[combine with the unelected/elected offices problem] managing trade, private/public debt, housing[ex. rental apartments keep people poor by not letting them invest their rents as they would do with mortgages] etc.)15. Public services are a part of the economy16. No party ideology(ex. it should be impossible for socialist parties to ban trade unions or drop labour laws beyond a certain point). Also you should not be getting votes and happiness for things that were already there from the beginning.- Strangely calibrated effects of some policies1. Agricultural policies have to be recalibrated so obesity, food prices, incomes and costs match2. Rare earth crisis should be solvable with trade alone(not all countries can mine for rare earth minerals) and should not immediately kill Tech advantage3. Oil economics don't have enough effect4. Migration should be recalibrated5. Brain-drain too easily provoked6. Foreign policy must be made MUCH more complex.7. Many of the problems in this game are only considered problems by certain voter groups and should not be displayed as problems for certain players(ex. playing very nationalist should let you get extreme nationalism as a positive thing)All and all I'd say this game is made by people heavily on the left side of the political spectrum, but without a formal education in neither political science nor economics. Though I usually agree with centre-left views, this game makes it seem like left is the only possible way to go.			"

You basically have to govern a 'certain way' each time otherwise you get murdered.I really wanted to like this game, but it's shallow and unrealistic, especially if you 'survive' the first term, then the game becomes to easy - an issue that plagued Democracy 2 as well.Definitely don't pay full price.

												7/10. While enjoyable there are several big drawbacks: - The game has a big bias toward some things. Apparently in Liberal-Capitalist country no-one minds 50% flat taxes, heavy regulation etc. - Many events repeat themselves and seems to be one-off - The cabinet supporting some groups makes no sense. One minister is angry about not caring about his core group even though I have 100% support and his group has 0 members. - One way of another you play as US. There are 2 parties and no coalitions. Evolution vs creationism is apparently an issue and England and France teaches both at the start. - People are angry and have opinion about you based on what is rather then was you are doing. So you can start with 0% approval rating. - Social engeneering is way too easy. It seems to be rather impossible for a country to get 0 people in some groups just in a few years.I'm on edge but given non-discounted price I'd expect much better.			"

												The problem with Democracy 3 is that no matter how marginalized a faction, they can still assassinate you. Even though my people were receiving numerous Nobel Prizes, the GDP was very robust, there was no crime or poverty, near zero unemployment, etc. a far-left faction assassinated me because I didn't have enough welfare programs (they were not needed due to such a strong economy and highly educated populace). Additionally, I had an 84% approval rating. Frustrating to the point of stupidity.This game is not about creating an ideal political reality/society through strategy and planning. Rather it is about appeasement which really undermines the playability and enjoyment of the game.			"

												A great idea for a game, sadly let down by a bad user interface and a one-dimensional approach to most issues. Rather than picking between truly different policies, every subject is represented by a simple slider that allows you to choose how much money you want to spend and tells you which groups that will make you more (or less) popular with.Occasionally an ""urgent issue"" pops up, and gives you only two (generally radical) options, such as ""allow GM crops"" or ""ban GM crops"". There's no complexity, no incentive for players to actually research the issues and select a realistic policy (ex., ""allow GM crops only after N years of testing and limit genetic patents to X years""). And the exact same questions pop up again and again, regardless of your previous answers. If you're presented with the option to ""lift the whaling ban"" or ""keep current law"" and pick ""lift ban"", in a couple of turns you get the same question (which assumes there's a ban in place even though you lifted it). They didn't even bother to save your choice and reword the question. It's just a button you press to make you more popular with some groups and less popular with others. Even when some issue shows various descriptions (ex., the ""abortion policy"" slider shows some text underneath it that goes from ""on demand"" to ""total ban"" with some intermediate stages like ""require the approval of two doctors"" and ""only under special circumstances""), it effectively still behaves as a basic linear slider. There's no way to select different policies based on how advanced the pregnancy is, no option to consult scientists, no option to launch a public campaign or referendum about it, etc.. It's just a cursor you drag to try to keep your approval bars green.Or rather, in a few cases, there is the option to launch public campaigns.... as long as you pay extra, for one of the ""DLC packs"", or (if you're slightly less gullible) install some free mod that duplicates those packs' functionality. Unfortunately, both the DLC packs and the mods are still limited by the shallowness of the gameplay mechanics and the bad UI design (i.e., they just add another linear slider that lets you spend some more money to reduce the negative effects of those policies on your popularity).Then there's a whole section about ""security"", which tells you which groups are likely to try to kill you, but doesn't let you take any measures to fight them; if the ""Union of Church-Going Grannies"" is mad at you for supporting the teaching of evolution, your only option to is to appease them (ex., by funding the teaching of creationism - and the game doesn't even let you pick which creationist myths to teach - or finding some other issue that will push their approval bars up). It never feels like you're managing a country or even establishing a political reputation; it's just a balancing game where you push a lot of sliders to the middle, to try to prevent invisible people from hating you too much.Also, I managed to get all the ""positive"" achievements (approval rating above 98%, technological paradise, crime-free utopia, poverty eradicated, etc.) in my first 4 hours of gameplay, so it's not even challenging.

												Charts and graphs and bubbles interface little strategy sim game about governmental work. Certainly not worth its full price. Even if you are want to challenge that game a bit, don't buy it with anything higher than 5$ (with all dlc). DLC not needed anyway, they don't do that much.Good points about that game:1) It depicts some of the governmental work. Some of us who don't get the classes about how politics work, might find ""Democracy 3"" even educational somehow. However, those of us who know already about politics, will be disappointed how many things describing political process, are not represented there at all. In defence I can say that even with that little content Democracy game can be something hard to get to, making it through all those connections between your actions and consequences.2) We have some choice of challenges in the start of the game, with different countries to choose from. For example, it is really not a problem to get Canada out of debts, but try the same trick with the US, and you'll certainly face some real problems in whole array of needs of the population. Some people just not tighten their belts... Another example: try to make a big tax on alcohol in Germany, and those tame burghers will tear you apart to get their beer back.3) More than different starting points, all this game is something like sandbox of some real world events and measures to fix them, like polluting or raise of social violence and CO2 taxes or additional funding to the police units. How does that work if we mix it? For some time you're getting the feeling of true experiment, where you can make everything like you wanted... Sadly, but that experimenting period is not long, even with all mods and additional policies from the dlcs. Soon you'll be knowing the universal formula to make everything good... but this recipe will never work in the real world. What a bummer that point is!4) While it is a bit harsh at the start, with not-so-helping tutorial, after you catch the flow of the game, you can finish it with all unlocked achievements quite fast, in less than 10 hours. So I count this as a ""pro"" point for achievement hunters.Bads:1) First, the price. For the same or less money you can get much more deeper 4X strategy games, where you will be not only applying and dismantling policies and sliding bars of funding to them. No, you will be really ruling countries, with much more tasks at hand. Well, if you're not one of those purists who are ready to pay more to recieve less complicated ""highly specialized"" type of challenge. After all, there are not many political sims on the market anyway... But even if you are that purist, you'll not be with this game for long, there are really not that much to do.2) Troubling amount of content. I know we are living in the flat world, and it's getting even more flat every day now. We have zillions of casual players who don't want to play nerd stuff, and the biggest amount of games are making for those simple and nice people. And we have this game, which is just not entertaining enough to give it to normal COD/Farmville player. And it is not thorough enough with representation of all the elements of governmental life of the democratical state. Certainly promoting ""the most sophisticated political strategy game ever created"" catch phrase is a lie.Democracy 3, simple put, is a look on the surface of the democracy building. It has little of value for casuals who don't have interests in politics and will of force to get through all statistics game throwing at player. On the other hand, for people knowing the deal with given topic, this game looks rigid and rudimental. For strategy nerds it is not challenging enough.I can't say it is a bad game (mark 6.3/10), but I don't know people to whom I could recommend it. You'll be much better with the Civilization or Crusader Kings, or whatever, in the most cases. Pass it.			"

												3/10 Maybe buy if very cheap/on sale and super interested even after this review.NegativeGameplay / In generalNear 100% electorate approval rate, having eradicated religion, poverty, positive budget, while having a space program and various other luxuries, then that as a total beginner at this game and after a 2-hour session on 100% difficulty? Tells you something about the complexity behind.It's not the least my intention to praise my capabilities, which I don't think are outstanding at all, but the game is just too simplistic at its core.The various relationships between policies and their effects are very simple, you just point and click and adjust sliders. The in-depth information provided to you (statistics, various reports) are there for the optics only, after you know what to look out for you are not really spending any time working through something really difficult.Things like banking and housing market crashes somewhat happen based on your policies, but they also do happen when everything is fine. It seems random and irrational. No poverty, full approval rate, overfinanced schools, bus systems, free meals, but you get class warfare?! ... Not that those things are of any challenge...ModsMods are available, they make it a little bit more interesting, adding various new policies and maybe some cause-and-effect relations, but they are not drastically changing anything.InterfaceThe interface looks nice, but other than showing cause and effect relations through arrows across the map, it isn't really practical. Looks > Gameplay in this case.CountriesWorthless. Picking Germany you start with a two-party system (which we don't have) and for example having to make the decision in the evolution vs intelligent design question, which depending on how you answer can♥♥♥♥♥♥religious people off. We don't have that debate in Germany. The only difference probably are some starting values (like tax rates, et cetera), but it's not really tailored in-depth towards the different countries available. Mixed It's lack of complexity make it rather fast-paced, as you can click through your terms quite in a rush if you know what you are doing. The interface though is not very fast, and all is point and click. Still: Probably the game serves well as a 2-hour enjoyment once a week or so, if you just play around trying out various things.------------ Conclusion ------------For a quick 2-hour session from time to time, it's okay, but to spent dozens of hours on this game, it's just too simplistic for that. Wanted something I could dive into, but there a more fun things than diving in shallow water. And as others have mentioned: You do get assissanted ridicolously fast (especially in the beginnig), however after grasping how it works, you can avoid it. Very unrealistic and can be frustrating though.			"

 The Good: - Playing with sliders can be fun- Game is decently difficult, but ""winnable""- Can be satisfying when you fix a country's economy The Bad: - The private sector barely exists at all, meaning the only way to get anything done is with government subsidies- A horrid assassination system results in you getting killed even when playing a moderate government- The numbers and sliders can have you scratching your head at times. At one point, I had a population that consisted of 100% ethnic minorities after less than 5 years of moderate immigration policy- The game gets stale FAST. Once you've fixed the country's economy, there is literally no point in continuing to play. The world doesn't change, and technological progress is nonexistent Summary:  If you're looking for a realistic government simulator, this probably isn't for you. The game consists of mostly fiddling with numbers and sliders with input-output mechanics, and you find yourself trying to play the numbers rather than simulate actual government policy. This game would maybe work as a five dollar title, but at this price, I would give it a pass.			"

												While this game can sometimes be fun, it doesn't really have the playtime to justify its price tag. It also fails to adequately model the politics of any nation other than the USA, but instead frustratingly attempts to pretend that gun rights and abortion is as big an issue in Europe as it is in the one country the developers understand (don't even get me started on creationism in schools and the unpopularity of taxes on the wealthy). With all that in mind, and how somehow a newly elected leader has popularity numbers in the low 20's, I cannot recommend you get this game unless it is at a steep discount. I got it at 75% off, and even then I don't think it was worth it.			"

Socialist paradise or capitalist utopia - but really?Socialist paradise or capitalist utopia. This statement used by the developers boldly claims that this game is unbiased and you can create your own ideal state as easily as a libertarian society with little to no government intervention. I was highly sceptical and I was not wrong - because this game is about government and state, it strongly favors statism. You might not be a libertarian, fair enough, but I still can't recommend this game because it fails to deliver what it promised - the ability to create a truly capitalist utopia.Statism instead of capitalismDuring my socialist gameplay it was not hard to eliminate most of the problems and forge a utopia, but during my libertarian gameplay, it turns out that the market won't eliminate problems for you - you will have to do it yourself. As an economist, I disagree with many of this game's causes and effects, and think that too many of them are not really adjusted properly to the state's size. I can understand that providing tax shelters by a small, poor European country might raise unequality significantly, but why on Earth providing high tax reliefs would ruin the USA in a matter of months, causing crime to skyrocket with armed robbers ruling the streets? I'm sorry but that's just ridiculous.  Next on the menu - private hospitals and private schools might work well, but not without your direction. Game assumes that private hospitals will not eliminate things such as obesity, you will need subsidies and quality health policies, while private schools won't really combat skills shortage, and won't advance your technology or robotics. For those you need state science funding, technology colleges and university grants. This is really biased, and I agree, some might argue that this is a government simulation and private initiative might be too easy, but this is pushing it too far. Are American private universities not advancing science? Then why are they training so many brilliant scientists among whom are many Nobel prize winners? Private space programs? Forget about it either. Free Market will not benefit environment at all either. It will not advance hybrid or electric cars, you need subsidies and grants for that or your fuel usage will never drop. Neither will trains or buses really work without the state, you will need subsidies to avoid traffic congestion. Private roads? Forget about that either. Game also ignores private initiative that introduces new, eco-friendly means of production. We're not using coal now not because of the government intervention but because of brilliant inventors and wise managers, who developed and introduced more efficient ways. While this game tries to provide free market alternatives, those won't really work well and free market will not provide most of the things necessary to really advance your country, especially connected to technology and environment. Other things that are just odd1. GDP has its limits in this game which are completely non-realistic in the long term. I can understand that this game has some limitations, but perhaps GPD growth would have been better for some of the calculations. 2. Taxes have a very low impact on the economy, compared to real life. Sales tax for example raises prices significantly which is not modelled in this game at all.3. Winning elections is pretty easy once you get to know how this game works, which takes a rather short time, especially if you're familiar with Democracy 1 & 2. 4. Rare earth shortage is unsolveable because the game assumes that none other country can supply what's demanded. Similarly food prices are not affected by foreign produce at all. 5. Changing some policies that are very hard to change in one country (such as gun ownership in the U.S.) is too easy. We all know how an attempt to confiscate guns would look like in America and it looks nothing like that in this game. 6. It is way too easy to solve problems with different policies. Want to solve crime? Spend a lot of money on police, add a couple of concerned policies and wait a year or two. It doesn't work this way. It takes a long time to train a cop, and a longer still to train a good one. Also, it's virtually impossible to eliminate crime through a large police force and a couple of policies alone. What's non-existant in this simulation1. Constitution - you can do whatever you want, only term length and term limits are binding.2. International trade - your problems and shortages are yours alone, as if trade was not a thing in Democracy 3's world. 3. Foreign relations - no interaction with other states whatsoever, despite some rudimentary interactions related to random events. 4. Banks, central banks, regulating them, privatizing, nationalizing, regulating. I expected an ubiased simulation, got one that says - it's either state or pollution, backwardness, and traffic congestions. I cannot recommend it at all.			"

												I liked Democracy on one level due to the management and such, the ability to implement policies and alter funding and check population satisfaction rates etc etc.But the reason I didn't like it, is because it's nothing like real Democracy, its like the sort of Democracy that exists in a vacuum, the kind of idealized Democracy that a Politics Scientist would talk about.  Sort of like when people talk about Communism as an idealized form of Government.The Human equation isn't present at all is what I'm trying to get at.  There are no lobby groups, there are no Corporations leaning on you for contracts, the press is completely unbiased and exists in its own bubble.  Your Cabinet members themselves consider themselves public servants serving the public, and are honest and straightforward with their policy opinions.  As if they are all robots.Thats the real problem I have, its that it's some sort of perfect utopia of what people would like the political system to be, but, due to human nature, it never even approaches what is in the game.

												At first, I was hestating to try this game due to its super simple interface. Just a few icons and text. (Unike Game Dev Tycon, which provide a basic graphics: your office and etc)After few minuts trying out, I was surprised by the content contained in this game. Various policies, different groups, natural disaster, monarchy and so on. You can do a bunch of things to build the country in your own way. And at the same time, choosing different countries will also give you various scenerio. (in which i consider USA is the easist country, since it have the economic power).After 8 hours or so, it was becoming boring to me, because there are just these policies (or maybe it's because I changed the difficulty to 40%). Then i found there are more things provided by the community. You can add more policies, countries and balance mods into this game. However, there is a limit of policies and coutries available to be selected. And the gameplay is kinda one-dimensional. Overal  i still recommand this game but in sale probably . You might be bored by these things after 20 hours, so paying too is not really worthwhile.			"

												Chose Australia as my country. Within 2 years I had cleared the deficit and turned the country into a pseudo-socialist-scientist paradise.Religion had been outlawed, with Creationism seen as an an ancient belief held by a small minority of delusional fantasists.Welfare promised to support the needy in society, but only if you worked for it.Cannabis and LSD were legalised. Dependancy on alcohol and tobacco plummeted following tax hikes. This was a country full of healthy citizens who had the safty net of a free healthcare system to fall back on.Australia became the world leader in technological advancements, boasting a fully funded particle accelerator and a space colony initiative. Every year the country was lauded with Nobel prizes.I created the perfect system, one I started to dream about living in. One I wanted to live in. But it's only a game.Then came the inevitable. My leaders term was up. He had to say goodbye.I wept over what I had created, for I knew my successor would ruin everything.---It's a fun game if you want to try and create your perfect political system, but that's all it is. A game.You emerge from your Utopia to remember that in the real world the country is governed by morans.			"

You have to make the smallest people mad while making the biggest groups/people happy.-Mod SupportMod support is always a good thing, and Democracy 3 uses the Steam Workshop.What Democracy 3 did Wrong-Everyone solves their problems by killing youMade blacks made? Feminist feel ignored? Cut a guy off on your way to work? Well, they're going to kill you. Everyone for every reason will kill you unless you have more privacy killing security laws, but guess what? Killing people's privacy makes them want to kill you! It almost feels inescapable.-Heavily biasedRacial profiling, Drones in the Sky 24/7, Capital punishment for even the smallest crimes, tank driving, machine gun wielding police officers, and nukes around every corner. These are the things that Ultra-Conservatives and Libertarians want in this game. That's wrong because the libertarian i know pretty much want anarchy.... anyways, in this game every bad  thing is wanted by the Right and everything Good  is wanted by the Left. You seeing their bias yet?Who Democracy 3 is for-People who can distance themselves from their political belief system-People who enjoy simulator games-Socialists-Democrats-ProgressivesFinal Thoughtsif you can go into this game and not get mad everytime you see your political side reacting in a way that they wouldn't, then you should be fine. As a Interracial Conservative, I was annoyed a little by the way they are shown in this game. But honestly i understand why they are like that in the game, because this is a political game and the creator is always going to put their own beliefs into this type of game, even if they don't mean too. Gameplay wise D3 is a tough strategy game and a fun one too.			"

												TL;DR 10/10, I was able to be Hitler and was assassinated by communists for being a good leader.My party, The National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) came to power when Germany needed her the most. Mass unemployment, degeneracy, lack of national unity, rampant violence, corporate corruption, and inequality threatened the fatherland more than ever before, and to make matters worse, the opposing parties (The Undergound movement of Judeo-Bolsheviks) promoted these plagues upon my nation and were bound to get worse as time progressed.Something had to be done, for the sake for the German people and the German fatherland, a young, noble drifter stepped into the spotlight. An Austria-born WWI veteran, decorated with numerous medals for valor and bravery, animal lover, vegetarian, and artist, knew what he had to do, and led the NSDAP to glory.With slow, firm steps, things finally started to look for the better for the German people. Prostitution was outlawed,  ethnic and cultural protection was ensured through anti-immigrant laws, the unjust capitalist economic system was replaced with a nationalist restricted-market system, and eventually, the newfound leader established a dictatorship and removed of the barely functional, if functional at all, Democratic system.Eventually, national values werre finally instilled; anything the people did, they did it has one for the betterment of the state, and thus the betterment of themselves. Man cared for man, brother for brother, and the most beautiful display of comradery to date was born.However, the leader was eventually assassinated by Communists, and all that he had done was shrouded in a thick mist of lies and propoganda. The chance of Germany every recovering to what she had accomplished is slim, but those of us that remember, that know what really happened, will never forget.(~Disclaimer: Don't be an edgy Marxist and call me a Neo-Nazi, this is a joke, treat it as such.)

												Democracy 3 is good and gives you the general idea what it is like to be President or Prime Minister of your country, and keeping the country's policies regulated from being blown out of proportion.The only problem, however is those Workshop Free DLC Mods that can corrupt your campaign and can crash your game.  Positech Games may need to work on the policies and Mods to make it a bit more intense, but this game will do well without those 3rd Party mods. And the Capital Power Points appear limited to control the policy like taxes and benefits, so those options can be tricky.			"

												The series of games build on a great idea, for anyone interested in the idea of political simulators. However, while Democracy 3 is clearly a polished game the central premise is executed poorly. Essentially, your sum level of interaction with your populace is clicking on a screen full of buttons and adjusting some sliders. There are some fairly basic rules and the game throws the odd curve ball but I'm afraid it all became a bit stale and predictable after playing for an hour. Credit to the creators, I didn't hit any obvious bugs, it never crashes, it's reliable... but it just lacks any real depth. It's uninstalled now and to be frank I can't see that I'm likely to sum up the enthusiasm to put it back on again. Largley disappointing.			"

												This game is, contary to what the store tells you, a horrible political simulator. The premise of this game is that you run a country and you have to get to know it and play it within the bounds of the political system. Sounds fun, right? Wrong. There is absolutely no variation from system to system, save for term limits in some of the democracies. The Republican proccess and Parliamentary proccess are nonexistant; you're basically an elected dictator in each government. Plus, diplomacy is nonexistant and so none of the diplomacy-related political issues matter in the slightest and are completely arbitrary. Not to mention how some of the choices that can be considered ""non-arbitrary"" are there purely to let you continue with your term and thus also have no real meaning. Political capital is generated at whim, rather than hard-fought and hard-earned in a real democracy, and the decisions, oh boy, the decisions.According to this game: A monorail system increases unemployment The economy can crash literally whenever it feels like it Police drones decrease crime incredibly In a democracy, you can completely go against the wishes of your own people and remain in power Political advisors serve no purpose whatsoever Democracy is just people electing a dictatorAll that being said, the game does have quite the replayability value for those who like going back and tinkering with each country, fixing it for the better or making yourself literally Hitler. RATING: 4/10 This game sucks at what it's trying to teach and the way it presents it, but it's fun to screw around with!			"

												Such a great idea, but such a bad game.  I like the idea that this is a game based only on policies and it tries to divorce itself from political groups and instead focuses on the idea of democracy. The downside is, I don't know if I got unlucky or the game is just broken.  On normal difficulty, I was assassinated in a couple months.  Nothing I could do in the first few turns kept me alive, except completely capitulating to the black voters (yes it's black voters).  The thing is the game moves too fast for the idea of unrest presented, so if black voters are angry at you, they'll say they're mad (without giving clear action items) and all the action items I could see take too long to execute.  I still try to appease them, and then suddenly I'm killed. If you lower the difficulty, this game becomes easy, but the fact is the out of the box experience on normal seems to rush at full speed towards violence before the player can do anything about it.   You're going to get assassinated, and if the black voters don't kill you, I'm sure someone else will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and try to kill you as well.   It's a shame, because theoretically this game could have been fun.  On paper it sounds really good, but when put in practice.  It just isn't enjoyable at all unless you scale down the difficulty, but the thing is, on normal, when things are going wrong you don't get any advice on how to fix it (other than vague hand waving).  On easier difficulties the game is the same way, people just don't get as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.			"

This is politics?I had a great time playing the game and had a hard time choosing most of the ""random event"" questions which required my attention. Adopting and altering policies was strategy which I like. Some of the policies you could add or alter is controversial and I like that they are in the game!I'm sure the developers have thought of several policies to adopt, but they aren't enough to stifle some of the events happening. The game did come to a ""click next turn"" very fast as there was nothing else left to do and after five or so hours it came to an end. You get shot! and you can't do ANYTHING about it! Adopting every single security measurement doesn't mean a thing! The tutorial wasn't close to be comprehensive enough so this game is really hard to get in to. If it wasn't for me having absolutely nothing to do and me being stubborn I wouldn't have played this game for more than an hour. I think I'm going to have a hard time playing it again, due to the reason mentioned above and that the UI was hard to manoeuvre in. The information was presented well enough, as example if you wanted to see what caused the unemployment in your nation, but when trying to see what policies you could add or alter you had to access them by drilling down and there were no ""back"" option one had to start all over. Very frustrating and confusing! Also it would be nice to have the policies you couldn't change due to low ""power"" was presented the same way as they were when trying to adopt policies, also if the preview of the new policy added the effects as well as potential cost or income. Seeing that I'm interested in politics I'll keep an eye out for the fourth instalment, but this one I'm going to give a ""no"" because of this game represents politics being a prime minister would be suicide.

												Democracy 3 is a good, addicting game.. for the first two hours.You will get assassinated. A lot. It's ridiculous in its implementation that upping stem cell research and reducing creationism (while having an EXTREMELY low crime rate) somehow translates to a religious extremist using a high-caliber sniper rifle to assassinate the head of state? Thank god you can turn assassinations off!But the main problem with Democracy 3 is one of irony, because nothing that happens in the game feels particualrly democratic aside from the end of term voting.Let me explain.For most of the game you're issuing and adjustiing policies to appease your voter base and grow your nation. At no single point in this process are you taking these issues through actual party politics. There's no system of a house of commons or a senate, there's literally nothing here that actually models the internal workings of actual government, which I think is really unfortunate because the developers are definitely on to something here.Overall Democracy 3 is a fun game, but I think Democracy 4 if done right would look nothing like it.

And two yeah, you kinda can, but it's incredibly easy to just pick the more liberal side of things and the game becomes a breeze. For example I wanted to turn France into a religious, conservative playground but I'm finding it a bit hard considering there isn't too many religious policies, and some of the religious policies, like banning divorce seem to even *reduce* the amount of religious people there are, while also making them happier. And like, having too many patriots, for example, will cause a nasty thing to pop up. Oh and also weirdly you can't get population, people only redistribute themselves. You can fully conscript the population instead of military spending, but this doesn't count towards military spending and apparently does nothing. Oh and some things I've.. never seen. Like oil is a thing in game and it has supply and stuff but I've never ran into a situation where it became a problem I have to deal with. And focus groups exist and are cool but I've never had to use them or go that deep into the group section. All in all I'd say you should get it on a sale if you could, but it's still okay at full price.			"

												This game is on a ""screw you, buy me"" discount for the entire holiday sale, and it got me addicted enough in a very specific way to make me do an LP for it, so I feel like I can't -not- hold up a  ""consider buying"" sign.Have you ever ""played"" the NationStates web/browser game? If you haven't, go try it out for a bit, right now. I'll wait.Did you like it? If after playing NationStates, you thought to yourself something like, ""I would pay money for a fleshed out version of this that's an actual turn-based strategy game, with scenarios and fail states and workshop support and stuff,"" Democracy 3 is the game of your very specific desires. It has similar limitations (your GDP and Health and Education and Technology levels can only get ""so high,"" and then once you've made a society as close to your vision of perfect as you'd like there's not much left to do but fiddle and/or come up with your own goals, so I doubt everybody will find as much replay value in the base game as I have), but, again. Made me make my first LP, so there's probably somebody else out there who'll get hooked if they try it.A final warning: your mileage may indeed vary massively with regards to how realistic the game's treatments of what outcomes all sorts of governmental policies have is. I would add a caveat, though, that I've seen people of all (as in, opposing) kinds of political bents criticize the game, so. While ""ending up making potentially *everybody* mad somehow"" may not actually be the optimal kind of compromise, it both feels like a bit of an inevitability to me given the subject matter and like a probable sign that the developer's at least trying really hard.Also, a plus side to the issue is that you wouldn't believe how many mods people will make for this kind of game when they have Workshop support and their vision of a ""realistic governance simulation"" is challenged. [strikethrough]Suckers[/strikethrough] VALUED CONTENT CREATORS. (seriously, the mods add quite some replay value)			"

												Awesome concept that lacks depth, but provides solid execution (and the guy, yes this game was basically created by a single guy, is a genius when it comes to presenting information, bubbles, bars, sliders, tables, charts all done in awesome and clear way)I wanted to play this ever since I seen 'WTF is Democracy 3', but felt 20 pound pricetag is excessive so grabbed it on sale yesterday. I played about 6 hours and feel that would be about it.Do not get me wrong it was real fun the first 5 hours (and 5 hours of fun for 9 pounds not too shabby, although other video games offer better), only after that did I realise that the games lacks in many aspects:* Only the first few turns are interesting in every game (and that is true on all difficulties 0-150% - have not tried harder), after that you either screwed up and are out of the office or have balanced most things and are bulletproof* You are an omnipotent democratically elected dictator. You will surprised (and disappointed) how easy it is to turn UK (or any country for that matter) into Orwellian police state and still be loved (point 1 applies, you need to balance things at the start first). You will also not have any trouble eradicating religion or car usage.* Economy doesnt feel right. Too simplified (although I guess if the author was able to model economy properly he would be an banker not a game dev ;) I hate to not recommend games that I wanted to be awesome so much, but I just do not feel that I can recomend a game that lost its charm after a few hours (if you see my played time go to double digits then perhaps I was wrong and there is more to it)			"

												Stay away from this failure of a game.Democracy 3 makes you the leader of a country, and lets you enact policies to interacts with lots of variables (racial tension, GDP, unemployement, technology, etc...). And you'll have to compose with the fact that each political tendance of your citizens have an agenda (capitalists, socialists, environementalists, middle clas, etc...), so you'll have to keep them happy if you want to be elected, or simply not assasinated.This game have quite a few good ideas, i'll give you that. And the choice of policies is relatively vast, if a bit repetitive. Countries aren't exactly realistic on some levels (no nuclear power in France? what?), but well, it's not exactly all wrong either.The main issue with Democracy 3 is that it's fundamentally incoherent. You get assasinated for more or less every choice you make ; you can have strike/GDP collpse/end of strike/GDP up/strike... cycles for very long ; economics factors are more or less impossible to predict. But the worst is, you can't tell if it's difficult on purpose, badly designed, or bugged as hell. Even if I would go with option 3.Let me tell you a story. I was playing France, assasinations deactivated (good way to test some possibilities), and managed to bring it to new heights through SCIENCE (space station, tech grants, all that stuff). Everything was fine, nearly no crime, best productivity on the planet, educations levels through the roof, until the next turn, where the nice music changed to a gloomy tone. My popularity dropped from 80% to 25%. No policy could explain that, so i looked at my electorate, and saw that lot of people became ""fanatically opposed"" to my governement. I tried to look at the ""why"", when I saw that lots of them did NOT have any discontentement but were opposed anyway. And that changed for no reason.And the thing is, it's like that everywhere : variables that weren't announced anywhere and crash you plans to the ground ; crisis spreading like wildfire ; assasinations attempts if you don't do everything NOW, even if it makes you country unsustainable...If you enjoy the kind of ""barely in control"" game like Dwarf fortress, you can probably try it. Otherwise, the only thing this game will do is making you join the ranks of people who wants to murder the guys who designed this.			"

												This is a fun game for causal play, though severe balancing issues make it incredibly frustrating to play at any higher level than that, at least as far as difficulty is concerned. Also the developers very clearly don't understand the diffrence between American politics and European politics, and if you don't understand the diffrence and you're American you're going to have a frustrating time playing your home country. The credit rating adjustments are increadibly unrealistic and disproportionatley effect the economy.That's just one of the more obvious things, there are tons of little quirks and inconsistineces in the game's balancing that sometimes are inconcequential and just serve to pull you out of the expereince and other times they activley make the game a chore to play. I won't go into them because I would have to type several pages out, I will say however that the DLC packs and certian mods will help, but they won't correct the issues entirely. Hell, sometimes they just make them even worse if you're not careful.The real problem is assassinations and re-election. If you're playing on the base difficulty setting, fine, you should not have a problem getting re-elected whatsoever if you're paying attention. You probably have a 30% chance of getting shot down, but as bad as that sounds even that's managable. Turn up the difficulty slider and you're going to have a bad time unless you turn them off entirley. The concept makes sense, but it's the execution is increadibly poor.Except for your own, of course, if you try to play on a higher difficulty you will die repeatedly to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.If you want to just mess around to make policy changes, this game is fine. Just turn on monarchy and turn off assassinations and have fun. If you want a serious and well balanced political simulator then make your own, you won't find it here. I personally wouldn't recomend buying this game unless you see it on sale with the DLC's included.Also, if you do get the game and decide to play America, have a tip. The thing you absoultley must do on the first turn is institue the anti-descrimination policy, because apparently the developers think we're all racist ♥♥♥♥♥ and don't seem to realize we have dozens of laws and several amendments that do just that. Otherwise you're going to be shot by minorities who did absoutley nothing wrong.tl;dr Get it if you want a casual game, turn off assassination if you want to actually play the game, buy it on sale if you must.

												In three years of a Democracy 3 playthrough, I expanded the welfare state, gave all children free lunches, turned the education system around, made cannabis legal, made healthcare available to more people, cut military spending (while still having the best in the world!), enacted stronger labor laws to protect workers, massively reduced homelessness, and eradicated poverty. And then a conservative extremist group assassinated me.			"

												Hard pass because I have enjoyed the game, but I maybe got $10 or at most $15 worth of entertainment out of it. It's a decent game if you don't mind the typos, grammar, unrealistically high chance of assassination and you're playing the only country the developers think exists, America, but otherwise it's just confusing. I understand that the developers are likely American so it's the only political system they're knowledgable enough with to represent in a semi-realistic* way, but even given that, why even have England as a playable country if you're so ignorant of their political system you think they have a president? Especially since you've made it so easy to develop mods for this game? I'm sure that eventually someone who knew the political structure of England would make a mod for the game.Finally, there's just no excuse for this high a price tag. Plague Inc was an independently developed plague simulation game that was able to simulate 14 types of real world pathogens and how they'd spread in different environments so well that the CDC commended the game. Not only that, but they also have 20 scenarios that pose extra challenge by changing the world in some way, they have a soundtrack and they aren't afraid to admit when they got something wrong; when someone points out a flaw in the simulation, they adjusted it to make it more realistic. You can buy that game for $15. That in itself is enough reason for me to tell anyone not to buy this game until they lower the price. Unless, of course, Steam has a sale. If it's ever under $15 I'd recommend it.*I'm not asking for this game to be completely realistic though, don't get me wrong. A checks and balances system for this game creating the option for Congress and the House to block you at every turn would obviously make this a prett boring game and would be way harder to program.

												Democracy 3 involes managing your money and ""political capital"" (i.e. action points) in an abstract, turn-based strategy game. You make policy decisions that influence your country in a complex network of interdependent ways. Democracy 3 is an interesting idea and might appeal to some people, but I just didn't get enough out of it to recommend it.Pros:+ The game gives you a sense of pulling on one thread and having it reverberate through a whole ""ecosystem"" of your country's economy and your popularity. It's pretty interesting to try different moves and see how your country develops. Can you work out enough of the network of causes and effects to fix your country's problems?Cons:- The game is pretty boring after the initial learning curve wears off. There's no graphics, dialog, story, or human element in the game, let alone action or drama, so the whole thing feels a bit like managing a huge spreadsheet.- I found the difficulty far too easy. I inherited a (ranomly generated) country that was in bad shape, and within a couple of years I had stabilized all of the issues and my popularity shot through the roof. By the time my first election rolled around, I pretty much had a one-party utopia. At that point I could just tread water and do virtually nothing, contributing even more to the boring factor.			"

You can't have a balanced budget giving everyone in the nation free stuff and not having taxes to make people like you. No sense of wars or sanctions which is a big factor in the real world.

												Probably the best simulator of the frustrations of public office ever designed, perhaps a little too well designed. The execution of the concept, with the possible exception of the sliders for difficulty before the game starts, is absolutely spot on. it really feels like running the country, normally directly into the ground. Idealists will have their hopes and dreams crushed as they discover that even after eliminating all national debt and achieving 99% approval rating the remaining 1% of poor untraied farmers will somehow find a way to seccessfully exicute you because somebody had to be made unhappy and apparently ther is no such thing as secret service in this in game world. There is immense ammout of customisability in how you implement and change policy, but you will still be assassinated. That is unless you fiddle with the difficulty sliders in which you can legalize slavery of all but yourself and ban fun and still have most of the country voting for you. As a completely free to choose experience there is potentially a way to play the game for everyone, sadly figuring that way out, unless the defult or baby's frst sim experience are whats right for you, is an exercise of trial and error frustration that only comes into play some time after you have gotten into it and is notified to you with a bullet to the head and a forced restart. Iteration time is annoyingly long and the actual paths that work in any degree of difficulty seem arbitrary and in times counter intuitive. In conclusion the game is well made  ut lacks focus for any player wanting something more than directionless ♥♥♥♥ing about.  4/10 can't really reccomend.			"

												The first 5 hours of this game are probably some of the most fun I've had with a political sim ever. After the first 5 hours, you're sat there wondering ""well what the hell do I do now?"" Sure, you can have fun trying to simulate different political parties, but that gets stale fast. I spent an hour learning the game. I spent the next two and a half fixing every problem that the British government had. In 2 hours, poverty was 0%, unemployment was 0%, health was 100%, there were no drasitc issues, and I was winning elections with 100% of the vote. Once you've made it that far, the game has no more depth to offer. Buy on sale. Do not pay full price.			"

Or a Libertarian police state where the military draft is the law of the land? A conservative socialist state where border guards scan eye retinas and food, housing, education and healthcare is provided by the state? or you can just could play the anarchist and remove all of the states influances and watch as society riots, loots and steals their way from the chains of government.The choice is yours, what kind of statesman will you be?

												Extremely basic.Populations don't increase over time so there is no real test of managing an economy or a changing landscape.All you really have to do is increase your tax income and then you can pretty much do what you want. Increase tax too much and the capitalists will try and kill you, so you either increase spending on police drones etc or indrudce some business friendly tax breaks.The only real way to make the game a challenge is to set the inate sliders to the complete opposite of what you want the 'end game' to be. If you're looking for something that has depth and is captivating for longer than the initial learning period, then this game isn't for you.

												An enjoyable but fairly lackluster game, it is a very engaging game, allowing the player to drive a variety of countries down many different paths, however the gameplay is fairly shallow after a while as the game merely uses policy to modify basic factors, and is not a perfect nor even particularly deep simulator.However for the price it is a nice game - (i would recommend to try out the mobile version also, it is a much better fit)			"

												Strategy at its finest. I imagine this game is really subjective to what an individual enjoys. I like micro management games and tuning things into finely thought out points in order to make them work together like a well-oiled machine. This game is exactly that, with politics involved. I enjoyed it a lot, perhaps you will too.			"

												Finding out what the effects of policies will be on a country and trying to make sure you remain in power and the country doesn't fall apart while you're doing so is a lot of fun. Sadly after only a few hours the whole finding out part is pretty much done and the game doesn't throw a lot of interesting things your way to keep things fresh. As a result I do not feel that I can recommend buying this game at the current price (€15,40, due to sale, €22,99 otherwise).Of course if you feel that a few hours of entertainment is worth said amount. By all means buy it.			"

												It's a nice idea but rather simple and too static for my own taste. It can be rewarding the first two times you manage to build up a nice country and fix it's original problems, but after 2-3 hours of gameplay you already know what to do by hearth. The only reason I played this game for so long (almost 12 hours) was because I like simulators and dind't feel like doing something else and wanted to get the archievements c(:Not recommended for the full price.

												This game makes it impossible to govern as a libertarian.  If you don't enact policies to appease the masses at every turn, you will be assassinated within your first 6 quarters as President.  The effects and consequences of any policy decision, whether it be enacting or canceling policy, is biased toward big government socialism.

												While the game is a nice tech-demo of how to make a political simulation and has a lot of potential, it simply feels very much unfinished and as if it's an early development stage. It fails to do anything in a way that is at all realistic. It displays a grotesque and rather primitive (even ignorant in some places) look at how a society works. While it may be somewhat realistic for how the USA works (only country I couldn't be bothered playing), the game just becomes a farce when playing any other country. The game is just so simplified that it takes away from the enjoyment and gives you no chance to experiment.It focuses so heavily on a two-party system (it's always you against ""that other party"") that everything becomes black and white and all the grey areas of politics are completely ignored. There's no gaining favours with some parties and losing it with others. The developers have completely failed to understand that in most countries you have a multiple of parties, favouring all kinds of different policies, and it is completely possible for a minor party to remain in power by allying with other parties. But in this case there simply are no other parties in the game. Your opposition party don't seem to ever have an opinion on anything, but if you lose voters they just go vote for that other party, rather than any of the many other parties that the game is missing.Many of the overly simplified policies result in extreme and absurd situations - such as high taxes causing the unemployed to have excessive alcohol and drug abuse and resorting to violent crimes, despite having a social system in place to more than take care of them. It makes it impossible to really deal with any situation without losing the majority of your voters, or even get assasinated when your 3 year plan don't take effect immediately.The fincancial side of the game is severely lacking as well and missing a massive amount of policies. The tax system is super primitive far beyond realism, applying only 6th grade math to most policies (even 10 year old SimCity 4 has a more advanced tax system...). Things like rent control don't affect homelessness like it should, and several other policies don't have the direct effect they ought to have << this may be bugs, but from glancing at the CSV file it looks to be by design.Overall the game is excessively simplified and you only stand a chance for sitting more than 1 term if you pander to your voters without following any sort of direction, and if you have no interest in creating anything but the most traditional societies in an extreme form (ultra socialist, religious fanaticism, or conservative suppresion) - anything else and you're almost guaranteed to lose the game at the first election.

												It's a pretty good game which genre is basically Round-Based-Strategy. You come into position to lead a whole country, with all its interest groups, problems and virtues. With policy- and budget-changes that take effect on already existent problems (and maybe create new ones) or situations you keep your country running.There is much Workshop-Content out there that makes the game more diverse and significantly harder (and sometimes better). I always try to minimize my debts and to make the people happy but you can  do otherwise if you decide to. All in all the game offers many possibilities which all want to be found and tried out and due to its easy to mod interface you are even able to make the game better for yourself and the others. :) I like it!If you buy it you HAVE TO check out the Workshop-Content on Steam, trust me some people invest much time in improving the game experience :) Special thanks to them too.

												This game is far more fun than it really should be.  I mean, the actual mechanics are pretty simple, you get some action point type things every turn and you can use them to adjust sliders for existing polices, scrap existing policies or pick nerw policies from a list.But then there are all the different interest groups to consider - going all socialist?  Then the capitalists will try to assassinate you, or at least, a cabinet minister might resignLose an election and it's game over, you only need more votes than the other party to win rather than over 50%, so you can make voter apathy and low turnout work in your favour.  It's a two party winner takes all system, no coalitions or minor parties and that is my only criticism of this game - it works well as a USA simulator but less so as a UK or Germany simulator.It's a simple concept, but the UI is well done and the whole cause and effect system is pretty easy to figure out - invest in science and your GDP will go up, but there will be a rise in pollution and angry environmentalists may start plotting/voting against you.It has workshop support and there are some awesome creations available.You don't have to commit to a long session, one turn takes a few minutes, perhaps less if you're following a long turn plan and you can save and quit the game at any point.Basically, it's really well thought out and a good way to spend a few hours of your life, plus there are difficulty sliders for different levels of player experience and/or drunkenness.

A fun political game for politic-nerds?Rock solid game144hz support and nice looking charts, layout, good design, etcFun variety of different political philosophies and policiesThis game kept me playing for hoursWorkshop has some cool add-onsMy chrome browser auto-loads realclearpolitics.com everytime its launched.  If you don’t follow politics I don’t know that this game will be enjoyable for you.  The fact is, the game is easier if you intuitively know what “biofuel subsidy” or “private school vouchers” are.  I would also say that the game is difficult.  However, before starting a game you may reduce the difficulty.  If you turn off assassinations the game becomes much easier and allows you to focus in on the policy.At first I felt like the game forced me to play left, socialist.  That’s not accurate, as a libertarian-leaning-conservative (right party for non-usa readers), I found my games always playing on the right side of the spectrum.  Sure, I might subsidize the **** out of mass-transit to try to fix one of the “problems”, but overall I can’t help but gravitate towards my own belief of what government should do.As a sim, the game puts you in charge of running the country like a business.  This will cause you, or at least it did me, to abandon your precepts.  I don’t believe government ought to tax behaviors like smoking; yet in the game they present a big red colored problem of asthma affected heavily by smoking.  So to “beat” the game or solve this issue I tax the crap out of smoking.  I don’t care if people want to get sick from smoking, and i certainly don’t think the government should be meddling in it.  The biggest reality problem is that you run the country as a limited-power dictator.  There is no legislature or high-court to deal with.  I think that for the scope of the game, this is a reasonable concession  After all, who criticized Simcity because the mayor built a giant eco-friendly tower or a huge amusement park?  I would suggest that we have a way to end game or retire out of governments like that of the UKs where you won’t term out.  I would like to just “end” my carreer like when the US president terms out.  I would also like to see a history of all my games and how they ended.  I would also like a one-page summary that I can screenshot and post to steam (the current system doesn’t fit on the screen all at once).  The technical aspects of the game are good - given that the game is just texts and simple charts.  At Least it runs at 144hz.  I found the music obnoxious and play in silence. No crashes or other problems.  Save system is fine.   "

												This game is very unique, and rather interesting, at least at first. Despite the overwhelming amount of data in the form of graphs and charts, it's still not always easy to tell what effect different policies are going to have on various groups. To top it off, there seems to be an issue with out of control immigration, and no matter what you do it keeps going. What happens then is you have a cascading effect of other nasty stuff due to runaway immigration and it's just frustrating.Eventually I realized I just wasn't having fun with this game. It's interesting, but not very fun. A much better political simulator is the Tropico series. At least with that you're not just staring at graphs and flowcharts for hours on end. I think I'd rather just be at work.			"

												It's really hard to please everyone.If you dream to be in politics and be president, like simulation and strategy games, and currently dislikes how your leaders handle problems of your country. Then this is the game for you. :)Pro:+Complex and exemplifies real life problems.+Design is minimalistic and is soothing to the eyes.+Good trailer. I like it that's why I bought it.+You can modify/add mods with regards to what happens on your own country with just simply tweaks with a .csv file. You can see the tutorial in game for more information. :)Cons:+Lacks Replayability. After you mastered the game for about 2 games or maybe 3 hours you would be bored. This is essentially the deal breaker for this game.+Tutorial didn't really help. Maybe because I just didn't read it.+After 5-10 years of your game you end up doing nothing but making all of your citizens happy.Knowing the right moves at the start will make the game easier. :D Despite all the cons, I still would like to recommend this game for brilliance.

												Democracy 3 is a decent political simulator, that makes you feel like the leader of a real democracy for a few hours. But not much longer.Basically, after you have spent a few hours building your (more or less) perfect society, you'll have to start a new game and make different decisions to experience anything new. This would be fine if the game would have enough content to explore in multiple playthoughs, but even in just my second playthough, it felt like i had seen almost everything.I really like the concept and overall gameplay of Democracy 3, and for what i have seen, it seemed fairly well balanced.Turning germany into a socialist one-party state was a lot of fun at first, but the game just does not provide enough content for me to recommend it.

												Totally Awesome!  I highly recomend if you think you'd be interested in this type of game.Pros:Great interface that makes handling and understanding the complexity easy, in 5 minutes you'll have a good understanding of it.In general I think it does a really good job of balancing the details and complexity with accessablity and giving you enough of all the details that it feels like a proper sim while not complicating things to the point of frustration.No other game like it, at leas that I have seen.  It fills this niche quite well and while it feels a little lacking in the details overall it really satifies my itch for this niche.Looks very easy to mod, and lots of mods on Steam workshop!Cons:No Undo - this feels like something that should really be in there since it's turned based I feel like I should be able to undo and action before I end the turn.  It's the only thing that makes the interface feel annoying or clunky.Can't really tell what a policy will do until you impliment it - combined with not being able to undo this makes picking new policies to impliment feel much more random than they should since you won't be able to see the policy effects until you've already spent political capital implimenting them.

												Disclosure: I have primarily played the game offline, which I guess completly prevents it from trakcing hours played? I'd say I have about 3-5 hours logged. Check my achievements on the game, which proves my claim.I like the concept of the game, and love Democracy 2, even though one could consider it limited in comparison. What made me dislike this game is somewhere around my fifth term in Austrailia, I quit because there was constant economic shenanigans that would force me to change my policies, I am guessing because I was doing too well. During my entire fourth term, the global economy was in deep recession and that did not change until I finally started reducing the ""benefits"" that I was providing everyone. Once I finally changed them during the start of my fifth term, my country began to have economic problems with market meltdowns, strikes, and cyber warfare. Once I remedied this and worked on paying off the debt, guess what happened again - that's right, another deep global recession! One of the worst things was when I had a credit upgrade followed by a credit downgrade two quarters later, but I still had a small surplus.I love the concept of the game, and will continue to play Democracy 2, but I don't find this game fun with the random disasters that occur regardless of what is done.

												Democracy 3 is a good game for just chilling out, sitting back, putting on some music and ruling a country. Sure some of the mechanic are a little bit unrealistic, but would be rather difficult to put every single possible scenario and outcome into a game. One thing I did notice about this game is the eventual love I felt my people had for me. I mean, after the first assassination attempt they were basically begging me to input a 8pm-9am curfew, and have armed police on every street corner, so I adhered to them, and they came to love me in a way I never thought was possible. Some would call my country a authoritarian one party police state, but I call us a utopia, striving ever for the peace and prosperity that all my countrymen deserve.			"

												Despite a rather complex and intimidating UI, don't be put off by this game, especially if you enjoy political strategy games. With extremely detailed and complex mechanics, Democracy 3 is undoubtably one of the greatest political simulators available on steam.The vast array of countries, polcies, and situations in this game allow the player to live out all of their political fantasies, whether that be being the conservative socialist leader of Canada or the capitalist liberal oligarch of Australia. Furthermore the vast library of mods available through the steam workshop add tens of hours of replayability to the game, which, especially when coupled with DLC, vastly improve the game quality, with hundreds of new situations, policies, and mechanics.

												Decided to try this out in my homeland: Canada. - Thought to myself: ""Haha, I'm going to become a dictator and run my nation into the ground!""- Against my better judgement, ended up creating an incredibly socialist society.- Destroyed my economy but everyone loved me. Canadians were too polite to acknowledge the depression I had just created for them.Restart as Germany. Will bring back Deutschland to former glory.- Decide to try my best to go full dictator.- Tax the big corporations and eliminate foreign investments. Keep Germany for Germans.- Abolish anti-racism laws and invoke racial profiling. Keep Germany for Germans.- Arm my police force to the teeth, set up cameras, drones, ID Cards, gated communities.

												I love politics and would recommend this game but there are some issues like you can get 100% the popular vote, there aren't enough policies (mods correct this) and some policies are biased towards the game developer's own political views (like banning guns reducing crime, in real life the states with the most gun regulations have the most violent crime incidents per capita; affirmative action reducing racial tension, it can be argued that it does the opposite).Hopefully Democracy 4 fixes these issues.

												The game is just too expensive for what it offers. Even though you can play with different nations, they all kind of look the same with different initial stats. And even though it looks complex, it is in fact very easy. It is all about maintaining a positive budget, then everything else will work eventually. The idea is great, but not well executed.			"

												Although this game has huge potential, Positech Games inc. has made a more beautiful advertsing campaign than a beautiful game. The first you notice when you start a game is various text/buttons and simple items. Although those are pretty simple to make look nice, Democracy 3 somehow manages to make them look bad and aliased, even on maximum graphics settings.I let that pass.Alt+Tab then go back to the game makes the screen blank, making the game effectively unplayable.I let that pass.In game it sometimes has unmovable windows overlapping over other unfocusable, unmovable windows. I let that pass.The general ergonomics of the game is bad, with some buttons performing actions that you did not demand without warning.I let that pass.The game is very complex and hard to understand. Wich such bad ergonomics, one would expect some on-point tutorials. Are the tutorials any good? No, they are virtually useless: they are in the of hover over a tab and te text showing is ""This is a tab"".I let that pass.What I cannot let pass however are the abundant game-braking of bugs in the game. I will not give any spoilers; there willbe only one example. In-game, you can have a look at the predicted outcomes of any changes you may make to a policy. You have to save your changes before they are applied. Democracy 3 sometimes saves your changes without you aplying them. What is worse, those changes cannot be undone, even though the game engine is turn-based, and modifying actions of the present turn wouldn't change aything to the gameplay.In conclusion, does this game has potential? Yes, it has. Has there been effort put into this game. Undoubtedly, yes, the potential is there. Has this game been properly tested and reviewed? No, probably not, and this is why I can't recommend this game. I spent mamy of my precious lifetime on frustrations with this game and regret it wasn't better. I was disappointed. It could have been the game I always wanted. It wasn't.			"

												The gameplay of Democracy 3 is quite easy. Simply choose a policy and raise or lower it's budget. It's the consequences for those actions that make this game both very difficult and very fun. Will you attempt to win the vote on a conservative or liberal ticket? Capitalist or socialist? Patriotic or ethnic minority based? It's all up to you, and you'd better play smart or you'll end up in a body bag. It may seem a little too hard or confusing during the first hour or so, but keep playing and you won't regret it (unless you're one of those people who need to be commiting mass genicide in order to be happy).This game may be a glorified spreadsheet, but it's pretty in-depth and as loaded with replay value as any you'll find. If you're not comfortable with investing $25 in it (which I relate to in full) wait for it to go on sale. It's definitely worth the $15.			"

												Played it for a while, thought it was decent. Then I came back to it after having broadened my political knowledge. I attempted to establish a Libertarian country. Legalization of guns=Crime and your ultimate demise (I was killed by socialists). Its like this game is trying to just scratch the suface, but instead, the surface explodes and sends this game as far away from being accurate as possible. If you are casually political, this game may be of interest to you, but do not base what is Liberal or Conservative off of this game. If you are very politcal, like myself, I would highly recommend you avoid this game. It will save you the frustration of the innaccuracies that are found constantly throughout the game.PROS: Fun for people with average political knowledge.Pretty cheap (although the game isn't much in itself).CONS:Very, very innacurate. Ex: Being killed by socialists for having less taxes+Less gun restrictions.I wanted to blow my brains out after playing this game again, that's how frustrating.The actual game isn't much, other than a main menu and a basic web design to manage policies.♥♥♥♥ the Revolutionary Army, those ♥♥♥♥ers killed me for no reason.

												Interesting concept, but too much spreadsheet work, uncooperative UI (trying different policies requires save-scumming just to see effects), and repetitive.The worst issue is that in the end, it doesn't really matter what you do, because remember that the wealthy only make up a small percentage of the vote, and they won't rally and sabotage your term, and it's easy to just replace your entire cabinet to loyal, effective people. You can just enact a ton of socalist and big-government policies, and easily pick up a ton of votes.You can also skew the population majorly in certain ways, like creating a ton of high-wealth and car/gas taxes. Combined with a ton of commuter, small business policies, public health policies, youth, and parenting incentives, 4 years later most people will be one of the following groups: commuters, self-employed, middle weath, parents or youth, and you can safely ignore the other 15% of the population and that doctor strike. (Though I went too far in one game and ended up with ZERO motorists, totally wiping out the hundreds of political leverage points I sank into car taxes. Still got positive environmental effects from eco-friendly cars despite having no motorists.)In fact, there is more incentive to do this than not, since changing ANY policies requires your hard-earned political leverage points, so you'll probably always go extreme on any policies you do want, and not change them later because it's too expensive to, leverage-wise.

												Very fun, if somewhat complex and confusing initally, during your first few hours. Ever wanted to create a communist safe-haven free from the oppressive upper-class? How about a capitalist paradise where everything is rightfully earned? What about a liberal state full of equality and compassion? Or a conservative utopia where tradition and piety are placed above ""progress""? Well, regardless of your political views, you can basically pass or outlaw all but the most specific of political viewpoints. Gay marriage? They got that. Race relations? Decide on that too. Socialism vs. capitalism? You bet. Abortion? Yep. The environment? Duh. All this and more are yours to decide upon, although it does cost you (in-game) money and you risk increasing relations with some voters and decreasing them with others, so you can't just insert laws or change taxes based soley on your personal ideology (for example, banning abortion will increase your approval rating by religious people and conservatives by a fair amount, but liberals will hate you for it). You also have to balance- or possibly go all-out with- an economy, by doing things such as raising or lowering taxes, promoting foreign trade or taking a more isolationist approach, by exploiting the environment to harvest fossil fuels or take the more expensive renewable energy, etc. As implied earlier, the game does have a fairly steep learning curve initally. There's a lot of buttons that you have no idea what they do, and you'll likely flounder about for a while before finally getting the hang of the game- it isn't that complex once you have played for a while. But also implied earlier is that the game is, sadly, rather repetitive and boring after a few hours. Especially if you play on lower difficulties, you eventually don't have to worry about the oppostion winning the next election- assuming you've played wisely thus far- and the entire game basically becomes ""insert all policies I want to and keep getting re-elected until I can't have another term"". Technically, replayabilty is increased by there being several nations (UK, France, US, Germany, Australia, and Canada IIRC) to choose from, but as far as I can tell the only real difference between the nations is difficulty.Should you buy it? If you are really into the idea of a SOLEY political game that lacks grand strategy, then yes, of course. If you'd prefer a grand strategy game with lots of graphics and international relations and wars and such, this isn't the game for you. If you're somewhere in between, definitly wait for a sale, since it doesn't have a lot of ""life"" in it after a few hours of play.Overall, 8/10.			"

												Barely a game.  There just isn't much there beyond what feels like a giant spreadsheet where you're looking for the one cell that's off.  Probably the biggest problem is that there are some policies which will work every time, no matter the circumstances (and some policies which are always terrible and shouldn't even be included).  Realism is pretty low; everything is static.  A limited selection of random events are as dynamic as it gets.  The developer really has very little idea how actual policies work and are implemented; while most things are alright, there's more than a few that are just way off base.   For example: there's no solution to global warming or the rare metal shortage; no matter how much money you pour in programs to combat them or how good your environment scores are, they'll be with you forever.If you get past the horrible tutorial and UI, you can get a couple hours in before you're bored doing the same thing over and over.  If you've played any of the Democracy games before, you can safely avoid this one because there's not much improved or different.  And if you do get this, DO NOT get the DLC; they're a ripoff and actually make the game worse (introducing game-breaking policies and situations).			"

It just seem to miss somthing, an extra layer of depth. which is why its not a game I will go back to. Good for 50 hours or less but beyond that... not enough there.			"

												Crank up sales tax to 50% and repeal all others? Move the USA Federal Budget from red to black? Close all the airports to lower polution? If you want to go nuts, you can. There are several mods available with more policies and instructions to create your own. The main object of this simulation is to get re-elected. The policies enacted truly focus on the approval of a group and the amount of membership in that group. For example, giving a tax break for urban farms will increase the membership in the ""Farmers"" group and their approval. There is not an explicit explination on why the creator of the game chooses the relationships of policies to changes in the simulation, but *most* do make common sense. I'll list the common complaints later.This is a fasinating game with one of the best government simulators I've yet seen. While it does not explore the ""balance of power"" between legislative, executive and judicial, it shows the maCssive effect that goverment policies can have on the daily lives of the citizens. Here are some of the main ""balances"" that the game explores, with the goverment's budget as an aspect in all of them.-Capitalism vs the enviroment, disadvantaging the poor, taxation and liberal socialism-Healthcare, is it a right or a privalage? -Welfare vs comfortably unemployed-Foreign Policy (the game is suprisingly light on this though)-Immigration control and liberal membership/approval-Firearms control and health/crimeIt goes on and on. If you're looking for a complex challenge and want to understand goverment better, you should experience this game.			"

												A strangely addicting game, if I'm to be honest. The UI is nicely done, and while the music doesn't really vary, it is amazing at capturing the mood and intent of the game. This genre is always at a disadvantage when it comes to scope, but this game comes the closest to simulating the real decisions made at the highest levels of government. In playing this game, bear in mind that it was not developed with a Call Of Duty-esque budget. Do that, and you'll certainly come to appreciate the game as I have.			"

This is simply just not the grand strategy masterpiece of political sims you're probably looking for and that the price tag and marketing would have you believe it is.This is a good start for the simulator all of us political science junkies want to see but the price is just completely unjustifiable in relation to the quality of this game.Verdict: Hard pass at full price.

												I think this game was one of my first games in my steam library and I still don't regret picking it up. From time to time I play it for the fun of it. I don't like to overthink and strategise in this game because I know that won't work either. Unfortunately this game is so old that it doesn't support tabbing without crashing. I was playing while chatting with a friend about game of thrones and whenever I tabbed out it couldn't load anymore. To appoint a very good part of this game is the autosave system. It literally saves every minute or so because even while chatting I could continue from where I 'stopped'. Time to talk about the game itself. The music is good, nothing special, but it is relaxing and it suits the atmosphere of the situation that you are in. I like the challenge that this game offers, unless you played this for 100 hours, you still don't really know how to easily beat the opposition. I have managed it before but it is extremely hard when you play from time to time. I can imagine that when you play daily you can beat it easier and easier and get bored. This game has been a rollercoaster of understandings to me. First I don't know what I am doing, it evolves into starting to understand what I'm doing, eventually evolving into overthinking ending again into confusiong because I think I screwed up somehow. The idea behind this game is very realistic and it reminds me of Belgian politics. Whenever you enact something liberals like the socialists are salty about it. Well you'll come across that in this game. It remains intresting because you can't have everyone in the green at all times. I do feel like this game needs a little more information than it has, especially to a player who doesn't play it very often. Maybe an option that displays the opinions and or modifiers in numbers would be interesting. For example going into the green can be good when you go for capitalist happiness, as an example, but it isn't when you go into the green with alcholism. With a numbers system I imply that whenever you boost capitalists it shows a positive number and whenever you boost alcholism it shows a negative number. Unless you want to boost alcholism that bad.Overall a good pickup for the price that it is at, 10 euro's (I'm not sure at all anymore) and it is worth your time. Although I do feel that you need to have a little interest in politics otherwise this won't interest you either.			"

												True, Democracy 3 can be incredably easy once you understand what best suits the problem in a certian country, and moving sliders with either major effects or little to no effect makes it feel unrealistic. However Democracy has an ocean of experinces and depth, letting you create ""different scenarios"" although the solutions you find will often be the same as before. These are lacking and most defintly boring, escepically after a few good terms. Its important to note isnt so much a politcal sim, but more like cause and effect sim. You get this feeling after you get asssainated when you change the slider 2 points. Not to mention that sometimes you'll be enacting, canceling, or chagning policies, not for your party or for your country, but for the approval of a group. The DLC's dont really add much, just some well needed policies that everyone wanted, like capping pay on CEo's, putting in smart meters, or having your county sing the national anthem. Sadly nothing game changing. But what I find is fun and interesting is the achivements. In Democracy 3 you can have the US become a fanactical god loving people, or turn into a police state! This is where Democracy 3 turns around. The fact the the changes are so dramatic, the fact that you have many options, lets you create different realitys, where the the US is a socialist utopia, or the UK becomes a police state. Getting these achivemetns, while balancing the regular game is lots of fun, and easily makes up over half my playtime. And Luckily for the gamers, mods are easy and supported. Creating interesting policies or new countries to master, then turn into a corrupt, strict, goverment watching you 24/7. Overall Democracy 3 can be boring, can be unfair, and can be way too easy. But its ocean of depth and goals encourage us to create our own content, and let us have our own fun. Not as a politics sim, but instead a fun open way for gamers to explore new, sometimes serious, sometimes funny, worlds.			"

												TL;DR Great foundation for what could've been a great game, but Positech got greedy and split the game into 2 games and 3 paid DLCs. For only 9 hours of content, it's not worth €23. First off, let me say that this is my favorite genre of game. I enjoy relaxing after a long day of work and managing my empire/country/business. I love politics and this game seemed like a perfect fit for me. If I had written this review after my first 2 hours with the game, it would have been a glowing paragraph or two about the worlds greatest goverment simulator. But as a plowed through what the game had to offer, it became more and more repetitive and dull. The same decisions, the same problems, and very few solutions. After serving 2 terms as president (which takes about 3-4 hours on the hardest setting) my country had zero obesity, zero crime, zero unemployment and the best health, education and GDP.  I was only 4 hours into the game and I had beaten it. I decided to go to bed and after work the next day, I picked a different country, downloaded as much content via Steam Workshop as possible, and started a new game. 5 hours and 1 savefile later, I had beaten the game again.I keep asking myself ""Why would Positech go through the effort of making the great UI, soundtrack, animations etc, and only supply 4 hours worth of content? I decided to look through the homescreen to see if I was missing something when the notification popped up on my screen. An advertisement for the Extremism DLC. Turns out there are 3 DLC packs available, and an entirely different game with the exact same foundation, same mechanics, same UI and the same developer, Positech games. Positech has developed would could have been a great game but instead they decided to be greedy and split the game into 2 games and 3 DLC packs.			"

												Enjoyed playing this game and seeing all the connections between various aspects of a democratic society.  It is tempting to go to the extreme and see if you can solve a nation's problems while still remaining popular enough to get re-elected.  (Or avoid assassination by a fringe group.)This is more of an educational game for strategists and puzzle-solvers than for those that seek action and excitement.  (There are NO action scenes in this game... it all about charts and graphs.)As I enjoy puzzle-games and games that do not rely on my (poor) reflexes, this was an interesting change.MIght be something useful to show students in school how societal problems and solutions are interconnected.

												Assassination Simulator 3 is a lackluster exercise in futility.In broad strokes, the gameplay experience was one of effecting sweeping and radical change based on personal philosophy and being assassinated in the first term; then reining it in and making more gradual, moderate policy decisions in direct response to the wants of the electorate and being assassinated in the first term; then deciding that the electorate seems happier with the status quo than any change, leaving things exactly as they are, and being assassinated in the first term; then giving up forever.In fine strokes, the gameplay experience is trying to interpret coarse data like popularity with the ""parent"" constituency into actionable information and learning through exploration, trial, and error that ""parent"" is game jargon for single-issue environmentalist because pollution = air quality = asthma = child = parent; then adjusting environmental policy, and just maybe postponing assassination by ""parents"" long enough to be assassinated by the ""Black Power Group,"" who are hair-trigger rabid about border controls, citizenship tests, and foreign aid -- I'm not making this up! -- then pondering whether the game is, in the final analysis, needlessly complicated, ludicrously simplistic, or paradoxically both; then deciding ♥♥♥♥ it and giving up forever.Add to that the pervasively partisan slant in copy and mechanics in a game marketed as an ideological sandbox, and graphics as immersive and spectacular as Microsoft Visio, and Democracy 3 is the kind of game you accept as a gift if offered and run once in the background for a handful of Steam trading cards.If you are considering purchasing Democracy 3, don't. You can get the same sense of inevitable and swift failure in a political setting from the award winning Papers, Please for 40% of the price, with comparatively revolutionary graphics and an actual sense of engagement and urgency, to boot.

												Somewhat interesting game.  Terrible user interface.Given the nature of the game, I'm not surprised that playing it feels like manipulating a spreadsheet.  But even given that premise, the UI is a huge pain at every step:You start the game by being shown dozens of existing policies and statistics, plus a list of perhaps a hundred more that you can choose to enact.  So plan on spending your first hour just reading a giant laundry list of knobs you can turn.These are grouped into 7 categories, but within categories don't appear to be organized by name, effect, or cost (except that ones you can't afford move to the end of the list, ensuring that next turn when you can afford them, you won't be able to find them, because they will have moved).The effects of a policy are listed in no particular order (not alphabetically, not by strength, not with related effects grouped together, not even in a consistent order between different policies)When you look at a policy, you can preview its effects at different levels of intensity.  But when you look at a stat or event, you can only see its effects at its current level.  It won't even tell you whether a particular effect is going to get stronger or weaker as the stat goes up (and yes, both are possibilities).If you look at a stat, you can see how all your current policies are affecting that stat.  But you can't get a list of all the available new policies that COULD affect that stat.  You have to manually search the entire list yourself....and even then, you can't see what a new policy actually does, even when you are specifically looking at it.  You just get a block of flavor text.  The only way to see the actual effects is to enact it (which is not undoable--the UI claims that immediately canceling it is free, but if you try it, it still charges you for enacting it, then charges you again for canceling it).  I have saved and reloaded so many times just to see what stuff does...I could almost imagine that they hid the effects deliberately because they want you to guess from the description (though I personally think that would be an awful design choice), but the descriptions will straight-up lie to you.  For instance, ""Eco-Home Regulations"" says in the flavor text that it ""will help protect the environment"", but it actually has zero effect on the stat called ""The Environment"".  The ""Hybrid Cars Initiative"" flavor text specifically cites reduced CO2 as an advantage, but when implemented it doesn't reduce CO2 at all (in fact, it increases CO2 indirectly by increasing Car Usage).When you choose an option in a special event, it won't tell you the effects even after you make the choice.  They'll be displayed on the screens of the affected variables (for instance, if you go to the screen for ""commuters"", you can see how their opinion was changed by your answer), but you have to check every screen in the game one at a time if you want to find them all.You can click an effect to go to the screen for the affected variable, but there is no ""back"" button.  Closing a screen will sometimes return you to an earlier screen, sometimes not.Some variables display the value from last turn, and others display what the value is going to be on the current turn.  These are mixed and matched without apparent rhyme or reason.  For instance, this makes it impossible to know what your budget deficit/surplus for the current turn is going to be, because the preview is calculated using some numbers from last turn and other numbers from the current turn.Sometimes very different effects look very similar.  For instance, ""Middle Income"" and ""Middle Earnings"" are totally separate variables that don't appear to affect each other.  A little use of symbols or colors to distinguish (say) happiness levels from economic indicators would have been greatly appreciated.Text strings are truncated all over the place, as if the guy writing the text had no idea how much space was available on the screen.  Even the achievement descriptions are truncated when you look at them through the Steam interface outside the game.This is not an exhaustive list.I also think that some of the rules for what affects what are questionable.  Since it's a game about politics, and the true impact of many policies is, itself, a topic of vigorous political debate, it's probably inevitable that any given player will disagree with at least a few of their representations, and I don't think we should hold that against the developers.  But there are also some that look less like a political difference of opinion and more like a bug.			"

												This game is amazing! A few people find bugs and errors but not me... Sips played it on his channel and made me want to play it and it was not a mistake! You can be the PM of Britain or President of the USA. You can be PM of Australia or Canada. You can be Chancellor of Germany. Each country you are in charge of starts with some epidemics. For example, when you play as Britain you start with an uncompetitive economy and an Asthma epidemic.There are a few factual errors, for example you can appoint speed cameras in Britain when, in fact, Britain IRL already has speed cameras. (At least Scotland does)Overall, Democracy 3 is a brilliant game if you love slow-paced, RP games. I give Democracy 3 a score of 3.9!			"

												The game tries to make you think that you can run a country in any way you like to. But, in reality, there only are a few 'correct' ways to do things and these ways guarantee you a 99% in votes, pretty much all of the achievements and general happiness. On the other hand, if you try to play your way (and your way happens to be 'incorrect') you're pretty much done for.The game is extremely short: It takes about 1-2 hours to master it. From then, you can only play for achievements, because there's isn't really anything new going to happen.It's very linear/limited,  short,  and expensive. Maybe if it was priced below $10 I could recommend it to casual players. But currently it's too expensive to be a casual game and too limited to be a hardcore game.Oh, and its DLC adds less than the freely available mods, so even if you buy this game, stay away from the DLC -- just look up some interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.

												I really enjoy the concept of this game and for the most part it plays well. However, there are some fundamental problems with the game. The most obvious of these being the assasination system. Assasination should be a rare event and the result of exteme circumstances. You can turn it off in the menu, but to be honest this is a cop out of the part of the developer and it makes the intelligence system redundant.Aside from this, after a few hours of play I was finding that there were optimal ways to achieve success and not enough room to experiement with non standard policy choices. I understand that making a game like this must be very difficult but I find that the gameplay becomes hollow and predicatable after a while. Great potential and fun for a while but misses the mark due to some poor design decisions.			"

												""Why did i buy it"" and ""what a waste of money"" were two questions i asked myself when bought it.After playing i was thinking what does this gameplay remind me and i got it. Its when you play Sims on max speed trying to make your character smart or athletic so you do everything to keep these stupid bars green to make sure he is not tired and is fed. With addition of quite ascetic and dull interface and repetative gameplay this game seems to be overpriced above all. Also - choosing a country brings absolutely no feeling you rule this one exact country, they in fact, are all the same and belong to one economic system, and even in this situation Germany is all like USA or Canada, though in real life they hardly are, two party system for everyone, viva democracy, lets choose from two sorts of same crap. Looked like a very perfunctory game even to my narrowminded personality.Wish i was aware of Charlemagne add-on for Crusader Kings 2, so i could buy it instead of that. This game, ironically, has much more to do with politics than Democracy 3.			"

												I've been playing the series for a while now. Unfortunately it's not good enough for the price they're asking.This is essentially ""Slider controls - the game"". It's a balancing act of sorts, and although it may sound like an oversimplification, it really isn't.A good developer would mask the simplicity of a game with enough layers of complexity. In democracy there are no layers of complexity, it's an X-Ray of a skeleton.How you play the game is ""slide this to make X group happy and♥♥♥♥♥♥off Y"", then ""Slide this to reduce Y group membership and increase it in group Z"".The functionality of the game is lacking too. Something that jumps out at me straight away is the Save option. Why aren't any of the current saves selectable? In order to save your current America game, you have to type out the name of the save you used last time (if you wish to use the same save of course). At which point upon ""selecting"" a save name, you will be promoted to OVER-WRITE the existing file name. Yeah.... so why the heck didn't you see this as a lacking feature and just make them selectable so you can over-write in two simple clicks?The theme of the game is far from the videos. Do not be fooled! The one where the eloquent American politician is speaking - with an morally strong and positive outlook - is not at all what the game really feels like.It has numerous loading screens per round with quotes by famous people. Quotes which are mostly, if not all absolutely cynical. And that is very important that you understand this.The game has a cynical sense of humour and it just feels out of place. It just carries this bitter vibe which speaks about the creator's world view. Again this wouldn't be an issue if the game was advertised in that light.I wouldn't buy this ""game"" but if you must, wait until it's on sale because it's not worth more than 5$.edited for spelling.

												Playing this game has made me realise why politicians always look to the short-term.People love and hate you for doing exactly the things they want, or don't want.People don't care about what they need in the long term and you won't either, because if you fail your election, its game over for you anyway.For example, everyone loves education. So you spend more on education to keep them happy. Your budget deficit grows, you don't want to increase taxes because you want to keep them happy. You don't want to cut other fundings because you want to keep others happy too. Economy worsens, your credit rating drops. everyone suffers and blames you etc.P.S. This is a fun game to play before taking a macroeconomics course/degree.P.P.S. Steam Workshop has a good variety of mods that change gameplay and scenarios in interesting ways. Be sure to check it out as they really add value to this game. I recommend

												Way boring. I like strategy games, but this one is way too simplified and complicated at the same time.  It's like skiing, easy to go through the game and finish it, however, very difficult to master and takes a lot of reading and experimenting to become truly an expert at this game. I would pay $5 tops for this game. It's such a simple program. You increase or decrease a stat, and it has an effect on your presidency one way or another. Simple if then statements. Do not buy unless less than $5.			"

												If you're a political person or enjoy economics this one's for you!  It's a turn-based political simulator, where you balance national budget and enact policies, all while trying to keep your constituents happy.  This is easier said than done in some situations and depends on how you choose to play. There are so many ways to approach a situation that it can be difficult to make a right choice, and being able to do so will often require presumptive strategy.  And, even if your strategy and execution are perfect, you can still sometimes fall victim to random chance.  To me, this all accumulates into a different, replayable game, and I'd say that this game is worth the money if it's on sale.  $30 is a bit steep, but, maybe not as this game has provided me with over 65 hours of entertainment, not to mention there are mods.  Ultimately, that is up for you to decide.  However, if you like anything I've said about this game, I'd recommend at least putting it on your watchlist, and catch it when it's on sale.P.S. This game has mods available			"

												Who doesn't want to be the person in control? On that basis this game is build and it is build well. Without a doubt there are some feelings of the devloper in this game and some options would without question have let to instant riots in real life, but truly those are minor points when you look at something so elegantly made.Not only does the game a good thing in guiding you around the game and the interface which by first glace might seem endless complex, but is yet ever so simple, it also gives you that wonderful feeling of ""See I can do this better."" I loved personally how I could transform any country to a wonderful place to life by my standards and have everyone behind me, because even if they don't like you, they will still vote for you if you do enough things that do please them.Wholehearthly recommended to anyone who has even a remote interest in the subject of politics, just beware when you quit from the game you do wonder more often why things are just not working out as smoothly in real life.

												This is a great wake-up call if you think it's easy to run a country.  The immense inter-linking of causes and effects makes you feel the presure of running a country.  Starting in a budget deficit, feeling the pressure of capitalists as your GDP tanks...you get the feel of a (almost) real politician.  And with the simple concept of political capital in a turn-based structure, there's a certain amount of availability to plan and strategize, but also realize that you can only push forward a huge plan by being immensely popular and liked.  Maybe my only gripe is the difficulty curve, because it takes a long time to figure out what links to what, but I give credit to the UI for making it really easy to find out how to improve many of the issues a country experiences.A good buy for anyone who likes a strategic simulator with realism (and for those who think it isn't real enough, the modding system is easy enough to understand so you can make it more real).  No need for warfare to make a good strategy game.			"

												This game has a generally boring appearance, but a playthrough of the game will easily show that this game is not boring at all.Things I like:•It is easy to align yourself with a specific ideology (capitalism, socialism, etc.).•The game is simplistic enough to understand, but still allows a general amount of micromanagement.•The game allows for easy modding and several of the mods look as if they were part of the game.•The DLC expands the game a great amount and is not very expensive.Things I don't like:•The game feels a bit expensive and although I enjoy the game, I was skeptical of buying it.•The Extremism DLC is not expansive enough (i.e. it allows the ban of homosexuality if you choose, but not the ban of religion, which would be a sort of opposing idea).•It is ridiculuously easy to be assassinated in the game. You can only assume that you, as a leader of a country, have absolutely no protection and have a target on your forehead. For example, I decided that my country should have retinal scans for those entering the borders (it was a test) and I was assassinated the next turn.•The game is a bit simple when it comes to names for various groups. For example, if you are assassinated by an ethnic group, it will ALWAYS be the ""Black Power"" group. This needs more diversity, as black people obviously do not represent all ethnic people.Overall, I recommend this game, along with its DLC. However, I would wait for a Steam sale to purchase it at a discounted price, because I can't really imagine having a desire to purchase this game if it is over $15 USD.			"

												This game is not bad, in fact I like this game. So in short:+Many policiesThings are influencing other thingsManagement of staffSolving problematic situationsCreating own ""democracy""-Its ""Democracy"" so its not really much possible to start a totalitarian state, left or right1 turn events are repetitive and after 3rd time, really boringHard to get in to it from start, but its okay laterNot really possible to stay in power for a long time, because of debt during cyclones and food crisis in later eraIts good game, but I rather recommend you, buy it only if you like politics.

												This game would be ok for a browser flash game, it's poor and simplistic. Within 2 hours on my first attempt I had 95% of the electorate, no opposition, wiped out religion and 300 billion surplus per turn.In the end my 'liberal' voters assasinated me.I didn't even bother with focus groups or caring what the voters thought and just did everything that may be related to gdp, then I eventually taxed the income of my voters by 110% (no kidding, I had 60% income tax and a 50% flat rate tax).At least I bought it on sale, £20 is a joke.

 Democracy 3 by Positech Games Okay. I will try to produce an honest and helpful review about Democracy 3 , which can be a little difficult... So here it is: Democracy 3 review So, what does  Democracy 3  have to offer, you might ask? It looks really simple and, well, There's no simulation other then the red and green arrows pointing towards and away from bubbles with icons on them. Why should I buy such a dull looking game?Well, what  Democracy 3  has to offer is a great educational example of how hard it actually is to get everything working, follow your ideology (wether it might be conservative, nationalistic, totalitarian, socialistic, liberal etc.) and keep getting re-elected. No, it hasn't got a glorious PC master race Crysis 3 graphics style simulation. Instead of making things more complicated than they have to, it shows a simple and easy to use, hard to get lost in interface (which manages to look really good at the same time).Another reason for not having the most advanced interface possible is that this is most probably meant to be an educational game, teaching students how and why the government keeps breaking promises and negotiate with opposing parties. Its important not to be required to have a  super-expensive-gaming-computer-that-is-completeley-unnecessary-unless-you-are-a-super-rich-showoff [www.yoyotech.co.uk] for a teacher to show how a government works. It is a simplified version of how heads of state work, but yes  it gives quite a clear image of what you're up to if you are running for office.Another thing that striked me was the actual amount of content in the game. Imply new taxes and policies (INTERNET TAX MOHAHAHA!), make enviromentalists rage and motorists cheer as you decide to build new highways all over the country. Seriously, you can do A LOT in this game and the only thing stopping you is your economy ( a debt of £8 000 000 billion isn't going to help, I'm afraid). And don't even get me started on the economy. Once you learnt how to handle it, fine. If you don't, you're screwed.So, conclusion. If you are interested in politics and how countries are ruled, try it out. There is Steam refund y'know. Although a bit pricy (€22,99 seriously? It's not that big!) at the moment  so wait for a sale. I recommend it for most people who like intellectual games in general, that requires thinking and calculating risks and consequenses. If you like Cities:Skylines, previous Democracy titles, or almost any other game that makes you think (and frown as people complain about your majestic rule).The only real cons about this game: overpriced and quite stereotypical focus groups (I know it makes things a whole lot easier but not all religious beleive in creationism (I don't, have never done, WTF?) and not all liberals get mad about strict gun rules.) But it's a fun game, and I recommend you try it. My score: 7,5/10  "

												Democracy 3 stands true to the description provided and overall it is an okay game. The game is fun for the first term or hour playing but soon after it becomes clear that the only true way to play the game is to simply conform to what all political parties or groups want. In reality a political party has an agenda set before they even campaign for an election and if they change any ideals or part of their agenda, they lose loyal supporters. Political parties realize that they cannot win every single vote which is why they usually focus on a few specific groups of people which could win the party the most votes. Democracy 3 completely ignores the standard election process and focuses only on political party happiness/approval and policies. The game doesn't introduce any new ways of playing after the first term and the only dramatic changes are with groups planning assassinations or with members of the cabinet leaving. Other events such as unhappiness with the general public and a declining GOP, which usually are extremely important for effectively running a government, become insignficant since the only information we receive are numbers and the player is never given any visuals about how these events are affecting the public. Even debt doesn't appear important. To make the game truly enjoyable after the first term, more time should have been spent into creating believable events that actually matter and using more than just policies to hold sway. Perhaps having severe consequences if the party completely switched ideals after making political statements or agendas. The game provided feels more like the skeleton of a potentially great game. More content and variation would have been great but as the game is, after playing for a little over an hour I became severely bored and uninterested. If I could undo the purchase I would have waited until the base game was only around two dollars.			"

												Okay, where should I start.It's pretty buggy and confusing. Closing some dialogs, like in the summary between rounds, leaves you in unexpected places and you end up accidentally leaving the summary. After changing a policy but changing your mind, you press the close button, thinking it will undo the changes, but noooo, it accepts the change. You have to press ""revert changes"" then click the close button.The interface is confusing with all the icons, good luck finding the one you are looking for easily. It's unclear if green or red means positive in some context. Take ""crime"" for example, do I want it red or green? Green usually means good, but a lot of things I would assume lowers crime puts it in the red instead.Also, seems like you can get away with any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and still get 90% of the votes. The election system is unintuitive and boring since there's only you vs them, 2 parties in total.			"

												Democracy 3 is a very niche type of game. It will only appeal to a small number of politics fans and policy enthusiasts. Luckily, I'm both of those.I received Democracy 3 as a gift and while it was on sale. Otherwise, I probably would not have bought it at all as for much as I enjoyed it, it is not worth its price. The game will last you a few hours and can be intellectually engaging but gameplay is pretty one-dimensional.Reactions to policies are also a bit biased. Socialist nations will inevitably do well, while it is almost impossible to have a prosperous free market economy. In this regard, the developers are quite partial.If you're looking for a neat political simulator in a genre which is quite small already, Democracy 3 is probably your best bet.			"

												As simulations go, this game is to running a Western liberal democracy as Hit The Ice was to professional hockey—that is, it's a kind of arcade version designed to emulate the essential elements involved, while at the same time exaggerating certain elements to keep things exciting/entertaining.Democracy 3 is built around 3 central concepts—budget, policies, and political capital—and one central goal: get re-elected (some would add ""don't get assassinated"" to the goal list, but more on that later). Policies allow you to choose how you raise and spend money, and your choice of policies will then affect certain economic and demographic indicators like GDP, unemployment, education level, and most importantly voter satisfaction. Policies are paid for with political capital, which is provided by your loyal cabinet—or not so loyal, if they don't like your policy mix. And of course your budget keeps you honest, as too much debt will affect your economy, which in turn will affect your policy choices, which will affect your popularity with your voters and your cabinet, which affects your political capital, which limits your policy choices... Basically, everything you can do in Democracy 3 has pros and cons in various areas, and the art is in balancing them.The simulation side of the game provides a decent range of policies, demographics, and countries to play around with, with adjustable settings and difficulty levels to keep your political tinkerer tinkering. The random events and decision-making dilemmas get a bit repetitive after a while, but it's bearable. The arcade side can sometimes be faintly ridiculous—for example, in my first game, I was assassinated in less than half a term by angry capitalists... in CANADA—but still fun. Steam achievements also add to replay value, giving you some social-engineering targets to aim for that, sometimes, no sane leader would want to achieve. Witness: in one game, I turned Australia into an Agrarian Society, then provided Full Employment, before turning it into a Police State, a Military State, an Educational Failure, a Divided Society with huge inequality, and finally a Banana Republic; all that within 5 electoral terms, and I won the last election with 100% of the vote at 150% difficulty. Strictly realistic? No. Kinda cool and enjoyable? Yup.Aesthetically, Democracy 3 provides a clean and usable interface, and a nice soundtrack which is, unfortunately, just one track played over and over. For more gameplay, there are 3 official DLC expansions which add to available policies and situations (I have not tried these), and an active modding community. All in all, a worthwhile game for simulation and democracy enthusiasts, who don’t mind the odd hockey fight gun-toting capitalist.			"

The simulation is grait an I had not experianced any bugs in the game so far. What is most impressive is the modding. It is a blast to mod the game. I almost prefere it to playing. But that is just me. Like many people I to made a mod of my county simply because I could. :) I really wanted to make as accurate representation as possible.  I loved every hour that I sank in to it and I hardly have any complaints. The biggest one I could poste is the fact that the pop. in the county does not change and there is no way to let say, set the number of active workers in one contry. Everything is based of the total pop.. Maybe that is a plan for a future DLC or D4 :) The game is not to expensive and it has a good Forum to satisfy all the questions in the world.			"

												Even though it was over 2 years since Democracy 3 came out and I played it, something about it made it great but also a disaster in a way.For one it was a bit overpriced, although with the DLC and base game on sale I would recommend it to strategy/political gamers out there although its replayability, gameplay, and quality could be called into question.Unfortunately its a hard game (much like politics funnily enough), but if you enjoy trying to come up with solutions on how to raise your country to the ground or rise above all of its problems, or even have several extremist groups make attempts on your life, then this is the game for you Buster Brown!

												Let me start off by saying that I like Democracy 3. It is a great concept. However it falls short for a number of reasons. 1: Making a game about politics is hard. Everybody has their own dream utopia and even though the developer has done a good job his personal opinions still manage to shine through. The consequences of certain actions and policies are not realistic compared to real life examples. 2: Budgets I find it really hard to maneuver the economic sliders in this game. It is hard to understand just how much money I need to make something work properly and how much I can spend without breaking my budget. The result is an ever present feeling of always thinking that you are spending a bit too much or not enough. 3: MinistersThe game has only one resource, Political Capital. You obtain it through your ministers every turn. Each minister has their own political allegiances and for some reason you are not allowed to pick the ones you like before you start your term. I often found their loyalty to crumble eventually and I never quite figured out how to assemble the most effective cabinet. Overall it felt like an annoying distraction from the main game. 4: DLCWith such a minimalistic game I would have expected there to be more nations aviable to play. Packaging a series of additional policies and events that should have been present in vanilla as 5€ DLC is not in any way okey.			"

												I am torn on this game. Really, Democracy 3 is little more than Democracy 2 with a new skin and some added content through DLC. You don't really get that democratic experience. I would really hope that in Democracy 4 (if there is one) that they would tailor their democratic experience a little bit better. For instance, if you play as the leader of the U.S., then you should have to balance your needs against the will of Congress (which the executive has to do). They could factor in midterm elections and if you lose control of Congress then your Political Capital costs increase. If you control Congress then Political Capital costs should either decrease or change based on how much you control Congress. In Parliamentary systems, you should have to balance your desires with the desires of your coalition partners. If you don't balance those needs, your coalition can rebel and you have to hold early elections.I'm also frustrated with the slider bars when you start a new game. They say they are for ""advanced"" users, but they never explain what the sliders do (except for the ""difficulty"" slider, which you can really guess what it does on your own). It would be nice to be able to modify those sliders to bring about new changes in your games.It would just be nice to have more to a ""democracy simulator"" rather than just clicking on some policies, adjusting some sliders, and managing a budget. It needs to feel like you're leading a country and managing it rather than just ruling by fiat. Maybe there could be policies that allow you to slowly chip away at the foundation of democracy and establish a presidential (or Prime Ministerial) dictatorship. But as it is, I'd say Democracy 3 is an enjoyable experience but only for a limited time.			"

The game has a lot to offer but is somewhat lacking in the fact that there's really very little variety in terms of consequences for your actions. You will spend the entire game at one screen, tweaking taxes and changing laws, it's definitely not an action packed game.

It's interesting to see counter-effects when a policy to improve X is introduced (for example, but making your country highly scientific, you'll get a lot of cyber-attacks).			"

												Being the sucker for political drama that I am I added this game to my list of interests with the patience all gamers enjoy like leaving the new tasty treat in the fridge that we tell ourselves will be a solemn commitment one of these days. Once opened however I was...actually totally impressed. The game is simplistic in approach but amazingly easy to grasp, full of sandbox similar glee moments and a full set of customisation options for your choice of state to take control over. The game begins with you taking the reins of power over one of the major Western powers at the beginning of the 21st century with a multitude of local affairs to deal with ranging from GDP to violent crime, education and immigration. But the thing that I recommend most specifically about this game is that even if you don't appreciate politics...I still think you will have fun. If you ever took sadistic glee when playing Sim City to develop a nightmarish Orwellian society where every person lived under your watchful gaze then this game offers even more specific ways to do it. Or if you feel just like a fun simulator to wizz through while chatting to friends then I heartly recommend also. It's easy to decide on your own level of involvement yet easily well worth a discounted price on Steam considering the mod community and replayability. Check this one out. Oh...and you can pi*s off some demographics enough that some groups attempt to assassinate you - I'm not making that sh*t up.			"

Takes a couple of games (in addition to the tutorial) to get familiarized with how everything works, but once that happens you will find yourself thinking about how every little policy change will affect the whole social web of your country directly and indirectly. My only complaint is that after overcoming the initial crises and making your country bloom, there doesn't seem to be anything else to do.Still, gave me a new appreciation for just how much a political leader has to take into account and balance out, and how difficult it is to please everyone.

												Neat concept, but gets boring fast due to the goals always feeling the same. Even when the percentages for the different groups you are trying to sway start different from another game, they always seem to migrate toward the same end results. As such, it seems like policies will generally feel like they're going to have the same effect.This is countered by the fact that so much just seems completely random that you can't really make educated choices. Ministers or activist groups will say they want you to support Thing X, and when you start doing things to support them, they get madder. My best strategy so far seems to be to completely ignore all of that, and then I start to feel like nothing I'm told matters.Maybe the whole thing is just a joke about politics, and how nothing we do matters, because people are fickle... but that's not a very fun game.

Democracy 3 is a very immersive sim with plenty of depth to it. The game quickly shows you just how hard it can be to be president, even when all your choices are clearly presented and can literally be calculated. Even with all of it's challenge and depth though, the game is easy to grasp from the start and does a very good job of teaching itself. Some mechanics however many not be noticed until after a few playthroughs and a bit of exploring. That's definitely one area where the game could improve. Another disapointment was the cluttered and often hard-to-navigate UI, sometimes opening and closing a menu takes you back to where you just were, other times it just sends you to your home screen.If you enjoy these kind of cause-and-effect sims at all then you should grab Democracy 3 as soon as it's on sale.If you like Democracy 3 I recommend, the Sid Meyer's Civilization series,venturing a little further Papers, Please is something that would definitely appeal to plenty of Democracy 3 fans, Breach and Clear is tactical simulator that may also appeal.

												The game showed promise during the first 45-60 minutes. It seemed deep enough with enough variables to continue to challenge the player, but ultimatley fell short. The UI is incredibly intuitive and straightforward, despite all of the menus and submenus you'll go through (spoiler alert, it's a ton). But, after about 90 minutes I started winning elections with 92% of the vote and had a budget surplus of nearly $75bn. I'd have taken it as a ""win"" and started a new round, except the prompts, in-game ""crises"" and issues that pop up each quarter for you to solve started repeating themselves. As such, the game wasn't nearly as deep as I thought it was when I first picked it up. I've logged 2 hours, probably won't log anymore.			"

												In a question of whether or not you should buy this game, I think the answer depends on what your experience with Democracy is. If you're here because you got Democracy 2 five years ago and want to give it a shot again, I urge you to locate 2 again and stay home. If this would be a brand new type of game for you, well then we can keep talking. But, coming from Democracy 2, this game has some serious issues. Like, horror-scifi pull-off-your-friend's-skin-and-wear-it-as-a-hat-do-you-like-me-better-now level of disturbingly bad ideas for a game that styles itself as brand new for $25 with $15 of DLC. The interface is the same. The way you interact with policies, ministers, dilemmas, the way you view your budget, opinion polling, focus groups – these are all the same and are styled the same. Maybe the color of the charts is sliiightly different and the background is sliiightly different, but it's the same.Policies are the same. Like the exact ones. And, of course, you would expect some of them to reoccur. It would be pretty difficult for you to have a nationstate simulator game without involving things like ""income tax"" as a policy, so some of them can get a free pass. But when Democracy 2 has, let's say, sixty policies and every single one of them shows up here again with the same icon, description, and slider effects, that's a little cheap.The dilemmas are the same. Turns are measured in quarters and every quarter or two there is a life threatening political crisis in your government that you have to rule on. What is cheap and disappointing is that these dilemmas are literally copy-pastes from Democracy 2. Again, I can understand talking about some of the same issues, but to have the exact same right-ups to the letter? Are you kidding me?So basically, if I want something different and larger than Democracy 2, I have to pay the price of Democracy 2 and five dollars, plus one to three five dollar DLCs (one of which is completely game-breaking) and then maybe it will have some semblance of a different experience? Please.That's okay, I'm newAn understandable way to deal with horror is to not know it's there at all. But even then, we have some familiar problems. So, here in Democracy 3, we take the roles of real nations in the world. Those nations come as the base game and then there's some more player-created ones that exist in the Steam Workshop. But if I wanted to take a country like the United Kingdom, basically, there WILL ONLY be the Conservative Party and Labour and it is impossible for anything else to exist at all. Your party will only ever have one opponent, it will be the same opponent every time, and you will never have to worry about one or more parties eroding your power because apparently if you win an election, you win 100% of your representative seats or at least always have a majority and will never need to compromise anything in your policies.That is fundamentally not how UK politics works or Canada or Spain or hardly any of the options for playable countries. You will not always have a ruling party dictatorship and be able to fully implement whatever program you want or change in spending that you want if you simply ignore the other party and wait a while.But it is how the US works.So, if you are an angry conservative farmer from Kentucky which, based on the angry reviews on here, most players are, this game makes a great deal of sense to you regardless of what country you play as and only pisses you off because you were previously unaware how much the federal government spends on welfare. But if you expect something other than US politics like the novelty of working with coalitions and trying to use policies and ideas that no one has seen before or something that is unique to your nation, you're going to be sorely disappointed. There's just so many awesome things that could have been included in this game, but were not.As far as the economy goes, there seems to be a bug with the global markets because I kept encountering games where the global economy was at 0% for two or three years at a time, rise back to 20% and then crashed again. You can get around this by having punitive fifteenth century Chinese tariffs and pretending nothing outside your nation exists.Finally, taking a note from the angry farmer from Kentucky, this game IS slider simulator. All of the gameplay takes place on having policies switched on or off and then a slider to control how much of that policy you want active or how forcefully you want to implement it and to what cost. This affects one or more of 21 demographic groups which, depending on what percentage of the electorate they represent, determines your overall popularity. This means that there is a ""sweet spot"" for maximizing your economy and/or your approval and, while there are different start conditions you can have, like how religious your country is or what your starting crises are, ultimately all playable countries essentially have the same sweet spot combinations, and I'll be the first one to tell you that the same policy doesn't work for everyone everywhere.Now that I have it, I will probably play it again every once in a while, but a game like this could have done a lot more and been a lot more fulfilling, so I can't recommend it, especially at its cost.

Although what am I to say, i've spent 8 hours of my life playing it when they could've been playing Football Manager. Democracy 3 is a game of simple ""point 'n' click"" action with a few sliders and economic control but each action can have dire consequences when you throw in a little bit of terrorism and disease. A very easy game to learn, a very hard game to master. 7/10 - Billy Toms			"

												Really fun for the first time playing, ok for the second. But the game isn't balanced at all. There's a few expansions that simple add more options, but ultimately the core game is the same. There's no real repeatability as there's a very simple route to 'winning,' that the game will even steer you toward. It's incredibly easy to pass every piece of legislation, run a positive budget with over a trillion in surplus banked, and have the clear majority of your populace love you so that you handily win every election.Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game. Just not worth the full price. A good catch if you can grab it on a big sale; if you have money burning a hole in your pocket and looking for a simple but fun strategy game pick this up, otherwise hold off.			"

												A really nice simulation. Not just tables and data but a simplistic and yet pleasant UI. The game seems hard enough to learn at first, yet you get the gist of it pretty quickly. There are currently 6 Nations embedded in the standard version: Great Britain, France, Germany, Canada, USA and Australia. There is supposedly an excellent modding support, which will enable you to download more nations once you mastered the above. The game provides you with more and more challenges even if you thought to have made your country an utopia already. There is progressive difficulty settings to provide challenges to experienced players. I don't recommend putting the difficulty as far down as 50%, even though it would go even lower. I once tried that and it makes the game kind of pointless. I personally enjoyed playing the game very much. I have made three attempts on 100% difficulty (which is not the highest, but the standard one), twice I got assassinated by different political groups, once I got germany to be not only deficit, but crime, drug and even car free, which I consider a win. Very fun game. Recommended for strategical thinkers as well as folks who are new to the genre! Really beginner friendly game, with guidance provided to newbies. I recommend picking up the game at the reduced cost during Summer Sale! Good luck and have fun!			"

If your an athiest, make country with 100% religion. If your a communist, make a place with all capitalist. All in all, if you thing this game is quick, your not playing on the highest difficulty.

												I'll start by saying I have never played this series. Like others have said, the beginning of a game is full of challenge and cool decisions, but once you get the hang of it and get everything in balance, u can pretty much next turn it until u get bored. The gameplay consists of clicking icons and sliding, well, sliders. Some choices u make make ya feel good. Compromising is sometimes necessary. I don't know how realistic the reactions of the populace are, but it seems like u can get re-elected when u kno ppl in this country would never go fer that s**t. (Well, then again...lol.)So I dunno...get it on the cheap and its a 7/10.Full price 5/10.			"

												:BUY IF ON SALE:This is very interesting fun political simulator. the gole of the game is pretty basic, get re-elected. Of course its not as simple as that. The game is set up in a board game like view with little bubbles representing diffrent laws or policies. By clicking on one of them it gives you the option to raise the budget, lower the budget, or abolish it. Depending on what you do it will change other things in the country of your choice. Like banning guns will lower crime but make most people mad at you. Doing these things changes how amny people will vote for you. There are also many fun little gimicks added in that make the game more interesting, like the threat counter. If you do something to make one group mad the threat counter raises for them and evetualy they might assassinate you.Now do I like the game? Well its kind of a mixed bag.Pros:- Interesting gameplay- Fun gimicks- Sense of humor- Great cause and effect systemCons:- Repetetive- Too easy- Bad tutorial Verdict: Good game but wait till its like 10 dollars.

Killer drones, crazy spy agencies, and let's not forget TAXES!An AMAZING strategy simulation! A must have for anyone that is remotely interested in politics or just enjoys single player strategy games. The developers are also AMAZING! If there is ever a problem, they actually work with you and communicate what they are doing. They make sure you know that you are important as a customer and that they take their products seriously and back them 110%! (If you don't beleive me, take a look at the forums ... see for yourself the amazing amount of interaction and care given)Fair Warning, Democracy 3 is COMPLETELY ADDICTING with or without mods (of which there is a pluthera to enjoy and tinker with). Positech makes great products, and takes seriously complex game processes and makes them user friendly and easy to understand. Long story short, BUY THIS GAME!

												This game is the hilarious of epitome of ""you can't make everyone happy."" Yep. No one will be happy and you most likely will be killed off by the Black Power Group before your next term. But you can tick off the religious peeps because they won't blast your door down and beat your face in, cause you know, they're better than that. They will just pray that you won't alter abortion laws, the death penalty, and other social features that make you question the creators of this game. Democracy 3 in itself is a click and watch the reaction type of game, a bit boring at times, I'd often find myself playing my 3DS whilst waiting for PETA to come bashing my windows in due to my insesitivity towards animal rights. It's a game of balance and realizing that you really can't make ANYONE happy by being a dictatorship full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ But hey, one can try. 7/10			"

												This is an interesting game that gives you a good perspective on the challenges of managing a country. It is definitely biased toward liberal polices, so that will either be a plus or minus depending on how you lean. Spoiler alert: Winning formula. The easy formula to this game is to drastically reduce military spending and increase social programs (education, welfare). I win every time with this strategy. I've also tried to implement a more conservative approach, but even with a 91% approval rating, I get assasinated by a liberal group every time. If you buy the game, you just have to know going in that you need to play with a liberal and socialist mind set. I'd give the game 3/5 stars because it is interesting, but no more because it only works with a tax and spend strategy.			"

												This is going to take some time to explain, So let me start out with the basics and gradually move up into the meat of this.I've played this game for about 130+ hours as i write this comment. Its a really fascinating game, a game that teaches a lot about how the world works. You start with a country of your choosing and you are given the task of managing your country towards a direction of your choosing. It has an extremely simplistic interface that is easy to understand and requires you to take a lot into account including GDP, Productivity, Poverty, terrorism, voter appeasement, cabinet appeasement and the like. The complexity of the game is vast, and there are so many combinations of sets of policies that you can inact that directs your country in particular directions.The game has a huge amount of information that you can look up to help you. Charts, Voter Groups, Policy Satisfaction, Income and Expenditure related policies, and statistics. You don't always have to look at this stuff, but it definitely helps if you do. the smallest of details can in the long run, set you on a path of financial disaster, or economical stability. If you have ever heard of The Butterfly Effect, then this game is a fantastic example of it.The game is both about Socialists, Capitalists, Liberals, Conservatives, Religious, Commuters, State Employees etc and yet at the same time not really. No one wants taxation but everyone wants food stamps. Everyone loves Jobs but no one likes Automation. This game will teach you things about yourself, your limitations, the power of the people, the power of the government and your willingness to think outside of the box. It will teach you about the differences and simularities between Tyranny and Benevolence, Freedom and Security, Economy and Society. This is a game that you will either love or hate, it can be rewarding or frustrating, and if you hate it, well, 'thats Democracy'.			"

												Amazing game that really sums up the frustration that goes behind being president. Only downfall I see is the tuturial is given via a box with text, that can sometimes cover up some of the screen you are meant to see. This does not break the game, but can make an inconvienence as you cannot move the box. and it covers some of what it is telling you about. Still fun, Played as if I was Herman Cain and got assassinated by liberals.			"

												Politics, democracy, sounds dull doesn’t it...well if you said no it sounds good I'm sorry, but if you said yes then this game could be a path for you to care. Democracy 3 is in the long series of being an awesome political simulator and I only came into getting it at this stage as the previous games weren't much to look at aesthetically. This game is simple to learn, yet difficult to master and you'll be throwing your mouse (wants you've ripped it from the wired socket) out in frustration to the nearest Nick Clegg dart board photo that you see when you're thrown out of office, dead or alive. Replay-ability, thankfully, is very good in this game and it needs to be so it’s not too bad when you lose in voting, but you may take it to heart if you are killed (just saying). The originality in this game is great thus standing out against other political simulators and its Democracy predecessors. Everything is simple and fun, no difficult looking information, just sliders and buttons to control things, which gives it the term 'modernised' that comes to stylistic games that are best suited to current trends. It’s hard to stop stating all the good stuff in this game because it’s just so nice visually and in execution, but to summarise here is a list:-Style-Controls-General feel of the game-Power-Information-Country selection-Data-Ministers-Core game mechanics-Realism-Situations-Developing modding communityNow this game has some problems and sadly most of them come from its good qualities. First off the simplicity of the game makes any action pumped gamer weep as nothing quick ever happens, this is a slow game which gives its excitement feelings slowly, in fairly good amounts though. This can be a turn off for casual gamers who want a quick fix and the action oriented gamer too. The other sad flaw is the way it shows its data off and the 'focus group' that represent randomly generated people kind of sucks. They attempt to give you a further in depth view into the voters, but the way they show their information is either unorganised or simply difficult to focus on (they should change the focus group name into a randomly generated views group). These features are ultimately its downfall for me as they just don't work. I usually wait till the voting results come in to see cool information in one page that provides simple percentages for key things e.g. crime, bus transportation (this stuff can be found whenever, but I like to see it at the vote bit since that’s when everything you've done through the terms is counted).To summarise the bad points for this game are--Simplistic features-Poor community and a slowly progressive modding community-Unorganised, poorly executed graphs and focus groupsI would recommend this game quite quickly to anyone, but I know that most of my friends wouldn't get it due to it being costly and since they aren't keen on the genre either I wouldn't waste their time, however I know a great free one that’s different, yet still good- http://www.nationstates.net/page=faq#generalNation States- even my friends would get that, but sadly ditched it after a week. I feel sorry for their countries which have been in an apocalypse for some time now.That game has some benefits over this one--Its free-Big community, over a million consistent members-On a browser, so doesn’t take up any space on one’s computer-Consistent news and improvements-Strong forum-One can create a nation-Great forumsTo finish I would say Democracy 3 is a great improvement, but some of its biggest strengths (some new, some old) are some of its biggest flaws, especially for casual and action gamers, but its great design and core features make it a great, deep (excluding controls), meaningful experience that really makes you want to try again and again after every assassination and lost election. Although there are others out there this games originality and style make it stand out greatly from the crowed and as a result makes it truly great and that is why I am giving it a 4/5 or 9/10 or 89%.

												This game is unfinished, Before you start raging at me in the comments allow me to explain.Elections: It barly scratchs the surface of what winning an election is. I've seen entire games based on just elections. At the end of every term in office you get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bar chart that shows howmany votes you got. Theres no debates, No promises or edicts thats you say you will impliment into the country. Nope its just how well you've done during the term. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Murica: Does it mention states? Nope. Can states decide on there gun laws? Nope. States do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ Countrys: There are only a select few countrys in the game. The only difference they make to the game is there population.I would like to see diffrent styles of running a country depending on which counrty it is. for example states, provinces, Ect.You can't please everyone: It's impossible trust me.Military Action with other countrys: Can you start wars with super powers like russia? Nope. Alougth i understand this is not a war simulation game and a country simulations it would still be a step forward to add wars., The only use for military is for taking down terrorists.Final verdict: 6/10, The game is a big let down and a lot more could be done to improve it. I would hate to see what 1 and 2 looked like :P "

The only policy I implemented was the deport a group of individuals who were being smuggled into our country illegally, and the black power group managed to assassinate me. If real life were like this game, our society would be in anarchy 24/7, because groups who didn't like a policy would just assassinate their leaders (because that's such an easy thing to do).

												Definitely not what I expected from a ""deep simulation"" of democracy.I bought it because I liked the concept that everything influences everything and that you gotta keep balance on everything. This is a huge plus of the game, while I found the rest more or less disappointing.After some rounds you find yourself just clicking from turn to turn (each turn equals 3 months) to gain more political influence, which you can use to introduce new policies. That is quite monotonous, since nothing really happens except for some decisions you gotta make (i.e. allow fracking yes / no; appoint a more open-minded / conservative judge, etc...).What disturbs me most is that it does not really reflect the way a democracy works, at least not how I perceive it. In the beginning you can choose the country you want to gouvern, that slightly changes the starting circumstances, but no matter which country I choose, I get the feeling that the system of Democracy 3 is influenced a lot by the American ""democracy"". There will be only 2 parties and as the ""ruler"" you have the full power over the political system. You do not have to justify towards your party. I expected that as a leader of a socialist party my party members would punish me for abolishing social welfare, but that does not happen. Furthermore, since you always need to get the majority of votes, you are obligated to make moderate politics (which makes the extremism extension quite useless imo).The last thing is that the game is really easy. The first election is always difficult to win, but since most policies have more positive than negative influence and you can introduce more and more of them, from the second election up to the future I won with >95% of the votes (which is completely unrealistic). The economy is not THAT easy to handle, but it is possible and as long as you don't lose yourself in debts, it's okay and not punished very much.Overall, the game has some nice ideas and features, is overall quite well balanced, but lacks depth and what I thought would be ""endless possibilities"".

												Look, look, I wanted to like this game. Who wouldn't? Controling policies and governing a country sounds fun. But the game is ridiculously easy. With practically no effort I LITERALLY eradicated crime, health problems, and poverty. What? The UI in this game gets a lot of attention, and, while it is slick-looking, it is barely functional. When you pop into a submenu to take a look at a tax or policy, you have to click the REVERT CHANGE button after tinkering with it. Apparently pressing X on the window means ""confirm change"" to the developers. Such clunky design. It is impossible to know what policies will do/affect until you implement them. On the policy screen your only hints are a vaguely worded paragraph, ""Wow, farmers would sure love some crop subsidies"" but I'm magically supposed to guess it will♥♥♥♥♥♥off capitalits? Maybe you could say ""Sure, that's a given, of course it will."" But many have esoteric by products such as maybe it lowers the membership of the capitalist group. You can't guess this stuff and a bar that says what percent of your constituency will like the new policy is not enough of a hint as to the effects of a policy. Don't get me started on assassinations. Extremely frustrating mechanic, and once a group decides it wants to kill you, you basically just have a few turns left in the game with no recourse. Fun.♥♥♥♥♥♥off any group enough and they will magically find a splinter group to kill you, even, say, farmers or parents. ♥♥♥♥ that. And, sure, you can turn it off from the options menu, but what type of concession is that? They're practically admitting the mechanic is broken. This game is moderately fun in a Civ-esque way, and maybe it's worth a buck or two to try it if it's ever HEAVILY discounted in a sale... But, as is, this game is just not good.			"

												Potentially good game, however, I do think there are too few countries to choose from and there is little distinction between them. The only main ones is the overall finances and starting policies.I have managed to get 87% of voters in USA and 95% of voters in Germany using the exact same policies while making steady progress to freeing the country of debt which make choosing a different country somewhat irrelevant.An improvement would be if there were some kind of international mode. Like, other countries were controlled by the AI and you could chose to help them financially or hinder them. For example, you could choose to get Germany out of debt which would improve relations, lower the cost of importing goods from them slightly and help stabilize the Europe but would make UK feel betrayed slightly. If one nation feels too deeply offended by you they would incite civil unrest (something you could do to another nation) and try to have you ousted which would raise crime and anti-government sentiment or even invoke terrorism. Also, how you treat your own people will have an effect. For example, if they see your hostility towards Canada as a negative thing, they will respond with crime and anti-government actions or if they approve of your relationship with Australia, response to certain contraversial issues would be lower.I can bearly recommend it because it is bland to look at and gets boring aftr a while, but if you like making decisions with consequences - or if you just want to see how good you'd be as a leader, go for it. If not, keep scrolling.			"

												this game consists of clicking on words and sliding bars, or choosing yes or no about some policy.  After the latest patch, its consistantly crashing when you hit next turn.  The dev's don't know why its crashing, so they asked for people to download a beta version with a debug option, and send in that info.  seems the debug version doesn't crash, so basically the programmers don't know what they are doing for this game.  Its been 40+ days and counting and they cannot fix a bug that makes the game unplayable.  That hasn't stopped them from putting out 3 DLC that you must have in order to get 100% achievement in this game, not that you feasibly can.For Achievement hunters who don't like to cheat, there are achievements in this game that are next to impossible to get.   Even before using any DLC for those achievements.So, to summarize:1) buggy and crashes often without using beta-version2) dlc required to 100% game3) almost impossible achievement req cheating to 100%recommend getting this game on a sale.  This game shouldn't be priced over $20 imho.  I paid $6.24 for it.			"

There are many groups of voters and many competing and interacting influences - the main screen that you play from shows a huge network of nodes, each node a policy which, if you hover over it, shows its incoming and outgoing influences.  Sounds complicated.  It isn't.  I just went full-pelt Green Party environmental, liberal socialism, made some smart choices by accident and got re-elected.  Got re-elected a second time.  I was raking in the achievements, approval ratings consistently >70% and the economy perfectly in the black.  I ended up getting assassinated by capitalist terrorists!Next I will delve into the HUGE number of addons on the Steam Workshop.			"

												This is an ambitious game, despite its admitted flaws. After all, this is a political simulator, making it difficult to account for all of the variables that go into politics. One obvious example, is this game doesn't take into account appearances, the way a candidate speaks, etc.What is here, however, is a surprisingly in-depth political sim that treats every voter like a rational actor. Taking that at face value, the game has plenty to offer. It is just as fun to carefully micro-manage your country from the brink of fiscal ruin as it is to watch the assassination attempts pile up should you make embarrassingly awful decisions.All in all, I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of the game, but I'd recommend picking it up in a Steam sale.7.5/10			"

For sure, the engine allows you to shapen your society but you should take your steps gently. As long as you don't attempt a revolution and care about the majority, you may manage to survive during the elections easily.Democracy 3 isn't as good as I expected but it is still pretty good to understand how balance of power works.I got this game as a gift but I must admit that spending more than 10 USD would be stupid.My Rating: 7/10.

To enjoy this game, you have to enjoy knowing that moving that slider has just gotten rid of organized crime in France or that your policy has just created a military police state.  While it is fun to try and balance your policies to appeal to everyone, the most fun in this game comes from trying to create extreme societies without getting assassinated.			"

												Pretty easy to understand and get around. Since there is a free demo, I suggest you try it out first. However I recommend that you get it on sale, I do not think it is worth the retail price of $24.99 (I got it on a sale). It is fun for a while (6 hours for me). It is still in my library so I may play a bit more of it but it is currently unlikely. That aside, I spent that much time over a couple of days because I wanted to get to know the system more. The simulation is indeed have depth to it as well as a fun aspect; however if the game really represented the real world, then I have removed the US debt and made all the available countries happy within two or three terms.Steam workshop is available within this simulator.Rating - 6.86/10			"

												I spent two terms and turned the environment around, increased police presence while increasing police oversight to sharply limit both crime and police abuse, and killed the income tax, the corporate income tax, and the debt by replacing both taxes with several smaller social-ill-linked taxes like an alcohol tax, a carbon tax, a petrol tax, and a junk food tax.  In the months before my second term came to an end, employment was up, health was up, crime was down, and I was cutting taxes because I didn't have much else to do; I was thinking I just needed one more term to turn the country into a technological leader as well.Then I got shot in the head by an angry farmer.

												Democracy 3 is a political simulator by Positech Games. You are charged with running a nation, choosing policies and balancing the budget to appease various voter groups while positioning yourself for re-election (or surviving assassintation attempts.)Democracy 3 can seem a little intimidating at first, where the game is introduced to you with a rapid fire tutorial that can be an overwhelming fact dump. It gives you very useful information, but since the style of gameplay is uncommon, it can be a lot to learn all at once. As soon as you go through a few turns, which are each a quarter of a year, you will start getting the grasp of what you need to do. I would recommend considering starting over after you get the hang of it, because I found myself wasting turns while I was trying to comprehend what I was doing.Gameplay consists mainly of choosing yes or no on policies, and using sliders on expenditures and incomes to balance your budget. Every policy choice and slider movement will have an effect on your voting populace, usually benefitting one group while harming another. The amount of moves you can every turn is decided by your political capital, points you are given for the loyalty and experience of your cabinet. You can reshuffle your cabinet or just fire individual ministers if you see that their values no longer match up with yours.The graphics and music are not really the selling points of a game like this, but they are adequate. Democracy 3 manages to put a lot of information on your screen, and it is done in an aethestically pleasing way.I recommend Democracy 3. I got it on sale, and I think the $25 price tag may be a bit much, especially since the amount of nations you can choose from is quite small. There is workshop support, so more have been added by the community, but I would have liked to have seen more official ones with a bit more variety. This game has gone on sale in the past, and I feel like it is worth adding to your library. A game for me lasted about 2-3 hours, and I think I might try 1 or 2 more nations and approaches before I put this away.Grade: B			"

												This game teaches you probably 1/3 of what you will learn in a standard civics and economics class. It teaches you that you can't actually govern america by being a good person and doing whats best for the people. It gives you awareness about many political debates of the modern day as well as some that have yet to be given media attention like Polyamorous  marriages. This game shows how you can't simply change any one policy, that everything affects other things in a whole bunch of ways and that you will always need to keep your budget in mind if you want to stay out of a major deficit. I highly recommend this game to any who have interest in being aware of the political debates and want to know what its like to be doing the impossible task of trying to please a whole country that has unfortunately been somewhat subject to American values in their recent years.

So I purchased it.I downloaded it, started it up, and I was almost disappointed. Look at that interface, this isn't what I thought it would be. But I preservered, and it actually is a great game. There are a lot of factors that makes you truly appreciate what politicans do, or think of them more critically now that you know how it is. I actually think that politicans should be required to play this game. That would be cool to watch.There are a lot of options. Assasinations, ghettos, those little things you have to make decisions about that pop up every single turn and benefit, or negatively benefit you. Those do start to repeat after a while.

												this game consists of clicking on words and sliding bars, or choosing yes or no about some policy.  After the latest patch, its consistantly crashing when you hit next turn.  The dev's don't know why its crashing, so they asked for people to download a beta version with a debug option, and send in that info.  seems the debug version doesn't crash, so basically the programmers don't know what they are doing for this game.  Its been 40+ days and counting and they cannot fix a bug that makes the game unplayable.  That hasn't stopped them from putting out 3 DLC that you must have in order to get 100% achievement in this game, not that you feasibly can.For Achievement hunters who don't like to cheat, there are achievements in this game that are next to impossible to get.   Even before using any DLC for those achievements.So, to summarize:1) buggy and crashes often without using beta-version2) dlc required to 100% game3) almost impossible achievement req cheating to 100%recommend getting this game on a sale.  This game shouldn't be priced over $20 imho.  I paid $6.24 for it.			"

Though the game does have a few questionable policy consequences, and makes itself seem to be much more complex than it really is - you could ""win"" the game without ever looking at focus groups-  , the true fun of the game is modelling the country to the your hourly whim. Want to make a socialist utopia? You can do it. Want to make a conservative paradise? You can do that, too. Want to create a liberal bastion? You betcha. Want to actually try to fix a country? Prepare for imminent assissination. One thing to note, however, is that the game is not very difficult to ""win"", that is, making all changes to the country positive, so it may feel repititve to those who want a challenging way to fix their favorite, or least favorite, country. It also lacks any actual politics, and may seem boring to those who want to battle for control against other parties. Ultimately, it is a game where the player decides how he or she wants to play the game, to the health or ruin of the nation he or she plays over. Democracy 3 is, in my books, a great game. PS: the little lightbulb in the right corner of the game UI is where you can implement new policies. It took me 5 hours of playing the game to realize what it was.			"

												great game. you can have the wealthiest nation in the world, with the best workforce. Then, the educated and efficient workforce can unanimously decide to leave your country, tanking your GDP. then, your entire economy collapses, then when you fix the interior economy, the exterior economy collapses, and you end up 7 trillion in debt, then no one will do business with you, but you need the GDP to fix your economy, but because of the collapse leaving your nation in debt, no one wants to deal with you. then a conundrum that has no solution ends up defaulting your governmnet, and a group of rich industrialists siezes power, and you are ousted. that was my first save. even when all goes well, your country can be dissolved due to bad luck.

												A very interesting and enjoyable political simulator. The mechanics of the game are easy enough to learn. An experienced player can have one heck of a game. (Note: Do not try to establish a new world order based on evolution and science. When I tried to do that, I was blown into little sticky pieces.) This game's only major flaw, which is the same flaw that plagues games such as Space Engineers and Town of Salem, is the fact that only certain people or groups of people can enjoy it properly. Thus, I shall give it a recommendation, but notice that said recommendation should be used with caution.Score: 8/10			"

But I feel that it is my duty, having played the game and experienced the fatal flaw, to report said flaw. The game is an absolute blast for the first game you play. But shortly after you realize that it gets repetitive and just not fun in general. You have to buy the DLC to keep yourself excited, but even that gets old. Look, it's a good game, but the re-playability just isn't there at this time.			"

												I really used to like this game, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it, were it not for the way it's been updated recently. Originally, the game was pretty straight-forward, you allocate your government budget by inacting new regulations and laws, and generally make decisions. It was somewhat lacking in realism (for example, most of your government spending yielded constant returns in whatever field you were spending them, so the millionth Euro you invested in education raised your population's education level by just as much as each of the first tenthousand Euros you spent).Nonetheless, as far as games go, it was a nice minigame, although it got repetitive as soon as you had figured out a strategy that works that you just had to slightly adjust for each country (strategy here meaning more or less the order in which you enact certain reforms and laws), but it stayed entertaining.And then, it was updated. The developer apparently tries to keep up with current events and tries to integrate them in the game, so, apparently inspired by the junior doctors' strike in England, the possibility of your health sector employees striking was introduced (or it was there before and the threshold for it was severely lowered), so now, when you have a European type of government with large government sector, your health staff won't stop striking until you've allocated almost the possible maximum amount of money into health, which is rather annoying.But while the doctors' strike is kind of ignorable and only a bit annoying, general strikes were also introduced (that or again, the threshold for them happening was severely lowered), and if you play with any other country than the US now, you are more or less guarenteed to have a general strike which totally screws up your economy, and is more than just a bit annoying. And it is, by the by, also a bit unrealistic, because if there were general strikes in developed countries at the same frequency at which they occur in this game, no one would ever be working.And while it was a nice idea to make the game more challenging, since it was updated it is just so extremely unrealistic that it isn't fun anymore (""Oh, you increased the police force instead of putting ALL your budget into benefits? Sorry, that's a general strike."")			"

												This game is pretty good, however you will need an interest in politics to get a true feel for this game.In Democracy 3, you can control a variety of different countries and run them however you want. In the process of making policies that fit your views or aims, you must appease the masses and bring a juggling act of reducing income tax, but then upping poll roads, or something along those lines. Whilst it has aspects of realism in it, it is by no means a complete government simulator. But nevertheless, it is a wonderful game for you to put some hours into if you feel like creating a capitalist/communist utopia, then getting assassinated by your rivals! Overall, its a cool little game, but get it while its on sale. 7/10			"

There is little in the way of opposition, but I will discount it by saying that for $8.50 the amount of realistic simulation was good. As for the fun, unless you define fun as ""manaically forging strange states from the ashes"", then I don't think this game is very fun. That being said, the developers are actively releasing DLC for it and I think that resolving the fact that the game is not very realistic can be solved easily.

												This game teaches you probably 1/3 of what you will learn in a standard civics and economics class. It teaches you that you can't actually govern america by being a good person and doing whats best for the people. It gives you awareness about many political debates of the modern day as well as some that have yet to be given media attention like Polyamorous  marriages. This game shows how you can't simply change any one policy, that everything affects other things in a whole bunch of ways and that you will always need to keep your budget in mind if you want to stay out of a major deficit. I highly recommend this game to any who have interest in being aware of the political debates and want to know what its like to be doing the impossible task of trying to please a whole country that has unfortunately been somewhat subject to American values in their recent years.

One day I was browsing around Steam, as I'm liable to do. I saw this game. I checked it out, it was fairly cheap, and it had a good, nay, great basis. So I purchased it.I downloaded it, started it up, and I was almost disappointed. Look at that interface, this isn't what I thought it would be. But I preservered, and it actually is a great game. There are a lot of factors that makes you truly appreciate what politicans do, or think of them more critically now that you know how it is. I actually think that politicans should be required to play this game. That would be cool to watch.There are a lot of options. Assasinations, ghettos, those little things you have to make decisions about that pop up every single turn and benefit, or negatively benefit you. Those do start to repeat after a while.

												This is a great game. If you think you can be a beter president or prime minister than the real life current one, this is for you. However, when playing, I realized you can't make a detailed political sim objectively. What I mean is, when I made guns more legal, the result was more crime, which, of course, is very arguable. If you're not very socialist or liberal, you might not enjoy this game as much as someone who is, but none the less, you'll still like it. There are other things that can stop crime, though: Better education is one. However, providing students with their own laptops will cost a fortune, so you'll have to raise taxes to afford it. That, in turn, will upset the socialists or capitalists, depending on whose taxes you raise, which might affect your vote outcome in the next term. It's a very complex game than I'd reccommend to anyone interested in politics.			"

												I don't have anything witty or funny to say about my actions and what they lead to in this game but you can tell by the amount of hours I've played that I am starting to become more interested in politics because of this game. It's not a 100% reality simulator, but, it gives you a good idea about the infrastructure of politics and what type of person is allied with whom and you can figure out what type of person you are politically by playing this game. One thing I noticed is I am having a horrible time fixing USA's problem with homeless people. I really want to help them but USA is so broken I'm having a hard time fixing it. Good game and I got it on a sale so I got MUCH more out of my money than I thought I would. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game. It's a nice simulator. I figured I could either buy a hamburger or I could buy this game, I'm glad I chose this game.			"

												So I bought this game during the winter sale and it was for 6 dollars from its usual 30 dollars (a fantastic deal for a fantastic game. I had not heard of anything about this game other than that it's user reviews were extremely high and it's genre tags were what I was interested in. Going in knowing nothing I was VERY overwhelmed and that is an inevitability for someone who equally doesn't know the mechanics about this game. It's a game of graphs, paragraphs, and statistics as you try and run a country of your choosing. You must appeal to many different types of voters of your choosing through the use of implementing policies each turn (each turn is a quarter of a year ingame). You will need to do this if you want to be re-elected for another term. You must try to do this for as long as possible or you can choose to have a limit to the amount of terms you serve (therefore a definite end to your game). It tracks through your actions if your more conservative, liberal, socialist, capitolist, etc. All of this is fascinating. But by far my favorite thing about this game is its interface. It's very sleek, neat, while complex at the same time. The game has a pretty good tutorial which I highly recommend going through rather than skipping it (I did that on my first try and I regretted it). Know that you will never please all of your voter groups and this can lead to a potential assassinations along the line. Even though this game can seem very overwhelming at first glance, once you beat the learning curve, it is highly addicting and an actual fun way to learn more about political systems (even for people like me who hate politics). 10/10.

												A friend got this for me (the version you get from their website) some time ago. I must have put hundreds of hours into it. Now that I saw it on steam, I had to get it. It's a wonderful little game for those interested in politics. The interface is very well done, and (mostly) allows you to see exactly what is contribuing to, or taking away from, a problem. Now, this is no geo-political simulator, so don't think you will pass politology, or that you are the new dawn of politics because you played this, but it does often give a realistic account of what a given law or policy would have an impact on. I highly disagree with people that play this as a game to get numbers up. That is so dry and boring. Numbers. What's better is implementing the policy that you yourself agree with, and then looking for ways to make it work, or suffering the consequences. I definitely recommend also getting mods if you are going to play this. The stock game is good, but mods make it even better.However, a few WORDS OF CAUTION: 1. There is no war. There's military spending that affects things like your GDP, foregn relations and trade, and some mods add war-like events, but there are no actual war mechanics. This is not a war game. 2. Trade is a statistic. Don't think you will be signing contracts. International trade is a value dependent on things such as your military spending and foreign relations, that boosts your GDP, hence you get more money to spend.3. It might not be very realistic at times. As good of a propagandist as you are, I don't belive you can completely remove religious people, liberals, conservatives, socialists, or any other group (nobody is in them) from a country within 4 years. In fact I doubt it can ever be done. 4. You can at times see the biases of game creators. For instance, if you are a proponent of gun rights, a school shooting event takes place, that gives you negative stats, and it's description nudges you twoards what it thinks is the cause of the school shooting - your lax gun laws. Of course, I would expect nothing more. The game is, after all, made by a human, and all humans have their biases, and most laws are pretty neutral.Overall, I recommend this game and I really enjoy it.  "

												TL/DRNot a realistic politcal simulator, in my opinion, but it is fun once you realize it's a game and not real life. Overall, I would rate it as follows:GAMEPLAY/REALISM:  (6/10) As stated above, not a completely realistic simulation but still enjoyable. Can be quite the challenge, watch out for fringe assassination groups. Also, it seems your own cabinet members are a challenge to appease. GRAPHICS/PRESENTATION:  (6/10) Very straightforward text based game with Solid layout that is very easy to navigate. Artwork is simple yet suites the game well. OVERALL: (6/10) A solid game that offers plenty of options to fulfill one’s desire to lead a country to their liking. Not without room for improvement but enjoyable none the less. If you like political simulation games this should appease your desire to lead a nation, but don’t expect too much.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At first I disliked Democracy 3, having been assassinated three times in a row my frustration was growing exponentially. I suppose I came into the game with ideas of grandeur that were slightly unrealistic. Who wouldn’t want the deficit lowered to the point that it became a surplus and the general quality of life improved? Apparently it’s not that important. This makes the game challenging and that’s a “good” thing. GAMEPLAY/REALISMThe game is not overly complex but many issues are interconnected appropriately and increase the difficulty of the game. The game has a spider diagram with all issues and policies. Upon highlighting an issue or policy the interconnected nature is displayed, i.e. increasing the Petrol tax will gain influence with Environmentalist but will negatively affect middle income families due to the direct increase to their cost of living. Frankly, it’s setup well to easily navigate between many different issues to change the country for the better or appease a particular political group. In regards to artificial intelligence, I seriously doubt that it would be so easy to assassinate a leader of a country, especially a large one like the US. Also, I have a problem with the frequency of cabinet members becoming dissatisfied with executive policy to the point that they step down. Having an option to establish your platform at the beginning of the game would probably fix this and would be a beneficial addition in my opinion. I suppose there is an element of this based on the party you select but it’s not customizable. For the most part, all major policies and issues are covered. It is very easy to customize budget allocation and political preferences, i.e. lowering spending on military or increasing corporate taxes. Overall, the game is very fluid but in many ways it’s not realistic. It seems the best strategy is one of balance between the different political factions. Sadly, it seem all you do is try to appease everyone to survive, literally. GRAPHICS/PRESENTATIONSimple yet fluid, with a plethora of information displayed in an easy to read format. I can’t say that the graphics were very complex or cutting edge but they suited the game well enough to not become a distraction to gameplay. Overall, the graphics don’t really matter and the presentation of the game is excellent. OVERALLThe game could be much better, but it does offers enough to satisfy most political simulation fans.  I can’t say it’s realistic but it isn’t simple either. It is very satisfying to erase a deficit or completely abolish crime, but the repercussions of political change seems overly skewed towards minority political groups. In the end it’s more about surviving by appeasing and less about political progression. This really holds the game back from being an outstanding political simulation game. I realize that the designers wanted a difficult game, because political issue are very complex and impactful on life, but a missing element is the ability to persuade and inspire your virtual citizens.

												While the interface is simple to use and easy to master, the game itself is deceptively complex and incredibly fun to play. It's more of an economic equilibrium model than a political similuator but the ability to implement controversial policies (educational emphasis on creationism/evolution, abortion laws, conscription, legalisation of weed/pills/harder narcotics) and essentially determine the character of your chosen nation (UK, France, US, Germany, Canada or Australia in order of difficulty) makes for a highly rewarding experience. An absolute must for politics, economics or law students.			"

												This game has both pros and cons. I'll start by telling you how pretty much every game goes (at least for me). At the very beginning, you are put right smack in the middle of a multitude of problems within your country's borders and must immediately think of how to work towards making these problems disappear. You are often faced with budget issues and must keep every group in your country relatively happy. Of course, you will always just go with what you believe in (or at least I did) and you will be assassinated by someone after about a term and a half despite the fact that you managed to make half a dozen problems such as drug addiction, alchohol abuse, pollution, and etc. disappear. This is how every one of my 20 or so games have gone aside from the 4 or 5 times it crashed and the autosave doesn't even work. This makes you furious and makes you hate the game for about 12 hours, only to reel you back in to try something a little bit differently.Here's a few short pros and cons.Pros:1. Very organized and very easy to play despite its complexity and how in-depth it actually goes.2. Has a massive selection of ideas of how to play the game.3. Has great graphics.4. Let's you have the freedom to do what you want to play the game.Cons:1. It gets too easy after a few terms. The very few games that I wasn't assaassinated, I eventually just got bored and started a new save after I had a surplus in the budget and all problems were solved.2. The game gives you a very unrealistic amount of power.3. Honestly, I think democracy needs even more detail. The game's already massive amount of detail is not quite there yet. I don't know what's missing, but it's definitely there.4. CRASHES CRASHES CRASHES!Please keep in mind that the 27 (and counting) hours I've played of this is without any DLC.Overall, 8/10 would be assassinated by liberals and the ""Crusaders of the Lord"" again.

												Democracy 3 is an amazing game if you enjoy politics or just want to see how good you are at running a country. It gives a feeling that's so unique when you destroy that debt and reduce the deficit. It provides a reward that no other game, the game didn't hold your hand when you did it, you did it yourself. This game gives that feeling and is extremely rewarding when you win that election.

												Ever wanted to be the president or prime minister or your country? Ever wanted to play a game that simulates being an actual politician? Well, this game will be very injoyable for you. I myself have never really been interested in politics however I always found the idea of a game centered around being a political leader of a country very promising. Anyway, I always manage to♥♥♥♥♥♥of the capitalists or nuns with most choices I make, this game provides you with many issues the country is facing such as police, health, drugs, tax, etc. and you are tasked with fixing them or either ignore them. Either you will fail in the next election, get assasinated (Which mostly happens to me), or actually manage to survive your run as whatever position in the government to were with either many successful choices or terrible choices and have managed to survive without getting killed yet, either way it is an accomplisment. I recommend this game to whoever loves strategy games and get manage various headaches and hardships and still have a good time. 0/5			"

												I am a huge fan of this game. Just so you know there are people out there who dislike how you play this game and just how (not) interactive it is. To me those people dont make sense.1. So the game is generaly for people who either like politics and want a game to see how you as a leader would do in a democracy...or you wish to rule the country you live in with an iron fist.2. You have alot of choices in the game, you can go any way you wish however some ways are better then others unless you want to challange.3. This game is not one where you play for MASSIVE amounts of time like me with Elder Scrolls V or ETW. However a Game or two and you will have enjoyed a great deal of fun.4.This game is not the most interactive but it is SUPER FUN to see just how the citizens react to there new dictato...i mean president and totaly not a guy you spies on them.5. This takes a bit of thinking...you need to know what your gonna do but the interactive sliders and control screen you see in the screenshots is totally easy to figure out.6. so try it yourself its WELL WORTH the money, so welcome Mr. or Mrs president. Lets face it your just gonna put up camaras everywhere and drones, Then institute that everyone needs to be in the Army, or even Wire tap and Spy on with spy tech like the CCCP...this game is awesome...

												You can either take the game seriously and try to follow some form of political viewpoint, i.e. Liberal or Conservative etc. Or you can just run a complete big brother state with ridiculously censored policies. The game is very difficult to begin with and the first few terms always consist of you trying to pay back the countries deficit that you selected. From then on is where you get to show your political alignment with a vast choice of policies that some will love and some will hate. It is a balancing act of getting policies done and make change, without angering the populace too much. Interesting game for people that are into politics, other than that, do not bother.			"

												Democracy 3 is an amazing game if you enjoy politics or just want to see how good you are at running a country. It gives a feeling that's so unique when you destroy that debt and reduce the deficit. It provides a reward that no other game, the game didn't hold your hand when you did it, you did it yourself. This game gives that feeling and is extremely rewarding when you win that election. At times you will fail but if you try hard enough you will rise and at those points you then realise how rewarding democracy is. It's all about perseverance.			"

												This game has both pros and cons. I'll start by telling you how pretty much every game goes (at least for me). At the very beginning, you are put right smack in the middle of a multitude of problems within your country's borders and must immediately think of how to work towards making these problems disappear. You are often faced with budget issues and must keep every group in your country relatively happy. Of course, you will always just go with what you believe in (or at least I did) and you will be assassinated by someone after about a term and a half despite the fact that you managed to make half a dozen problems such as drug addiction, alchohol abuse, pollution, and etc. disappear. This is how every one of my 20 or so games have gone aside from the 4 or 5 times it crashed and the autosave doesn't even work. This makes you furious and makes you hate the game for about 12 hours, only to reel you back in to try something a little bit differently.Here's a few short pros and cons.Pros:1. Very organized and very easy to play despite its complexity and how in-depth it actually goes.2. Has a massive selection of ideas of how to play the game.3. Has great graphics.4. Let's you have the freedom to do what you want to play the game.Cons:1. It gets too easy after a few terms. The very few games that I wasn't assaassinated, I eventually just got bored and started a new save after I had a surplus in the budget and all problems were solved.2. The game gives you a very unrealistic amount of power.3. Honestly, I think democracy needs even more detail. The game's already massive amount of detail is not quite there yet. I don't know what's missing, but it's definitely there.4. CRASHES CRASHES CRASHES!Please keep in mind that the 27 (and counting) hours I've played of this is without any DLC.Overall, 8/10 would be assassinated by liberals and the ""Crusaders of the Lord"" again.

												I really like the idea of the game. The simulation has some really interesting aspects and displays the complexitiy of decision making. But the game has sadly so many problems and flaws and needs a lot of love by the developers to be considered worth the money. Translations into German are partly missing, typos all over, my elections always end with the complete population being non-voters, I'm asked to comment on the Monarch of France or Germany (wtf?), etc. Also the dualistic party system doesn't represent countries like Germany properly and is thus not even close to a simulation which displays reality. As I said, I love the idea and I see a lot of potential in the game, but not in the current setting. Please rework and update and I will happily change my review!			"

												I assume the reader is vaguely familiar with the game mechanics.  If not, go watch a youtube video or so...The problem with making a game about things which are hotly debated matters of public policy is that the player does something expecting one thing to happen but the designer programmed in another consequence and it's not clear which one makes more sense.  Of course, the devs tried to compensate for that by tellling you what does what in the menu, but that just complicates things (and hot damn, is it confusing to read).  These things should be simple and obvious, that's the hallmark of good design. "

												I honestly thought, I'd play this game alot more, than what turned out to happen. I have launched it once and played through a full ""mission"". That is also the reason for the negative review. The game is priced fairly high considering it's feature set, and my unit of measure in terms of reviews is always whether I feel like I've gotten enough good hours of entertainment for the cost. The game does what it says on the box, but it is *way* oversimplistic and this removes any hint of difficulty. For my very first play through, I managed to built an ""ideal"" nation that scored high in pretty much every aspect. I also got reelected over and over. While an interesting concept, many of the ""challenges"" that the game showcase seems to not really exist within the actual game. The video for instance talks about your ministering doing something and how you might have to go back on a few election promises. That never really seems to happen. You also never seem to struggle with simple things like getting support from your government, and the consequence of every decision is clear in every detail when you decide, so there's never any ""Oh, so if I increase funding for this, it actually has an unfortunate sideeffect""-kinda moment. With that said, while this isn't arcade by any measure, calling it simulation seems a bit of a stretch too. And in any case, either I'm a political mastermind (waaay unlikely), or this game is just plain and simple too easy to keep the player challenged and interested.			"

												It is not a grand strategy with overwhelming number of things that you can take care of. There is a lot of numbers and statistics, but most of them are less important than the few that make a diiference.Generaly it is fun to play and makes me always want to play ""just one more turn"". On the other hand it is rather quick gameplay. You can sort things out in few terms and fine-tuning a good working state is less fun (but still a little fun)			"

												Its a fun spreadsheet game, but its pretty easy to ""solve"" the optimal policy settings to just win the game every time.  Once you figure that out you've basically beaten the game and there isn't much left to do.  Ultimately that affects how much value you get from the game.  It took me a little bit under 4 hours to do, and I don't think that 4 hours of gameplay is worth $25.  However, the game goes on sale a lot and right now is $5.  I'd say at $5 the game is worth it if you like spreadsheet games.  You can probably get some value out of it at up to $10.  Past that I don't think its worth it.			"

												Too expensive ideal world socialist utopia generator. Would be ok at 7-9$ but still hard to take seriously in terms of political management.It's really nice work on part of the devs but still quite a bit of a caricature. Everything is too smooth and predictable, it lacks any sense of the utter chaos, constant pressure and systemic corruption inherent to anything democratic. Democracies are pretty much circuses, yet in this game democracy feels like a sterilized laboratory. "

												Lots of typos, bugs, shutdowns and glitches, and unexplained important aspects of the game indiscernable on your own or to the greater community at large (I searched forums in a few instances and no one had any clue what was going on). I've only played this game as long as I have because I'm intrigued by it as a beginner programmer myself, but, if not for that, I would've stopped playing this game about 15 minutes in. You set some policies, those policies affect statistics, and those statistics generate random events. It's a game of ""what policy affects this?"" and that's about it. I took one C++ course, and I probably could've made this myself. It's hardly strategy so much as following the dots backwards to the issue and attempting to solve it... and it's too boring to bother solving it. I like what the creators were attempting, but government is more complicated than this. Some things are too random, some things aren't random enough, and this game was (and still is) in desperate need of beta testers and proofreaders.			"

What do I do now? Nothing else happens except for a minor -0.03 drop in GDP which make me laught since I have a huge stash of cash deposited.

												A fun little game of politics. For me, there's nothing better than reconstructing the foundation of a country's society in order to fix it. Sure, it's a game of graphs and policies and some thinking and a lot of reading. If this isn't your thing then I'd vacate the page ASAP. I love it though. The policies are interesting, the graphs are useful and I love when I achieve a Socialist nation that doesn't believe in religion. Hell, the flipside is interesting too! Making a police-state, that's a crazy Theocracy. It's a fun challenge to do it, and it might be somewhat repetitive but I'm okay with that. For vanilla, 9/10 for sure. The workshop makes it a 10/10 for me.			"

If I don't get assassinated again, I might complete all the badges. LOL Silly conservatives, guns arent for you.			"

												You look at charts, and you make decisions. It's fun, because everything is connected and it requires you to think.  However, after a while of playing, you feel you've seen all scenarios you're going to see.I miss a bit more variations in situations that I have a limited control over - and I miss an ""end game"".

												The Democracy series caters to a different sort of gamer. Some of my friends will jokingly call this ""Spreadsheet: The Game"" due to the overabundance of sliders, graphs, charts and percentages as opposed to gunfire, action, suspense, etc. This is not Civ, this doesn't involve empire building, you do not need to construct additional pylons, no troop movements, no resource management, no leveling up. What you do get is an engaging political simulator that allows you to play out your political machinations while dealing with the needs, wants and goals of a diverse populace spread across a variety of interest groups. Balance risk & reward, weigh the options, implementing sweeping reforms or minor tweaks, combat obesity or pollution or lack of intelligent workforce, create a socialist paradise or a police state full of chipped & tracked citizens, get shot by extremist liberals or gun-toting patriots. Overall its a wonderful and engaging game but if you've never played a Democracy game before then I would highly suggest finding a friend with a copy and trying it out first before buying.			"

There are tons of mods for Democracy 3.The only problem I really have is the price, The game should be worth 15 not 25 Without any DLC.It was definatley worth the $8 I payed on the summer sale.If you are a political nuthead get the game.It is real fun and on sale is definatley worth it!8==============D			"

												A very easy time-sink.  The game revolves around manipulating a complicated-looking set of statistics through the use of sliders in order to achieve your vision, whilst keeping each faction happy enough to:a) Vote for you, andb) Not assassinate you.To begin with, this can be pretty difficult- particularly balancing your ideology with your budget - but as the game goes on your country becomes more and more stable and the difficulty drops away.  That doesn't stop it from being engaging, though, as it's also fun to try and change your socialist paradise into a capitalist utopia into a brutal theological police state.While it may seem terrifying to look at initially, how the game works becomes apparent very quickly, and the user-interface is extremely intuitive.  I definitely recommend this one!  Give it a shot.			"

I would give this game a 4.5, because the game does have limited playability (after a long period of time!), but usually, the modding community could supply for that.			"

Posted: August 10, 2014
												The game has surprisingly deep simulation mechanics, which are matched perfectly by the developer's choice of user interface. While the game may appear visually bland, at least to me the interface feels like a brilliant method for visualizing all the current conditions and policies in your country, although of course it does take some time to get used to. After some initial confusion, I never felt again as if though I did not have sufficient information on my country's situation, and therefore never felt as if though I had too little information to make a particular choice. Indeed, the interface itself can produce a bit of a shock initially, but now that I am accustomed to it, I have to recognize its power in providing exactly the information the player needs in a simple and efficient way.Speaking of initial confusion, one of the most noticeable features of the game is that the initial learning curve is very steep. Expect to spend your first few games becoming very unpopular with some political extremist group and repeatedly getting assassinated. I however found the steep learning curve enjoyable - running a country is a massive endeavor, so I don't think the player should be able to guide his/her nation towards becoming a global economic superpower during his/her first try. The main reason for the steep learning curve is unfamiliarity with the way by which all of the game's policies and ""situations"" are linked to each other; ultimately fixing a country's issues in this game requires a balanced and moderate approach, which in turn requires experience of the intricate web-like nature of the game's entities.I have often heard complaints such as ""the game is unbalanced in favor of socialism and European-style welfare states"". I think these complaints stem mainly from players lacking understanding of the way a nation's population works in this game - while the player might consider a policy beneficial to the nation, it doesn't mean the population agrees on that matter. Entirely abolishing public healthcare/education is just as feasible in the game as constructing an absolute welfare state, one just has to consider the political leaning of the nation's populace before making such changes. If 70% of people favor ""socialist"" economic policy over ""capitalist"", obviously creating some sort of ""free market paradise"" will not be easy. And all of the nations featured in the game by default start with a larger percent of the population favoring social welfare rather than an entirely market-based society.Overall, the game is very enjoyable and provides hours of fun, mostly due to how long it takes to actually figure out how the country should be governed. It can also be a fun way to learn to understand how massively interdependent all entities in an economic system are, in addition to getting a basic idea of how some elements of governing a western democracy work in the 21st century. The main issue with the game is that, unlike real life, there isn't after all much variety or randomness in the simulation, meaning that once you've figured out a successful strategy for lifting a nation to greatness, you can basically apply it to each of the nations. At this point the game's difficulty drops off significantly and at least I couldn't really think of much to do with it anymore.			"

												A fun game if you have a strange sense of fun.The entire game is looking at stats, looking at different slider-bars to adjust up or down, and watching the stats change. That is it. It's possible to lose if some of those stats are bad, but once you get to a certain level of understanding what the game is telling you, it's easy to pull off situations where you cannot ""lose"". That is, you can just keep getting elected over and over, and the people support you 100% no matter what you do.That said, the game does give you freedom to do whatever you like. The achievements also reward you for taking certain extremes in the game that you otherwise might never be inclined to do. If you're the type of person who can turn on a ""world creation"" game and enjoy watching what the AI does for a while, you might enjoy this game.If you have played a lot of games by Paradox Interactive (CK2, EU4, Vic2, HoI3) then this offers a nice diversion as it's not as complex and is easier to get into.

												I've said it before, but if you have any friends that love to make unfounded blanket statements about politics, have them play Democracy 3. The game does a fantastic job of displaying the careful balance it can take, and the difficult decisions involved in many parts of occupying a position of power.The new Extremism expansion for Democracy 3 introduces many new policies for appeasing (offending) your citizens, or programs to save your taxpayers money (generate massive amounts of capital for yourself).My experience with the base game was a torrid one. The game is extremely difficult. Your initial instinct to just run wild with the policies you personally think will work to solve all the problems in this country will likely prove massively ineffective quickly, at least in the sense that they'll do what you thought they might while offending a majority of your constituents.You can read on at http://thumbthrone.com/reviews/democracy-3-extremism-dlc-lets-you-go-a-little-mad/ "

												Overall, a great game. One of those that makes you think (in a good way). Reccomended for anyone interested in government or politics. Seeing how everything has an impact- no matter how small it may be really makes you sit there and really think about it.My one gripe with the game is how quickly people hate you and will start violent rebellions.

												If this was marketed as a casual game and sold for about 5 Euro, I would recommend it.But for the current price a couple of things are just not good enough:*) Only some western countries are playable, all quite rich. No eastern european, no asian, no developing country. Why not Poland, Brazil, India or Japan. That would be more interesting than a choice between USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK and Australia.*) Primitive model of society and economy. Complex longterm effects don't appear (or I didn't see it). I stopped playing when the only way to increase the competiveness of my economy was to lower my capital gains tax. Other things like regulations, education level of the workforce, energy costs, infrastructure, etc don't seem to factor in.*) No real planning tools for the budget. I could not see how my policies will affect the bottom line in the long term. But ruining France's credit rating was fun. ;)*) Graphics like a spreadsheet and a lot of buttons with arrows between them. *) No attention to detail. E.g. the ""Evolution vs. Creationism"" controversy mainly happens in the US. It is certainly not an issue in France where religion usually doesn't play a big role in politics and most people are catholic anyway. (The roman catholic church endorses the theory of evolution).On the plus side: *) Very nice game concept. I really like the idea and I hope it gets some improvements.*) Runs on my old laptop.*) Supports Linux.So if they would integrate the content of the ""Social Engineering"" DLC in the main game, polish it and lower the price this game can become quite popular. But if I had paid full price for this I would ask for a refund.			"

												Don't be disguised by this game stating to be ""in depth"". If you look at the core  fundamentals of this game then it is basically based on balancing different bars which just happen to have ""different titles"" to differentiate them. If you find it enjoyable to do this  then sure you will love this game however it got old very quick for me. I continued to play a few more hours hoping that some new developments or gameplay choices would be introduced but it was the same old repetitive balancing of bars.  I found the whole concept of being in control of a nation very interesting which is why i puirchased this game however my choices and policies on different sectors just seem very repeititve and bland and there is no satisfaction in things you implement. Sure I admit i probably suck at this game but do not be fooled into thinking it is some in depth strategy game as it is far from that.			"

												This game is sorta fun, but it pushes many of the cons the elite in the real world are trying to push on us. It is an agenda pusher in my opinion. Some of the mechanics are make believe like global warming and terrorism. The only terrorists are the government funded ones. It takes big bucks to finance a personal terrorist army. The only people with big bucks to spend on that would be the governments themselves and the elite. If it did not have the propaganda included it would be a fun game. The mythological aspects added to it are what ruined it for me.			"

												The game is very confusing and the ups and downs are very radical and unpredictable.. I feel the game is not mechanically sound... I've spent about 15-20 runs on the same country and some random event always happens that screws me over and un-does everything positive that I've done and I never recover.I understand tycoon/business games are meant to be challenging but this is ridiculous. The game does tell you what good and bad each policy does to each group of people, but even though I abide to the game's information, I still get screwed over. It's like some policies have a phantom effect on certain groups and I'm here, head spinning figuring out what the hell's triggering a ""Black Activists Group"" from wanting to kill me when I have done things to help the minorities and the poor. Unless you want to try and figure out this very very unpredictable puzzle, I suggest waiting for a sale.. The game really needs to give more information and feedback than what it does already. Good guides are not easy to come by and you can check the community forum for this game, other people are also pointing out mechanical flaws within the game. I'm all for Indie games but these guys have to do their homework before they release a what seems to me, a semi-broken game.			"

												As a fan of strategy and simulation games, this was quite fun for me. The systems are complex (which you'll see the moment you look at how things are all connected) but after an hour or so the whole thing becomes extremely gameable. Easily-gamed systems means an easy game, once you figure out how to do so. But the fun isn't in the freeform games, it's in the various scenarios you're given (for example rescuing a country from economic devastation, familiar?)I bought this during a past Steam sale for a song, along with the DLC that was available at the time.

												I can't seem to have a presidency that doesn't end in assassination. At first, it was funny, because I figured it was a rare outcome. But as I played more, I kept getting assassinated, no matter what I did. The devs NEED to lower your odds of getting assassinated. On a whole, this game is fun, so just barely I recommend this game. It does loose its appeal quickly, due to the constant assassinations, so maybe wait for a sale, $25 is a bit much for what you get.			"

												Democracy 3 is a game about you guessed it, running a government in the political simulation genre. The overall gist of it is you're the newly elected prime minister/president and you have to implement policies, monitor spending, security threats, etc.I have played it much longer than Steam states so I have clocked up probably closer to 12 hours on the game. Democracy is extremely fun. There is high replayability with seven base countries, but with Steam Workshop, closer to about 30 different countries. Within the gameplay there are factions. Some factions include environmentalists, capitalists, parents, etc. and the policies you implement effect how much of an approval rating each faction provides.The game requires patience through a feature called 'Political Capital'. Political Capital is a system that provides you the government points for policies because different policies require fewer/higher political capital points. This is how the developers basically keep the game going for long periods as you cannot implement everything on one turn. However, you can turn political capital off and play sandbox which is fun.The vanilla game is quite basic in the sense there are all the things for you to do but in the sandbox version, you realise how many little events and situations there are. Another thing is some tabs such as international trade and your policies impact on other countries are just there or ommited, which does suck. Mods to the rescue through Steam workshop though as there are several mods that modify the game.The interface is simple and clean, and the music is solid.I'll be honest, if you're into politics and any sub-field of that such as law, military management, etc. purchase the game. If not, you will probably find this extremely boring. It will take you quite a number of hours to complete the game with all the different countries that have different values and with the factions system, you have to please everyone. I wouldn't recommend full price at $24.99, however I do recommend it at anything under $19.99.Side-note, there are asssassinations. So relating to the factions, I played a runthrough and I went full-out socialist which the capitalists hated me and I got assassintated by them. There is a security briefing section so that tells you about it but hey, greedy pigs.Pros:- Replayability is high.- Good niche product. (Fun for you political people)- Great variety of sections within the government ie; security, policies, funding.- Good developer support and DLC.- Steam workshop.- Very clean interface.- Solid music.Cons:- Full price at $25 is quite high.- Somewhat too basic.- Bugs regarding to crashes occasionally.- Lack of international relations. Note: I would have loved for the game to dive further into international trade but its only a tab, nothing quantifying it.8/10.----Thanks for reading my review!

												If you are a libertarian, avoid this game like the plague.  It is a socialist's wet dream.  By and large, the game penalizes you whenever you try to reduce government and rewards you when you enlarge it.  Policy options are almost always to increase the size of government and/or control people's lives.  There were turns where there wasn't a single reduction policy option.  This game has NOTHING to do with reality and everything to do with the fantasies of control freaks (sociaists, social conservatives, etc.).  Halfway through my first term, I was assassinate and that was the end of me playing this game.  I wish I could get a refund but that's impossible from Steam.			"

												At first glance this game excited me, made me think I could have a joking expirence with a dictator like govement. However, this game is serious, and seriously over priced.Pros.-The game is on sale alot and I got it for a low price.-If you have an intrest in politics you will be slightly intrested in this game.-Has a nice neat layout.Cons.-It took me 1.6 hours untill I had lost all intrest in the game.-Will drain any intrest of politics you may have.-Extreamly over priced-The DLC seemed to actualy limit the game, not expand my expirence. This is becuase I found no quick qay of toggling which DLCs I had active. (I am sure there is a way, but I shouldn't have to ""google it"" when I paid money for the DLC. Furthermore this was a while ago and may of changed since)-The game feels overbaring. You have to learn alot about the games mechanics and read alot of things when you start out, I personally dont mind this but I thought it was worth mentioning.Overall I would not recomend this game. The most enjoyment I got out of it was from roleplaying UKIP and the NAZI party. I'd rate this game arround 4/10 for enjoyment and 1/10 value even when on sale.			"

												It all sounded SO cool... run a country, make the decisions, shape the policies to steer a successful course back from the brink of doom, a really creative and intuitive interface. SO much data-porn!! So clickety click, in I went. And it all started out OK... until I started thinking through the game mechanics, about what their simulation assumptions were. All hard line left. Liberalism, socialism, communism, collectivism... a morass of all of my least favorite ""-isms"". Taking the default starting settings, after a number of hours trying various things, I can literally see no way to ""win"", short of making 100% pro union, pro left, pro populist, guaranteed to ruin any real life country just like it has every single time it's been implemented decisions. Social welfare? Need lots! Unemployment without strings? Got to have it. Free housing? Yup, all in. Police-state level of government control over the population? Obviously, yes. What about tax relief to unshackle the engines of capitalism? Nope, that will bankrupt you. Killing off expensive, leftist policies? No actual way to get more than one or two done, and the effects take so long to soak in you're sacked in no time. And on, and on, and on.Overall, disappointing and exhausting. And if even the barest minimum of the game creators assumptions about how to build this simulation is accurate, it's wildly disheartening. Because that would mean we're screwed when it comes to recovering a free market, personal liberties and personal responsibility, you-are-the-only-limit-to-your-potential kind of society. On the other hand, if you're a fan of the leftist twaddle being peddled by the administrations and the media in nearly every nation today, and you think you'll fare better than the 140,000,000+ dead by communism in the last century (as far as we know), you may just love this game. Until you run out of other people's money and resources. But that is another discussion entirely.I'm uninstalling it.			"

And then black terrorists storm the white house every 3 months trying to kill you.Still, a few things are realistic:Tax the rich 90% of everything they own, earn and think of buying, and they selfishly leave the country, leaving you with poor, low income, workshy masses who are happy to live from unemployment benefits, totally destroying your GDP, education, technology and economy.Too bad you can't raise the berlin wall at that point to stop the rich and educated from leaving your marxist utopia in the making.Really guys, it's for your own good.

												Democracy 3 is fun, but not for very long (although you can keep coming back to it once in a while for casual playing). And it's easy--the same basic strategy works for any country or situation, and you figure pretty much everything out on your first playthrough.As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I had eradicated crime, poverty, pollution, unemployment and racial tensions, reverted economical and technological non-competitivity into hyper-productivity and world-leading technological developments, turned a 1 trillion pounds debt into positive reserves, one of my citizens got a nobel prize thanks to the quality of the educational system I implanted and my approval rate was 100% (yeah, really... better than God's...)Still, the game is fun for a couple of hours each time you decide to play it, and it also made me wonder two things:1 - Is the UK really in such a dump as the game portrays it in it's initial scenario? As Democracy 3 puts it, the UK's situation looks almost half as bad as my own country's...2 - Why the hell am I playing games? I came to learn that, given my administrative skills and political profficiency, I should be ruling Earth or the Milky Way.			"

												If your that guy who likes a fun political game of chain reaction then this is for you.Sadly im not that kind of guy considering how yet it has the feel of being in office and dealing with the needs/wants of the country at the same time it kinda keeps you with boring lookin bubbles and bars and♥♥♥♥♥♥with a white background the whole time. The feel is ""kind of"" there like Nation Policy isnt exactly all ""MOVE THE ARMIES INTO COMPTON AND SHOOT THE BLACK DUDES FOR LOOKING LIKE CRIMINALS"" type of deal and its more like apealing to the religous, the capitalists, the socialits (:3), and the insensitive parents who go all out bezerk with the government (like when their kid sneaks in a copy of Carl on Duty or some sh#t and play for about 1 hour), and other groups of people.The gameplay is basic and really easy to grasp after a few mins of gameplay (if you can read) which is nice for someone like me who found out what he was doing fairly quickly. I found it a bit dull after a while due to the basic lower bar and sh#t happens deal but im just that guy who plays Roamer Soldier in TF2 and just goes f#cking bezerker blood bath on my enemies while im pushing 40 keys at once trying to not die while sweating like hell. But yeah I didnt play a whole game of D3 because I couldnt fall into wanting to play more of it after about 1 hour of gameplay. I had this feel with other games like FNAF where I didnt feel an actuall rush or reason to play other than the fear of a bobbling head in my face with an ear♥♥♥♥♥♥to go with it but im not reveiwing some game about a robot bear. Other than the dull gameplay It still kinda makes me feel like its a really good game but not for me.My final recomendation goes to the people who like a serious but not like the ""FAST REFLEX FPS/MOBA/Srategy"" type of game. Also this can be fun for someone who is into politics like gun control, education, medicince, and the Socialist VS Capitalist (pigs) deal and not the whole shooting heads off people.			"

												It's fun at first, but after a while it becomes a game of sorting through policy suggestions and just implementing the ones that will be most popular with the majority so you get re-elected, but if you anger any minority group they can asassinate you whenever they want despite increased funding for military and police, surely I could invest in some better personal security? The good thing about the game is there are a lot of community mods which can rectify the issues I've mentioned, but I'm not quite sure I could reccomend it having played it as long as I have, it becomes tedious quickly.

												It’s a great concept but at this point it seems more like a graduate thesis or game proposal than actually finished game – it’s more frustrating than fun. Let me give some examples:Start new game with standard settings: my party starts with only 2million members while opposition has 75million. There are no (none that I know of) ways to raise party members or campaign. Whatever, I go through trying my best to implement the most popular policies and adjust current policies to be more popular. 2-3 years of this leads to only the most marginal gains in popularity and no gains in my party population. My cabinet tells me they hate me. Minorities decide they hate me and I’m told of a possible assignation plot – there are no options to crack down on them with CIA or something. Next turn I am told I survived an assassination attempt – again no option to crack down with police or military or whatever. Two turns later I’m told I was assassinated – game over. So fun.Start new game, spend the entire time doing nothing but implementing popular policies and adjusting current policies to be more popular. Do literally everything that the overwhelming majority requests. Squeak by election with less than 1% margin – continue doing the same. Cabinet decides they hate me – populous decides they hate me – made aware of multiple protesting groups and coup-attempts. Loose next election overwhelmingly – so fun.There’s a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of missing controls and a few clunky menus that make these game pretty much unbearable. For instance – income tax: there’s no way to structure it, you can’t set the tiers or manage it at all so no matter what everyone hates it. There’s no way to campaign or raise your parties population or public image. There’s no way to crack down on militants or extremists. As far as I can tell, the game is always limited to a 2 party system and as soon as you are out of power the game is over. And one thing that really irks me is – the only way I have found to adjust current policies is to go into ‘polls’ the select the policies tab, which doesn’t really make sense.Conclusion – get it for $2.99… for the i-pad… and play it on the subway. Never pay full price for this game and don’t expect much more than frustration from it. "

												This looks like a simulator, but this is a game.A simulator would try to be as realistic as possible, and that is already out of the window when creationism vs. evolution is an issue in every country, rather than only the USA.And if you start as america, you have a worldwide educational and technological advantage and still lack qualified workers. And then black terrorists storm the white house every 3 months trying to kill you.Still, a few things are realistic:Tax the rich 90% of everything they own, earn and think of buying, and they selfishly leave the country, leaving you with poor, low income, workshy masses who are happy to live from unemployment benefits, totally destroying your GDP, education, technology and economy.Too bad you can't raise the berlin wall at that point to stop the rich and educated from leaving your marxist utopia in the making.Really guys, it's for your own good. Come back, somebody needs to pay taxes. "

												Bad design choices are horrible bias towards big government policy ruins this game.There are 2 major problems with this game: The ""outside world is having a depression"" thing, and the creators horrible political bias creeping its way into the game. Every now and then you get this message from the game that claims the outside world is in a depression and that it is harming your economy. This will happen often and can crush your economy at no fault of your own regardless of what you did earlier. As a result it is possible to do everything right and still can expelled from office with your country in flames. The second problem is that the creators of the game appear to have basically just decided that anyone who wants to play a small government playstyle can♥♥♥♥♥♥off. I have made half a dozen attempts as many countries, and with with the game settings tuned so that people like socialism less and capitalism more the people in your country will scream for your death if you get rid of social services and lower taxes. I just finished my game as Germany with 1% approval rating. Yes, WITH JUST A SINGLE PERCENT! Why? Because I heavily lowered funds to state schools to get people go to private schools instead. Regardless of if you agree with that in real life or not, seeing your approval vanish like that is stupid and unrealistic. This game isn't good. Avoid.EDIT: Ok, I decided to check out some of the community mods for the game and as it turns out they make the game MUCH more playable and enjoyable. For this reason, I woulld probably feel bad if I still left the game rating as bad. Don't get me wrong, all of the things I said about the game still apply if you play it in its vanilla form, but the mods fix the isse to a large degree. Use the mods and its good fun.			"

												This is  a well designed game that shows the effects of politcal policies and struggles, but it is a bit biased towards social liberalism so that it is almost unplayable with any other sociopolitical system. In general, its actually an interesting and different game and if you are ready to look at texts for hours, then get it! (you should definitely wait for a sale)			"

Pros:*Lets the player immerse itself as a politician. Thus, greater educating the minds of players as close as it can be to world'ś today politicians (no matter how corrupt they be or how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the government may look like).*Focused on ""what should i do if (random disaster) event takes place, and how should I handle it?"" *Game for Law Majors.*Really fun, if one puts its mind into each event or through contemplation via real life.Cons:*At times repetitive, could gradually bore the player before completing 3 year term.*Lacking pseudo-realistic events on certain nationsOverall it is a good simulation game for casually dabbling in politics.

												Interesting that when I play this game the liberals and conservatives hate me.  Kind of like real life, actually. If you govern according to your principles, you are doomed, either to be assassinated or slaughtered in the elections. You have to please the stupid voter, not entirely unlike real life.   The debt goes up.  The voters want more stuff, more regulations but now they don't like the debt you have run.   You have to please everyone, sell out on everything.   Kind of disheartening, but, if you play it, I think you will find that this is more like real life.  Not being the type of person who likes to sell-out, I found the game too depressing.   But well made, thoughtful, although a little naive as to the roles of liberals and conservatives, capitalists and parents. "

												After a good few hours of playing game becomes extrimly easy. I have manged to achive 100% vote rate 6 elections in a raw. Social engenering aspect is too easy. I wanted to creat green paradise so I put crazzy taxes on cars, super heavy restrictions on car usage banning them in most cities. And what happened? Pepeopl start using bikes and public transport. Car users went to 0% in about 3 turns. Noone protested noboduy oposed that. Can you imagin this happening in your coutry?I have increased number of patriots in 3 years by puting flags, singing athmes and banning everything forign. What happened nothing. Noone oposed that. On other occasion playing as great britan I relaxed imigration law and was pro migration like crazy. Ethnic minorities mebership went up to 90% but population stayd constant. How? Did people paint themself black to get benegfits avaliable for etnic minorites or what?On one occasion I was playing wit assasiantions on, I was killed by people oposing death penalty and human right supporters...Also sliders seem not to comunicate with each other propely. I have reduce amout of alcohol consumption to near 1-2% with heavy policing and restrictions. Then I raised alcohol tax and suddenly poor people earnings went down like crazy even though they should not do so as noone was drinking anyway. In under 1 ellection you will be able to reseape composition of a coutry. In 2 ellections it iss possible to change US into the most comunist coutry in the world and people will thank you for it with thier supportive votes. Game is fun to play for few hours but don't be fouled it it not simulator of how to run country. It is nice micromagment game with fun sliders and you will ejoy it but it isn't what advert said and I don'tthink it is worth the money. In my opinion game requires more complex changes to it like other parties having thier say even though being in minority. Imagin that Obama bans all the weapon in US, will oposit party allow it? I don't thing so. In Democracy 3 you can do it in 1st day of your ellection and yes you will loos some votes but noone stops you. With good changes this game has potential to be great			"

Also you may not be able to get the screen resolution to fit your PC so most of the screen will be out of view which means that you can't look at half of the information; if you try to go into the files and enter a custom value, then the game will crash half way through loading the save.

												I love these kind of games but this one is quite poor. The entire game is just slider bars. That's fine if the game is fittingly complex but it isn't. Every slider bar effects certain other bars and it shows you how they will change if you change that. The game is just managing a series of bars and doesn't have an immersive feel in any way. I myself won 5 consecutive elections and unlocked 7 achievements without doing ANYTHING. I just let the game run. The game lacks depth needed for it to be a good political simulator. Regular people wouldn't like this game and people who love political simulators would be left wanting much much more.			"

												It's very easy, you can do anything as long as you do it slowly. The opposition is just a number that don't really play any role, so you can turn a liberal, polluting, capitalist contry into a green, socalist police state and then turn that into a theocracy. IN THREE YEARS! You run out of things to implement pretty quickly, even with the DLCs, so you don't get that much play time.It's not worth 23€ but if you can catch it on sale, then you might aswell buy it, it's not that bad. and you can download new policies pretty easy from the steam workshopi give it 6/10it could sneak up to 8 if it had some more policies build in and an actual opposition.

If you manage to get it for 10 - go for it. I was patient and got it from a bundle. Now I will wait for a discount on the two expansions, while I install and, possibly, create mods.I got assassinated by nuns. With my next game I took care to eradicate religion and now there is not a single believer in Germany.EDIT:Consider the above before I added mods. Steam Workshop saves this game! Sadly, the comparison can be only made AFTER you have seen how many things are missing. Still, I recommend ti.WITH mods it is 8/10; Without mods it is 5/10.			"

												I THOUGHT I was doing great as president of the US, taxes were high, but we were out of debt, and making money.  Polution was on the decline and we finally got past that pesky race issue.  I was unaware, however, of just how angy I made the big corporations.  Aparently they aren't ""American"" enough to pay taxes.  Next thing I know a high tech sniper rifle slung a bullet through my head.  Whoops.  Don't mess with the Big boys. I think my attempts will be better starting in UK.So far an interesting game.  I think it is in a good place, but with time, will get even better.  This assumes the developers are planning on building out with more expansions as they have started doing.  This game has so much data to digest it's great, and for those that like strategy, but hate the mysical black box that some games have, this clearly shows how everything in the game interacts.  Then it's sort of like flipping switches on a wall and seeing what happens in the next room.  Here's a Laundry list of things I'd like to see in the future (I'm no modder or I would try this myself since the system looks really easy for modding, maybe I will!).  Dirty Politics: I would love to see some dirty politics options or at least ""harder core"" options.  I should be able to blackmail my opponent, run smear campaigns, I should be able to (in extreme cases) have people taken out.  If I'm able to be assassinated (seems like a really tough thing to do these days) I should also be able to take out either the people in uprising constiuencies or, if I want, my competition or at least try to.  I want to be able to blackmail my own cabinet, house of cards style.   Conspiracy Nut: I would like to be able to fake invasion attempts or fake attack my nation and start a huge war overseas in order to build nationalism.  Would be great to fake UFO landings or something to hide excessive military spending. Develop mind control gas that you can put in airplanes to make the people more complacent.  OR just fake it all :D  "

												Basically it let's you see the world as leader... From my point of view it gives a good understanding how everything works together, even though some aspects are missing. For example are enviromental impacts far too small.It's a pretty funny ""simulator"" of what politics do and why... maybe in order to get your own♥♥♥♥♥up and do something.. or appreciate what is being done			"

												This game is highly inaccurate, unrealistic, and often just plain ridiculous. This game is best described as a half-hearted attempt at producing something similar to propaganda, a political sandbox sim it is; taking place in a dystopian brainwashed political pundit fantasy world. Nearly all actions are responded to in a very a black and white manner. This game lacks character and depth for the amount of money I spent on it and I'm really dissapointed that I wasted my money on this title expecting anything less. Some mods can create more balance, think before you buy!			"

												The idea of the game is great, but the execution feels a bit, well, old. The interface is a bit confusing (closing a window of the quarterly report for example will not get you back to that report) and cluttered with seemlingly randomly positioned icons. It is quite a bit overwhelming in the beginning, although there is a nice tutorial. I like the basic mechnisms of the game, but it becomes boring quite quickly. It is good, but definately not worth the high price asked for, unfortunately.			"

												This game was unrealistic, and fairly dull. I was annoyed that the only options were white, mostly English speaking countries, because it made the populations very similar and took away the challenge of catering to the interests of a certain group.There was only so much you could do, and generally had to go a certain route to keep people happy, which led to lack of replay value in individual countries.Also, one of my gameplays I went a more libertarian route. I had previously been assasinated, so with the rising threat of a religious group I added policies that went against the gameplay style in order to protect myself.  I was very popular but still assasinated, which I found ridiculous because as a single person I could have an armed guard and other cheaper, less invasive and expensive policies to protect myself. I realize the point of the game is that you do need to make compromises but wouldn't terrorist attacks on my citizens be a more likely outcome? The game really needed intrigue. The advisors lacked subtlely and beyond the political capital, added little to the game. I would have preferred a setup more like Crusader Kings where I could become personally involved with my cabinet, perhaps do them favors which would increase their loyalty but potentially harm my reputation. Perhaps my cabinet members could form their own cabals and run against me if I strayed too far from their interests. I am so happy I got this on sale for $6 because $24 is a ridiculously high price.			"

												This game is incredibly frustrating.  It's perhaps one of the most infuriating (and depressing) games I've ever played.  My politcal goals just don't work anywhere in the game.  Everytime I play I end up getting assassinated by (usually) capitalist-funded groups.  It's actually really disappointing, because I feel like this game really does have potential.  Perhaps it's because the game focuses on real-life politics?  I'm not really sure.  I think I was just expecting something different when I bought this game.  (On sale; this game is definitely not worth the full price, if you do want to buy it.)  I just really wanted to be able to turn the countries I played into the truly free (of debt, inequality, homelessness, crime, ect.) utopias I know they can be.  I guess it was just too much to hope for.			"

												I just bought this with the Humble Mozilla Bundle for $8.  At $8 the game is well priced.  There is roughly 15 to 30 hours of replayability from what I can tell after playing for 4 hours (although I have played the Democracy 2 demo before, so I already knew what strategy I was going to use mostly).  I just beat the campaign playing as the United States.In my book, a 15-30 hour game is worth about $5-$10.  Your mileage may vary.What did surprise me was how effectively the game does suck me in - even though I was doing the same thing over and over again.  There is a rogue-like element of getting assissinated repeatedly until you learn how to deal with the terrorist groups to keep them less unhappy.  That, and the economy, are the majority of the game.			"

												Fun and interesting, I've been thinking about it since I stopped playing.  Part of what's interesting about it, though, is also what stops me from wanting to play much more than one full session: the biases of the designers.One example is that in my last play through, I got hit with massive brain drain.  The only two causes that would have directly lowered this would have been eliminating income and luxury tax, since I already had them low.  I'm pretty sure there are other factors that influence brain drain (like executive orders against immigrants, or, in the other direction, creation of high tech jobs).  Another, which didn't hurt gameplay as much but was just kind of silly was the effects of drug legalization. Legalizing marijuana, in the game, increases the crime rate... which seems debatable at best. But then the next step up was legalizing LSD, which in the game drastically increases crime and addiction (???).  Then after that is full legalization, which is a bizarre sequence.I did like that implementing Welfare Fraud Detection cost billions but only saved millions, and was ridiculously popular with voters.  This is a pretty deep game and there's a lot to poke around in and experiment with.			"

												Great fun to play and wonderfully engaging. Could probably use a bit more depth, as many policies seem pre-biased and/or remarkably binary solutions to complex issues. That said, mods can fix many of those problems. All-in-all, great fun to mess around with - particularly the semi-ludicrous reasons you get assassinated occasionally. My particular favourite is having four factions trying to assassinate me for literally building Utopia.			"

This game is pretty hard at first until you get the hang of it.

												I THOUGHT I was doing great as president of the US, taxes were high, but we were out of debt, and making money.  Polution was on the decline and we finally got past that pesky race issue.  I was unaware, however, of just how angy I made the big corporations.  Aparently they aren't ""American"" enough to pay taxes.  Next thing I know a high tech sniper rifle slung a bullet through my head.  Whoops.  Don't mess with the Big boys. I think my attempts will be better starting in UK.So far an interesting game.  I think it is in a good place, but with time, will get even better.  This assumes the developers are planning on building out with more expansions as they have started doing.  This game has so much data to digest it's great, and for those that like strategy, but hate the mysical black box that some games have, this clearly shows how everything in the game interacts.  Then it's sort of like flipping switches on a wall and seeing what happens in the next room.  Here's a Laundry list of things I'd like to see in the future (I'm no modder or I would try this myself since the system looks really easy for modding, maybe I will!).  Dirty Politics: I would love to see some dirty politics options or at least ""harder core"" options.  I should be able to blackmail my opponent, run smear campaigns, I should be able to (in extreme cases) have people taken out.  If I'm able to be assassinated (seems like a really tough thing to do these days) I should also be able to take out either the people in uprising constiuencies or, if I want, my competition or at least try to.  I want to be able to blackmail my own cabinet, house of cards style.   Conspiracy Nut: I would like to be able to fake invasion attempts or fake attack my nation and start a huge war overseas in order to build nationalism.  Would be great to fake UFO landings or something to hide excessive military spending. Develop mind control gas that you can put in airplanes to make the people more complacent.  OR just fake it all :D  "

												This game is highly inaccurate, unrealistic, and often just plain ridiculous. This game is best described as a half-hearted attempt at producing something similar to propaganda, a political sandbox sim it is; taking place in a dystopian brainwashed political pundit fantasy world. Nearly all actions are responded to in a very a black and white manner. This game lacks character and depth for the amount of money I spent on it and I'm really dissapointed that I wasted my money on this title expecting anything less.

												Goverment sim? Sounds fun! I found this game very interesting. They do throw a lot of information at you, but they present it in a way that is simple and easy to understand. You may want to play according to your political views, but that would probably cause you to either get assassinated, or lose the election. This game is pretty hard at first until you get the hang of it. You probably will think through some of the choices, like abortion, military spending, religon, labor laws, deporting terrorists, who to please, and who to ignore.			"

												I THOUGHT I was doing great as president of the US, taxes were high, but we were out of debt, and making money.  Polution was on the decline and we finally got past that pesky race issue.  I was unaware, however, of just how angy I made the big corporations.  Aparently they aren't ""American"" enough to pay taxes.  Next thing I know a high tech sniper rifle slung a bullet through my head.  Whoops.  Don't mess with the Big boys. I think my attempts will be better starting in UK.So far an interesting game.  I think it is in a good place, but with time, will get even better.  This assumes the developers are planning on building out with more expansions as they have started doing.  This game has so much data to digest it's great, and for those that like strategy, but hate the mysical black box that some games have, this clearly shows how everything in the game interacts.  Then it's sort of like flipping switches on a wall and seeing what happens in the next room.  Here's a Laundry list of things I'd like to see in the future (I'm no modder or I would try this myself since the system looks really easy for modding, maybe I will!).  Dirty Politics: I would love to see some dirty politics options or at least ""harder core"" options.  I should be able to blackmail my opponent, run smear campaigns, I should be able to (in extreme cases) have people taken out.

												Now im canadian, I had just done a HUGE project for my class about the politics of canada. I look at this game and think ""hmm, political simulator. Now i can prove that I AM a better prime minister than steven harper."" I start playing. I almost instantly realize a couple of things. First, theres no Bloc Quebecois. Not insanely bad but still an anoyance. As time goes on I realize that this is NOTHING like a politic simulator for canada. Theres no House of commons or senate to stop me from doing whatever i want. The game is near impossible to understand. Also aparrently my country HATES me when everyone is happy and were not in debt BUT when i am HATED beyond belief and were in debt over a billion dollars, they love me and i am in for a second term. I dont get money from donations and people in canada wouldnt assasinate me ESPACIALLY RELIGEOUS PEOPLE. Theres only two parties, in reality in canada i believe theres about 26 or 27. 5 that are actually voted for. The tutorial is crap so i have no idea what im doing half the time. If i was american, i might have diferent feelings about this game but i still would deem it unplayable. No matter what i do, i am hated (or liked i still dont understand really) and i dont know if poverty is going down or up. I would like a full refund for this game but i cant get that so I will tell you right now. This game was on sale for 15$ and i still call it a rip-off. Don't get this game or you will be almost thoroughly dissapointed. Unless you know nothing about politics, but dont go to this for a politic simulator or anything really. If you are willing to look through the internet for an hour to learn how to play this game, be my guest. But you will still be disapointed if you buy it.			"

												- Many of the features are poorly implemented.- The country selection only changes population and economy size, but doesn't reflect policy in those countries. For example, if you pick Australia, policies such as both Creationism and Evolution being taught is the same as when you pick USA.- The premise of the game is that you start having just won the election and this is your first term. Why is it then that you start with a 0% popularity and no membership of your party?- No matter what else you do, if you decide that teaching creationism in school and outlawing abortion is a bad idea, and hell, while you're at it legalise same sex marriages, you WILL be assassinated by an extremist religious fringe group. The last time a Prime Minister was assassinated? Never. The U.K.? Never. France? Not since before WWII.- How can you justify releasing updates for the PC month after month, but not your Mac version? What was the point in releasing a Mac version? I really suggest you don't buy this game. If you love supporting Indie games, there are plenty of better titles out there than this tripe, worst money I've spent on Indie games, ever.			"

												Far better than the previous iteration, Democracy 3 feels much more complex to tame. Simply increasing healthcare spending and Education spending wont be enough this time (although it will go a long way), many problems require a more nuanced approach. The standard 100% difficulty does seem to actually be easy mode (Britain starts with a budget surplus) so I would recommend playing at 150% difficulty as it's a better representation of the real world. They fixed the infernal assasination system since the last game, so you can run a long living government to your hearts content.			"

												I liked this game...for about 10 minutes.I was low on money so I raised the corporation taxes. The Battenburg Group assassinated me.I decided I was going to spend money on border controls. Soon after that Liberals assassinated me.There was high unemployment so I decided to abolish alcohol and tobacco laws and taxes. Suddenly there was crime everywhere and the conservatives hated me, so I spent money on police, which made the liberals hate me and the conservatives still hated me. I got 11% of the votes on the election.Overall, this game is boring. I would not recommend it.			"

												- Many of the features are poorly implemented.- The country selection only changes population and economy size, but doesn't reflect policy in those countries. For example, if you pick Australia, policies such as both Creationism and Evolution being taught is the same as when you pick USA.- The premise of the game is that you start having just won the election and this is your first term. Why is it then that you start with a 0% popularity and no membership of your party?- No matter what else you do, if you decide that teaching creationism in school and outlawing abortion is a bad idea, and hell, while you're at it legalise same sex marriages, you WILL be assassinated by an extremist religious fringe group. The last time a Prime Minister was assassinated? Never. The U.K.? Never. France? Not since before WWII.- How can you justify releasing updates for the PC month after month, but not your Mac version? What was the point in releasing a Mac version? I really suggest you don't buy this game. If you love supporting Indie games, there are plenty of better titles out there than this tripe, worst money I've spent on Indie games, ever.			"

												FULL REVIEW AVAILABLE AT:http://consolesandkeyboards.wordpress.com/2014/02/08/democracy-3-positech-pc/Democracy 3 gives you the chance to run a country and affect the many lives you are responsible for over a whole host of variants including labour laws, taxes, the environment and education. Playing as the newly elected leader of government, you have a limited amount of time and political capital to fix the societal issues and stay popular enough to get voted back in for another term. This is a game for anyone who has ever said they could do a better job than the current government, and shows the difficulty in holding popularity amongst the various political and social groups. The new DLC for Democracy 3 implements twenty six new policies and eight new dilemmas, increasing the growing complexity of running a country.			"

												If you want to be a president or dictator of a country, try this game.  Democracy 3 offers a variety of challenges to the player, which may include: riots, homelessness, credit downgrades, etc.  Each challenge takes patience, skill and the right choices to remediate the given issues.  In addition, you can implement various decisions, which will change the views of your citizens.  Being able to make your citizens happy is one of many concerns, which will go through your mind while playing.This game is a pure political simulator.  Do not expect graphics like in shooters, this game offers many flow charts and data screens, which can be a bit overwhelming at first.  You can easily find out which decisions may influence specific groups and at times one decision could make your population so unhappy, you could be assassinated over it.DLC is always controversial and if you opt not to purchase it, this will not affect your initial gameplay experience but will make this game less replayable.  Replayability is a big factor when deciding on purchasing Democracy 3.  Through the game itself there are not many nations to play from and depending on your thoughts on DLC purchases this may affect your opinion. This game does have a modding community so you can download extra nations if you wish.The only negatives:  The nation immersion and music.  I honestly did not feel I was in control my specified nation like America, France etc.  The only nuances you felt were the currency and the starting point of your nation but since the music and displays looked the same for each nation.  Additionally, I wish you had the ability to create diplomatic ties with outside nations and create a trading system to boost the economy.7/10 - Based on buying 1 DLC.			"

												This game demonstrates that a politicans job is no easy one. Having a degree in Economics and Finance I thought I would easily bring my country to flourish. Instead, I was assassinated. This is an interesting strategy game where experimentation is key. You set your own objectives on how you want your country run. Legalizing drugs and lowering taxes may make you popular and boost your economy, but then you may find yourself in debt and with other problems. It looks simpler than it is.It's pretty obvious if you will like this sort of game just by looking at the pictures on the steam store. Long live the free markets!			"

												So, first I disabled assassinations...honestly, I dont think I've been this head-shot this often since the first few sessions of CounterStrike.  Perhapse its my undying love of grassy knolls and Our American Cousin, but I was getting murdered an awful lot.Anyways, once I did that, I got down to the business of running this country into the ground.  No, wait, that was Great Britian. As POTUS I managed to eradicate Creationism, balance the budget, see the country through a global recession, and make America a global tech leader.  All without cutting military spending.And then I tried playing as a dystopian tyrant in Great Britain; removing the drinking age entirely and then introducing a crippling alcohol tax, creating near-universal unemployment, a massive wealth gap, outlawing abortion and Evolution, and eradicating vitually all crime by introducing draconian police and security measures.However, unlike David Cameron, I wasnt re-elected.

												This game has taught me to never get into politics in fear of being assassinated. But also that there are a lot, and I mean A LOT of factors a president must be aware of 24/7, such as education and crime. Not only this, but you have to do your best to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible, and no matter what you do, you can't win them all.With that being said, I recommend giving this game a try, I got annoyed by the fact I kept on being assassinated, so I guess I should never enter the world of politics, ha-ha!

												I would not recommend this game at the price I paid (£18.00).  If you can get it for about £6.00 it would be worth it. This game is enough to spend about 10 hours on then it becomes dull.  On 100% difficulty it is too easy (91% election results), on 130% it is impossible. You are trillions in debt within a few turns and the economy face plants with the first turn.While I like the idea  of this game there is simply something... missing... Yes the screens and graphics are interesting to start with, they soon become monotonous to the extreme. There are no interaction with other countries, its like you are the only nation on earth. The only thing you know of other countries is how much they drag your economy down when the global stock market free falls every few turns. Running a country is just not a case of throwing money at policies like this forces you to believe.There are a few areas which irritate me as well.  I like the idea of a technologically advanced and educated country, so I always invest heavily in these areas but like the hybrid cars policy.. this should reduce CO2 emissions right?  Wrong. Cheaper hybrid cars increases the number of cars on the roads which the game then presumes is bad for the environment so your CO2 in-fact increases over time! If Superpower 2 was on Steam, I would have brought that for quarter of the price.			"

												Interesting game, very bare bones and numbers heavy. As a game, I'll say it fails, it's not very entertaining, doesn't tell a story, doesn't have production values. Feel like there is only one level (all the scenarios play the same). A 3d visualization of the cause-and-effect graph that's the core of the game would make it a little easier to grok.Overall, I enjoyed this for an hour or two, and thought it was somewhat expensive for what it does.

												There are certain fundemental flaws. If you get something like braindead, trying to remove braindead is impossible. So you end up having not to give a f*** because if not you will go bankrupt. Also no matter what you do you will be attempted assasinated after a couple of terms. I realize you can't please all, but the fact that you are either assasinated by a liberal or a religious is complete bogus. They probably added it to make the game harder, and it became harder. Once 1 group is trying to kill you, you are screwed. Because if you deminish their group, then another opposite group will come after you.			"

This is not fun, this is not challanging, nothing is happening, why i am playing this. After the last one i simply stopped and thought what else fun i could have done with my twenty euros and wouldnt you know it the time spent thinking about that was more fun then this game.			"

												Welcome to Democracy 3, where you either get bored or assassinated.You see, unless you ramp up your security service funding to the highest possible amount, you'll be shot whatever ideology you choose to take (in this case I was continuously pestered by an extremist Christian organisation and an ultra-libertarian organisation). Too bad that your security service effectiveness can randomly deteriorate and never seems to go higher than a drab 'Adequate'. And if you get through all this, you'll soon find that you'll have a large budget surplus, everyone loves you and the terrible lack of available policies drain away by the minute. This is when the boredom sets in, as all that is needed to do is click the nice blue button at the top right.Democracy 3 seems to delude itself into thinking it's in depth; instead it grows tired after just one week - really it should be named Dictatorship 3.

												This is by far one of the poorest AI written games I have ever seen. Some countries it is almost impossible to lose with. Other Countries, no matter what steps you take you always end up assassinated. As far as being in charge and having no actual way to defend yourself with policies that do not seem to how any affect. I have maximized the Police force spy network and policies that benefit the the parties that are angry there are no actual changes happening. Save your money do not buy this game and if I could demand my money back I would. This game is poorly made and you can see they favor certain countries over others.

												As other commentators have pointed out, you are really more of a dictator than a democraticly-elected leader. And the options are fairly simplistic. As long as you abide by the standard Democrat/Republican party lines, then you will succeed. If you want to play outside that, as a libertarian or socialist or a mix, then you are destined to lose badly in the election. Because a lot of the policies and how they  relate to voters seem off. Lowering taxes or running a surplus seem to have very minimal impact on voters. Implementing something small such as free school lunches seem to have more of an effect. And really, the gameplay is such that by the time the election gets around, you've already done everything you pretty much wanted to do anyways. Being reelected would just mean a continuation of the policies you've already enacted. So, more often you'll probably play to see how much stuff you can do before you get tossed out of office.Democracy 3 is almost there, yet so far away.			"

												You play the exact same seed every time, even with random seeding. The only way to change what happens in the game is with the difficulty sliders. Every game starts with the same problems and stats. Judging by the reviews, I'd say that this is the experience most people are getting. If you don't believe me, try playing a couple games with the same settings and make the same decisions (unless you're looking to buy this, in which case, DON'T).I don't think they meant to do this - it seems everybody has a different random game. Some are easy, some are impossible. Mine unfortunately ends after about 6 turns playing America, and honestly, do you really want to be a different country?I paid a sale price for this and the 3 expansions, I still think the $15 was too much money for something I could've written myself when I was in high school. Actually I wrote a tank-shooter as a semester project, and it was more fun.Summary:- DEVELOPERS NEED TO FIX random game seeds - but they probably won't because it's the style of the time- Too expensive - it's pretty the same as playing with a spreadsheet. $A2=(POPULATIONxINCOME)... except they did some nifty buttons and graphs.- It would be nice to see some scenery, like beautiful tropical island nation or something			"

												This is based on a recent game of democracy 3, playing as modded Scotland, Its meant for entiertaiment only! :) Sitting in his office politican Flazam recieves news, Scotland has voted for Independence by 36% to 35% and you have been appointed leader.Flazam was worried, such a close vote had led to a split in society and breaking away from the union had had strong impacts on GDP with are credit rating dropping faster than Skyrliexs new album. During Flazams first year as prime minister, it was decided military spending should be cut, and this money is to be invested in to education and science to build the future generation, Flazam began to introduce new policy and cut old policy, Flazam was become very popular amoung the socialists in my electorate. Sitting in his office reading the news Flazam is suddenly shocked as his deputy Gabe Newell, blasts through the door, Gabe told Flazam, 2 things that a mediterian island had been invaded, I nodded sadly, he then informed me that because of this the steam sale would be cancelled, slowly lowering his class""get out"" Flazam screamed.""no"" Gabe replied forcefully, ""Fine"" Flazam rebukedTwo security guards grab Gabe procuding to beat him up and through him out of the building ""the cake is a lie"" he screams as his body smacks the pavement. Gabe was popular amound the captalists, and the patriots whom were sad about losing the island, but presumbly more sad that there would be no steam sale, set up a terroist group calling themselves the ""battenburg group"". Flazam went to vist open a new airport, the day was going well and the sun was shining, suddenly bullet fill the air, Flazam is knocked down to the ground in a grenade explosian, Flazams loyal body guards return fire. The body guards fight of the gun men, as the gun men retreat, the guards capture one, pulling of his mask.""Gabe Newell!"" The guards shout.Flazam pulls himself up from the ground wiping the blood of his lip. ""I would of got away with it, if it wasn't for you meddli..."" Gaben sentence is cut short as Flazam deals a punch to his face, and Gaben is dragged away by the guards. Now the election was looming and Flazam had learnt one thing recently, 3 is not a number and captalists can't be trusted. Flazam decided to increase police funding, and began to enforce more anti captalist legislation. The weeks progressed with more assisination attempts from captalists happening often the election was looming, and Flazam was polling well, his socialist utopia was progressing well, and the people adored him for his legalisation of prostition.The Election day came and an impressive 82% voted for Flazam.11/10 would establish neo-marxism again			"

												Lots of unleashed potentialD3 is a good game, but it could be a great one if the dev spends a little more time polishing it. It has some nice features, and is enjoyable for a few hours, but there are some things that ruin the game:a) no matter what you do, you'll get assassinated. Honestly, how often do we get that IRL? Presidents are impeached more often than they are assassinated (just look at what happened in Brazil!). b) the starting country makes very little difference on the voters mindset and political costs. Bannig guns should have different weights in the USA or Australia, but in the game they are the same thingc) There should more 3rd world (or developing) countries, because these offer some economial and social challenges that would greatly differ from the 1st world economies the gamne offersd) there should be other ways for a president to leave office other than assassination, such as impeachment, a coup d'etat or a foreign invasionIf the developer does polish this game just a bit more, it has everything need to be a great game.

												Highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in political science and government. It has its flaws however, but its nothing too severe. I was assassinated like 6 six times but I was able to resume my game and continue playing. Was I now the VP or did the assassination just never happen since I resumed the game after I was directed to the main menu? Also, why was I assassinated so many times? Socialists and liberals hated me but I had really good numbers with everyone else. In elections, I got an overwhelming majority from them as they voted for me instead of their own party, but I guess their splinter factions didn't feel the same way. I didn't want to make a police state, but I felt like I had to introduce wire tapping, drone surveillance, and heavily funded police just to stop from being assassinated every other turn. Also the game autocrashed on me a lot but there is an easy fix that is stickied in the steam discussion forums for this game.			"

												Too simple, and too boring.The political capital idea is lame and limits the player's choices per turn.Wouldnt it be better to have a real Parliament/Congress made up of different AI voting with their own settings on stuff instead of this simplified political capital thing?The ideas for policies are not that great, and it would be better if users can craft their own ideas instead of using cliche presets that everyone already know what's going to happen next.The game does not allow the player to change the money supply type, be it precious metals backed, fractional reserve, zero reserve, or whatever scam somebody can come up with next. Money makes the world go round, and as Mayer Amschel Rothschild once said, ""I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply"". How a game that tries to simulate the complexity of ruling a country not take this into account is mind boggling.And lets not forget that this game conveniently excludes another important field when it comes to controlling a country: The power to declare wars, sign treaties, and alliances with foreign countries.Like I said, this is too simple and too boring. I bought this game and its DLCs looking for a challenge, but I got bored by child's play instead.Oh yes, and what do you call a group when it is 100% of the population? YES, it's called the ""majority"", not ""minority"". Also, it is damn frustrating to have immigration, and yet the population number does not increase but is REPLACED instead.This makes absolutely no sense.			"

												This isn't really a game, just a manifesto of the creators political values encoded as a 'cause and effect' structure. It has 0 replayability, all countries are basically the same.  The model is super simplistic and very direct for example: strict alcohol law --> less alcohol consumption --> less alcohol abuse --> less crime. All countries start with alcohol abuse which is automatically solved if you bother to make alcohol law stricter. It's unrealistic: Religion is bad for science, but by teaching evolution only, you get rid of all religious people in 1-2 terms. Patriotism is bad - it leads to racial tensions. Everything is clear cut and simple like that, no finesse at all.The fact the political views promoted by the game largely overlap my own doesn't make up for this not being a game, not being challanging or interesting or in any way varied. I feel like it's still not done, years after release.All mods debalance this to make it increadibly east or impossibly 'hard'.			"

Different countries have different forms of government and different constituents wanting different things.

												Fabolous game for those who are interested in public policies. I couldn't tell how realistic the events, stats and the effects of your decisions are, but it's certainly a complex gameplay. And when you start understanding the decision engine behind the curtains, you can always set the difficulty higher or download mods to find new challeneges.Graphics are not impressive, like in city building or role play games, but suit the purpose of the game. The main screen will be easily navigable after a couple of minutes playing and there is no time pressure to make quick moves as the game play is turn based.This is practically a single player board game with a computer in the background calculating the effects of your moves.

Worse is I too am part of the Liberal Party. Crime, Violent Crime, and Organized Crime are at lowest level, 0. No gun allowed for public.I know Liberals hated me for the CCTV, submachine-armed Police, death penalty, etc. But all of these should provide strong  cover for me to be not easily having shot at.The most difficult challenge is after the 6th terms, when Water Shortage and Cyclone would be very expensive to be controlled as the world temperature would keep rising regardless my CO2 at 0, and my environment level at max.Well, I still could put good hours for this game.

												This is a game for a very specific demographic. Now that we have that pun out of the way, let's get down to it.Overall, 8/10, with the qualification that you have to be a certain person.A certain person who like planning, forethought, and an entirely menu driven game. Democracy 3 places you in a country of your choosing as the Prime Minster, President, Chancellor, whatever the paper-thin disguise of a real nation calls for. You are then presented with a rather pleasing diagram of all the things harming your country and all the things helping it. Each turn you are afforded a set amount of political capitol, which you can spend to either create new policies, strengthen or destroy existing ones, manipulate taxes or shuffle your cabinet. Some policies cost more than others. It's oftne possible to pass two or three low level policies a turn, but if you want to, say, increase the income tax, that will take more capitol than you generate each turn. So you wait. But each turn demographics shift. Often a national emergency or policy issue arising to cause the shift. You have to make a decision that costs no capitol, on the spot, but which will affect your country and your standing. The end goal of course, is to get re-elected as well as solve your national issues-debt, low standard of living, what have you. That's the game in a nutshell. I liked it, but it isn't for everyone. Buy it if you like charts and long planning.			"

As a political junkie and campaign volunteer, I can tell the programmers put some SERIOUS thought and study into the content and layout of this game. I look forward to seeing how my policies work out. Must-buy for Poli-Sci majors and policy wonks. I recommend it.			"

												My Story:I put my views into Great Britain and made it a socialist, communist country full of equality and ecolological stability. I had rid Britain of it's pollution and helped struggling mothers and protected the poor and vulnerable, reducing organized crime and increasing science funding so that we can become a purely developed nation.I was assassinated by Capitalists...Just no pleasing some people...

It's like the sociopolitical version of Civilization.I was running Canada. My people were some of the smartest on the planet, winning Nobel Prizes with ease, then the global economy tanked. My forward thinking economic policies helped to blunt the recession...for a time. Then, slowly, my secular policies came back to bite me as unemployment, homelessness, and religious extremism began to rise.10/10. Would get car-bombed again.			"

												This game is so much more interesting and fun than real life politics. UI is simple to navigate and you can get a hang of how the game works relatively quickly. However, if you have a small attention span, you may miss things on the side very easily like how your country's money is doing. I did very well with making all the voters love me for about 3 elections my first run, but I'm pretty sure I ran my country into horrible debt because I wasn't paying attention to my money which caused me to lose my 4th election. My only real problems with the game however is changing the resolution and the start up. Every time I change the resolution, I have to close the game and restart it to have the changes take effect. I'm not sure if this is just my laptop being sh*t as per usual or if this is a problem among multiple players. Also, on start up, Steam constantly does the first time set up even though I've opened the game multiple times already. I have no idea why it's doing that. Again, it could be my laptop, but I might as well mention it if it's not. All and all, regardless of my problems, I love this game and would definitely recommend giving it a try even to politically apathetic people like myself.			"

												This game is really really good, and I will recommend it to my friends.However, it has one thing that put me off:I have no idea what some of the sliders are good or bad.Like at one point, the ""Crime"" slider was green, and the next it was red. Mind it was green when I worked with Police. Does this mean Crime is going down, or is it just to confuse new players? I need to consult a guide on this, which is never a good start.Still, very good game, 7/10			"

												This is based on a recent game of democracy 3, playing as modded Scotland, Its meant for entiertaiment only! :) Sitting in his office politican Flazam recieves news, Scotland has voted for Independence by 36% to 35% and you have been appointed leader.Flazam was worried, such a close vote had led to a split in society and breaking away from the union had had strong impacts on GDP with are credit rating dropping faster than Skyrliexs new album. During Flazams first year as prime minister, it was decided military spending should be cut, and this money is to be invested in to education and science to build the future generation, Flazam began to introduce new policy and cut old policy, Flazam was become very popular amoung the socialists in my electorate. Sitting in his office reading the news Flazam is suddenly shocked as his deputy Gabe Newell, blasts through the door, Gabe told Flazam, 2 things that a mediterian island had been invaded, I nodded sadly, he then informed me that because of this the steam sale would be cancelled, slowly lowering his class""get out"" Flazam screamed.""no"" Gabe replied forcefully, ""Fine"" Flazam rebukedTwo security guards grab Gabe procuding to beat him up and through him out of the building ""the cake is a lie"" he screams as his body smacks the pavement. Gabe was popular amound the captalists, and the patriots whom were sad about losing the island, but presumbly more sad that there would be no steam sale, set up a terroist group calling themselves the ""battenburg group"". Flazam went to vist open a new airport, the day was going well and the sun was shining, suddenly bullet fill the air, Flazam is knocked down to the ground in a grenade explosian, Flazams loyal body guards return fire. The body guards fight of the gun men, as the gun men retreat, the guards capture one, pulling of his mask.""Gabe Newell!"" The guards shout.Flazam pulls himself up from the ground wiping the blood of his lip. ""I would of got away with it, if it wasn't for you meddli..."" Gaben sentence is cut short as Flazam deals a punch to his face, and Gaben is dragged away by the guards. Now the election was looming and Flazam had learnt one thing recently, 3 is not a number and captalists can't be trusted. Flazam decided to increase police funding, and began to enforce more anti captalist legislation. The weeks progressed with more assisination attempts from captalists happening often the election was looming, and Flazam was polling well, his socialist utopia was progressing well, and the people adored him for his legalisation of prostition.The Election day came and an impressive 82% voted for Flazam.11/10 would establish neo-marxism again			"

Despite the fact that I never make it to election day because I get assassinated every time, it provides some really good challenge. If any of you are into more of a slow-paced, yet still cut-throat and challenging game, this one is for you. It also kinda opens your eyes as to how tough it is being in this position, the people want one thing, yet you're gonna have to cut something somewhere else to balance it out. Play this game, especially while the package is on sale with all the DLC (Until 3/30/15 iirc).			"

I was protecting the hard working Americans by giving protecting them with labor laws and such! Dropped crime and unemplyment and cut back the rich.... but like reality, the wealthy didn't like it! Almost halfway through my second term, they decided to assassinate me!			"

												Highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in political science and government. It has its flaws however, but its nothing too severe. I was assassinated like 6 six times but I was able to resume my game and continue playing. Was I now the VP or did the assassination just never happen since I resumed the game after I was directed to the main menu? Also, why was I assassinated so many times? Socialists and liberals hated me but I had really good numbers with everyone else. In elections, I got an overwhelming majority from them as they voted for me instead of their own party, but I guess their splinter factions didn't feel the same way. I didn't want to make a police state, but I felt like I had to introduce wire tapping, drone surveillance, and heavily funded police just to stop from being assassinated every other turn. Also the game autocrashed on me a lot but there is an easy fix that is stickied in the steam discussion forums for this game.			"

												The game hates you if you try to implement libertarian policies. How one can repeal drug laws, end state executions, reduce military spending to its lowest possible level, and end up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people off is beyond me. Try it and in just a few turns, approval rating will be 2% and cabinet members will be leaving. That's especially weird because they are clearly *aware* of libertarian positions--even though the game is broken into a conservative/liberal dichotomy. Within that broken, unrealistic dichotomy, though, libertarians come out (as Gary Johnson liked saying) as ""fiscally conservative, socially liberal."" That's an assessment that I reject, but implementing such policies should have resulted in both conservatives and liberals being moderately happy. Instead, both groups simply get angry. I guess that's realistic, because both groups are notoriously unwilling to compromise on anything, but it doesn't make a good game.			"

												Fun little game. Would never advise paying full price as it's a bit shallow without all the DLC (and even then, I wish you could implement more extremist policies/governments... But that's not really the point of the game). Make sure to turn off assassinations, because they're broken as hell unless you're role-playing as some cucked centrist.Could not set up my white nationalist utopia but still worth the buy for a few hours of entertainment. Just wish it was a bit deeper, feels like everything is very on-the-surface only.			"

												I'm very disappointed. I thought this game would be interactive, fun, and engaging.Unforunately, you find out early on that the creator of this game has no idea how the real world works. The game is designed that only a Socialist can win. Maybe the creators of the game have never been to places like Hong Kong or Switzerland.I would NOT recommend this to anyone. At least I bought it on sale, I only paid $10 for this garbage.			"

												Lots of unleashed potentialD3 is a good game, but it could be a great one if the dev spends a little more time polishing it. It has some nice features, and is enjoyable for a few hours, but there are some things that ruin the game:a) no matter what you do, you'll get assassinated. Honestly, how often do we get that IRL? Presidents are impeached more often than they are assassinated (just look at what happened in Brazil!). b) the starting country makes very little difference on the voters mindset and political costs. Bannig guns should have different weights in the USA or Australia, but in the game they are the same thingc) There should more 3rd world (or developing) countries, because these offer some economial and social challenges that would greatly differ from the 1st world economies the gamne offersd) there should be other ways for a president to leave office other than assassination, such as impeachment, a coup d'etat or a foreign invasionIf the developer does polish this game just a bit more, it has everything need to be a great game.

												I was pretty hopefull when I purchased this game. I love gestions/simulations games such as zoo tycoon, game dev tycoon, sim city... So what about a democracy simulator ?Well, the positives things are the free additionnals contents you can find and the headacke you'll get figuring out how to improve your country. That's almost it.But for this price, you'll have a really poor design, the choices you can make arn't that great, people don't go on strikes or things like that. Or I don't understand how the damn things work or you'll be doing the same things over and over again to succeed. Bored after 22h hours of playing on a democracy simulator. Im disapointed, and kinda outraged to have paid that much for that game. Run.			"

There was a glitch, or an error where the game suddenly crashes when you attempt to move to the next turn, and I've looked online for help, and I couldn't find any really realible thing to fix this glitch, it also seems that that the earliest posts about this games probably with crashing started about a year ago, and I haven't seen any threads that are actually realible.

												Although this game has no ""world"" as such, there's a surprising surplus of gameplay, designed for both the novice and professional alike this game does require some political knowledge, (although not too much). I personally believe our current politicians could do with something like this, but alas I doubt they're that tech savvy. Personally, I love this game, but if you have no interest in the political shenanigans of the day I doubt this game will be your cup of tea. I tip my hat to the developers of this game for their bravery to create such a politically based game.			"

												As a total nerd for policy and news this game was fun. However this game obviously is developed by liberal loving hipsters who have no idea that 75% of the country lives in rural counties where farming is a way of life and major cities make up only about 25% of the nation. Obviously the prez elect is a bought race, but since he has no real power anyway it doesn't really matter. This game suck at its core, carbon tax gives you the budget you need to win and it's been repealed in the only country it's ever been approved in so that should give you some insight to how stupid the devs are. Devs if your reading this which would be impressive since you likely don't know how to read having been raised on public education YOUR GAME SUCKS! I know I started by saying this game is fun but honestly after a few 2-5 rounds your going to hate this game unless you are a progressive liberal who taxes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone. Government exits on taxes and since this game is about govenment then you need lots of taxes. If you try to play this game as a libertarian AT ALL even just a little bit you WILL FAIL and YOU WILL NOT WIN.			"

												Democracy 3 is the best part of the series, mostly because of the polished interface. It offers an interesting and unique premise by putting you into the role of your nation's leader. After a couple of playthroughs it is rather simple to achieve complete success on all fronts though. While generally offering multiple ways to play, there are a couple of fool-proof approaches: investing heavily into police, education, tech, health... some fields are just plain good. Focussing on them will ensure overall success.Still, the game offers quite a bit of fun. You can ignore the DLCs because mods literally offer the same if not more.Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.7/10			"

												The game is very simplistic and has a very limited range of things you can actually do. The claim that it is biased toward the left is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though. For someone to say that they would have to be delusional. It's actually fairly reasonable if it is assumed the framework of neoliberalism is sensible. Outside of that, however, it offers a glib take on economics. I would not buy this if you're looking for a robust political simulator. It limits you to a very layperson sort of sandbox. There's no real ability to explore anything outside of liberalism (not as opposed to conservatism; the broader socioeconmic liberalism in which conservatism exists). Being so confined makes it extremely boring.Pass on this.			"

												OK, I think I got it.I want to lay my honest opinion on the game, sorry devs.The learning curve of this game is about 5 hours.After that you should be able to make GDP grow steady even if the World economy is not in good shape.The bad thing is that even if the interface is pretty nice, it actually will took you some time to memorize which policy affects what. And that makes the game artificially difficult, not by idea.Because not all relations in this game are pretty straightforward ... and I don't mean always in a good/complex way. :(Example:I have GREEN relationship with all particular groups that a minister is sympathetic with. All of the groups characteristics are GREEN but still the minister that is symphatizing on that group is giving me only 1 point of loyalty. Which is COMPLETE nonsense ... Or at least that shouldn't work so IRL ... :) ... Or devs just want to defy logic.Anyway. I think the devs have to put more effort on the content ... DLCs are OK but they need to CHANGE the gameplay. Because when you buy the DLC the policies it brings to the game ... well ... they should be there in the first place.Still ... if you get this game on promotion ... it's worth giggling your ego.			"

The sad thing about this game is that it's such a cool idea, if only they had done something, I don't know, more with it.  Even for a phone app this thing lacks content and replayability.  I'm not really into phone apps, but even if I was, I would still expect more.  You basically click on things and make choices which the game calculates more or less non-randomly, into predictable results, and it feels a bit like putting together a powerpoint slide or an excel spreadsheet.  There aren't really graphics, and the music consists of a single song that gets old faster than listening to ""Achy-breaky Heart"" on repeat.  But, well, one thing...it's  a cool idea, at least, like a really good idea.  And, I'd love to see someone actually do a real game with this concept.  Wouldn't it be awesome to play a quality strategy game where you can play as a politician, making deals (dirty or clean), shaping the world in your image for good or ill.  That sounds like a lot of fun!  But, this...this is just not fun.			"

												I used to love this game, it was in depth, but fair. Given some level of effort, you could (mostly) find a way to succeed. I don't know what changed, but now I can't make it a full term without being assasinated, or if I do, I am overwhelmingly voted out. This is Democracy 3, not Donald Trump Simulator.			"

												DO NOT BUY< DO NOT BUY , It looks as if only a few mods work, the game itself is boring and easy to beat after a few hours of playing the only thing that made it worthwhile was the mods shared through steam and now they are gone too. This company does not seem to care much about their product or costumer requests since for more than 2 years there has been talks about a new game and at least improvements but nothing and now they go and do allow any of the mods to be used unless they are verified by them.

												Decent simulation of a ""democratic"" system - though the interconnected variables of what policy decisions impact which social outcomes is a bit foggy at best. The diversity of outcomes from similar policy decisions between what are effectively similarly structured Western democracies is just odd - picking a similar policy choice between the britsh and french should not result in significantly different outcomes (all things equal in other policy values) but that's often the case. Intuitive interface, good option set and pace - overall a good game to spend a bit of time ruling by proxy through.			"

												You merely get assassinated a couple years in because apparently you're in a nation of homicidal maniacs who can't simply be disgruntled... I understand the premise, and it was invigorating and euphoric even, at first, because you had so much control...but any change seems to make people load up their guns... Who wants to govern ***** like that? It defeats the point of the game. There should just be a severe disapproval and a risk of assassination if you're extreme for too long... I was knocked off every time I tried to play, gradual changes or not... Just, lame. I hope a fourth one comes out correcting these issues...			"

												This is a game for a very specific demographic. Now that we have that pun out of the way, let's get down to it.Overall, 8/10, with the qualification that you have to be a certain person.A certain person who like planning, forethought, and an entirely menu driven game. Democracy 3 places you in a country of your choosing as the Prime Minster, President, Chancellor, whatever the paper-thin disguise of a real nation calls for. You are then presented with a rather pleasing diagram of all the things harming your country and all the things helping it. Each turn you are afforded a set amount of political capitol, which you can spend to either create new policies, strengthen or destroy existing ones, manipulate taxes or shuffle your cabinet. Some policies cost more than others. It's oftne possible to pass two or three low level policies a turn, but if you want to, say, increase the income tax, that will take more capitol than you generate each turn. So you wait. But each turn demographics shift. Often a national emergency or policy issue arising to cause the shift. You have to make a decision that costs no capitol, on the spot, but which will affect your country and your standing. The end goal of course, is to get re-elected as well as solve your national issues-debt, low standard of living, what have you. That's the game in a nutshell. I liked it, but it isn't for everyone. Buy it if you like charts and long planning.			"

												I've got a love hate relationship with this game.+ Used Pigovian Taxs to decrease effects of negative externalities through economic pressure AND use subsequent revenue to fund programs to further mitigate social problems.- Got assassinated because I angered the 40% of the American population who identify as Socialists, because everyone knows America is full of violent socialists.The balancing of interconnected policies and issues while juggling deficit and debt along with the opinions of various factions is fun, but it does get a lot easier with practice. Once that's mastered there's not much else. Once you crest in a game there ceases to be any real challenge. There aren't many random events either. You can also just eyeball your projected expenses/revenues without having to pay too close of attention to your budget, especially once you start steering your economy in the right direction. For a game called Democracy 3, the election part is awfully minimal and simplistic. Two party parlimentary system for every avaliable country? They're just a number counting cutscene based entirely on current opinions.Would have been interested to get to set some monitary policies just to play with how other economic theories might play out. Would have been interesting to have a fleshed out economy or detailed GDP; just given that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥around with taxes and subsidies without any consequences beyond specific interconnected issues, public opinion, and your budget. Sometimes the political opinion of the developers is hard to ignore, based on which issues are affected by which policies. Eurocentric game is eurocentric. A Keynesian approach to crawling out of a deficit is kinda OP. Come to think of it, you're probably universally at a disadvantage unless you're playing as a socialist/enviornmentalist/atheist.With all it's faults, I still like this game. It's far from perfect, but it's alright. ""Yes, I recommend this game, BUT..."" It isn't for everyone. This is a geeky game for geeky geeks. You've got to really love bubbles and arrows. Probably should wait to get it on sale too.			"

It's oftne possible to pass two or three low level policies a turn, but if you want to, say, increase the income tax, that will take more capitol than you generate each turn. So you wait. But each turn demographics shift. Often a national emergency or policy issue arising to cause the shift. You have to make a decision that costs no capitol, on the spot, but which will affect your country and your standing. The end goal of course, is to get re-elected as well as solve your national issues-debt, low standard of living, what have you. That's the game in a nutshell. I liked it, but it isn't for everyone. Buy it if you like charts and long planning.			"

												I've got a love hate relationship with this game.+ Used Pigovian Taxs to decrease effects of negative externalities through economic pressure AND use subsequent revenue to fund programs to further mitigate social problems.- Got assassinated because I angered the 40% of the American population who identify as Socialists, because everyone knows America is full of violent socialists.The balancing of interconnected policies and issues while juggling deficit and debt along with the opinions of various factions is fun, but it does get a lot easier with practice. Once that's mastered there's not much else. Once you crest in a game there ceases to be any real challenge. There aren't many random events either. You can also just eyeball your projected expenses/revenues without having to pay too close of attention to your budget, especially once you start steering your economy in the right direction. For a game called Democracy 3, the election part is awfully minimal and simplistic. Two party parlimentary system for every avaliable country? They're just a number counting cutscene based entirely on current opinions.Would have been interested to get to set some monitary policies just to play with how other economic theories might play out. Would have been interesting to have a fleshed out economy or detailed GDP; just given that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥around with taxes and subsidies without any consequences beyond specific interconnected issues, public opinion, and your budget. Sometimes the political opinion of the developers is hard to ignore, based on which issues are affected by which policies. Eurocentric game is eurocentric. A Keynesian approach to crawling out of a deficit is kinda OP. Come to think of it, you're probably universally at a disadvantage unless you're playing as a socialist/enviornmentalist/atheist.With all it's faults, I still like this game. It's far from perfect, but it's alright. ""Yes, I recommend this game, BUT..."" It isn't for everyone. This is a geeky game for geeky geeks. You've got to really love bubbles and arrows. Probably should wait to get it on sale too.			"

												This game got really irritating when it started serving the cocktail of near-unavoidable assassination and bugs like being able to spend your political capital twice on the same issue to no effect. The UI is unhelpful and uninteresting. (Half the time you can't actually see the edges of the graph because they're covered by labels.) The relationships between policies and statistics are sometimes wired wonky (at least that's what I assumed looking at certain relationships.) The whole game is a cluttered mess.			"

												Democracy 3, could be so much more. So so much more. But no, it had to be an utterly stupid and laughable simulation of politics rendered down to little tiny buttons and bars.

The game is reduced to a mad balancing act of whack a mole and without real though to policies and mostly finding ways to either a) balance your constituents b) get rid of a particular group of constituents c) get so much popular vote that getting voted out becomes laughable.Pros:It is addicting for the first few hours.

Graphically it is decent, not much animation and it was mostly text in communication. You don't see riots, which I think would have been a nice addition. Really, any cinematic would have been nice.Cons:Every country gets stale because it is simply different sorts of policies with different tactics but in the end they all feel the same. It's like deriving several different math formulas to come to the same answer. It also gets stale once you have balanced the budget and made most of your constituents happy. You can't be voted out.

												Rating: 2/10 -- ★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆Valve: Please change recommendation/review system to use a 10 point star system. Much more accurate than ""yes/no"".I don't believe this game is realistic at all.  I've tried many times to run a smooth country, and no matter how powerful my police force and military and such, I always always get assassinated after making the envirornment max, nice schools, delete the debt and start reducing taxes after, I make a very good country, and someone always assassinates me.  This last time, by some group that was 50% happy with what I was doing!  It makes no sense.  Many things I change, effect things that it shouldn't, it's a big load of crap.  I've tried three times now, and I'm sick of it, I never want to play again.			"

												the models used are quite biased toward the necessity of government invovlement in certain areas. there are many areas in the game when, realistically, government any involvement causes more problems than it resolves. overall, the game is well-conceived, and not completely wrong: democracies throughout the world have always failed. democracies always violently impose the will of the majority upon the minority. it makes sense that, if the model in the game is attempting to portray how hard it is for a figurehead to run such a flawed system, the game is difficult to understand and to play -- perhaps this is because it is quite difficult to separate the game mechanics from reality.details: the cabinet/ministers pool appears to be quite limited to people with varying backgrounds. often, in reality, the pool of ministers is not required to have 1 religious, 1 environmentalist, 1 socialist, 1 liberal, etc. it makes the game quite annoying that your ministers are more loyal to their constituency than you, the player, as they are not elected officials.there are a few flow issues with the UI (not enough buttons to navigate everything quickly or to sort cabinet by category, etc). overall: it was fun to try and figure out the system for a few hours, but after that, the system itself is just unrealistic enough that the game became un-fun. i actually have been assassinated or lost election by landside every term i have played so far.

												in general I got a sneaky feeling this game is really dangerous for unreflective young people who play it too much and start thinking about logical shortcuts from decision A to result B. Its offering a game design (balance) that represents a truth that just isnt like real life. Be aware this is a game made by people with a certain opinion. Personally I feel like it glorifies modern police and anti-terror agenda with the standard sentences like:""who isnt guitly has nothing to hide"". It has potential to wash your brains. Imagine beeing randomly stopped, investigated and beaten up by bored or career-seeking (stats needing) policemen - it happens more and more! I didnt feel like I could even start the game without rising police and anti-terror levels which is a big, big joke!And regarding the price and the product. Even 50% off (11.50€) was too much for what I got. Although I´m a big fan of this kind of manager games. Highly not recommended, with lack of detail, humour and any sort of surprises - maybe only for 1 school lesson for small kids to get an imagination of what politics have to consider when making decisioins.

												A government simulator / strategy game that balances fun and realism. Primarily, the goal is to introduce new policies (and manipulate old ones) to appease different voting groups so that you may get elected to another term. Other factors such as the loyalty and effectiveness of your cabinet, as well as natural and economic disasters will affect your party's popularity. Become too extreme in any regard, and that unpopularity may result in your assassination.			"

												This game looks like a very fun and enjoyable game and one that my family would have enjoyed playing for hours to see who would make a better President but the way this game is set up takes the fun out of it.  After trying for hours and many game plays I never once got reelected.  Now the first few tries were just bad playing on my part but even when I would get my likely voters up to 65% I would still lose and each time it was due to something outside my control like an event that would drop my happiness from 65% to 10% or less always on the last turn before the voting.  This happen with every game after the 1st few tries before I understood the game.  It has become clear that no matter what every time something will drop your approval ratings at the end costing you the game.  I even drop the level to as easy as it would go and still lost due to an event on the last turn.  My family will not want to play a game they already know they will lose in no matter how while they play. If I am missing something please someone write to me and I will edit this review but as of now and until I get reelected at lease once I stand by this review.			"

												I can't recommend this game, it is not a realistic simulator.  It's only as good as it's programmed to be and the way it's programmed and even the way it's written is highly pro statist, liberal and socialist.  Have whatever belief you want i the real world, I'm just talking about this video game.  Don't think this game is in any way indicitive of reality, the values changed by the sliders are arbitrarily picked by the programmers and are very pro socialist.  There is nothing to really learn here except that actions can have consiquences, which I hope you already learned before the age of 6.  Not all change in life has to be done at the government level.  In fact pretty much all of it can be done and done more efficiently by many other forces, such as non-profit groups which play a huge role in the real world.  This game doesn't take that into account.  Also, assasignation is rampant and way over the top in this game.  The English used is all the queen's english, American english is not accounted for and therefore when playing any country, it's as if you're playing as the UK ministers, etc, everywhere.			"

												Game seems like a PowerPoint presentation made by a Democractic Party student of political science. It throws us into a world with the status quo being one of political correctness with so-called ""nationalist"" types as the bad guys and ""socialists"" as the good guys. Presents an unrealistic approach to politics and sets us on Democrat vs. Republican rails unto the point where the game leads us ultimtately to nowhere. It's like watching CNN political commentary by Jesse Jackson. Terrible waste of money. Don't even buy on sale.			"

												Long ago, there was a boy. He was ignorant of politics, and his friends laughed at him. But one day, everything changed. The Boy was introduced to.... Democracy 3. This game opened his mind, and soon enough The Boy was not laughed at, but he was laughing at everyone else. He played the game for hours, and soon enough he ruled Germany. Everyone loved him, except for one. The Capitalists. With his Spy Satellite Network, The Boy toiled and worked to make sure he was safe from the mysterious ""Battenburg Group"". He had Armed Police, CCTV Cameras to the max, and Internet Censorship. Soon enough the people hated him. He pleaded to Gaben, ""Save me, SAVE ME!"" But Gaben shook his head and said ""You brought this on yourself. The Boy returned to his PC, and started Democracy 3. After getting a mod for propoganda, he tried to save himself. Soon enough, one of his ministers who was a capitalist sympathizer decided to ""spend more time with family"". The people rebelled. The Boy was assanitated by the Battenburg Group. But he had a backup. Becuase he knew it was only a matter of time before he was killed, the boy downloaded a mod to introduce a ""Dead Hand"" policy. When he died, the world went down with him. 11/10 would plead to Gaben again			"

												If you're looking for realism, don't buy this game. They tout it as a simulator, but it bears little resemblance to the real world. That's not to say it's a bad game - it isn't. It's just that when I bought this, I was hoping for something that would be a reasonably realistic simulation of policy and politics. It falls far short of that mark. The modding community is pretty dead here on Steam, as well, so you're more or less on your own if you try to fix it up via mods. If you're just looking for something to putter around on it might not be a bad buy, but if you're looking for something hardcore it probably will far short of your expectations.			"

												Could've been done better. As other reviewers have said, if you lean towards full-blown communism or a leftist police state similar in tone to pre-WW2 Germany then this game is for you. Anyone else you will be frustrated to no end.The dev was trying to make a statement. Basically any attempt at being conservative will fail and leftist, communist, socialist, liberal policies make the game so much easier and the people 'happier' which flies in the face of real life. The biggest joke is gun control reducing violence in the US in this game, that's quite the opposite as all the Democrat-run cities in the US like Detroit, New York, and LA account for the vast majority of the firearm related murders and they have gun bans! That's just one example of how this game is nothing but a platform for political hack devs to shout their opinion. Played for a while in my DRM-free version, had to get it on Steam for some DLC but seriously this game is basically a giant pro-leftist political statement made by a liberal hack. Clifffski, we don't care of your personal opinions on how the world works. Evidence abound in reality that the ideas promoted here don't work in history or today. Stick to making fun games. This one is only good for a few hours, maybe a dozen max. Everyone I know that tried it quit within 2-4 hours.			"

												Before you buy this, make sure you know what type of game this is. Don´t expect any fascinating 2D- simulation like DEFCON or Plague Inc.; The game itself is boring. Democracy 3 is less entertaining but more educative. There are no cutscenes, there is no story, there aren´t even animations. So if you want to have fun, this is not the game to try. Instead of controlling life-events as you might have expected, you will have to read and wait, a whole lot. Democracy 3 is a complex simulation, confrontating you with one of the most difficult tasks in the World: Leading a state. As easy as it seems, it´s not. Everything you do can have deep consequences, each solution will result in a new problem. There are always tons of things to take care about, simultaneously. As in the real world, nothing works as it should. While you are trying to count as many voters at possible, your whole government can be ruined from one day to annother, just because of one simple aspect you did not think of early enough. There are crises, natural catastrophies, riots, assassinations or even worse things, making it hard for you to develop a solid society. Before I played this, I didn´t ever think of the difficulty beeing president. So, in conclusion I can absolutely recommend Democracy. It´s a well made, realistic simulation. For all, who are interested in politics this is totally worth the price, for some others this could also be interesting when on mass sale, while Hardcore-Gamers or Action-game-players should definately stay away from this, since Democracy 3 hasn´t any gameplay at all.One last thing: When playing Democracy you should be pretty good at speaking english, because the translation isn´t complete. There are a lot of sections, such as the integrated guide, that are only available in english. To the fact this is an educative game, the grammar is pretty advanced and the texts are using uncommon words. If you are new to the game you might not understand the basics, the tutorial is short and reduced to the minimum. That can make it pretty hard for you to be successfull here. I hope this review is helpful, -T21-			"

												World War II  also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of ""total war"", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11(Editors note: mostly Russian) million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.......Don't worry in this game you are playing as USA			"

												Excellent simulation! Once you learn all the levers and information panels, it is pretty fantastic, albeit, very frustrating. Just like real politics! I would highly recommend this game, especially to those who are interested in the policies and how they affect people. Since there's no representation (senate, congress, that sort of thing) the people seem to be very ready to just assassinate you, so play nice.			"

												Positive: This game should be called The Treasury. Democracy (3) was tedious for many weeks and a friend, who I had gifted it, hasn't been playing it. Interestingly I kept coming back to this game every week or so, playing sometimes for an hour. It is only now, months later that I have really adjusted to the interface, which was at first disorientating because it looked too simple. This was an incorrect observation.: It is only now I realise that the game's structure is not disorientating but incredibly nuanced and attentive to every decision I act upon. Therefore, Democracy (3) lives up to its name of being the ultimate political strategy game. It does not surprise me in the least to know that this game is used in colleges to teach students about what could be best described as 'applied politics'.       Negative: You can learn how a political cabinet and headquarters (Downing Street, White House) functions (around The Treasury); but when it comes to less pertinent somewhat flimsy policies I can only learn predictable, somewhat careless results and consequences. For example, allowing Gay Marriage will raise the happiness of the liberals. Although this is politically true, it is not universally true and obvious if looking at the concept of marriage holistically and what it means for your LGBT citizens: conformity, maybe? But this game is not called Philosophy 3.     Neutral: Like any good game Democracy (3) allows me to use my imagination - obsessively so. Considering teachers use Democracy in colleges, buying the game for £18.99  suggests you would need a definite interest in politics in the first place, otherwise, you will definitely give up and wish you had bought a known and good game like Rise of Nations instead. How much can this game stimulate interest in politics I don't know, but given its depth and seriousness, it just wouldn't work for gamers of the raid and conquer mentality exclusively.      Rate:  It is definitely a 3.5 out of 5 star game and also inspiring because the Democracy series can only get better if it is given the chance. I think Democracy 3 is a big step-up from Democracy 2 and so that leaves me excited for a Democracy 4.			"

												This is a fairly straightforward yet complex game. One could call it a puzzle game if you ignored the game storyline. In reality, it does a lot more for teaching the interconnectedness of systems in politics, and how things are a massive balancing act. The best kind of teaching tool is the one that's fun, and provides the ability interact with an open world and learn from it, and experiment. This game does just that, and it would probably benefit many politicians to actually play it.			"

												Phenominal. I'm extremely happy I got this game. At first I had a hard time getting to figure it all out but after a few hours of play I learned to utilize everything and had the most fun I have in a while. I started making a habbit of pushing to the hardest difficulties of the game by maxing the difficulty and including every problem possible along with a horrible deficit. Mastering the game was the fun of it all and in the end I learned a lot about the different political views and became far better at managing numbers just by playing this game haha.Some of the other fun things you get to do are the underhanded schemes like making the religious happy everywhere but teaching evolution only in schools which decreases the religous population to zero then going full liberal so there were next to no religious to vote against me.You'll absolutely love this game if you enjoy a good strategic statistical balancing game (there aren't enough of them!). Have FUN, and enjoy the game, I know I did. I'm excited for the fourth and hope they add even MORE complex problem solving!			"

												For a third installment in a series, Democracy 3 is a very basic and rather unpolished title.The game is consistent from its predecessors, with very little new mechanics to the game (Rather it's just Democracy 2 with more compatibility and more DLC).However even basic menu items are misaligned, a great deal of in-game text is laden with typos even so long after its release, and a lot of the effects you get are simply absurd (Britain requires major power to change gun laws to be stricter, you are popular enough to win elections in a crime-free nation but you get assassination attempts 4 times a year...)Past all its issues with bugs and polish, the game itself is really quite limited in functionality. If you can actually get a country to function, there's nothing else to do. At all. The game doesn't even upscale anything overtime, you can play for 100 years and your GDP will never surpass a certain limit, your income will never grow, etc.If it's on sale, it can be fun for a few hours, but not really much more.

												It's unrealistic...1 for instance the United States does Not, nationally have a sales tax, but in this game it does... most western nations have an anti-descrimination law on the books, or at the least, the U.S. does, they've had it for longer than i've been alive and i am in my 30s, and yet in the game you have to indroduce it.2 It's almost impossible to win on normal mode without doing things like horribly and artificially jacking your tax rates, while removing your biggest spendings. the United States was in debt with more spending than billing, for a fairly long time...in real life, the only reason it's credit rating slipped is because it almost refused to forward those debts.3. on Normal No one wants to vote for you at the beginning of the game, if this was the case, you'd have never gotten elected in the first place, this is after all ""a democracy."" what were you appointed by a miracious god.... 4. different countries call their cabinet different things... in the United States it's called Secretary, in England it's called MinisterI got the distinct feeling that either A. the person who created this knows nothing about how governments or democracy's work and specific ones that aren't part of their country in particular.. or B. they have Balance issues that need adjusted badly.What does this say that of all the horrible games i have played this is the First one that I've not recommened?

												Extremely in-depth game that can become even more in-depth if you install just one of the hundreds of available mods. Well-polished, realistic, and overall fun; all three of these are usually missing from these kinds of games, but Democracy 3 has the ideal game *locked down*. Sometimes, though, the interface feels too polished. One example is the screen transition, which seems like an overdone Adobe Flash animation.

												Democracy - 'How not to make everyone happy'The game features an interconnected web of policies, economic and voters. It then pushes you in and expects you to manage this tangled mess. The challenge is that every policy you touch effects every other policy. Additionally the most popular policy (throwing money at anyone who wants it) is not alway the best for the nation.The problem I have with the game is not is the puzzle. Its that when you really come down to it there is only one interconnect puzzle. You can try to do different things with it but there is only so much spead sheeting I can play and still call it a game.I reccommend this game to educators. It is a fun interesting little peice on politics. I'd compair it to an interesting book. However, I am not the type of person to constantly rewatch the same film. Like myself, I cannot see most people playing this past a curiousity.			"

												I genuinely enjoy trying to solve a country's problems in Democracy 3. I've only played a few hours with the DLC and from what I've seen, it adds more challenges and problems to plan for and solve. I love how much depth there is to this game. Making sure I balance everyone's wants with what the country actually needs is an immense challenge I'm not even sure how to begin to summarize in a review. Instead I'll try to just summarize my favorite playstyle. It's worked with pretty good success for me most of the time. I like to support technology and education as much as possible. I legalize all the drugs and maximize police funding while raising taxes on alcohol, gas, and tobacco. I raised taxes for the wealthy and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a lot of conservatives and drove the religious people out of my country with all my antireligion and protechnology policies. I made the environment a major priority and funded as many alternative energy and transportation technologies as i could. I made many modifications to the ""free market"" that boosted small business and forced larger companies to treat their employees extremely well and make sure nobody pollutes. Capitalists, religious folk, conservatives, and the wealthy all disliked me immensely, but since they were such a small portion of the population, it never lowered my popularity in the polls by that much. There were definitely stretches where i was losing an obnoxious amount of money each turn, but always towards the end, things would level out and my country would start making money and eventually build itself out of it's big debt pit it started in. My biggest problem was always the world economy. No matter what country I picked (and some countries were MUCH harder for me than others-AMERICA-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nation is more like it) I always suffered from the world economy. It seemed like every couple of turns there was a global economic meltdown. I don't know if it had something to do with my foreign policies or was a randomized event or what, but I always wondered why the global economy melted down so much while I was running things. Haha-hopefully it's not MY fault.Anyway, if you wanna try your hand at running a country and think you've got what it takes, definitely-DEFINITELY check this game out.			"

												At this time, I can not recommend this game. The only way I would recommend this game is if you happen to enjoy analyzing statistics in your spare time. The user interface basically consists of information compiled by category. Unless you have a good idea of what you hope to accomplish in office and can combine that with the scenario presented at the time of your election, you'll be lost. On a side note, there isn't much information on how to play the game. The documentation provided acts as a glossary for the terms used, but does nothing to point you in the direction of actual gameplay. 3 out of 10			"

												There was a web based version of this game over fourteen years ago. I can't remember the name but it was basically make X number of decisions on bills or laws that would pop up for vote. It was fun for a while, but then got really boring because the strategy was funnelled. Meaning if you duplicated your picks every time you'd end up at the same result. It really isn't random and the choices are limited.3/10 stars because it is OK to pass time but I wouldn't buy it for more than $5.			"

This game is just some icons, piecharts, simple animated arrows & what looks like generic generated 3D models. 6/10. A missed opportunity.Sound:Is there sound in this game? Didn't really notice it... 4/10.Gameplay:If you are interested in politics, this is a must have... But not at this price. Once you get a hang of the mechanics (I will not spoil them here, but if you are part of the reddit hivemind you'll make the right choices right away), you will conquer this game fairly easy. The events are limited, so are your choices. I'm really into these kinda games, but unless the community starts to provide a lot of more content I will not come back to this game. Overall:This is a niche game, so if you fit the niche, you should buy it, but also wait for a firm pricedrop. 6/10.			"

												This game seemed like it would be fun.  Unfortunately, it appears that the game developers had neither a political background nor an economic one.  Policies that are clearly pro-growth have the opposite effect on the economy.  You can have groups that clearly favor your policies and yet you poll near zero.   They even throw in creation vs evolution, and you seem to take a hit from an education and science perspective for favoring creation.  It is almost like the developers had a certain political world view that they used to construct the came, rather than researching and inverviewing people with backgrounds in those areas.  What is unfortunate is that I would never be able to get my money back for this purchase, even though it was on sale.			"

												The game is a simplified version of ""Masters of the World - Geopolitical Simulator 3"". It's for political illiterates who are too blind of their political ideologies and just want to rule a country under a ""democracy."" Perfect game for progressive libtards and SJW snowflakes to finally pass the laws that really matters to their fantasies. Perfect for greedy right wingers and conservative snowflakes to finally pass the laws that really matters to their fantasies as well. Killarytards. Drumpftards. Bernie. Farage. Merkel. Putin. The janitor down the hall. Your neighbor's cat. Your mother in-law. HARAMBE. Doesn't matter. This game is for you. Although, expect some neo-liberal bias from the game system.“Freedom is not defined by safety. Freedom is defined by the ability of citizens to live without government interference. Government cannot create a world without risks, nor would we really wish to live in such a fictional place. Only a totalitarian society would even claim absolute safety as a worthy ideal, because it would require total state control over its citizens’ lives. Liberty has meaning only if we still believe in it when terrible things happen and a false government security blanket beckons.” ~Ron Paul“We don’t create governments just so we can have a government. We create government to secure individual rights.” ~Austin Petersen "

												TL;DR IF you do get the game get mods... Good idea, Poor execution. The game pretty much forces socialism, I mean, you get to choose what sort of socialism it is. you have to tax the hell out of people to get anything done, and the game loves it if you tax rich people and business (they might have alot of the money but not enough to pay for everything). Anyway everyone ends up being okay with you taxing them to death (mind the incoming sarcasm) because of course the state can take care of all your needs, it's worked so well in real life. also some effects of laws are completely subjective you can tell the people who made the game are very much on the left and rather autoritarian.

												There are a few things that seem to be politically biased about the game that frustrates me. When legalizing drugs for example, it increases crime rate and drug addiction. I would argue that legalizing psychedelics like LSD (yes they give you an option for that) would LOWER crime and LOWER drug addiction. There are many more examples of this that make this game not realistic enough to be fun for me. Theres too much incorrect assumption about what effect certian policy changes have.			"

												民主制度3 是一个精妙的游戏，提供政治、传播、统计和市场调研等各方面的知识。我写信给开发者赞美了这款游戏，并且提出了中文版的愿望，开发者表示中文版正在制作中。a splendor but subtle game with knowledge about politics, communication, statistics and marketing.这个游戏多少能给我们理解民主政治一些帮助。help us get closer with democracy.比如，我的感受是：-民意比政治抱负重要，我的理想是小政府大市场，低税收刺激经济，低政府福利促进社会福利事业，但有时候不得不先放弃政治抱负，否则你会刺杀，或者你只能待一个任期。-民意有时候也可以不听，他们或许一时反对，但如果真的对他们的生活有利，他们总会在未来支持你。-有些阶层投票率底，真的可以不听他们这个阶层的声音。所以，至少在游戏展现的民主制度中投票是个好东西。Via this game, I feel.-Public opinions sometimes value more than your ideal social bluepritings, you must learn to compromise-However, you have to insist your own stand, even you may feel people's bad malice to you, they will be grateful when they actually benefit from your decisions!-Go to vote, cherish your rights, citizens! I, a Chinese, envy your system which may be imperfect.缺点是，-两党制不符合现状（虽然英美都是两党，但在实际政治生活中，其他党派仍然有重要作用，在英国更加明显，而且很多国家都不是两党制。）-简单多数决，很多国家的国家领袖都并非简单多数决来决定的，比如美国，就是选举人制度。-反对党存在感低-数值简单相关，导致玩套路，可玩性不够（打了选举的DLC之后好一些，金主对政策路线有一定影响）Cons-Two-party system is too simple, actually a democracy state have many parties.-Simple majority vote, actually many country ,for example, USA have the Electoral College-Opposition party is invisible, they will not harm your governing.-Simple number relations, lack of playability (Electioneering DLC can fix it a little)但如果实现真实的政治模拟，恐怕不太可能。人是政治的动物，但AI不是，如果AI有天真的理解了政治，那么他们就是人了。不错的科普游戏，另外如果你对统计学和市场调研感兴趣，这个游戏也可以给你带来一些启发。However, as our human's democracy is imperfect, this game can and must be imperfect. I wish it can be better and more real-like but it is never the reality. As Aristotle said, The HUMAN BEING is an Innate political animal, AI is not, if they are real political animal, we may face real problem.(LOL)After all, I prefer this game!8.5/10 "

												I'm gonna put my 4 years of Political Science degree into something useful.If you are looking for something that will challenge your abilities to balance policy without getting yourself killed, this is a 'game' for you.If you are looking for some sort of government simulator, this is not that. There are no interests groups, only assassination groups. There is no congress, supreme court, federalism, anything. In the european countries, there is no Parliament. Just put yourself into the position of a dictator whom was somehow elected with 1 percent approval rating and try to kiss as many asses as possible without getting assassinated.Did I mention that 90 percent of the time your game will end with you being assassinated?

												I found Democracy 3 to be incredibly boring.  There was nothing built into it to keep me engaged and interested (the threat of assassination might be enough for some players, I found it exasperating).  Playing it felt like work.  I tend to enjoy games that are asthetically pleasing, and Democracy 3 was lacking even in that respect.  It's a game of numbers, nothing else.I was very much looking forward to playing Decmocray 3 before I got it, so much so that a friend bought it for me as a gift.  I tried really hard to like it, it just wasn't for me.			"

												I just beat this game and it was perfect: perfect education, close to 0 unemployment, perfect health, average GDP, 0 crime due to community policing and equality, and no policies I didn't agree with. So satisfying, especially after countless assasinations by extremist religious groups.The one thing is that the debt crisis was nerfed since D2. While automatically losing after going over the debt ceiling was frustrating and limiting, it did create an interesting balancing act.			"

												Many elements of this game are backwards and seem to reflect either programming while exhausted, and thus getting the positive/negative effects confused, so much so that the only seemingly successful narrative is to be a brutal socialist regime. Only recommended to Stalin or Sanders supporters. With extensive enough modding, one might be able to balance out the game to reflect the rather counterintuitive real world, add a negative effect to the GDP from high taxes (thus creating a Laffer Curve), make loose gun regulations actually reduce crime, make prostitution and drug legalization and lower drinking limits reduce crime and alcohol addiction, etc. With the game in its current state, only those who support big government will enjoy it, cause it lets them live in the realm of fantasy, where the USSR is still a global superpower.

												The first play through I focused far too much on clean energy, the environment, and advanced technology and I lost the re-election. Because apparently people didn't like having clean air to breathe, no pollution, and being the most technologically advanced country in the world. You know, even though I was spending twice as much as I was making. The second play through I focused too much on the economy, GDP, and eliminating debt. Apparently people didn't like that and started joining gangs and mobs. I ramped up the police force to compensate for this, seeking a long term solution, when I was assassinated. By a group of extremist liberals. They'd rather have high crime than a secure police force. This time the income was greater than the expenditure, so I at least had that. And a couple pounds of C4. I used to have an everything. Then I was dust, dust in the wind. Sad face. Saaad face.This game is brutal. This game is unloving, and hates you. This game laughs at your petty politics. This game is great.Buy it.Just. Buy. It.			"

Want to crush the trade unions and allow business to thrive? Crush to your heart's content. You may even convince yourself you'd make a great leader.Two hours later, however, you may just find yourself with 2% popularity, draconian controls in place, taxes as high as possible whilst refusing to permit any kind of welfare, and yet laughing gleefully.This is a very, very fun game.

												As a fan of the 2nd Democracy game, I find this one some what lackluster. While the improved visuals and improved access of information is a good and much needed improvement, the way your choices affect things is very dissappointing. If you play in America for instance, and make one pro captlist policy, chances are you will be assaisanted from the socialist party in 3 turns. The biggest error I found was when I made a policy to prevent racial discrimination, I was assasinated by the ""Black Power"" party for being racist. This was when I was playing on normal difficulty. This game has its problems, but if you are a fan of the first two, you might like this one still.			"

												This game is a great way to see how various issues affect each other in the political system of your country and others. I think it helps you answer the question a little bit better .. ""could you do better as President?"" Not that our President is playing a game like this ;)   His job is of course far far difficult than this. The tutorial system is _much_ needed when you start out as there is a high learning curve. I am still learning things as I play. I only wish the tutorial wasn't so much reading and more audio or a combination thereof. As far as ""fun"" goes... I guess it is entertaining enough to keep me playing. The game is educational and insightful due to the subject matter. The game is light on the system and plays well on my 2011 mac mini.  "

The subtleties of running an economy whilst trying to please every corner of your political spectrum is captured perfectly!This is a game for the thinkers and the planners. If you are a little more ""click now... see what happens later"" you may find yourself quickly assisinated or overthrown by your rival political party!There is no such thing as an average game length as games CAN, but rarely do, last for an infinte number of turns. Overall I rate this as a solid 3/5.  A good similuator for those people who often say ""why doesnt the government do X... or if I was in power I would change Y"".			"

Once you're able to balance out your GDP so that it's not overly affected by the global market crashing every 10 or so turns (which is about 1 minute worth of speed clicking waiting for something to happen), the game gets pretty stale, as nothing new and unusual ever throws you into a state of flux anymore.

												This game teaches you just how difficult it can be to run a country. It also taught me just how important finances are when making policies.Allow me to elaborate. I've played through this game twice. The first time, I paid little attention to finances and wound up tearing down the US's credit rating to CC, upsetting the nation, and nearly getting assassinated before I decided to stop playing.The second time, I paid a lot of detail to the finances and made sure the nation was always earning a surplus through taxing those who could afford it (but not so much that they'd leave). By the time I had spent two terms in office, there was practically no crime, the nation was a healthy one, the credit rating was at an AA, the nation had a reserve of 3 trillion dollars, my approval rating was around 99%, and the world was a great place.It also shows just how much better we'd be off if a good, effective leader was able to pass policies without sending it through a gridlocked Congress and Senate. In the game I played, a lot of problems were solved and America went from being deep in debt to being a pretty prosperous nation. Meanwhile, here in real-life America, we're still living a pretty depressing life with little done over a lot of problems because nothing can be passed.I think every elected official should have to play this game and do well in it before going into office. Perhaps it'll teach them a thing or two about how to run the country. :PAnyways, on with the game, it's entertaining and it looks really nice. I don't know if I'd pay 30 bucks for it (I got it on sale for about 10 bucks), but if you can get it on sale, it's a great game and it's really fun to see just how well you might be able to run the country.

												There are not many games like this one. It is really something different, certainly not a mainstream strategy game. It gives you a little bit of insight on the politics of various countries (although it could certainly use a much variable palette) and it puts you behind the decision making process of the highest level. I really do believe that this game can teach many people something new about how governments, elections, economies or political parties work. The responsibilty and possible consequences of your actions dropping on your people really feels ""authentic"", although all you see is just numbers and graphs.But keep in mind that it may get quite repetitive in some time, you basically just solve every situation with moving various sliders representing various ""units"". And sometimes it can be really frustrating that you can deal with some problem that would under different circumstances would not matter and everything could be much easier only if you'd have enough support from your ministers or your budget could cover it.There are also several mods so far, that can make scenarios even more unpredicatble and challenging and that is certainly a big plus.And one more thing - this game is 100 % NOT worth 23€. Bought it on Summer Sale for around 8€ (which I think is quite OK). DLCs for 5€ are IMO also hugely overpriced, I'm not going to buy them until they drop to at least 1€ per each.			"

Some countries are harder to manage than others, but I suspect the difficulty varies based on your own political leanings.			"

Want to crush the trade unions and allow business to thrive? Crush to your heart's content. You may even convince yourself you'd make a great leader.Two hours later, however, you may just find yourself with 2% popularity, draconian controls in place, taxes as high as possible whilst refusing to permit any kind of welfare, and yet laughing gleefully.This is a very, very fun game.

												Despite how it may appear before you purchase it this game is incredibly simplisic and lacks any real depth. The first term begins in the middle of the recession so your goals are obvious and if you can survive the first election at the end of your 4 years (not that easy) then you have essentialy won the game, you can continue to improve everything and I now recieve 100% of the votes in every election, without any kind of fraud. The only people who dont vote for me are people who dont vote! As someone else has said the ministers do absolutely nothing, they are there simply to generate the required political capital each turn in order to inact policies. When they are losing loyalty because the people they represent arent happy then they tell you that but offer no suggestion or ideas of how to address the issue, you are essentially one man running modern Britain or wherever u choose to start. Although this sounds like a promising Idea I would avoid it, even for £10, it felt thin and I purchased the expansions when I bought it.			"

A;ways having to take away from one group to give to the other. The wealthy hated me the whole way through the game as i just took all their money to fund my projects into new sciences, a PRO-ACTIVE healthcare system and eradicating crime by upping the police force which in turn reduced unemployment. I was a trillion in debt at one point but bounced back to end the game a trillion in the green. I was the United Kingdom (My country). I only wish it was so straight forward to fix this country.			"

It's feels like a ""toy"" more than a game but it's certainly worth tinkering with if you have even a passing interest in politics.  Tries to be complex without being unwieldy and falls a little short on the complexity side but is by no means simplistic.

												This is a very very very good game! I do highly recormend it! The economy in this game is a bit unrealistic but there are mods to fix that.

In my own personal expeinace i play as a capitialist and and i end up making a lot of money and getting everyone to vote for me and this is a  never ending cycle. There are natural disasters but there are only a limited amount of political disasters which are easily fixed and reaccuring.The positives of this game is that dispite the economy not being that realistic and the social engineering DLC didnt add as many campeighns to change the mind of the voter as i would have liked this still one of the best and most realistic political simulators on the market and anyone who enjoys this genre should pick this game up.

												I thoroughly enjoyed Democracy 2 and noticed Democracy 3 was on sale in the Humble store so I picked up a copy.The games are virtually the same, the experience feels no different than Democracy 2, with only noticeable cosmetic adjustments and a few new options. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but why pay for the exact same game with a new coat of paint?As far as game-play itself goes, it's enjoyable, but a bit frustrating at times. Things can go from perfect to terrible in just a few turns. I was doing great earlier, Unemployment was low, and GDP was at an all time high, I skipped a few turns and then suddenly I had rampant racial tensions that came seemingly from nowhere. I had ghettos and inner city riots soon after, and only solution to curb the issue was ridiculously strict border controls and strict citizenship tests.			"

												After weathering a tough recession and several credit rating downgrades, I had all but lost hope when the foreign mortgage market crumbled again and my GDP hit rock bottom. My electorate had turned to alcoholism; a coping mechanism for spiralling unemployment and poverty. But then, light at the end of the tunnel. That long term investment in research, state education and health paid-off. New industries were created, the skills of the populace were enhanced, and productivity sky-rocketed as the workforce abandoned their stress-induced boozing. As my deficit disappeared I diverted the extra funds towards improved state housing schemes and food stamps; appeasing my core liberal vote and ensuring the middle classes didn't have to look at unsightly homeless people. I had alienated the religious, banning the teaching of creationism in schools, but they barely had a voice anymore. Not with so many of my supporters reaping the benefits of a STEM lead economy. Now I just need to work out how to deal with those obese, conservative capitalists...			"

												Democracy 3 is a fun and complex game for those who are politically interested. It takes a while to fathom the interface and mechanics of the game, but once you've grasped it, virtually living out your own political ideology is piece of cake. One of the major downsides  to Democracy 3 is the neverending risk of assassination, and the fact that I find it very hard to accomplish a succesful society that isn't heavily socialist. This has been commented on in several fora; a potential bias favoring socialist tendencies. Some of the achievements, particularly one, is virtually impossible to get, which I find endlessly annoying. Despite these faults, it's really a great game.			"

												I don't really like how this game works. Instead of pitching your ideas to any democratic body, you're given complete freedom to pick whatever laws you want. The checks and balances, however, are a bunch of people who will kill you if you don't make the right decisions. The weird result of this is that you can do funny-seeming stuff like cutting the police force budget to the point where armed vigilante mobs roam the streets, while keeping the upper-class voters happy by funding gated community initiatives.It's a funny head image, but it's also not 'Democracy.' The only stuff that gets voted on is whether or not you kept a large enough portion of the electorate happy when election day comes around. It's a cool game, but it's missing the PR and backroom dealing that make politics (and especially political simulators) interesting.			"
