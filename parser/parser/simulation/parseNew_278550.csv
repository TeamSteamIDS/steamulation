												Initial Perception.OK. So being an old fan of Transport Tycoon, I had seen A-train a number of times, and had not bought it, as I was never really convinced that it was going to be a good game. It always seemed to be a mess of complex options, and half built cities with the player left to simply re-arrange the rail options of the already working city. It also seemed like it was too diverse, with a mix of both city management, and not really enough depth for transport management.I could not have been more wrong.**A-Train 9 V4.0 : Japan Rail Simulator**So I saw this new version,  intiially discounted it as I thought it was really expensive. Again my initial impression was ""Meh ..... not sold on this at all."" So I waited and I bought this on a sale for something like $20  (Wow was I lucky - a complete steal ) Having played it, I believe it is actually worth the high price tag. This is simply THE most impressive transport and logistics management game or rather simulation that I have ever played.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, with a design unique to this game. They are almost cartoon like, but not quite. the detail is amazing,  and even when zoomed at high resolution the game really looks very sweet.The first thing I decided was that I was going to actually put some time in, and learn the game. - For anyone considering buying this game, this is critical. It does have a learning curve, you will need to experiment. There is no instant gratification. That said there are tons of youtube videos. One set I found particularfly good was from ""Monte"" , Monterico Gaming -  https://www.youtube.com/user/montericotips   who has a very nice set of tutorial videos on Atrain 9, check him out, and give him a like. The guy has put in a great deal of work, and his videos are well worth watching, and explain in great detail how to get started - Thanks Monte, Much appreicated.Dont expect a half hearted point and click sim city clone, as the depth and wealth of options in this game is absolutely incredible. The first thing I did , was to understand how to create a new map, on the map generator, with nothing at all on it. This is incredibly easy, and the player has complete control over how they would like their game world to look. Options range from the amount of water, to the height and distribution frequency of the mountains. The player can have an archipeligo with a number of islands connected by bridges, or a large landmass, with a single coastline, or anything in between. The options are limitless.Once you decide on how you want your world to look you then build your transport network. You have options to add buildings, and subsidiaries, but your main task is to ensure the flow of materials. This is where the logistics of the game come in. You create a factory. The factory will produce raw materials. However the raw materials sit in the ""shipping"" bay of the factory, and are not useable by any 3rd party who wishes to use themYou own the factories, so you do not make a profit unless the materials are used. Therefore you need to ensure that the materials are moved from the factory, through a distribution centre , to a freight storage area. This can be done either by rail, or by truck , depending on which method of transport is more suitable.So once you move the materials, they can be purchased to build houses, shops offices etc, in your city. You gain profit by selling the materials, however you need to absorb the logistics cost of moving materials to various distribution centres to ensure the growth of your city. You then have the opportunity to provide a transportation network to your digital citizens who inhabit your city. This is in the form of a Bus network, a rail network and a subway system.This is where you can make the profit in running a transportation network. I think the big difference here is that in many transportation games, you already have customers, and simply need to provide transport, Here you can provide freight transport of materials to build a city, which will in turn provide the opportunity for a transportation system. The depth is incredible. I have to say I am totally hooked on this game. There is so much to do. If you find yourself running low on funds, you can buy and sell shares on the stock market. This is pretrty easy, and can make the game a little easy, but if you only use it as needed, and work to ensure your transport network becomes profitable, then its just a useful backup.This game will drag you in. If you are a fan of train fever, and Transport tycoon then this game is definitely worth the money without question. I would pay $50 for this game, and be very satisfied. Just bear in mind, it does need some time to get used to it. Setting options for stations, where trains arrive and depart on different platforms, and move to different tracks is very powerful, and allows you to manage multiple trains on a route and switch tracks at intersection points ( which you can lay when laying tracks) but takes a little time to get your head around. Once you get it, the possibilites click, and you can make something as simple as a country station with 2 tracks, to a thriving metropolis hub with multiple tracks and platforms with trains arriving and departing 24/7I love this game, before this, train fever was the closest I had seen to transport tycoon, but this is like a simulated virtual train set, where you configure the game world and run it as you see fit. I cant recommend this highly enough. Whether you wish to spend the full price on it or not , is up to you. I can understand why you would question it, as I did.  I think the marketing on this game actually underplays what it is capable of. Its very modest in comparison to some games. I was really pleasantly surprised. This will definitely be one of the games that has a permanent place on my hard disk, and one of the games that I will return to time and again. I usually dont spend a lot of time reviewing a game, unless I feel really strongly about it. This one is worth it. Pros : Incredible depth, Beautiful cartoon like graphics, huge game world, Complete transport and logistics simulation, trains, trucks, and busses, city management elements, complete control over materials logistics and transport.Cons: Price seems a little high, steep learning curve, needs time to show real potential.Recommend : Definitely YES			"

												I finally took a dive into the manuals to figure this game out. Now that I have played a bit more I continue to find gems in the game that make it shine. That full price is scary and hope that changes but the game does have a lot to offer from transportation to city building to watching it snow in the winter. Here is my first look into the game.

												This is a pretty enjoyable economic simulator / city builder, with several flaws. Actually the gameplay is good and addictive, albeit a bit shallow, and my negative evalutation is mainly due to the price. Considering that is just an updated version of the original A-Train 9 with some improvements, the current price (€.54,99) is too high. I suggest to buy it only if discounted to €.20/25.PROs: - building and developing cities is very addictive with a lot of buildings to choose in every category. - building complex rail networks is fairly easy and fulfilling. - very powerful editor. - scheduling trains is easy and enjoyable.CONs: - the track tool lacks automated terraforming, so negotiating with steepy grades is achieved with unaesthetic viaducts, and can also be very frustrating because of terrain obstacles.  - there is a lack of some instruments in map editor, like automate trees spreading. - the buildings built by Ai don't align with roads. - there are no objectives, missions or campaigs of any sort. The game is only a gigantic sandbox. - the world feels empty because there are neither AI cars or people. - there are only japanese trains in game and only few trains are really profitable and useful. - a catenary tool is available but is a bit flawed (however catenaries are only cosmetics). - the difficulty seems hard for beginners, but since you grasp the basics, it's rather easy, and you'll swim in money. - the stock exchange dynamics, when you grasp it, are very unrealistic and more like a money cheat.

												On the fence but no can not recommend this game sadly, especially at this price point.   Some say it's rich and complex, yet when you begin to peel back the layers, at least I find that's not the case.   The AI builds randomly in a hodge podge of buildings mixing in residential with industry and industry with agriculture resulting in not being able to build a realistic city; that is without without reserving all the land and placing buildings yourself or building directly in the editor.  If I wanted to place all my buildings I'd be playing another city builder that also includes transport, 3 come to mind.  Realistic growth is not possible from the AI and that's a shame, in fact it's a game breaker for me.  For those that think I did not give it enough time I was a version 3 owner, so familiar with the basic of the game from the start, frankly I had the same complaints with the prior version but had not played it in so long had forgotten why I disliked it.Scheduling trains and laying out track and roads is where the meat of the game is, but once you realize you have little control over how your city develops all the fun goes away, sure you can supply parts of the city differently with goods and passengers but the ai is still going to build randomly regardless.  I'm not looking for simcity zoning here, but an AI that follows my lead at least a little when I place a subsidiary is what I would like to see. A moderator or dev here mentioned making some videos, should those show my points wrong I will gladly change my review.  If you don't mind placing all your buildings yourself or using the editor to build cities then this game may be for you, but if you want your city to grow organically around you in a semi-realistic manner I'd have to say look elsewhere.

												IF THERE'S A SALE, BUY IT; OTHERWISE, NO.Usually Steam (and all other overseas) versions differ from the original by that train sets are heavily confined, while I think about 2/3 of the game's price depends on that very thing.The Steam release of V4 worths more than its predecessors by including a few Japanese trains, but I'd say $25 to $30 is all it deserves.  I paid just $19.99 at a Steam Sale.  Good luck!			"

												One of my fav. game now! This game might be complex, and hard to make profit at first, but this ""complex"" is the reason why the game is fun. I played train fever, cities in motion 2, but none of the game reaches this realistic simulation. This game allows players to not only lay tracks and build stations, but set timetable for each trains. I might adjust the timetable so there will be less train at night and more trains at rush hour, or make express trains stopping at only the big station, or even a limited express train connecting the rural area, and the central city. Now, my main line has a tight schedule, with local, semi-express, express, commuter express, limited express, and commuter limited express running. It is worth every cent. 10/10, Best Game			"

												This is a true-to-life simulation game - do not expect it to be easy. You'll face a challenge at every corner. At the same time this offers immense depth and complexity that scales with anything you can imagine.Best tip: take it slow, read guides and try not to get frustrated when you lose.			"

												The trains are similar with what we used in Jakarta. So, this game for me is basically a casual one with a feel of familiar. Placing tracks is still not hassle free			"

												Like in City Skylines I'm rubbish at economics and making a profit but A-Train seems even harder to make money. So I stuck it in sandbox mode and just practiced building and making timetables and routes and I've never played it as a serious game since.That's not to say it's not a great game. If you are like me and just enjoy planning and construction and making pretty cities and watching them grow then its the best game going.I set a big map, started in the middle and worked my way out. It's now months old and the map is almost full.It's a great way to relax for an hour, working on lines and routes and watching it grow.It would be nice if saved maps synced with your other devices. I play both on the PC and on my laptop and I have to copy the saves across if I want to work on a map on another device.Apart from that it's a great game and one I will be playing a long long time.

												I really liked this game and had fun building my city. Adding multiple trains on a track and even heading different directions was very fun. The only thing that stopped me playing was the lack of life. No people...no traffic...no life... Only the trains and trucks you place. Fun game just made me feel really lonely. Why was I bothering making all these train line and bus routes for ghosts? With some life like cities skylines or even transport fever would have made this game a lot cooler. If you like the looks of this game get it on a huge sale or even check out transport fever.			"
