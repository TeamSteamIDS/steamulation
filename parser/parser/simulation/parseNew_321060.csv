								Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme Hyper Turbo Tournament Edition The Movie The Game featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series is a visual novel fetish game. If you are expecting this game to be a commentary on anything or an interesting look at a different perspective, for example someone transitioning between genders, then do not play this game.At its core, DNA Twister is a visual novel game which decides to give the player several shallow characters rather than one or two indepth paths like you would find in Japanese visual novels. I suppose you could draw a comparison to an CYOA novel, but it lacks the same feel as that kind of game. I will fully admit I read the bare minimum of text in this game because the writing in this game is really bad. Everything is stupid and cheesy but lacks self awareness. For example, the scientists who made the drug that makes you become a sexy woman work for a company called Abbadon. The writing just feels sophmoric, shallow and at some points blatantly insulting. I considered writing more indepth on the story but I feel that it would be disingenious as this game is clearly not made for me. I do not have a huge passion for webcomics and I do not have a transformation fetish or gender bending one, and most of my comments would be on how stupid the characters are, which is a moot point. I will say, if you do love webcomics and have a laundry list of fetishes or you are Bulgarian, then seek professional help and buy this gameThe art is bad, but I suppose that goes without saying. The phrase ""deviantArt"" gets thrown around a lot, but frankly, the art in this game is embarassing. The women stand at impossible angles, destroying their spines. Their bodies have long, weird stomachs with too small hips and giant balloon sized breasts. Perhaps it'd be best to describe the art as beloning to a bad webcomic? Really, that's what this game feels like.One final thing I want to address is how gross this game made me feel at times. Now, before you assume I'm going to take some sort of moral high ground and condemn it for sexualizing women or something, I am not. I do not particularly find the T&A appealing, but that's my own view on sexuality and aesthetics. What left me feeling gross is the childish, and very stupid message the game shoves down your throat. It's not, as one might expect, ""Wouldn't it be cool to see what life was like if you were the opposite gender?"" where maybe the characters get to experience the good and the bad of being a woman, or something. You know, freaky friday style trials and tribulations that cause them to grow and better understand themselves and the female gender? DNA Twister, obviously, does not do this. What it does do is give the message ""Everything would be better if you were a girl!"" which to me is really unnerving. All but one of the characters (from when I last played at least) was totally fine with being a girl. They totally embraced sexy clothing and in multiple characters' paths they spend entire nights masturbating (I am not kidding). It's this eye rolling drek that makes the whole thing feel like it was written by a 15 year old who loves boobies. The worst of it comes at the end of the fetish monster Dina (my pebbles) story where she talks to the one character unhappy with being a woman. The dialog essentially boils down to: ""I don't want to be a woman forever Dina!"" ""Fred, I know you say that, but deep down you actually want to be a woman."" ""Wow Dina you really changed my views on this.""That left me slackjawed in awe of how oblivious the writer(s?) of this game are.Other highlights include: Black character grows straight, white people hair upon becoming a woman. Horrific breast expansion. Tons of implied masturbation. And an epic quest of self discovery.In conclusion, this game is really good. Buy it now folks!PS: As an aside, the devs were helpful and polite when it came to getting my key onto steam and did so fast so there's that. "

								I highly believe in giving things a fair chance before I throw my chips into a bowl, so, after having actually played it, I can say that this game is rather callous to Transgendered issues, at least over the course of the first two routes (if there is places it does this better, please let me know)You can generally tell what is going to happen long before it does. Since each character tells you precisely what they include (How many endings, what types of strangeness they will encounter) any real surprise is removed before it can sink in. You're left scrolling through lives that you can figure out precisely where they may be going (accurately) long before they get there. After about an hour, you start reading the text simply to confirm you were invariably right.The game is insensitive, and honestly I'm a bit hurt that someone could even make something like this. The artists have deleted several threads filled with honest criticism of the title, but they are also at the same time incredibly helpful both to me and others. They are just trying to stand by the game they made.I find myself genuinely conflicted, because distasteful art is still art. Even if I think what they show here is 'bad', it's designed with someone else in mind, and I wonder if that person really deserves for me to demonize their fun. In any case, I do not personally recommend this game to others. If this is your sort of thing, you could do well to wait for a good sale in any case.			"

								Edit 6/26: And now I've gotten my refund from Steam! Huzzah!Okay, let's do this thing. I'm somewhat ashamed that I bought this game. This does coincide with my interests, and I felt like supporting an indie dev. It also got endorsements from a few webcomics I read, which also lead me to take an interest in it. If it were five or ten dollars, I would feel less ashamed, since I wouldn't feel quite so ripped off. In a world where Chroma Squad is 15 bucks, this game is a hard sell. I am not a troll and I am not a hater; in fact, I am somebody who is probably the EXACT TARGET AUDIENCE of this game.Now, I'll admit that I haven't played all of the paths. I stayed away from the anthro-heavy arcs because that isn't an interest of mine. I played through Dina, Yael, Dan, Nadine, and dabbled with a couple of the others. Positives- * Um... er... Dan's cute. I feel sorry for Yael. I could feel something for THOSE two characters. * I'm REASONABLY sure I don't have cancer afterwards. Okay, now that we've gotten the nice things to say out of the way, let's get to the meat of this. This is not a good game. This is not a good story. This is not good porn. It tries to be all three of these things and largely fails. First, let's look at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme as a game. Now, I'm not going to get into the ""are visual novels games"" argument. I'll accept here that a visual novel qualifies as a game because it's at least somewhat interactive (you make choices and there are branching paths). The number of choices are fairly limited and a couple (I think specifically of Yael choosing to slack off or not before the accident) are pointless and have no impact. I love alternate universe stuff and thinking about what might have been, but none of these endings were worth the effort to make save states to see how things play out. The differences are either insignificant or horrifying. This is more of a game than, say, Sakura Spirits (watch the Game Grumps playthrough of that, it's hilarious), but I didn't feel engaged. This is because of...The story. Oh Lord, the story. This game actually has a surprisingly in depth story, as the playable characters weave in and out of each others' paths. And that story, for me, crashes and burns because of the character Dina. (It would be on life support if she wasn't the horror that she is, but she kills it). Dina is selfish. She wanted to be a woman with enormous jugs, so she decided to make a serum to make that happen. Fair enough. The accident at the start of the game that forcibly transgendered everyone was unintentional. Fair enough. Dina's actions afterwards are horrible, however. She promises to help work on a cure. She instead works on something to make her more buxom. She tests that buxomizing formula on a character who wants nothing more than to turn back to normal on the theory that ""big boobs are awesome, and Yael's a jerk anyway, so forcibly altering his body further is AOK."" She enjoys messing with people, has no responsibility, no EMPATHY for the people whose lives she ruined and is never punished for any of this. She doesn't even lose her job and in fact becomes stinking rich. The game clearly wants me to think that she's a funny character. She is not. I hate her and everything she stands for. The rest of the cast are more or less ""insert body type fetish here."" Short and Busty? Dan. Sorta regular looking brunette? Yael. And so on and so on.I mentioned earlier that the branching paths often ended up being horrifying. The game does not regard them as horrifying. The game regards them as funny or sexy. However, paths where a character loses everything they have and is forced to transform into a half human creature and be objectified all day to make a living is horrifying to me. Paths where a character makes it QUITE clear that they have no interest in making already large boobs larger and is then forced into it by someone who claims to love them is horrifying to me. Sure, the characters accept this, but they do not feel like human characters. Everyone is EXTREMELY blase about everything that happens to them. The characters I actually sorta liked were Yael and Dan, and that's because I thought that their reactions to the whole thing (being miserable, at least to start) made SENSE. The game also has numerous romantic pairings. These relationships are rapid and forced but we're supposed to take them as being extremely romantic because... shut up, that's why! Clearly these characters who have been women for a week are able to make lifelong romantic decisions with people they've often JUST met! Because that's healthy! If I were transgender, I'd be insulted by how seamless and easy this game makes the whole thing seem. Now, you'd be justified in saying to me, ""You fool, you're obsessing over nonsense like gameplay and story when clearly this is just mindless smut based on a transformation fetish! You're just supposed to turn off your brain and be turned on!"" Well, (despite some comments I saw in the Steam forum to the contrary), that is exactly what this is supposed to be, though there's no law saying that your porno needs to have a character as hateful as Dina. Well, the art really gets in the way of that. I'm no artist and I couldn't do better. I fully recognize this. But the character models are often inconsistent from shot to shot. There are sexy ideas utterly ruined by the execution, as I think to myself, ""Is that Yael? I can't be sure... yeah, that's the same jacket, I suppose."" Especially jarring are the stylistic shifts you see in images where it ISN'T the character's ""talking"" body with a different outfit thrown on. The art has been described as amateurish and wannabe anime. I can't disagree with this. If this game was still in alpha and the images were placeholders along the lines of ""pants to be darkened,"" it'd be acceptable. If this were a free beta with the promise of future improvements, it'd be acceptable. I've seen no evidence of any future improvement in the art in the materials I've read. This game costs more than Final Fantasy VII (a primitive looking game with infinitely more style than this one) on Steam. There is no excuse. There are also a lot of head scratching artistic decisions. Characters like Dan and Ben are always feeling themselves up in public in scenes where they really SHOULDN'T be, based on the dialogue, just because the artist didn't draw another placeholder shot. The anthropomorphic characters are horrifying to look at because of how the hair is drawn. The ultrabusty characters are horrifying to look at, eliciting sympathy rather than attraction. Even with perfect line art, these decisions would still make the game hard to look at. In closing, notice how many times I used the word horrifying in this? Yeah, there's a reason for that. It is. I could see someone having a good laugh at the whole thing, but for me, I just come away feeling bad for myself for even giving this a second glance. Also, anyone trying to fool themselves that this isn't a borderline hentai is in denial. TL/DR: Do not buy. I wish I had a physical copy of the game so I could burn it.			"

Early Access Review
								My earlier review was too long for Steam, so here’s the abridged version.GBDNATE purports to be a Visual Novel about a couple of researchers who devise a serum that changes the gender of anyone exposed to it. A lab accident occurs, hilarity (in theory) then ensues, and all of the exposed people have to cope with the ramifications of the gender swap.What The Ad Copy Leads You To Believe: This is a zany, gender-bender comedy extravaganza along the lines of Ranma 1/2 that portrays the hilarity of a diverse cast of characters having to adjust ‘to wearing a bra in the morning’ (per the devs). That said, the title is also allegedly sensitive to the many difficulties transgendered individuals face in modern society.What The Title Actually Is: The extended, misogynistic, self-insert fetish fanwank of two boys who wish they were hot lesbians, and whose comprehension of gender issues and cultural sensitivity lies slightly below that of Chris Brown.How Much Have I Played: Every route of every character thus far released, from Yael to their latest character, Nadine.As someone on the discussion boards pointed out, a Visual Novel needs to have: Art, Story and Gameplay. GBDNATE is wanting in all three categories.The ART in GBDNATE has been called “anime style”, and that style is fairly common for VNs. The style itself would work, if not for problems with:Basic Anatomy - Even by anime standards, the characters’ proportions are grotesque. Hands and feet are awkwardly avoided or poorly drawn. Character poses (especially Steph) would require breaking the character’s spine.Clothing - The artist doesn’t seem to know how cloth hangs on the human body, nor how light shines on it. He also thinks every woman dresses like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Perspective - Backgrounds defy the rules of perspective drawing, and the characters (who are flatly drawn) appear simultaneously in front of and behind other objects.Eye Bubbles - The characters’ eyes look more like lizard eyes than eyes with light reflections.I’d encourage anyone who wants to see the art to look at the screenshots or download the demo.The STORY in GBDNATE is not one story where you play the character you want. GBDNATE is implemented as separate (8 now, 13 total planned) stories that have some events (the explosion) in common, but otherwise contain too many inconsistencies to be deemed a perspective shift.The first seven routes have none of the Setup / Conflict / Resolution narrative structure of a VN at all, so they read as “stuff happens until it stops”. The eighth route (Nadine) is the only route with a coherent narrative.The characters in GBDNATE are flat and largely indistinguishable. Yael and Nadine are the most coherent characters; Lynn and Dina are the developers’ Mary Sues (with all the problems thus engendered), while the rest of the characters are forgettable. They all talk and think with the same narrative voice, despite differences in age, gender, education, social standing and anything else.Good character ensemble humor comes from the interplay of different, well-defined personalities (think Rumiko Takahashi or Seinfeld), but since the characters are poorly (often inconsistently) defined, there’s no humor in their interaction. They’re just lifeless boob joke generators, and nothing more.With no humor, a fanwank title like GBDNATE should at least have a titilation factor, but all the sex scenes are rendered as follows:  … …… ………  “Was it good for you?”  Unless one finds ellipses to be erotic, there’s no titillation to be had in GBDNATE. The characters masturbate more than they connect with each other anyway (Yael actually sets a flag for this, sadly).In terms of the writing, the developers are violating the first rule of writing: “Write what you know”. Anyone with genuine experience in the sciences, technology, the law, sex or anything else will find much to bang their head on the desk over.Nadine’s route was especially bad. It strayed into the realms of science, computer hacking & security, legality, criminal investigations, corporate business culture, investing, and a variety of other fields in which the developers clearly have no knowledge or experience. Even the background art will make any computer-savvy player twitch.Mechanically, the writing is just not good. Tenses drift, continuity errors abound in all routes, there are plenty of spelling and grammar errors - it’s a hot mess. It’s not as hilariously bad as “My Immortal”, but it’s definitely a distraction in a format that relies on writing to convey 95% of the content.Nadine’s route was the worst offender in this category as well. My impression was that someone had spell-checked the hell out of it, but nobody ever sat down to proofread it with a red pen. Again, in a text-centric medium, solid editing is just as important as basic code testing.GAMEPLAY: Up until Nadine’s route, there is none. The first seven routes are nothing more than Choose Your Adventure novels (with very few choices). By making a choice, you choose which path the narrative goes down. What few choices you get often have no bearing on the content to which they lead, which means that making a single choice of “Stay At Work” leads inexorably to the Lesbian Catgirl Ending of that route. Things like sexual orientation are determined by getting haircuts and eating nachos.There are no skills to master, there are no meaningful status flags to set, there is no endgame to navigate, there are no deductions to make. In the first seven routes, there simply is no gameplay at all.They tried to change this in the Nadine route (which ends with a watered-down Phoenix Wright knockoff), but the only real “gameplay” here is in asking a few common sense questions in the right order. At no point is any information from the rest of the game required to navigate the endgame, and it’s quite possible to reach the optimal ending having never seen the rest of the story that leads up to it.Still, as badly executed and derivative as it was, I’ll give them credit for the attempt. It’s a positive sign that after over a year of being told that their title has no gameplay, they actually gave it a try in one route.CODE QUALITY: While not normally relevant in a review, I do have a couple of comments because of two factors:The developers didn’t write their own VN engine; they’re using a free one called RenPy.The developers are charging premium dollars ($25 as of this writing) for their title.Given that the developers are charging premium dollars for a title that’s just a script running on someone else’s engine, it better be a pretty amazing script.Thing is, it’s not.  GBDNATE is an absolutely appalling pile of spaghetti code that a) would not be accepted in a Comp101 class, and b) taps into almost none of the RenPy engine’s capabilities.There are far more robust RenPy games available for free on the RenPy website. There are far more robust RenPy games right here on Steam for far less money. GBDNATE simply is not implemented well, nor is it worthy of the ridiculous price tag hung upon it.FINAL SUMMARY:GBDNATE is a bad title, plain and simple.Do I recommend it? Well, if you share the developers’ fetishes, I’ll recommend that you download the free demo. If you like that, you’ll probably like the rest of it enough to buy it if they ever put a realistic price on it: say, $6.99 (the price of a trade paperback). It’s not worth any more than that, in my opinion.I’ve been asked by several people if GBDNATE is a “so bad it’s good” title. In my opinion, it’s not. It’s just dull and tediously bad, with mediocre art and way too many 5th grade boob jokes.			"

Early Access Review
								The most insensitive game ive ever played.Having a sex change doesn't simply come down to the fact you want to have boobs or look sexy, alot of people do it because they don't feel comfortable in their own bodies. Its especially hard to actually read on Zeke's storyline when pretty much every 2-10 minutes, he mentions the fact he was forcibly turned into a girl and infact he has a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing a okay point and everyone is like ""OMIGOD YOUR HOT."". Jeeeze, there is stuff like this all the way through the story and in fact its pretty cringeworthy. Its pretty much gag gift status, right up there with bad rats. I could seriously see this game hurting the feelings of some people, and its not really in anything else but the writing. The writing is definitely the worst part, i absolutely hated all the Gender Bended characters when they interacted with others, literally all they did was talking about being a girl and how sexy they were. Not everyone is going to be like that if you force them at will, in fact i'd imagine they would be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and sue you.  The other storylines are just as cringeworthy (and funny) but Zeke's one is absolutely the most ive ever gotten actually angry at a visual novel that i've had to force myself to finish reading through it so a word of caution.A Few Bug Issues.Occasionally the UI will have you thinking its your protagonist talking but instead its another character. Spelling mistakes galore, too! It makes you think that these guys haven't even heard of a spell checker, its a magical construct that actually makes sure you haven't ♥♥♥♥ed up grammatically!Ultimately what the hell else can you expect from Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme. Hell, i accepted it because i figured it would be a bit of a laugh to read and it is so, i guess this game has that. However, if your in it for the narrative side there are many alternatives. Stuff like Katawa Shoujo and Analogue : A Hate Story tell the story in a much more interesting way. In the end this game will always be ridiculous while with Katawa Shoujo and Hate Story in some parts its some top class writing. I'd like to take the time to tell you that Katawa Shoujo is Free, and Hate Story is much much less costly.edit: fixed a few typos.			"

												So I bought this game to mock with friends, I'd read the reviews, I'd seen how bad it seemed to be, but I was unprepared for the true depths of how shoddy this is. As soon as you boot it up, it blasts obnoxious, low quality techno music at you, while you're faced with low quality Deviantart OCs. I probably should have heeded this warning, uninstalled it and gotten a refund, but I sadly only reached that point 72 minutes later. The art is not only bad, it's inconsistent, with characters constantly being off model, to the point where parts of their clothes would change color in between sentences in ways that can't be explained by shading, the characters are mostly unlikable, and the Abaddon Conglomerate has the most supervillain-esque name of any fictional company I've seen. I felt ashamed owning this game, and I added♥♥♥♥♥♥like Imouto Paradise to my Steam. Don't buy this game, and if you bought it, aim for a refund. If you can't get a refund, get it removed from your account. Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme is an abomination of game design, and you should stay as far away as possible.			"

Posted: January 18, 2016
												So lets start this review with the question of WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GAME??? Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme (Is that the only ♥♥♥♥ing name for this game they could come up with? It sounds like they mashed together the names of a fetish porn and a arcade machine.) is a visual novel with some very light choices that dont pop up often. (Date this bland character or this other bland character) The VN it self claims to be ""A romantic comedy where a bunch of people become female"" Right off the bat that sounds pretty stupid, but it could have worked if you got someone like ernest hemmingway or quinten tarintino to write it. Lets jump right in to the review and see how ♥♥♥♥ed this whole thing really is. VISUALS/AUDIOPeople often call this game deviantart quality, this is an insult to the ms paint  fettish artist on deviantart. Honestly a painting elephant could make better visuals for this game.  The whole thing just looks strange, and it makes it worse comparing its self to anime and much better visuals of other cheaper visual novels on steam. Have you played SC2VN? Its visual style is very clean and colorful, and despite being koreanime, its a lot closer to the style then this drek. While I could tolerate the bad music in most other steam VNs, I muted the game the minute I heard whatever the hell the music was. I really don't know how to classify the genre of this crap, Somesort of girly pop with no lyrics? Stock free music from hell?STORYThis is the part that gets really bad guys, this is where the whole thing falls into the abyss. Firstly I would like to say if you are getting your idea of transgendered people from this game, go to this link http://w.itch.io/dys4ia buy and play dys4ia, a game that perfectly sums up what it feels like to be transgendered. If you dont want to shell out 5 bucks you could get a gay freind or something. This game's story and writting can all be summed up by the campain of one character, the most evil and despicable ""protagonist"" I have ever seen in a video game, Dina, the main character. Dina is a selfish juvenile monster. Lets look at dina's list of achievments. The whole plot started because Derek, thought he was transgendered (even though the people who made this game only think with their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and have no idea what transgendered people are like). Derek was actualy just obsessed with getting big boobs (so many dialoge boxes were wasted with derek obsessing over boobs). Derek then uses some really inacurate science to make himself into a female. Dina. He accedently turns all of his researchers into women. The researchers wer not told they were working on gender manipulation and did not want to become female. So instead of looking for a cure to un♥♥♥♥ several people's lives. Our protagonists works on way to make her boobs bigger. She makes a boob expansion serum and gives it to Yael,  the reasercher that hates being female the most. Dina tells Yeal that the big boob serum is a gender reversal serum. Yeal gets even bigger boobs and dina never changes her back, claiming being female is much better than bieng male. Instead of working on a cure Dina: gorges on nachos, gets drunk at a club (You can tell the authors are are little kids because dina acts the same drunk as when she is sober) and works on a way to make herself into a half human half whatever the hell monstorcity. BTW Dina never gets comeupance for the horrible things she has done, she just gets filthy rich.Oh and how can I forget this little detail. Dina goes to the mall and sees the researchers buying clothes. She then hides behind a plant and starts taking pictures of them. When the mall security gaurd Stephane, catches her she arrests dina for sexual assault. In the mall security office Dina claims she will delete all the pictures off her phone, stephane watches as she does this. Stephane goes to the next room to take care of some buisness, and Dina escapes, laughing at how Stephane didn't know that the pictures were backed up in the cloud.

Early Access Review
								WARNING: This review may result too long and even more if you don't imagine it with the voice of Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw. Yes, this is a rather weak attempt to do a review in the style of Zero Punctuation, given the fact that Yahtzee hasn't reviewed this game and it doesn't seem like he's interested in doing so.----------------It would be very narrow minded of me to say that all VN created by amateurs or fetishists suck, it's like saying that every shooter game released this day is a rather bland and weak work of copy pasting the same concepts but with different stories and some sort of different graphics (even when this is true 90% if the time). The fact is that there’s bound to be at least one thing to your taste in all different varieties of VN’s, be it about the most cliché story about heroes or mundane slice of life pseudo-comedies or even about sex maniacs that want to have sexual intercourse with every woman in the vicinities by sheer force of wank and luck. But it would be fair to say that there are certain popular trends in VN’s that tend to set off my “this is massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alarm. I would list them but thanks to this particular VN I don’t have to, now I can just point at Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme and say: “Pretty much that”.Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not sort of fascist VN connoisseur who cannot function without a sublime argument and jaw dropping CG’s, reading about nonsense, plastering your own dark and deep fantasies and making a plot that doesn’t appeal even the most twisted of fetishists is fine with me, as long as it brings me some degree of fun or enjoyment. I’ll make an except at making a VN with Mary-Sues so unbelievable ♥♥♥♥ed that you’ll start to wonder if those magical crystals you added to your coffee this morning were actually sugar. The game starts rustling my jimmies when it populates itself with a cast full of rapists, sociopaths and incarnations of fetishism and starts neglecting even the most insignificant amount of plot or even art decency because it’s too busy vomiting fetishes at us that makes me want to beat the faces of every character with a mallet.Allow me to expand, the abominable cast of characters lets you summarize what can happen when your entire VN is a walking abomination made of your own fantasies and the only thing the player can do is chug the ♥♥♥♥♥tream like there’s no tomorrow. There’s no reason to not add any ♥♥♥♥ed-up character but the game seems to be too busy eating its own♥♥♥♥♥♥and feces cake to care about it. It’s like a friend invited you to some convention, under the false promise of some food and fun, but then you realize that the convention is about ponies and your friend buys you a hamburger in apology, but no, you won’t forget this betrayal, oh no.The producers are trying to play the: “Intricate and deep story about transgender issues and society” card, but in truth you’re only invited to a party where the cake is only a cover of nice looking icing but under that there’s only♥♥♥♥♥♥and wank. It seems however that after all the rambling and rage about this game attracted the developers are only plugging their ears and yelling really loud: “IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT, DON’T BUY IT. THANKS FOR THE MONEY”, totally oblivious of the fact that here, in Steam, you can’t rate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you don’t buy it. There’s going forth with confidence and then there’s the developer whooping my nose with the tip of their big self-pleased stiffy. Not that I think that most amateur VN’s are sublime works of art that deserve the maximum amount of praise, some are only worth of a shot in the balls. But the only thing you need to do is not grabbing all the worse parts of every single trend and fetish in history and magnify it by 200000%.The “story”, if one can be so bold as to call it so, revolves around a pair of male “scientists” (a term that this game uses so loosely that the genitalia of the most concurred sex worker is cleaner than this) that are FIXATED with becoming females. And I made the word fixated big because it’s something that borders plain and pure madness. But not the kind of madness that makes you do the right thing in the wrong way, no, it’s the kind of madness that whispers in your ear and makes you wank in front of your parents. The kind of madness that was treated with electroshocks and brain lobotomy.Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme is a game that really makes me want to hate it because everything about it is twisted (get it?) to a degree where all that could possibly be remotely enjoyable has morphed into a horrible ball made of the most horrible nightmares. And there’s nothing wrong with nonsensical writing, there’s some charm to it in fact. But this shiny gold star I sticked for the attempt at nonsensical writing its almost immediately torn off for some truly abhorrent drawing and writing design. Genderbending: Fine. Genderbending with some animalistic tweaks: Fair Enough. Genderbending with the option of going full furry: Now we’ve dropped into the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness. But then there’s Gender Bending, with the option of going full furry, mermaid, goo girl and others mixed with the worst writing in the history of humankind and art worth of a 4th grader: And now the ocean of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness has closed over our heads.Lazy attempts at absurd aside, GBDNATE, strikes me as a rather mediocre attempt at a game. An argument as solid as farts and that whole speech about wanting to create a truly enjoyable game about living the life as the opposite team aren’t valid points when your whole game is just a pile of turds.  The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions, they say and this game sure makes you notice that you’re on a different kind of hell. Instead of red skinned fellows wielding pointy tridents you are pinned against sexual deviants, furries and mentally challenged people. Even when they try every single approach to the other routes, you can see that it’s just a misuse of a good formula.You see, if that were the only fatal flaw, we could call this game mediocre at best, and then go back to the wanking, but no, this is just the tip of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ iceberg. I’ve already mentioned the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art. And even when the artists says he’s trying to “improve” all I can really see is a moderate amount of effort being put in not sucking so much rather than stop being a complete disaster. IF at that you add the price tag, which is 25$ you can see with ease what the problem seems to be. Because, let’s be honest, if this massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥was only 2 bucks then then the only complains would be: “Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but for 2 bucks it’s a nice way of getting a giggle of two (If only you could call this an attempt at comedy), but no, the price is way high for a quality this low.At this point it seems that the developers are only trying to grab the most amount of cash in exchange for the least amount of effort. And no, the: “Then don’t buy it if you don’t like it” card cannot be played here, devs. Also, speaking of the green devil, I must remind (Or tell) you that this game was FUNDED before. Yes, the devs got even more money before they even got this game on Steam. And that makes you think that they could’ve hired better artists or a decent writer for this.Overall I can only recommend this game to masochistic ♥♥♥♥♥ that enjoy psychological pain rather than the physical one, but at some point you will also feel the physical pain. And you don’t have to tell me, I’ve spent 110+ hours in this thing reading every passage trying to find the most minimal trace of good writing but at this point I can safely assure that my adventure has ended in total and abysmal failure.Paying the full price it’s equal to asking a gentle colonoscopy. You won’t like it but you paid for it, and the guy who’s doing it it’s probably enjoying the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this.Rating; Welcome to Deviantart			"

								First of all let me get one thing straight I do not hate this game.but you do need to be a fan of fetish games of the gender blender games, if you want to consider buying this.the story is really basic and some of them are fun to play. but most of them are over the top with strange transformations.and they all seem really happy about it, so it has no realistic characters inside this game.becouse I would be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of if some one would turn me in the opisite gender for the fun of it.and would never ask to be turned into a zoo atractions (furry's) there is also an over opsession about boobs, like thats all girls are, and its so great and all,all in all I wish they did a better job on the story.I only liked 3 routes of all the routes they released.the game had a lot of fun ideas and great promise but that is all there is.I think they would have done better doing only 1 single character in a much bigger story thenwritng the same short story 14 times. with all characters you dont really have the time to get to know themalso it seems choises of other characters dont effect new characters. so for replay its no good.my first review of this game I was really mad about how this game was not given a fair change to build up.and allow the creators to fix some of there mistakes but as we continued and more characters released,I did not see any big inprovments on the early routes.still this was there first game they made and it was a good try. I dont think this one will get any better.as it is now. but if they do decide to make a new VN take this advice.just use 1 main character with several routes you can play and some bad ends.make a bigger story this one feels to rushed with the characters you play witch I do understand as almost all characters are about 2to3 hours long at best.the character art is as you see in the screenshots but sometimes the art does look awfull.this game has some mild nudity in it, and mention of sex but that is all.well I hope this helps some of you dicide, if you want to buy this game or not.my advice for this price go buy a other VN for I do find the price tag way to high for this gamethey are asking the same price for a 30+ hour VN of a much better Studio and those vn are voiced this one is not.ps sorry for spelling mistakes.

												If you have a fetish for this list of things:- Male to female transformation- Breast Expansion- Furries (Anthro) [sorry horse humpers]- Shoddy dialogue- Falling in love with your male friends once you've become a girl- and badly drawn artThen this is the game you should play. The deviantart tier art showcases how little budget went into art production when the game was heavily funded. It would seem like the developer only kept the artist because either A) The artist is the dev's friend or B) The artist pretty much did a lot of the art already or C) Both A and B. Most VNs don't need good art to be good but the artistic value in a fetish/harem VN should at least be more presentable than 7th grade ""decent"", considering that's exactly what this game is. It's a fetish game. You play as a male who gets turned into a girl. That's a fetish and also delves into the realm of transgender issues, but I'm not going to talk about that as I am sure this game doesn't even graze that subject, considering this is purely fetish and not social commentary. Then you can go further into your fetishes becoming weirder things or having body expansions. This game would be better as a dress-up game as I'm already falling bored of the character interaction and find nothing interesting in the characters. That could be due to the visual representation of them. Thanks again, art, for being so subpar. It seems like this could have been written by a young teen and you can notice the attempts of proper grammar leaking through the text as it feels forced. This is because the developer is French Canadian. I doubt they're a young teen, although fetish art this bad and fetish writing on Deviantart is generally young teenagers, which is pretty shocking when you think about it. On transformation it seems most of the characters instantly enjoy and embrace their feminine selves instead of trying to fix the damage that was done. This can be construed as the characters are all perverts or actually wanted to be females to begin with. I doubt this is even a plot point of the scientists who created this disaster, as they apparently do not have a clue what's going on. What I think makes this worse is the fact you get to have male love interests. I can understand embracing your feminine changes but these characters are almost right into it and ready to be girls. I guess if they wanted meat in them before this would make sense they'd be instantly okay with it as a girl.  Overall, there are better (and free!) VNs or games in general with fetishes that are more well played out than this game that you can jerk off too. I still recommend this game. It's a disgusting waste of $25 but if you want to show your friends how much you love buying them trash and you have the disposable income, you should buy this for them.			"

								Fetishy trash told through 8th grade art with a script I can only assume was written by Stephanie Meyer and anatomy proportioned by high school virgins. Highly reccomended.			"

												I bought this game as a gag for a friend one time. Now it's just here in my library, mocking me about my poor financial decisions. Bad plot, bad ""plot"", and weird fetishy nonsense EVERYWHERE. Not to mention the grammarical errors and that it's also twice as expensive as a REGULAR, HIGH-QUALITY VISUAL NOVEL.			"

								While I wouldn't recomend this game to my friends, I can say that there is more to this visual novel than meets the eye. No, I am not a furry and nor do I have any interest in the gender bending genre. However, there were several times that I couldn't help but chuckle at the dialogue. Honestly, I went into this with just knowledge of the screenshots, yet still I kept an open mind about what to expect. As such, I can see how this does appeal to some crowds and why it doesn't appeal to others. And for only 3 people working on this project, it is not half bad. Again, would I recomend it to others? No. Do I believe that it should be on Steam? I'm a bit conflicted there as I have seen other visual novels here, some with gameplay elements, others like this one. Either way, if this appeals to you, good on you. If not, don't trash the developer just because you don't like it.			"

												How To Enjoy This Game:See game for the first time, dismiss it as garbage.See game for the second time by showing it to a friend, friend laughs it off.Go look at game again because you get really bored one day.Go back to the page again and actually watch the video on the store page.Fully realize just how sub-par the game is.Return to store page to read reviews.Continue returning to store page because you now secretly want to see if the reviews are right.Keep going back to look at the video and screenshots, debating whether or not you should buy it.Convince yourself that this is quite literally the worst game ever created and that you will contract real world diseases by playing it.Decide It can't actually be THAT bad.Finally buy it.Install it.Boot it up.Realize the soundtrack is pretty good.Realize people weren't lying about the art style.Cringe a little at some of the writing.Keep playing.Realize that there's probably worse games out there.Realize that you didn't contract any real world diseases.Go back to play it at two in the morning after all of your friends go to sleep.Finally come to terms with the fact that you WANT to finish the game.You like it.You don't know why.You just do.TL;DRConvince yourself that this game will cause you physical harm with how bad it is, and when you get something better than that you will be satisfied. Applies to any game, really.			"
