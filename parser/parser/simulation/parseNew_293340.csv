												The Good Life description says that this is a game about building a ""commercial empire"" while becoming ""rich and famous"". However in reality, the game is so shallow that these descriptions are bordering on false advertising and misrepresentation. I'll briefly explain how the description provided is just barely met by the reality of what the game actually gives you.Do you build a commercial empire? Well, you do have a box that pops up occasionally to allow you to buy property. But that is the end of it, no further interaction from the player. I wouldn't call it management at all since you cannot even set a charge for renting these properties or influence them at all. What these do is function as bonus cash after you taxi clients from port to port. This brings me nicely onto the boating business aspect. When someone says the game is about running a business, there are some key elements required for that to really apply. Budgets, marketing, customer relations and employee relations are the core things which come to mind.  Well, The Good Life does require you work to a budget but everything else is absent. You apparently have employees because boats you own, but don't personally use, generate income like your other investments. But again, you don't actually influence any of that. Essentially your 'empire' consists of you personally picking up customers and taking them from A to B. Now this wouldn't really be too bad since games like Crazy Taxi actually made this kind of thing enjoyable but sailing empty waters in largely straight lines gets dull very fast and the highlight of the journey is the challenge of docking the boat without damaging it. One of the biggest mistakes the developers made is to give you the slowest boat in the game at the start and not explain that they can instantly buy a speed-boat instead. The developers should have simply provided the speed boat right away to avoid frustrating players.The description also says that this has exploration, treasure hunting and other activities. Well, since you cannot ever leave your boat the exploration is limited to looking at islands from the coast and while the diving sections do allow you to very slowly move around freely, there is only 1 small map which is used for every diving mini-game. There is fishing, but it is a mini-game that just generates some more cash and isn't profitable or serve any purpose in the larger scope of the game. There isn't any complexity to fishing other than pushing the up and down arrows keys to reel the line in or loosen it to stop the line from breaking. There are other trivial events which happen at random as well. Such as tossing life-preservers to rescue people in the water, the occasional pirate speed-boat for you to avoid and the laughable 'tornadoes' which appear from time to time. But none of these are very interesting.I can honestly say that while The Good Life sounds good on paper; what it gives you is a shadow of what it promises. Paying money for this game would be a big mistake even if it was on sale due to the limited entertainment value and what basically boils down to as leveling system where you invest time and energy to just see your bank balance grow. It lacks personality, a sense of progression or achievement and it just barely manages to even qualify as a game at all, due to how shallow the content is.			"

												Why don't ""they"" make more games like this? I really like this game a lot! Basically, this is a game about moving to the tropics and taking over a small boat transportation enterprise. You spend most your time transporting people from island to island (for a fee), while acquiring the money to help build your tourist industry empire (via bidding on properties that pay rent). There are also missions that have you skin diving to collect treasure and find downed vintage helicopters, etc... You also have the opportunity to fish (which I have yet to get the full hang of). As you gain money and property, you also gain reputation. And yes, you can buy different boats and so on as you increase your funds (and it is all fairly open ended). The game apparently ends when (you go broke or) you drive all of your competitors out of business. Haven't got to that point yet...  :)The game takes a little getting used to as far as the controls, but its smooth sailing (sorry) once you do. There are some minor issues that the developer is on top of and he has already released a patch addressing some of them and adding improvements (literally acknowledging the individual players who suggested them). He is very engaged on the ""discussions"" board and obviously, is very open to those of us who have made suggestions. THIS is the kind of communication that you hope for from a developer! I'm really excited about the possibilities that might be included and the tweaks that will be made. Because this game is really fun to me .... And I believe it can be even more fun as its further refined.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  The idea of the game seems very cool.  Pros:- The water is just beautiful!Cons:- Game controls are very weird and hard to get used to.- The boats are SLOOOOOW! even a speed boat is'nt much faster than the rickity boat you get in the beginning.- I was thinking there would be so much more to this game but your really just a water taxi for tourists, about 90 percent of the game is transporting people. Sure there are little side distractions, but they are just that, distractions.- When diving the controls are so bad its almost impossible to do anything underwater.- The clouds look like packs of UFOS- The dolfins sound like a bird of prey rather than a sea creature- The pirates are just weird.  It looks like they are shooting yellow nerf balls at you.  They are terrible shots and it dosen't even affect the strategy of the game much.  Just a weird distraction.Having said all of that, I hope the designers keep improving this game, because I think it could be turned into something great.  It seems like it just needs a bit more tweaking.			"

												So fun game so far, slow casual pace with plenty to do. Appears to be a lot to do in order to reach the end.Controls are fine once your used to them and basics are explained well in the tutorial.Visuals are nothing spectacular but are plesant to look at and have found no ingame bugs in my 2hrs of play.Only bug so far is unlocking achievements before you do them.The tycoon part of the game is a very simplified property buying process that only involves money management as to whens the best time to buy. The end game does involve owning all property though so is a nice incentive to pay attention. The reputation part is an important aspect because when you bid on jobs and property you need to pay attention to who else is bidding cause someone with a much higher rep than yours will drive the price up making it tougher to be profitable. Like that part.So if your looking for a casual way to spend your time yet stay engaged this game is a good buy for the price.			"

												Game: 8 / 10  -  Dev: 11 / 10This game has so many activities, including: Boating, Fishing, Diving, Photography, Rescue, Real Estate Tycoon and Management!Pros: DEV Support, Graphics, AI (Bids/Ranking System/In-Game Economy), Management, Many Varied Missions, Detailed Boats, Contols (Realism), Diving Scenarios and Map Size.Cons: Fishing Scenarios (Weak), Real Estate Purchase System, Camera During Diving Scenarios is sometimes unresponsive, Pirate Zones (No Designated Area on Map to Avoid) and Repetitave Missions.I really wasn't a fan of this game until about 2 hours of play.  I thought that it felt a little shallow.  Understand that the main point of this game is to gain REP to increase your income through bids, and ultimately purchase all of the real estate to run the AI out of business due to bankruptcy.  After a couple of hours of getting the hang of it, this has become a suprisingly good game.Synopsis:  The cons aren't enough to take away from the strong features of the game.  If you're a fan of simulation/management games, then you must pick this up!  The price is well worth it, even at full $10USD retail.  Also, the DEV is awesome.  He really listened to the community through forums and quickly fixed a lot of the main issues quickly.  I don't think other DEVs put this kind of work in on a Sunday to please the gamers.  Cheers!BUY IT!			"

												I reviewed the game a year and a half ago while it was on Desura and for the most part had a positive experience.  However, there are some glaring flaws that I'm sorry to say haven't been fixed.  *There are no audio sliders in the option menu.  Granted, this can be worked around by using your desktop's audio mixer, but you really shouldn't have to.  *At present, there are certain situations in which the ""save"" button will not appear when you hit ""esc"" to view the in-game menu.  This can be a bit inconvenient for when you need to leave in a hurry.*I like the addition of the new red quest line telling you where to go on your map, though for whatever reason it displays a line from the last port I've been to rather than the current port to which I'm currently docked.  It's worth noting that this only happens before you accept the quest (when you check to see where the destination port is on your map) - 11/30/14 Update: This appears to have been fixed.*Safari and photo missions tend to pop up at the worst times (like when on a timed ferry mission) and skipping it so as to deliver the person on time will actually penalize you.*On the plus side, new fishing missions have been added though reeling in a fish takes some getting used to.  The water effects are superb but the rest of it (character & cloud models, etc.) could use work.  For now, the game is simply ""good"" for the asking price, though it could have been better.2/15/13 Review:  http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/the-good-life/---Updated Gameplay Video:

												I really enjoyed my time with The Good Life. I canvased the forum, read reviews and watched a few videos before I bought it on sale at 2.49. The controls take some getting used to and the boats are tad to floppy sometimes but after playing it for awhile I figured out how to catch fish, collect rent, find treasure before using up all the air and in the end I won, literally the game told me that :)I thought this game was made by the company that did Aquadelic GT because the boats and water are very similair but its just a resemblance, Aquadelic GT had more boat sounds like water smacking the hull. At first I was not sure which property to buy and what to focus on but after playing and reading the screens that come up I started buying everything I could afford and completing all the tasks on the trips. I sold off my starter boat thinking I could buy it back or didn't need it but if you want the achievement for owning all boats keep it. I had to start over after like 12 hours because I sold all my old boats to buy property, do not do this as the boats you are not in generate income. I only had a few bugs, the first was the big sport fisherman (purple) has the steering wheel floating over the drivers head, its visible in the picture before buying it and second was the occasional treasure spot on dry land or a photograph target under a building. Otherswise the game was rock solid and I ended up somewhere around 41 on the Hall of Fame.For 2.49 or even 9.99 you would be hard pressed to find anything this entertaining.			"

												“The Good Life” immediately caught my attention since I like management games. It gives me a sense of satisfaction since I’m no business man. This is a close as I’ll get. To start off the graphics looks terrible when you’re still in the city. That’s acceptable though since the game will not be played in the city. Arriving on the island the graphics immediately got better. There is room for improvement though, e.g. if you look at the edges of the water and the beach – it just doesn’t look “real”.What I like is the idea of purchasing real estate apart from running a boat company (really is that what its called? Nice uncle :( ). Although I’ve not had time to really play this game very long the first thing that really annoyed me, was trying to dock the boat. Sure I understand that realism is important but damn, I’m where I’m supposed to be but just can not dock it. The water keeps moving the boat around. So maybe the controls needs some tweaking … or maybe practise makes perfect.But in general I think this game is worth the sale price and even the full price. I mean really, I’ve bought rubbish for between $14.99 - $19.99, that looked intriguing at first but turned out to be the biggest disappointment. So for $9.99, or for the current sale price, I will recommend it. I’m sure the bugs will be sorted out.			"

Pirates are a bit sillyI got this on sale, in this case for USD$1.99, and it is worth the money at that price.  It is probably a 3.5/10 at $9.99 but at $1.99 it is a 6.5			"

												To me it seems like it never got ""polished"".  Like a early release game.I'm going to recommend it anyway 2 thumbs way up and elaborate a little:-driving the boat is a good balance of challenge.  When u dock u can't just drive in there, u have to be careful w/ the controls so u don't beat ur boat all up.  It's cool.-Fishing is ok, I only did a couple fishing b/c fish aren't valuable enough to be worth it.  Maybe if I casted closer to the middle there's fish worth catching?  I dunno.  -I only did one diving quest for about 5 mins before throwing my hands up in complete disgust and giving up.  I play a game to have a good time, not to get frustrated.  They need to work on that.   -Pirates are stupidOther ppl have mentioned the game is good but the controls are quite awful.  Still I played almost 10 hours   I hope they build it more or build a new one if this ones a hit.  It's a good game.			"

												not what i was expecting.by the title and discription i was expecting being able to roam around and do stuff like go to the casino, lay out on the beach ect. but with in my time of playing this simulation. i realized it's just a boating sim. your basicly a taxi boat making money to buy property. you can free roam on the waters only. there is no getting on and off the boat as far as i can see.  so don't go into this expecting it to be a vacation sim for you, when it's really a vacation sim for the pc and you have to work for them. so in my opinion the discription is far from the actual sim it's self. it is still kinda entertaining none the less. i suggest only buy this game if your into games like taxi simulators ect. take this person here, take that person there kinda chit.

												Found this one my discovery queue today and it sounded interesting.Well it plays like a cut down version of Ship Simulator in parts and has similar physics - so if you cut the motor you wont auto stop.  Not as indepth as Ship Sim (if that could be classed as indepth).Not sure what the diving is all about nor the fishing.  But it is a slow cruise taxi service.  The Tycoon bit, as some one said, is basically buy cheap, sell at a profit.  The properties do generate income, so weigh that too.All in all, I'll get something out of it - but that's just me.			"

												The Good Life is a rare type of game, fitting a very specific interest. However, for those of us with that interest, this game is a gem. The Good Life has its ups and downs, but for the most part it is a very enjoyable game, if it's what you're looking for. Pros :-Huge world to explore, plenty to see and discover-Plenty of missions-Pretty environments-(sometimes) fun minigames-Awesome soundtrack-Good Price-New, rare genre-Online highscore ranking-Great to relax withCons:-The diving is fun, but the camera/player is insanly hard to control-Cheesy intro-Random forced missions while transporting people (rescuing people, taking pictures, running from pirates)-Sometimes you can't save, forcing to lose data or play until the option re-appears. -Long over-complicated 'controls' help on Main Menu-Little interaction with anyone, it gets lonely in such a huge worldOverall, I love this game. If you can look past the downsides it's great. The game is much less 'relax vacation simulator' as I assumed, and more of a 'relaxed small business game, in a vacation area', as you rarely leave your boat/work. However, I think this game is 100% worth the effort. When it goes on sale, the price is perfect (5$). If the devs continue to support this game by fixing bugs and adding new content, this game could be nearly perfect too. Overall, 7/10.			"

Ah, The Good Life. As you may see from this video, it looks wonderful.First, I need Steam trading cards for this game. They're like sunken treasure. But anyway...Imagine a world where you take enormous amounts of money from people to transport them between tropical islands in an archepelago, flogging them food and drugs along the way. Well, here it is. You are completely in charge, to the point where if you want to abandon ship halfway through transporting them to go diving for treasure, you can. You probably shouldn't, but you can.It's the sort of nonsense I love. And it is, nonsense. If you are looking for an in-depth business or management sim, this is not it. This is for relaxing with in a moment of downtime.And it would be relaxing, if it weren't for the tornados, pirates, and screaming drowning people. But let's not talk about them. It's too harrowing.			"

												I have only been playing four hours as I write this but I think this is a ""keeper"". Some people have complained about the boat controls and how hard ""parking"" them is. I have been around boats most of my life. They DO NOT handle like cars. You need to think ahead and this is how they are modeled in the game. Think ahead, realise you do not stop by just throttling back, and you will be berthing your boat neatly before you know it.There have been complaints that the game sells itself as a ""tycoon"" type game. These may be issues that were in the older versions; I don't know about that as I have only just got the game. All I can say is that you have to make sure you have enough cash to keep your business ""afloat"" at all times. I learned that there is no overdraft facility by paying for my repairs, leaving me cashless. Keep a check on your bank balance!So, do I enjoy the game? Yes. The music in the diving area is calming... For a while then I got annoyed with it, sorry bout that. :( I found that the controls for diving are harder to get a hang of than the boats. But then I have never been diving, perhaps they are fine if you have dived, bit like the boat controls maybe? :)The pirates are a bit odd; another review says they are firing nerf darts at you. Couldn't have put it better myself. So far, even my rickity old startup taxi could avoid them so not sure, at this point, what they are there for. I may regret saying that and maybe there will be a dozen waiting for me when I play next time. I do have a very nice boat now, wouldn't want to lose it or get the green paint scratched.It is in the sale, (should that be sail ;-) ) at the moment; buy it now!			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It's a budget title so I went in with what I think are fair expectations. The problems are fixable so I'll start with the good, end with the bad. Maybe they'll get fixed! Edit: The developers have noted that they're working on some of the negatives in my reveiw. This game is NOT shovelware, it's just rough. It's November now, if you're reading this review a few months from now, check the forums to see if my concerns have been fixed. Edit2: Pirate issues have been addressed. I can safely give this game a thumbs up. It's ROUGH, but still good if you like this kind of game.The graphics are a mixed bag, the models for people are so bad, but it's not really a big deal because the game is about boats, water and scenery. I think they did a pretty good job on that although there is definitely some improvement with weather effects.I really liked the physics for waves. You can't just point your boat in a direction and go, you've got to be active on the helm like in a real boat.The controls for everything except steering your boat are awful. Trying to aim when throwing life rings is nauseating. Trying to use the diving controls is a nightmare, fishing is confusing and unfun even once you know what you're supposed to do.The random event generator is unbalanced, a random Hurricane is awesome. Two in a row is dumb.Pirates, at least early in the game are a death sentence. I got two pirate events in a row before giving up on this game.Edit!!: Boat Damage has been addressed and fixed---Boat damage is economically crippling. A trip taking about 10 minutes might pay for 10% of your ship's damage. A single crash can cause that much, pirates might cause 50% damage. Damage also slows you down so good luck earning your way back to 100% health after a pirate hits you.Edited on 25 Nov 2014: Made a note that the developer has acknowledged some of these problems.Edit: 26 Nov 2014: Repair damage has been rebalanced and pirate areas are now marked. This was the thing that made me feel like the game was unplayable. The other issues are still being worked on.			"

												I bought this unsure if I would like it after reading mixed reviews, but after playing this for 5 hours straight I quite like this game. You are a water taxi transporting wealthy folk between a archipelago of islands. With money earned you can buy more boats and various property oppotunities that go up for sale during taxi missions. There is always things going on and happening during taxi missions which stops the game from getting boring and keeps it interesting, from pirates (which are right nasty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) to throwing life rings to drowning souls. The game can also be enhanced by playing the game with an erection. Its not perfect though, but has a nice balance. I like how the big boats which earn more are more difficult mooring than the small ones. All boats are available to buy at the start of the game, instead of incermentally so you can buy the best boats early on in the game whereas I would have liked to have worked on increasing my rank to get better boats. The AI players also start with a large amount of property and it will take some time on increaing your own portfolio before you are able to buy large amounts of property meaning the AI players will purchase it. The pre-set camera angles can also be awkward, but using my third hand I played this with an Xbox 360 Controller, mouse and keyboard at the same time. Even better as of writing the Dev is listening to players feedback to make improvements and releasing patches to improve the game. While the game might not be for everyone, I am more impressed than I thought I would be.			"

												The Good Life is an alright game with a neat concept. I would describe it as a casual simu-explorer with hints of management. For a game of this caliber, the graphics are decent – I’m running the game on the “Fantastic” setting @ 1920 x 1080 and I maintain around 60 fps; your mileage may vary. The sound is acceptable, although several recording loops can be heard within the engine noises and the background ambients. In my opinion, the game feels a bit unfinished, and could definitely benefit from more ""tweaking"" work. One of my early frustrations with this game, was getting the controls on an Xbox One controller all sorted out. Specifically the thumbsticks which control driving and camera movement. You can change the axis settings via the configuration pop-up before starting the game and this helps. After I made a few minor tweaks, I really began to enjoy it more. All in all, it was quite fun cruising around ferrying passengers, and all the while building up my water taxi/property tycoon business within the given tropical setting of the Jo Jo Islands. I would recommend this game and I do think it’s reasonably priced for what it is. I say pick it up if you’re looking for a simple, relaxing, no brainer-time killer!For the sake of rating the game with numbers...I give it a 2 / 5!Recommended +0 for ""it could be better""			"

												(7 hours played as of time of rating.)A beautiful idyllic simulation.  For the $2 spent, it was well worth it.  Those paying full price might feel a bit ripped off.PROS:-- Beautiful and varied ocean/island scenery-- Restful music-- Music changes to match tasks/environment.-- Boat handling characteristics are realistic.-- Boat damage scales with speed of impact.-- The challenge of mooring the original boat is fun.CONS:-- Mooring challenges with highly upgraded boats (e.g., 58' yacht) are too challenging.-- Mission challenges during fares are typically intrusive/disruptive to the experience.-- Mission challenges in upgraded boats can be frustrating.-- You never leave your boat.-- Customers (fares) are a little too simplistic models.-- The property tycoon mechanics (what is a good buy?) were not well explained.

												As some others have mentioned from the description of this game i presumed the game would include managing hotels that you had purchased as you build up your money, but i found all i was doing was driving a boat back and forth between ports with the occasional option to be able to buy a new property. Was not able to set the price of the rent for the properties I had managed to buy, wasnt able to view them apart from on a map which showed them up like monopoly pieces. I requested and got a refund for this game. Seems the description and the images need to be edited to not make people think that they are able to manage the properties that they will purchase in the game.			"

												For 2$ in a sale totally ok and worth it... I realy dont understand people who have over 30 hours in a game this cheap and give it a bad review... by that calculation every full price title i have less than 1000 hours on is bad? Realy the game isnt polished like WoW but its fun and relaxing... so why not?			"

												Bought this game when it first came out in 2013, just recently picked it back up but didnt have it on my computer and my old game was outdated and i couldnt redownload it. Customer support simply asked for a receipt and sent me a free game key for steam (which is an update from my old version) within an hour of contacting them. Im just amazed at how prompt and easy it was, wish all customer support were as great as this. The game is also a lot of fun and theres plenty to explore in a laid back environment, a nice change of pace from all the fast pace action games these days. 10/10.			"

												Unless you say ""This is just the game I need to play"", you may safely stay away from this game.The game does feel like a joke at times. The in-game graphics, combined with that hillarious intro, looks like it came from 2002, not 2012.""It's not always about the graphics"", did you say? Well if a game is about beautiful scenery, you expect it to look beautiful. Instead, here's how it looks:

Gameplay... feels like fun. But not like ""OMG I can't stop playing"" fun. Sending typhoons and pirates after you doesn't help.Overall, it may be a fun game if it suits your needs, but avoid high expectations.			"

												I thought ther would be more to this game, but all you are is a water taxi, cant get off boats or do anything much else then buy virtual property. Some other side missions but they seem a little buggy. Game got boring very quick. Dont care for controls either. Graphics are ok.  I would pass on this title unless you like those boring simulator types.			"

												I like this game it's very relaxing, looks good (apart from the character models). The controls are fine - diving is tricky at first but ok when you get the hang of it and, apart from that, the boats handle like boats. Things really pick up once you've got a sailboat. Trying to outrun pirates or a twister when you're short of time and your destination means your'e sailing into the wind? Yeah that works.All in all, The Good Life will easily provide enough hours of entertainment to justify the purchase. Go ahead.			"

The concept is golden but the gameplay is not what it was all to be suspected. It gets very reptitve very fast in less than thirty minutes. Has potential but for now I give it a solid 5/10 for now.

												It is not such a bad game. But it is more an arcade-action and a game of skills. Every 2 to 4 trips pirats are coming into your line trying to damage your boat, every 2 to 4 trips tornados are coming into your line. For a simulation game a bit to unrealististic and very nervy. Very nervy are the camera controls, both with mouse and gamepad. The bigger your ship, more problems with controlling in side missions. I am not so happy with it. There could be more informations about docking stations to the map before you agree into a customer's contract. F.e. distance from current location and a list of it. An option is missing to get more passengers in one journey. If you run into a sandbar, don't think about to call for help. There is no option given in this game. You can load your game save by hoping that the sandbar will release you, but it depends on how deep you ran into it.You can change your bought boats at each docking station if you like.But I can give this one my recommendation because of the atmosphere of this game and all the skills you have to use making this one very special. All in all a nice game with interesting challenges. :)			"

												The Good life is a great idea that is barely realized. There's nothing to manage in this game. Property can only be purchased at random and you can only buy one boat at a time. There's little to do in this game but ferry people around from one point to another. Sure, there's diving and fishing, but they're rarely worth the effort. Once I realized that the game was far more shallow than it let on, it was hard to play it to the end. There's supposed to be an end state, but after almost thirty hours, I haven't seen it yet. Look, I paid a dollar for it, but I'll be honest, it ain't that good. Your time is worth more than this.			"

												The Good Life,If you want to play a bit relaxed without anything more, then this is the game for you. But do not expect too much. Scenery is nice, the atmosphere is there but other things can be a bit annoying. In a way, well it is difficlut to say what kind of game this is. It is party a simple boat simulator, and very small partly management. A few things could easily be done better like those dumb pirates, repetative actions (transporting people), sialing boat bugs etc.Anyway, if even a new version could come out id definitivly buy it but the quite a bit more should be done to improve the game. I am thinking of more types of boats, customizable boats, faster boats (powerboats should sail faster than a sailing boat), managing and controllling your properties (rents), and please ... if bugs are found fix them. It came out did very few updates and that was it...For me i give it a 5.5/10, and I really like it. Makes you dream away.And I appreciate people's review + or - whenever they have played it a decent amount of time.			"
