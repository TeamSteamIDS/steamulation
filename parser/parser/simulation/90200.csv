												This is the game you wanted your entire life. It's probably the best game ever made. Don't believe me? Ok then, take a look at these amazing features this game offers:*4 different crop types. Ever wanted to have a variety in your farming sim games? This is where it's at. It can't get any better than this.*Cows. With the new motion-track technology, these cows are probably the most detailed you will ever see. They move, eat and do other stuff just like in real life. It's 100% accurate!*Next-next-gen graphics. With all these kids playing their Xbox One's and PS4's, talking about the ""next-gen graphics"", they don't know that Giants Software already did it. These stunning graphics have been considered to be even more realistic than real-life itself!*Atmosphere. You can spend hours sitting in your tractor, listening to nature sounds, watching the beautiful scenery with those realistic animations.*Multiplayer. Ever wanted to have a farm with friends or family? Now you can! With all the features listed above, you can just keep playing this game and never even stop! This is currently the only multiplayer game that has been proven to have absolutely zero connection issues and no lag!*Perfectly balanced. While other farming games can be a little unrealistic with money, crops and other things, this game is balanced, so everyone can have fun while playing the most realistic game ever!Still not convinced? Read again!10/10 would play forever.			"

  Farming Simulator 2011   Is a pretty good game. It's all about you are a farmer to run a business, buy new tools, tractors and more. You begin with fairly simple things but it is easy to upgrade themselves. The game itself does not have the best graphics, but you still get a good gaming experience. There is also a multiplayer which is very fun to play on. This game is very time consuming and it takes time to wait for things to grow, but there is always something to do. My experience of the game is that it's too bad the graphics for my taste but I recommend it anyway. There are also very many Mods to download. If you find this game on a sale i highly recommend it.I would like to give this game 7/10 becouse the game is so good of possibility for mods.			"

												I give a thumbs up to the ""Farming Simulator"" franchise.The reasons are:1- Its absolutly relaxing gameplay, the closest you can get to nature without leaving the house.2- It is by far the most deep game that can still be played ""passivly"", meaning you can fullfil other life duties such as reading/ studying and still enjoy this game in the background.3- Has enough activities to engage you when you have more time and choose to play more ""activly"".4- Even provides multiplayer to enjoy with friends!5- Very educational for urban people like me who never even knew a thing or 2 about farming.I will gladly recommend all the versions even today: 2011, 2013, 2015 every game has a set of achievments and the older it is the more basic the gameplay is. So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)			"

												Farming Simulator 2011 is the ultimate experience of farming in 2011.  I recommend it to anyone who likes physics errors, haybales sticking to everything (maybe I'm farming sticky weed?!), or the arduous task of figuring out what the hell all the things in the shop are/do.  I can't remember what other games came out in 2011 so I'm retroactively giving this GOTY 2011 honors.			"

												This game is so f-ing incredible, I genuinely had to remove my pants whilst playing, lest the gigantic boner it induced tear a hole through the bottom of my desk and proceed to penetrate the underside of my jaw.I then proceeded to whack off furiously over the hard, uncensored, corno fields I was harvesting with my long wang blade. When I was finished, I was unable to determine the difference between what was cow's milk being transported to the dairy farm, and what was part of the gallon of man juice I consequently covered my entire computer setup in. I'm still trying to scrape parts of it out of the GPU as I write this.This game isn't for the weak of ♥♥♥♥♥. It's a hardcore orgyfest for the elite. I rate this a truthful 12 inches out of 10.Buy it.

												Although this is now a pretty old game, it's still worth picking up in a sale. The first in the Farming Simulator series currently available on Steam, this game seems pretty basic, however it can really become your own with the host of highly detailed mods available. Many of these are fantastically modelled and exclusive to FS 2011, which really make the game something, even now.Most games as old as this or even older (excluding Pac-man and Asteriods!) would have died out many years ago, but although 2011 has been replaced by 2013, 15 and now 17, it is still a worthwile purchase in my opinion :)			"

												SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM FOR AN UP TO DATE REVIEWI would say that I like this game. The economy is relatively robust, there's some fun time-keeping challenges in keeping everything balanced, and there's a good bit of variety in vehicles/ crops/ activities/ etc. The graphics aren't great (crops will pop in when you're about 10 meters away, despite being able to render the buildings and mountains in the far distance), but I'll admit, they do the job. On the whole, it has a lot going for it. Except for the controls. Every time I've opened the game the controls have, to some degree, randomized, including at one point, mapping one of the buttons for activating a key tool to the button for turning left. This was the most annoying example, and the first I came across, but there have been plenty of other occurences of two completely separate functions (e.g. changing what crop you sow, and activating the machine that sows fields) to the same button, or with functions completely missing. If this was the first week of the game's release, I'd let it pass, but not in a game that came out in 2010. TL;DRGood game ruined by badly coded controls================================================REVISEDChecking the local game files fixed the coding issues, but then when I had to update my OS the game just stopped being openable- the icon would pop up, and then crash			"

												Farming Simulator 2011, upon first appearing on your radar, may not evoke immediate feelings of quality or entertainment. This is sadly misleading however, because if any game falls under the description of ""deceptively entertaining"", it is FS2011.There is a surprising amount of depth and strategy to the game, knowing when to harvest, when to sell, and when it is time to purchase new equipment. The game world is fairly large, and the freeform gameplay makes it easy to just wander off and explore for a while. As a side benefit, there is a rather large mod community that put a ridiculous amount of work into making sure that random 80's farm tractor #36 is as accurate as possible.If you're interested in a fairly detailed simulation game that has gameplay that is a fresh change of pace from your typical action/shooter/racing/strategy game, than you could do a lot worse than to fire up the demo.

												Just when you thought a farming simulator would be stupid and boring, you fire up this gem and remember how much fun you had playing with tonka trucks when you were small >_<. This game is more fun than it should be, and allows for some hilarious situations if you decide to drive like a fool, or attempt to use farm equipment in ways not intended.It does allow for more serious play as a simulation if that is your thing, with many different ways to farm, and a lot of freedom in where you do it.The one thing I did not like about this game is how the methods of farming are quite alien to the ones I have seen living in farm country (in America, the simulator is euro themed which is fun, but did not make it feel very real for me). Instead of making circles around the fields it seems designed to go across, turn around, go back, ect. Nothing wrong with that, but it is less efficient and realistic (at least for the area I live in, I am not sure if this is how it is done elsewhere). This might be just a symptom of your AI farmhands being hilariously dumb. Nothing stopping you from doing zigzags while driving yourself if you wanted to, but in order to make full use of the hired help, you must very carefully align your derpy farmhands who will just drive back and forth until they reach the edge of the prepared land (mostly...sometimes they might just sit there all lazy like soaking up pay :P)There are many mods for other maps, AI changes and implements, but I have not used them much myself. I tried a couple for AI improvements and maps but the ones I used made little difference for me, and I preferred the stock map.			"

												Can't say this was the perfect farming simulator. No sisters to marry. I mean they got the rest perfect, nearly nothing around, constantly performing slow repetitive tasks, barely coherent learning, the people look like they live a tortured existence, knowingly living with learning difficulties and so aware of their own deformities they do nothing except question their very existence.4/5 Norfolk SimulatorNeeds capture sister's corn hole gamemode DLC to be perfect.

												Farming Simulator 2011 is, despite the few additions to the game after FS2009, a great game!What i like about FS11:+Very nice, realistic cows!+Cows are also easier to tend to than in the later games+Has my favorite map with my least favorite map name. (Map1)+The tractor dance glitchWhat i don't like about FS11:-I'd love to play multiplayer, but the game stutters so much, it's not even worth it!-Not beginner friendly, mostly because people don't know to check the missions menu!7/10 Would make my frontloader dance again!

												The quality of human life depends on our living lives of purpose and meaning.  Purpose and meaning must come from somewhere beyond – from our connectedness with “some higher order of things.”  This “higher order” or “higher power” is the ultimate source of ethics and morality. A sustainable agriculture is built on an ethical foundation of friendship and stewardship – a more enlightened concept of self-interest. Thus, the new American farmers, who are finding ways to farm more sustainably, are creating a metaphor of a more sustainable human society.  As a society, we must stop exploiting our natural environment.  We must look again to the timeless principle of diversity in finding new means of sustaining human progress.I believe that we can, and must, help create a new kind of agriculture that will sustain a high “quality of life” for farmers and society, both for this generation and for all generations to come.  That’s why farming is important to America.			"

												Probably one of the strongest games of the year, Farming Simulator 2011 takes everything we know about gaming, and throws it all away. Take all the strong points of Left 4 dead, Call of duty, Age of Empires, Starcraft, Need for speed, Gran Turismo, Bejeweled, Plants vs Zombies, Fable 2, Legend of Zelda, Sim City 2000, its all here. If you are into any of the games above, this game is FOR YOU. I cant sum up how awesome this game is in the space given, but i will try my best. Imagine youre a young up and coming entrepeuner, or maybe just some dumb white trash ♥♥♥♥ who inheireted his grandparents farm, because for some reason you still live with them. Imagine one day youre sticking crabs in your butt and they walk in on you and die. Boom. The farm and all the land is yours, its your choice to make it or break it. Design and build your farm, or destroy and conquer others, its all up to you. Your choice, your destiny, Farm Simulator 2011.			"

On the plus side the lighting effects really do look great and the shadows move with the sun. The headlights and even the flashing becon on the vehicles are well designed and look quite realistic. The Career mode is a good way to start learning the game but after time the work gets boring and repeative on your own. The multiplayer, however, is amazing and makes this game only really worthwhile playing if you have friends to play it with as it makes it easier to earn money as well of the fun of working on a task together.

												Like games where you can manage AI / accounts? Then this is the game for you. The game is able to be mostly automated by AI, setting tasks to do, this gives you time to concentrate on buying new equipment and selling stock from your silos.The extensive moding community also allows you to add to the game every day with more equipment and skill sets. For example tree cutting and flipping cars over with forklift, dropping them into a lake from a bridge, that sort of thing ;)			"

												The most highly touted game called ""Farming Simulator 2011"" ever to hit Steam! This photo-realistic and absorbing game will show you what it's really like to be a farmer; as you tend the crops, harvest the wheat and watch your 50-cents-an-hour hired worker get his tractor lodged on a scarecrow because he has no sense of direction.Farming Simulator 2011 features the most up-to-date list of essential farming equipment for all your simulation needs. Vital inclusions are all here; such as farms, grass, cows and, yes, even a Gas Station! This is a developer who listened to the demanding cries of the farming simulator fanbase, to be sure.You'll find yourself in awe as you drive your tractor down the streets, watching cars fly through the air in celebration of the complete lack of gravity; which we all know farms do not have in any way.

												I really enjoyed this game it is very close to the real life thing excepting the work that you do in real life and the being able to transport your self to your vehicle without having to move a muscle it is very fun .			"

												its a good game. here are my pros and cons:PROS: -lot more cooler mods like bale wrappers and tractors that people never converted to newer farming sims- has some vehicles not found in fs13, but some are on both fs11 and fs13CONS:- Lot more challenging to play because theres no page in the pause menu that shows crop growth stages-no reset button when your vehicles/ implements get stuck- no hirable workers for the Krone chaff harvester, gotta do it yourselfI dont recomend this game for beginners to the Farming Simulator series but its fun if u are expierienced and want a more challenging farming sim. Also check out the mods for this game theyre pretty good "

												If you're looking for something a bit different to relax with, then I might suggest Farming Simulator. It's neat to use, see and hear the various equipment and vehicles in action. Satisfying to plant & harvest your crops then gradully build up your farm and gain more new equipment to use over time. If you have a steering-wheel controller, then it will be a more immersive expereince. If you have a friend or two that also has Farm-Sim, you can even do some farming together online.			"

												This is one of the greatest games i have played, cross between RPG, Action, FPS, Adventure, Adult, Simulation, Online and very Hardcore. The online play is extremely fulfilling in every was an online experience can. The design is flawless and the graphics are one of a kind, to get any other game would just be a sin.			"

												Graphically wise I don't think Farming Simulator 2011 is one of the best games of its type, whilst the exterior of the vehicles look amazing, in the cab they are poorly detailed. On the plus side the lighting effects really do look great and the shadows move with the sun. The headlights and even the flashing becon on the vehicles are well designed and look quite realistic. The Career mode is a good way to start learning the game but after time the work gets boring and repeative on your own. The multiplayer, however, is amazing and makes this game only really worthwhile playing if you have friends to play it with as it makes it easier to earn money as well of the fun of working on a task together.

												This is such an intense game. Nothing captures the esene of sitting in a tractor all day like this game. If you want to be a farmer, then go outside and plow. Or if your lazy, play this game. Warning, vehicles occasional fly away into the sky.			"
