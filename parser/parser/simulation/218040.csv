												Overall 5/10Pros:- The idea behind it is good, you get to play a government and using different policies you try to get reelected while improving a country.- Some concepts behind it are solid, both in terms of ecomics and social policies.- It is easy to understand what each polciy does.Cons:- It is probably too easy to beat, just a bunch of algorithms to beat.- There's only one way to ""win"" and that is pretty much going full ""social democrat"", nothing else seem to work.- Very few scenarios.- The consequences of some actions are totally off, like raising VAT to 70% and seeing your opinion rating go up.I truly like the idea behind it, and I hope the author gets backing to develop it into 1) a real game, made by pros and  2) a more realistic simulation, but as it is now I cannot reccomend it.

												Better as a lesson of how interconnected things are, and how quickly things can go stupid with just a few bad mistakes, than as a simulation of real politics. Still can prove quite fun til you figure out how to tweak the folks to get them to do what you want. At some point, it loses its charm, but you may have a bit more respect for your politicians by then, if you're not wondering why they haven't implemented all the policies you did to have a socialist utopia. 3/5			"

												Buyer beware - This game has limited functionality on Windows 7 & 8. You most likely will experience a display issue cutting off half the icons needed. It seems to be an issue related to widescreen displays. Changing the compatibility mode does not work for most either. Unless the developer manages to patch this and solve the UI issue, do not buy this game.			"

												I managed to create a socialist paradise by cranking up my GDP to the point where the bare minimum of taxes off of corporations paid for public education, transportation, healthcare, retirement pensions, the military, and basically everything else.I created a socalist utopia through the magic of the free market and laissez-faire capitalism.

												Let me start out by saying that I have a degree focusing on Political Science and have worked in the sector....The Socioeconomic policies do not reflect what happens in the real world, more what someone idealizes how they should work. The Human Element is not well represented, such as in situations where a positive outcome is seen, but the electorate is unhappy due to outlying political/social/etc beliefs (e.g. the goal is accomplished, but not HOW the populace wanted it accomplished, etc). The Political system is rather simplified and this makes a Democratic Socialist approach far too easy and ignores key psychological responses that have been observed in the real world when certain situations arise.After playing for a few hours, using demographic knowledge of game developers, and knowing the political beliefs behind certain policies, I easily beat the game with a Social Democracy....which appears to be the ultimate point of the developers. Comparatively, I attempted a few other forms of government approaches that have been historically stable in the real world, but those forms were not nearly as friendly in the game world.As this is intended to be a political sim attempting to replicate the real world, I cannot recommend this. However, if this were a model that honestly stated its intent to show HOW a Democratic Socialist contruct can best be made and why it is best for them, in their view, as compared to other options...Then I would say that it accomplished its intent.

												Love the concept. The UI is bad, but I would be okay with it if the game was balanced. Starting scenarios are far too random. In the same scenario, sometimes I started with a $10Bn deficit which was manageable and fun, but several times I started with a >$40Bn deficit which needs almost all turns until the election to just correct, changes take too long and I found the game too difficult to be fun. Perhaps I need to change some parameters to make it work, but I think it is just bad game design overall. Really wanted to like this game			"

												Definitely a great game, but you have to fit the right niche. No flashy graphics to distract you, just a screen and some government policy options. It's pretty fun to try to build different types of countries, such as a socialist one or a pure capitalist democracy, or even try to model it after the style of leadership of an individual. It's your chance to create a country the way you see fit, so why not take it!			"

												Democracy 2 is a really lackluster game.It's rare that I play a game and feel like I've wasted my money, but D2 had me feeling that within half an hour.For me, the dealbreaker is the fact that when you aren't voted back in, the game ends. What's the point in that? I was actually looking forward to being opposition leader and laying the smackdown on the current government while I set my party on a road to recovery.It just made it a really one-dimensional and short-lived game for me.

												This game is a fun political simulator. Only complaint I can think of is that it encourages you to go to extremes on all the issues and doesn't really encourage moderation (basically, if you're going to anger a certain part of the electorate anyway, then the game doesn't discourage you from going all the way).I've also heard some complaints that this game has a left-wing bias but I don't buy that. You'll get some bad events if you go full-blown socialist to the point of alienating your capitalists.			"

												Overpriced, unbalanced, inflexible. This is a game that is over 4 years old now, and still costs 20 dollars. It's ridiculous! Second, many of the in-game options are unbalanced. I have been assassinated, by environmentalists, when I had a carbon tax and strong anti-pollution regulations. Most importantly, I find, the amount of actual changes you can make besides different degrees of neoliberal capitalism is very low. You can't have any kind of socialism(Social democracy is very attainable, but the closest thing to a leftist ideology in the game, and it's still capitalist.), you can't abolish the government, and limited government doesn't work great either. You can't really have fascism either. Even the sequel to this game(Democracy 3) is still plagued by many of these problems, but slighty less so. If you really want a game like this, just skip this one and get Democracy 3, but the entire series isn't the best, I find. There isn't a really high amount of replayability, either, it all gets to be the same pattern, for me. (Make some changes, keep budget balanced, some terrorist group gets angry, I get assassinated after about an hour of playing) Can't recommend.			"

												For a political game, it sure doen't like you making choices. I'll give you an example.Say that I'm the Labour Party. The Labour party does not make decisions based upon the Daily Mail, but rather based upon their fat cat union paymasters. So when the Labour party starts to impliment these Union policies the Daily Mail doesn't like it and SENDS OUT HITMEN TO KILL THE PRIME MINISTER. The same could be said when playing as a liberal, although you would have to add THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND to the list. You know, the tame and timid church of dwindling numbers and no real passion? OK, OK, it may very well be Muslims, but it wasn't a masque that denounced me a month before my assassination.Try to impliment the policies you think are the best and you will be killed. Betray your voter base who wants these reforms and you may just get a coup from your ministers. Quite frankly, I agree with my ministers, I want to run a liberal government. It's just a shame that UKIP and the Church of England disagree, because it makes the game dull. To play you must now tow the center ground, pander to all groups and believe in nothing. DId Thatcher pander to socialists? She most certainly did not, nor did Reagan or the two Bush's. Where they assasinated by Socialists? NO?!? WHY THE HELL NOT?Let me put it this way, if Ed Miliband came in, do you really think he would listen to the 50 year old UKIP voters who read the daily mail and wouldnt vote for his party anyway, especially given that they dont give him any money? Of course not! So would he be assasinated? The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not some bannana republic that was just liberated from the tenticles of spain and doesnt know how to run an election! What this game does allow you to do, is manage the budget, which is reletively easy to do since it devoted over 25% of the UK budget to the military. just reassign the funds. OH BUT YOU TOUCHED OUR PRECIOUS MILITARY, I'M SHOCKED! I'LL BE WRITING A STRONGLY WORDED ARTICLE TELLING OUR HITMEN TO GO FOR THE THROAT!I'm one of the only people devoted to politics you'll ever meet, so when I say this game is dreadful, that not even my latent interest in the topic was enough to carry me through, I god damn mean it.

												I guess I have to give this game a negative review!  It's *such* a cool idea, and the implementation is smart: nodes showing problems, issues, and policies, connected by red and green lines that show how they're related to each other.  But this game needed a lot more testing.  I dare anyone to get reelected in Zambeezia; you start out terribly unpopular and simply can't get enough people to join your party in four years, and unaffiliated voters mostly do not vote.  There are strange omissions ranging from ""CO2 emissions apparently do not affect air quality in this universe"" to ""I have no tools to fight terrorism other than military spending.""  And maybe weirdest, it seems that my voters' and ministers' opinion of the issues is absolute, not relative.  That is, if a country starts out very un-capitalist, I can do nothing but pass capitalist policies and still get resignation threats from my capitalist ministers, because capitalist voters hate me.  (One wonders whether they've seen the opposition party's policies!)And, you know, fair's fair -- it's a one-man studio, and this is a pretty awesome game for one person to have made.  If I'd made it I'd be pretty pleased with myself.  But I really can't recommend it as a commercial product unless you're interested in game design, where this game has various good and bad lessons to teach.  Extensively modded, it might be salvageable.  As-is, no.			"

												This is a very simple and minimalistic government simulator type game. After playing about thrice, you learn all the mechanics inside out, and it becomes boringly easy to ""win"". It has a very linear type of policy making panel, with far left, or far right, and everything in between. Everything has a linear and predictable effect, and all-in-all, it becomes very tedious.It is fun for the first few hours however, I won't deny that. But it simply has no replayability. Games like Masters of the World have a much better and in-depth mechanic and policy implementation. But if that's too complicated for you, then this game is just fine. Grab it on sale since this is an old game, no point paying full price like I did for a game that's just about mediocre.Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												I haven't yet played Democracy 3, but since that exists and has achievements, I'd say your best bet is probably to play that game.  I enjoyed my brief time with Democracy 2, but I can't really recommend it as a game, and I'm rating it 5/10.  It's really just about familiarizing yourself with the relationships and dynamics of the various functions withi the game, and then 1) immediately fixing the emergency problems upon starting a new game, folllowed by 2) micro-managing and tweaking these elements, which doesn't change very much from game to game once you've taken care of #1 and have some general control over the country's economy.The setup of these dynamics is interesting to examine, and doesn't seem overly simple at first.  But the more you play and see the interconnectedness of the various elements, the more it reveals itself to be simple.  And there's not really much gameplay on the top of everything.  Democracy 2 is good for a few hours of understanding these systems and general gameplay, at which point you end up wishing there were more functional achievements and a deeper game.  I'm hoping that's what Democracy 3 is.			"

												Recommended for anyone who is into politics and ever dreamed of becoming the ruler of the world. Also, this game doesn't have much of a graphics interface and is mostly text and statistic based.			"

												Fun little game, although hard to master (or so it seems). I can potentially see it becoming repetitive in the long run, but it's quite attractive for short playing sessions, if you're into politics.			"

												Fun game. It is interesting to play around and see what different sorts of outcomes you can get.			"

												I wanted to like this game, and tried to, but ended up not liking it.  The idea behind the game is compelling and interesting, but a majority of the play is moving sliders around and finding the sweet spots.  So, you're pretty much tied to however the game designers weighted the curves the sliders control.  Some people may like it, but it wasn't for me.			"

												This game looks way more complicated than it actually is, so don't be put off by the screenshots. And it's actually pretty fun, even if it is absurdly America-centric; for example, ""teaching creationism or eveloution in schools"" is always an issue and takes a ridiculous amount of effort to get rid of, even if you're playing as the country where most of the population are atheists. I guess Americans just can't imagine that not being an issue anywhere. Oh, and patriots are always in favour of reduced gun control, because that's how it works in America. Despite that though, it is a fun little game, though probably not one you'll spend a huge amount of time playing.			"

												Bloody terrible. Don't get it. It's outdated and gets boring very quickly. If you're even thinking about it - stop. Take it from me, I generally love these sort of strategy games; but this one's the scum of strategy. If I could give it a star rating, it would get 1 out of 10 if I was in a good mood. There are so many bugs it's just painful to play.			"

												Hey you like adventure? You like excitement? You like doing boring ♥♥♥♥? Me neither!! Don't play this game!! It's really bad. I wanted to be Ron Paul and it says people hate me, so I was going to be Obama and the people hated me, then I was Jesus and they crucified me. Moral of the story: Democracy doesn't work.			"

												As a national government simulator with a relatively minimal UI, I recommend this game on sale for Sim buffs.  For me, its intricacies outweigh any complaints that I have of its shortcomings.  I got this instead of Democracy 3 because I heard that the only difference is a cleaner UI and not much else.			"

												All flash, no substance.  All sizzle, no steak.I paid full price for this.  I hoped it would be another fun democracy sim.But, I found it to be a dry desert of linear responses too archaic situations. "

												Great game for the Micromanager in all of us. The slightest move on a policy slider can impact the scenario in ways that can make you unpopular, create a recession or force the people to vote you out at the next election.			"

												This game is not well supported on current pc's. Also it has a good crash potential. That is something too keep in mind.But if you like a good in-depth game with a lot of strategy and every choice you make has impacts. I would say give it a go.			"

												I haven't yet played Democracy 3, but since that exists and has achievements, I'd say your best bet is probably to play that game.

It's really just about familiarizing yourself with the relationships and dynamics of the various functions withi the game, and then 1) immediately fixing the emergency problems upon starting a new game, folllowed by 2) micro-managing and tweaking these elements, which doesn't change very much from game to game once you've taken care of #1 and have some general control over the country's economy.The setup of these dynamics is interesting to examine, and doesn't seem overly simple at first.
