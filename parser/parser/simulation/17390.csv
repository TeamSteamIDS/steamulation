												An asteroid hurdles through space, speeding past alien spacecraft who follow it, attempting to scan it for any life. Within seconds, the asteroid is out of sight, and enters the orbit of a planet. Catching fire, it slams into the ground, creating a crater from the impact. Hundreds of small fragments explode from the asteroid, scattering themselves around the planet. Some land by cities of sophisticated, lizard-like beigns, others by curious tribes who begin worshipping the fiery rocks, and by clueless creatures who poke and lick them. One particular fragment lands in a small pool of water, and you crawl out - a small, slithery cell who's main goal is to survive. This is Spore, the tale of how your microscopic race can go from scavengers getting enough food to barely survive, to a thriving empire that controls the entire galaxy. The game is based on five stages: Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and Space. Cell station is where your journey begins. There is little customization in this stage, except for the basic shape of your cell and organelles. Once you become the top of the food chain, you evolve legs. Stumbling onto land, you enter the Creature Stage. Here is where the true customization takes place. You can collect various parts from skeletons scattered around the planet and add them to your creature. You can make a huge, strong behemoth who crushes his enemies with his gigantic claws, or a small, nimble beign that flies and steals food from his enemies before they notice he is there. You can create your creature based on your species' diet: omnivore, carnivore, or herbivore. Besides the customization, Creature Stage introduces a huge skill in the game that is incredibly useful - friends and foes. You can choose whether to impress other races and become friends, or attempt to destroy and annhilate them. You have to be wise as to who you attack and who you ally; making enemies with all the weak creatures could end up with them evolving into way stronger creatures and destroying YOU. Once your brain has increased, your species can begin laying out the foundations for a tribe. Here is where the friends and foes system comes into major effect. To complete the Tribal Stage and become a civilization, you must complete your Tribe Totem Pole. For every tribe you defeat or ally, a new totem is added. This stage goes by rather fast, and prepares you for Civilizational Stage. Civilization Stage takes inspiration from Sid Meier's Civilization series. Your goal is to control every city on the planet, whether through religious, economic, or military means. Religious races can convert the race into believing your civilization is their leader, and is considered the easiest way to complete the stage. Military is just brute force; when it comes to the guns in this, size DOES matter. Economic is peaceful; you start a trade route with a friendly city and eventually buy their city from them. This takes longer than the other two ways but can be very helpful in the long run.Once you control the planet, you can launch a space project, starting the Space Stage, which is endless. All the choices you've made in the previous stages add up to decide what class you are in the Space Stage - perhaps a battle-crazed tyrant, or a religious zealot out to convert everyone to the teachings of Spode. During the stage, your goal is to go from the Captain of your Space Project to the Omnipotent Beign of the Universe. On the way, you'll encounter the Grox - a cyborg race who hate all and arguably are the antagonists of the game. (If hours of work are put into it, you could make them your ally- if you ever do, I commend you for your bravery.) Between space pirates, colonizing other planets, upgrading your fleet, and stabalizing your funds, this is by far my favorite stage. Overall, this is a great game for creative people and truly lets your imagination soar.Graphics: 16/20Story: 17/20Gameplay: 20/20Replayability: 19/20Soundtrack: 18/20Overall: 90/100			"

												I didn't build my empire, I took it. Tearing it from the grasp of the species around me. What I couldn't buy with money I bought with the blood of the innocent. My empire was pure; only the clean survived. My empire was strong; I sifted the weak away like chaff. My empire was vast; we spread our might to the farthest corners of the galaxy.We were a people of pure war. Gunfire was our music, the smell of smoke and charred flesh was the sweetest of aromas, and the site of corpses and ruins was the most beautiful sight there was. The universe was our canvas and we painted it with blood. Death was our peace and destruction was our prosperity. We made petty alliances with the other, impure species in the galaxy. We used them to do our bidding. The smiled as they went to their deaths. Then while they were busy, we claimed what was rightfully ours. We tore down their homes and slaughtered their people. It was but mere amusment to the wars we had seen. Just something to pass the time.Others we waisted no time with. They were too unclean to be bothered with. They were dirt and we were to clean the universe. We were to scrub their impurity out of the fabric of space and time. Some species fought back, their fights were mightier than others, but still nothing compared to our vast power.Soon we met the grox, a mighty empire that had claimed the center of the universe. The center of a universe that belonged to us. We waged war. And we do to this day... but that is what we want. After all this time, we met an empire that would wage war on us eternally. And so, our galactic history turned into a galactic love story. A story of two empire who have fallen in love with the war they wage on each other.10/10 Will recomend to the corpses of my enemies.

												wow, it's been 9 years since i started playing this game. This was probably the game that actually got me into gaming. It has great mechanics, outstanding creative abilities, and doesn't take up too much space on your hard drive. interesting how it changes from a top-down scroller, to a third person rpg/adventure game, then to a stratergy game, then 3rd person space explorer. there's something in it for everyone. only thing that has aged is the graphics, quite outdated and not updated, but the pros overwhelm the cons. great game.

												Pretty good fun game but unless it's on sale or you have a coupon it's not really worth the full price. People have trouble with the game left and right. You need to fix two registry errors just upon start up. Your world might freeze during gameplay and force you to start over on another world. Your key for the game may not work and the multiplayer servers don't work.No, you will not get a refund, it's not Steam's fault. It's Maxis and EA's but you won't get a refund from them either and no the game will not be patched so don't bother whining about that. People are buying the game regardless if they patch it, they have no reason to spend extra money to fix it.			"

												First off, my hours spent playing this game do NOT represent my true hours in this game. I've probably got thousands of hours in since release.I did however, recently come back to it after perhaps a year off.Went from cell stage all the way to space stage. Conquered a few systems, allied with a few more. Played God on a few others.Advanced to the center of the galaxy, and annoyed one of my previous stages in that area. Proceeded to go to war with them... completely forgetting that I waged war with, and defeated the Grox with that Empire.Naturally, I got absolutely obliterated.10/10, would lose a war with myself again.

												Bought the complete pack.Started 3 worlds.HerbivoreCarnivoreOmnivoreHerbivore: Easy! Because in the beginning theres food LITTERALLY EVERYWHERE. On land even more! And a whole tribe collects ''Apples'' Even more!Carnivore: Sometimes tricky, because when you are low on food you HAVE to kill a animal, even on low health.But in the tribe stage they all go after fish, and meat. WAAAY easier. And dont be scared in the civ stage. BECAUSE BLOOD AND GLORY!!!Omnivore:Hardest, but also easiest. Food, EVERYWHERE. All the food is accepted. But in the civ stage, Its hard to start off. First of all, Get money to make allies, start a trading route, and then, BOOM Money flows in. Buy the city, But then, Other nations attack. I can place turrets, but against a team of 7 ''Tanks'' You cant win. So i thought, If i give that city to them, then i can make a trading route with them, and buy off their city's!. Worked! after buying 7 cities, they said: Want to work together? And then, Space.I would love a medival or pirate age. Sounds cool.11/10 Would play it as a omnivore again.			"

												Spore is a game I have played many times over the years. From the cell stage through to the space age, it keeps being fun. It is cute, appropriate for young children, can be challenging if played on harder difficulty settings, and offers you a literal galaxy's worth of content. I once spent over a year playing this game frequenly and barely put a dent in my expansion of the Universe. Making every planet mine, and every world a Tier 3 world was my dream, and the universe is so large, I don't think one person alone can do it, but it sure was fun to try. The addon content, Galactic Adventures as well as Creepy and Cute add more dimension and choice to the game, as well as some new content. One of the most exciting things about Spore is that you can create your own species at every stage, and shape them into whatever or whoever you want them to be.			"

												This game is providing me with what I have always dreamed of. ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THE ENTIRE GALAXY! if I play my cards right. Every stage of this game is good fun. I abolutely love this game.My only complaint is that in the final stage of the game your empire becomes soo large that personally dealing with every little thing and trying to handle the spice trading for your entire empire with your one player controlled ship really started sucking. I wanted to be able to Age of Empires style delagate responsibilities to computer controlled characters. like trading, like military action, like colonization. I wanted to end up being the emperor who could just watch the empire I had built continue to grow, and spread, and take everything over everything. After the setup and planning you do in the first stages of the game, only require minimal player interaction, which would leave me (the emperor) the freedom to go do whatever I wanted. (like finding galactic adventures and lvling my captain. that was fun.) That said, this game is fun and totally worth the cost. Its just not made to allow you to be able take over the galaxy to the scale that I had wanted, in other words its sort of soft-capped out. There comes a point when you reach a size where you simply cannot manage everything personally, and you start losing planets as fast as you are gaining them.			"

												I am extremely happy to own this game on Steam.I probably spent hundreds of hours playing this game throughout all of it's stages.Spore is a rather complex game even if it comes off as a bit childish.It has 5 completely different game stages:In the first one you start as a cell trying to survive.As you progress,you start to evolve into a multicellular organism,develpoing more and more features like better eyes,horns and so on.In the end your ''fish'' will evolve enough for it to go on land.This is where the second stage of the game begins.You are now a land animal fighting/socialising with other species and exploring the world.Same as in the first stage you evolve continuously.The Third stage,is the tribal stage.Your animal is smart enough to form a tribe,craft tools,build houses and create a form of government.Your mission is to conquer the surrounding area by war or diplomacy.After that,the fourth stage begins.Now you must conquer the entire planet by the same principle.But now along war and diplomacy,you can establish your domination by trade.This stage represents the stage we are in.Tanks,nuclear bombs and lots of trading.Now begins the space age.You now control the entire solar system and begin exploring the Milky Way galaxy.This is by far the best stage of the game because of it's depth.It is for sure addictive to explore planets and venture into the unknown meeting space empires,undeveloped planets and so on.You can terraform planets,blow them up,colonise them or just explore for artifacts and more hidden items.The game is fun but it has it's weak points.It could have been so much more.The tribe and industrial age stages are dull and unremarkable.They play as RTS games with a bit of diplomacy mixed in there.Nothing special and it could have been much improved.This game is a unique sandbox space exploration simulator and my only regret is that Maxis limited themselves when creating this game.It could have been one of the best games of the 2000's..let's hope they plan a Spore 2.The seemingly unlimited customization combined with tons of free user created content gives the game amazing replay-ability.I recommend this game to everyone.At least to try it once.

												I wish everyone a merry Christmas, but that´s not the full purpose of this review.I discovered SPORE in 2012, more than 4 years ago and I can still enjoy it like I did then. This game isn´t only one of my all-time favourites, but my secondly most played game of all time as well. As you can see on my playtime, SPORE is absolutely massive and I don´t regret any minute I spent on it, not even those 2,880+ I had already collected on Origin. I am thankful this is now also available on Steam, but unfortunately EA games are simply not made to be here, EA doesn´t give a **** to their Steam-community.Whom do I recommend SPORE to? (All following aspects are listed in order of importance)Explorers: First spot, definately. If you love to spend your time on uncovering secrets, this game is perfect. Especially the last stage has tons of things waiting to be discovered by YOU. If you aren´t an explorer, don´t be afraid, this one is OPTIONAL, you can ""complete"" SPORE without finding all secrets as well.Creative: Very close to the previous type. The designers feature nearly INFINITE possibilities. There´s almost nothing you can´t create, your imagination is the only limit. More than 400 Creature-, 500 Vehicle- and 600 Building-parts to use, modifacation of those and no set placements allow an unbelievable ammount of possible combinations. In fact there is no object looking like another one.""God-wannabes"": Write your own story from the very beginning. Start as nothing but a little cell, the most simple lifeform, evolve to an intelligent group leader and rise to the lord af the largest empire in the entire universe. Mess-Around: Everything said. Build ugly monsters and use them to kill everybody, edit the surface of planets, transform water into lava, highjack your friends, wipe out innocent creatures... The only limit is your free time :DChallengers: Who said this game was going to be easy to finish? In fact it´s impossible, the last stage is endless... And trust me, if there´s one thing you have to try to understand, it´s (Spoilers Ahead) reaching the galactic core and wiping out the Grox... I wish you fun at exterminating around 2000 star systems...Children: I know this has a teen-rating, but seriously, nobody would be mad about a six-year old playing this. Of course you can literally take out the entire universe without showing mercy, but the brutality is way to low to be frightening to anyone... Come on, the animation isn´t even realistic...Non-EA-haters: I am afraid, but that´s the point I have to admit. The only thing I dislike this game for, but only the Steam version. EA doesn´t let Steam-users connect to their servers, so all online-features are disables for us. Bad thing that you can´t share your creatures or download other´s epic content, but this review won´t change either. EA isn´t ready for Steam yet and won´t ever be. I think singleplayer fun can annihulate this point, but the condition is bad, that´s sure.Do I recommend Spore to anyone else? I am not sure about this one, to be honest. This might be considered too kid-friendly for some adults and too boring for action-gamers. This review is intended to be funny, just as SPORE is. In fact I want to say that you shouldn´t miss this, SPORE is just a game everyone should at least know. Please, get it in a sale. I do not force you to play this for as long as I did. Since there are no achievements you can also get rid of this within a daytime. I am still really surprised by this, SPORE just marked the simulator-genre, it´s still the one and only god simulator. I know there aren´t even many, but those few won´t ever reach this. Why do I say ""get it in a sale"" when it seems like I am amazed enough to pay it fully?Because I didn´t either. Spore without online support isn´t just worth it. Get the Origin version if you don´t mind. saving your progress for this is important and sharing creations keeps the community alive. SPORE is an amazing game, but the publisher isn´t a great one. Thanks a lot for reading until here, it means a lot to me. I'd aprechiate if you leave a rating, I care about your opinion. Keep it up, guys ;)			"

												Ive known about this game before it came out when i was younger, And i still love the hell out of it today. Hands down one of my favorite games, But this little gem has its flaws and its perfections.Spore, i can easily say is one of those games which you can let your imagination run wild, make whatever you like, And isnt too complex. So its easy to pick up and learn. Plus the main game, besides the Creature/Building/Vehicle creator, Is pretty fun too; evolving from a simple cell, into a complex creature, then into a tribe, into a nation, and lastly, into a vast empire in space. The replay value of this game can be high, Depends how much you liked the game.Now as for its flaws... The game has its bug, sure all games have their bugs. But Spore has had some unusual ones. Before i had the game on steam, I owned up to three copies of spore. All stopped working after some time. Each one having a strange error prior to just dying, The last copy i had affected Space Stage, Every Empire, Planet, Solar System, and Galactic Formation were all named 'BADDATA'. Now does this affect the steam version of Spore? I dunno, hasnt happened yet and i dont see anyone else complaining about it. As for some problems that i see with Spore on steam; The game does crash often, and with almost all games that crash often, The game isnt good with autosaves, And if im correct only saves once you get to the next stage. So this can easily set you really far back in Space stage, Sometimes making it not too fun to play. Plus there is the price. The game is kinda dated, and has some problems, So it isnt worth the $20.So if its on sale, Go buy this game, im sure it will be an experience.Now if its not on sale, Get something that you may want instead, unless you really want Spore. then get Spore.

												If ever there was a game that divided opinion, Spore is it! While i can see why it frustrated a lot of people by taking the relatively cutesy path rather than being a genuine look into genetically creating different creatures, it still gives you a huge amount of options when it comes to making your own creations. The second level is where you really get to flex your creativity and is without doubt the best level in the game. It does rather tail off as you get further into it, especially the fifth stage (space travel), but when you feel like a break from the missions themselves, you can simply head back into the creature creation section and create an entire planet's worth of creatures. If you should find this at a sale price, i would recommend it then, but at full price... maybe not.			"

												Overall Review- Challenging game that uses the creativity and mindset of the user to direct the game into a more personal format. Overall score- 7/10Pros- You can get very creative- You can make the game more challenging - The game is customizable in the way that you can select you type of gameplay, for example a friendly and smart spieces, or a ferocious and aggresive one.Cons- The game runs kind of ugly if you dont have a good gaming computer- May get repetitive for some people			"

												It's a great game. But $20 is a little bit pushing it.Well, there are tons of sales, and as I'm writing this there's one right now, so you might want to wait for one.Gameplay:Evolving your creature is something I found super fun. The graphics are really nice and the animals are cute....most of the time...I also love the feature that your behavior effects your reputation as a species, you might be a vicious killer, or a very social creature that likes friends.Unfortunatly, personally I find the extreme change of gamplay a little boring. It starts off as you evolving, killing or befriending other creatures, and eating them or plants. Then it locks the way you look and that's kind of sad, transforming it into a full on tactical birds-eye view of your planet, defending off enemies, and eventually going into..space?So I see what to developers were doing, a little cell in the ocean to advanced beings in space, but it just didn't seem all that interesting to me at that point.Depending on what you like, it has an ok replayibility level, but I like going into create and making my own cool animals.

												Spore has left me with very mixed emotions.  I LOVE going through the Cell stage and then playing through the Creature stage (4.5 out of 5 stars to that point).  The first night I downloaded the game, I had planned to only play a half hour or so before bed, which turned into 3+ hours and having to be harrassed by my husband to finally shut down the notebook.  I was starting to become an addict already!And then the Tribal phase happened.There is a very natural flow between the Cell and Creature stages, with a little more complexity added when you begin to move the camera around.  The game is entirely at your own pace and you aren't penalized for taking your time to explore, look for additional parts, or make more friends.  It's truly a casual game.  And then Tribal turns the game entirely into a Tower Defense game where you have to control multiple units and every minute you spend trying to build a strategy is held against you as the other tribes start to hate you more, attack your village, and steal your food.  To add to the fun, the interface is confusing and unintuitive.  At that point, the game fell to 3 out of 5.I've made it through Tribal once and into the City/Civilization stage.  And that is as far as I'll ever go in this game.  The Cell and Creature stages have lots of replayability, which is why I can still recommend the game despite my obvious dislike of the rest of the stages.  I bought this game when it was on sale so I feel like it was a pretty good buy for the parts I enjoy. "

												SPORE is a very old game. It's very unique, friendly, and (against a lot of other opinions) executed very well. I remember pre-ordering the physical copy of the game as a kid. The first time I booted the game up was just mind blowing. An entire galaxy that's mine to control! I didn't care what others thought, it let my imagination run wild and showed me hundreds of hours of entertainment.Spore is a game about imagination where the limits just keep expanding. As you progress through the game you'll be able to control a creature that you have thrown together, through the stages of evolution. Work hard to get your cell onto land. Dominate the other creatures with friendship or extinction. Take control of your tribe's continent. Unify the world's civilizations. Take control of the galaxy, one solar system at a time, and discover it's secrets. All of this can be done in a game of SPORE.Feeling really creative? Make some friends and share your creations with eachother! To really put your creations to use, consider visiting the DLC store pages! You won't regret the extra hours and hours of gameplay, created by the community!			"

												It's fun at first, but it lacks replayability.The cell stage is mildly entertaining while you decide what kind of life-form you want to grow up to be (though I guarantee you'll pick Omnivore if you can help it).While it's a matter of survival in your animal form, the game really feels fresh and new. In fact, I would've liked it more if the animal stage was a lot longer. The way you interact with other animals, the way you take on larger creatures or even epic monsters, the migration patterns of your herd and exploring the wide world is really fun and really engaging.But after the animal stage, the game becomes a very basic, very lackluster real-time strategy game. The tribal and civilization stages are nothing more than mash-ups of Age of Empires and Civilization, the only bonus being that you get to design your stuff. There's nothing here that you haven't seen before, from three-choice politics to point-and-click control of armies comprised entirely of a single land vehicle type, which you will no doubt convert to a fleet made entirely of aircraft due to them not being limited as to where they can travel.But the biggest letdown was the space stage. Instead of starting at one vessel and working your way to commanding a whole fleet with which to explore and conquer as you see fit, you're stuck with a single ship occassionally accompanied by a few brainless AI ships who are utterly useless against the more powerful space empires and tend to die pretty quickly. Oh, sure, you can upgrade that one ship, but there's no real sense of progress being made.The graphics aren't that great, with everything looking about as well polished as that old CG television show Reboot, just with improved animation. If the textures and shapes were a bit more complex it might stand out.I'd recommend this game only if it's on sale or free for a weekend, because it really isn't worth paying full price for this. It has enough juice for about 1 playthrough, but afterwards I really can't see any reason to go 'round again except to make different choices that will ultimately lead to the same result. But if you take the path of least resistance, you'll end up making the same choices each time.Ultimately, it's a good concept, but the mid-to-late game mechanics really feel uninspired, like too much focus was given to aesthetic customization options rather than gameplay mechanics.

												Spore is a fantastic game, whether I'm playing the full game from cell to space, or just creating a fantastic creature with my 5 year old niece. Spore is both user-friendly and appropriate for all ages and I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.There is only one thing I would change about this game, and this is a feature that only I am likely to care about. I want it to be possible to type more for the descriptions of the creatures and their vehicles and I want it to be possible to type descriptions for individual cities on their planets. I like to create a lot of backstory for the creatures and vehicles in my game because I want to tether the game to reality. In an effort to do this I've taken to documenting the various wars, city foundings, vehicle creations race extinctions etc. on a piece of paper. I set a timer on my phone to keep track of the ""years"" that have passed in the game and keep a detailed log of my civilization's history every 5 ""years"" from start to finish. It would be easier if I could record more info for each creature and for each city on every planet, it'd certainly save my wrist from arthritis later in life.  "

												Ok, I've been playing this game since I was.. I... I can't remember. I just cannot say enough good things about this game. I've spent more time than is reasonable, and was rather obsesseded actually. I DO however, remember being devoured by giant monstrosities, befriending others, and conquering the universe.  ""Ok, gotta put those eyes over there.. Maybe this should be a Cyclops! No.. Perhaps a tail hat! Definitely a mustache, oh yes. And a nose ring."" Just one of the many things I remember thinking.  This game is truly huge. It has so many aspects, that I've replayed it more times than I can count and am still thoroughly enjoying myself. If you have even the faintest creative spark in you, this game is for you.  Please Note: This was released in 2008. It's not going to have the best graphics, or anything like that. It just makes it even more impressive that this kind of game was developed and released that long ago.			"

												It's fantastic being able to design and play as your own creatures.  The design possibilities are nearly limitless.  Creating and messing around briefly as your creatures is really the only great part about this game.  The Cell, Tribal, Civ, and Space stages are mostly just disappointing and tedious.  If you have a day free, you can play all the way from Cell stage to Space stage in a single sitting.  Space is agreeably the worst part of the game sense you are set as a single ship managing your entire empire. (And no expansion fixes that)  I'm pretty upset that they gave up on this franchise.  I feel like it could have easily become amazing and complex over generations like the Sims franchise. TL:DR Only get this game when it's on sale.			"

												This game is impeccable. The space stage is very fun, and it is a sandbox, which i really like. Although once you are Omnipotent, there is not much else you can do other than go to war, ally with other aliens and spread your colony throughout the galaxy. I played the space age for about 48 hours before i got a bit bored, and right now i am allying with the big bad meanie beanie who are the grox. I have always been looking for a game in which you evolve, but not an extremely serious one, this has multiple fun stages for you to enjoy, and many achievements for you to collect. The cell stage is like agar.io and one of the LEAST fun ones because it is so short (I can do it in 5 minutes without a particular rush) and then you grow legulars and go onto the creature stage (the least fun in my opinion, but for many it is a favourite. Tribal stage, oh tribal stage. I find it very fun! I just go around befriending other tribes :) Civilisation stage is one of the funnest. I like being religious and converting everyone :3 then space!! It actually does have a main goal and that is to go to the centre of the galaxy, which i found quite a challenge but when i did it it was so worth it for you get a very useful tool :3 10/10 would evolve again.

												Spore is a great game. I've been playing for over 24 hours now in total across Spore and Spore: Galactic Adventures. You start off as a cell, evolve into higher level species and eventually become a spacefaring civilization. I've learned a few different things about the game that I feel newer players could have use of knowing.Evolve your creature to max in the creature stage if you plan on playing with Galactic Adventures. You will be using creature stage abilities a lot here, better make sure that it becomes as easy as possible for you.Save often. Spore crashes occasionally, and with the immersiveness of the game, it's easy to forget to save. Spore does NOT have auto-save functionality.One more thing that a lot of people miss: BACK UP YOUR SPORE DATA FOLDERS! I had the game suddenly delete all my progress in Spore without any warning. I don't know the programming logic that would result in such a thing happening, but when I launched Spore yesterday, I was greeted with the main menu with no saves in it. Luckily I already had an older backup of the data as I copied it for playing on another computer once, but I've lost a lot of progress.Spore data folders may be found at %appdata%\Spore as well as ""My Spore Creatures"" in your Documents folder. Back them up regularly.			"

												Spore is by far one of the best sandbox evolution based survival games I've played. Given that I haven't heard of any other games that pursue this kind of playstyle, my review may be slightly biased. You will start off as a single cell that has been brought to your planet by a meteorite. You can choose between playing as a carnivore or an herbivore. In the first stage (Cell) the carnivore is argueably the better choice because there will be plenty of creatures to eat, and you get parts to add to your cell faster this way. The currency in this stage is DNA points, which can be gained by eating plants (herbivore) or meat (carnivore). Once you have filled the progress bar to full, you will advance to the creature stage. In this stage, your cell evolved into a creature and migrates onto land with a group of your species. You are able to add legs and arms in this stage, and can add a filter mouth or jaw in order to make your species into an omnivore. I highly recommend this because you are not stuck with being forced to find animals to kill or migrate to find more fruit to eat. The currency in this stage is the same as the currency in the cell stage, however is gained by allying groups or destroying them. Once you have finished the creature stage through defeating or allying other groups of animals, you will transition to the tribal stage! In this stage you band together with your group and make alliances with other tribes or exterminate them. There is a wide array of tools available to choose from in this stage, from fishing spears, to stone axes, to healing rods. All of them serve various functions and your main currency to purchase these buildings is food. Which can either be gathered from the wild or plundered from enemy villages. Once you have finished the tribal stage, you will advance to the civilization stage! In this stage, the tribes you either destroyed or allied will band together to form your first city! You get to design a lot in this stage. The town hall, factories, houses, entertainment, boats, cars, airplanes! It's all at your fingertips! The main currency in this stage is called Sporebucks. This is earned by selling spice, the hot commodity in spore, which is produced by geysers on your planet. Eventually, other groups of your species will arise with their own cities. You can either choose to ally them, purchase their city through economic means, convert their city through religious means, or force their city into submission through military means. How you played each stage determines which kinds of special abilities that you have. In the civilization stage, the way you played the tribal stage determines whether you are a militant or religious city. How you caputure an enemy city determines its specialization. Or for instance you capture a military city by religious means, you can choose whether it is a military city or a religious city. Once you have achieved total global domination, you will advance to the space stage! Most people dislike the space stage because it's ""boring"" or ""too different from previous stages"". I think it is the most fun stage because you can purchase star systems, plant colonies, craft planets to your liking, discover other empires, destroy lesser empires, uplift a species in a lower stage to a higher one, terraform planets that were 150 degrees Celsious to a comfortable 22 degrees, control the spice empire through taking ownership of the high profit spice planets, defeat the evil Grox empire guarding the center of the galaxy, and so much more! People dislike it because it takes so long, but that's the fun of it. You are but a single planet in a galaxy of tens of thousands! Have fun, explore!

												Great game! (Spoiler Alert!) As you start out in the sea of some planet that you chose, you eat others and things found in the waters to eventually become a land animal. As you progress you get to create your own creature and make civilization. Others advance with you to become an enemy or an ally. You then take over the planet and create your first space ship to explore space, try taking other planets, and going into war with other colonies on other planets just because you want to. 10/10			"

												'SPORE' is a game where you start off crash landed from a meteor into a planet and you're trying to grow from your tiny bacteria to a large galactic nation. You play through multiple stages and choose how your civilization progresses.Pros:-You can play this through more then once and will get a different outcome-You get to customize nearly EVERYTHING to your liking-Can keep you occupied for hours-Runs wellCons:-Some evoloution stages are extremly short-Galactic stage is the longest by far and I wished the others were made longer-No autosave so if the game DOES crash you're doomed			"

												Fantastic game that I loved back when it first came out and I love it still. Basically it's a mixed genre game. When you start it you have casual amoeba swimming game. Then you evolve and go to land where you go around eating fruits or other animals until you advance to tribal stage. Tribal stage becomes a kind of a lightweight RTS where you attack other tribes, create tools, equip them to your tribe members. After advancing to Civilization age, you start to build cities, defenses, vehicles (land, air, naval) and it's even more of RTS. And then you go into space... :) The best part of the game is definitely Creature Creator though. It's easy to use and you can make  many different cute creatures, only your imagination is the limit. Spore is a nice game, and additional pack add to the game but are optional.You can even play with the music and change it during gameplay (different beats and stuff).It's not the best game ever, but I can recommend it without any problems, especially if you're into building stuff (Sims, Sim City...)  Graphics:  ★★★★★ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Music:  ★★★★☆   Overall:  ★★★★☆ "

												Spore is a bit incredulously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It introduces something amazing, an entirely new concept with you, but when you get about halfway through the game it takes that all away from you with hardly any reason or meaning why.Playing a new game, you start as a little microbe thing with some very basic gameplay and some addictive mechanics. The goal of this stage is to eat and get bigger until you fill up the meter at the bottom, it's promising but gets boring fast which is just as well because the stage can be over that fast if you want it to be and you can move on to become a proper Spore creature, going into Creature stage.Creature stage... is the best part of the game. This is the part where you're shown an almost infinite variety and customizability combinations in the creature editor, with all sorts of interesting options and different things. You can make a four or six legged monstrosity with ♥♥♥♥ing spikeballs coming out of it's nose or maybe a ball with a pair of legs and four arms, with a ridiculous variety of hands, mouths, eyes, assortments of weapons and the likes.And if that didn't already appeal to you, on top of all this, you're shown an expansive world with other species which you can befriend or extinct and giant ♥♥♥♥ing creatures you can attempt to slay if you get powerful enough for thrills. And this courses through an ENTIRE PLANET of these other species and massive creatures. This appealed to me so much that I absolutely loved everything about it, it was so thrilling, it was absolutely majestic and wonderful.But then comes Tribal stage. Once you're filled on the meter at the bottom and maybe have the full look for your creature that you want, the content was pretty stunted there. Personally, I would have loved to have the whole game be Creature stage, just getting progressively better.Instead, it's all taken away from you. You're shown an entirely different genre of game in some sadistic attempt to radically change your idea on playing the game. Initially, I dismissed this as EA's standard policy to alienate their entire ♥♥♥♥ing demographic and tried to make sense of it, but no.Your love that you put into your creature to maybe make it more socially friendly or combat advantageous in Creature stage? Poof. The only things you retain from Creature stage are the actual planet (which is no longer free-roam), the other species on it (now lowered to domestic pets and other rising tribes which are pretty generic and bland) and the look of your creature as well as it's voice and how it moves (like if you have a four-legged creature, it moves the same way it did when you were controlling it yourself, but it's generic and loses it's charm). The whole game turned into this forced, linear pathway that is completely different from what was shown to you earlier.Tribal was pretty short, though. Civilisation stage... Ugh. It introduced an entirely new editor, but it was like it was trying to shoehorn user creativity back into the game, but with no real purpose. The things in Creature stage were actually relevant to the gameplay, like combat and social, with the other idea of it being whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want and it can apply to the actual gameplay, like moving on. While Civilisation stage things do have the element of application to gameplay, it's just less and less content. There's only the coolness in making vehicles. That's it.Space stage is another step where the Civilisation stage was going in the first place, you deal in planets instead of nations/cities, you deal with a galaxy instead of a world... It's incredibly boring, though. There's combat segments and some customization, but the game lost all charm for me at this point.But yes, if you agree with everything I said and want to buy the game, then NEVER progress past Creature stage unless you REALLY want to. It's not that rewarding. Incredible beginning content with incredible mechanics, but really sucks later on.			"

												Really enjoyed spore. It came out many years ago, on my birthday and I had my dad get it for my present when I was younger. It was really a fun game, I enjoyed it a lot, and I enjoy it even better now that I have a better computer. The graphics are chunky, and that's just what makes it's style!Good:-------------------------------------------+Make custom creatures+Literally customize anything, you want it's toe to be huge, but the legs to be small? GO FOR IT.+Runs basically on any pc, it's such an old game.+Graphics look nice actually, on my Gx950 graphics card.+Each mode is indepth, so you can get different endings and benefits depending on the path you took.+You can technically upload your creations and download others.Bad:--------------------------------------------+I havent personally been able to log into my EA account, so I play offline.+This game isn't what people wanted it to be - but it's good for those who don't care what it was 'supposed' to be. My husband and I played this as young teens, and we enjoyed a lot for what it was.+ Multiple ending types, and creature spawns can be good, but it can feel old after a while with the AI being similar each game.

												Okay....soo I am reviewing this from when I played it many years ago shortly after it came out on PC. At the time I remember looking this game up and seeing its promise for a in-depth evolution system which seemed almost too complicated for me to understand but sure looked fun as hell~So I got it on a CD at some point and I remember playing it all night and day. It was a few weeks before I stopped but while playing it I felt like it was missing something, like I was playing half of the game that was promised. At the time I was on end-game stuff which is the spaceship stage (which pretty much never ends). So I started to realize it isn't really complicated and in-depth as it was promised to be. It seems more basic and nothing super advanced.... but I still loved it. Its a shame though because it could of still been something much MUCH bigger if it had more depth. Also apparently some of the Sport EA servers are shut down now so there isn't much of a community for the game now.To keep it short...the game is really fun if you like a mixture of RPG, Sims, Strategy games with heavy customization to keep it personal and unique to every person. I highly recommend this game still even if it is a bit dull around the edges.			"

												If you buy the bundle, the DLCs count as separate games. So, if you want to access everything, launch Spore: Galactic Adventures instead of the other 2 games. (This is good for those who want to pad their Steam game count. 3 games instead of 1.)(Shows 0.2 hours since I launch it from Galactic Adventures instead. Each has their own playtime.)30FPS lock. This can be fixed if you find the 60FPS guide and go over what the guy says. However, DO NOT copy/paste the codes straight from the guide. You need to have the spaces exactly like the screenshots. No V-Sync option, though going into Nvidia Control Panel and enabling it fixed it for me.No Anti-Aliasing option, but going into Nvidia Control Panel again and enabling it works.No Autosaves and crashes randomly. So manually save often.Even in 30FPS, it's still a lot of fun. Highly recommend, even though it has poor graphics options.			"

If you have ever wanted to be involved in the evolution process of a species, or ever wanted to fly the galaxy while expanding your civilization to other planets in the universe, or simply just create a species, just to watch it get erradicated or destroyed by another sentient species,  Then I highly suggest you check out Spore!

												At best, a guilty pleasure. At worst, a miserable pile of disappointing crap. When originally announced, the game promised many interesting concepts and tools for creation. When released, it was a mish-mash of oversimplified mini-games leading up to a fairly disappointing space stage. It doesn't help that there is very little quality control with the user generated content, so most of the new creatures you'll see will be horrifying blobs or ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters.

												It only took me 8 years to play it... yes, get it. You can feel the quality, it's a powerful game, every phase is new and well done and the progression feels great. It might feel short after the first playthrough though.I have no idea if the online features work and I don't really care. There are minor bugs and problems with the AI, for example in tribal stage when gathering food, but playing around with your own creations makes more than up for it. For example: you may see your ship from the other playthrough abducting other creatures or crashed in some random planet... The end game, in space, it's an almost endless sandbox to play in. I like it, every game should have this.tl;dr Great replay value, great game, complex but inviting.			"

												This game was initially  overhyped, but beneath the surface is something totally worthwhile, if somewhat simplistic. However, simple isn't always bad in games, and quite often some ofthe most addicting games are quite simple (Candy Crush) or have some simple elements (sneaking around  clueless NPCs in Skyrim). Spore is not Candy Crush, however it certainly isn't Skyrim either.  Spore has an amazing creation engine that is in an of itself completely fun to  use. Growing up I used to joke about there one day being game that was  nothing more than the create a character function, where that WAS the game. Spore is not that game. Even with the parts pack it will give you at best one more page or less of pieces to mess around with. (Yet to this day EA has no qualms about still charging $19.99 for even its worst  reviewed Sims 3 expansions.) Spore could have been better but this was before Minecraft sold for an enormous sum and the industry took note of how much life you can breathe into a piece of software by allowing people real creative  control. I'm sure at the time EA was more worried about ""Sporn"" and other issues they didn't want to spend their time managing to preserve the game,  and the company's, brand image.  Spore though presents some amazing possibilities, and also functions in some ways as a statement on life  itself, from the single celled on up. No matter how big and complex we get, we still seem to encounter some of the same essential problems.  I do recommend Spore, but even more so I recommend EA make a sequel. Spore only requires 4gb of space, a modern AAA game will usually require 15 times that. There is a lot of room for expansion here, and profit, if EA is willing to construct a sequel that allows their engine to more fully serve people's creative impulses.			"

												Will Wright's fascination with letting people play god  from SimCity in 1989 to the game that garnered worldwide fame and cemented EA as the top-dog in game publishing for over half a decade, The Sims has led to Spore, the first game where your actions truly feel godlike. But a new Sim game this is not, and this is apparent right from the moment your asteroid fragment breaks apart and you lay eyes on the amoeba-like creature you're going to manifest.At the start, you're prompted to choose between being a carnivore or a herbivore, and that determines whether your little cell starts with a meat-eating jaw or a collection of small tentacle-like appendages for tearing apart microscopic plant matter. You direct your cell around and eat accordingly. Eating and surviving  are the only real objectives for this first section of the game, which plays like an organic blend of fl0w and Pac-Man, and becomes progressively more difficult as your cell becomes multicellular bigger and more complex.Eventually you'll devour enough to grow a (tiny) brain, and advance to the second phase of the game  the creature phase.Immediately taken to the creator, now in 3D your humble little cell can now use a pair of legs. As your new belegged creature wanders landward, with identical friends in tow, you get your first glimpse of your home planet. This phase of the game is more complex, and you must choose between befriending the other species you encounter, and eradicating them from the face of the planet. The latter works similarly to combat in games like World of Warcraft. You've got a set of abilities and when you use an ability, you trigger a cooldown.The third phase the tribal section  works like a small-scale RTS, with resource collecting, unit production and building construction. You must assign villagers various tasks and spend food on hatching new tribe members, or adding to your small pool of buildings. Again you'll meet other tribes, and you'll be forced to choose between allying with them and systematically dismembering them and torching their huts.The entire time you've been playing, the game has tracked your actions and determined various passive and active bonuses for the next part accordingly, and depending on your technique, you'll end up as a military nation, a religious nation or an economic nation.The actual gameplay for this section plays out like a simplified version of Rise of Nations. You capture resource points, build units, and try to take over the other cities with them. The depth lies within the ability to design the layout of the cities, thereby determining how resistant to attacks they are, and how efficient at making money they are. During the final phase of the game, having unified your planet, you once again take control of a single entity and man a spacecraft.here are several introductory missions to get you used to the capabilities of your ship, and before long you're flying between stars and meeting other races. No longer earthbound, you are literally free to do whatever you want. Interaction with other races is much more fleshed out in this section of the game. There are dialogue boxes a la Sid Meier's Civilization where you can choose to trade goods, or take diplomatic actions, and the races each have their own fleshed out personality.In conclusion, Spore is definitely an exciting game in this time of repetitive ideas in an over crowded gaming market. It's not quite an RTS nor an RPG nor a strategy game but one that successfully combines all three genres into an exciting game that works quite well and is complimented with good graphics and a great premise.Overall 9/10.

												I enjoyed this game. I recommend buying the DLC for it as well though, because the Galactic Adventures DLC adds a lot. You could do without the other one though, but you might as well get it too if you have the money. (read no further if you don't want to know what happens as you progress.)You start off on a planet of your choosing. From here you get to start off as a microscopic creature where you can evolve over time by either eating what I assume is algae, or other creatures. From this, paths branch off. You evolve into a mindless animal, who either tries to make friends with other creatures, fights others, or both. Then you evolve again into a tribe, where the same principles apply.  The only sad part is that you can't choose to be an underground civilization, or one that dwells in trees, underwater or on top of mountains. You can choose to give your creature wings though, if you'd like them to ""fly"". It's sort of just gliding, due to the fact that you can only flap your wings about 5 times or something like that.The next stage of evolution brings you to city life, where you can either choose to dominate other nations economically, religiously, or through war. Once you've dominated all of the other nations, you advance yet again to the space stage. It's basically the same thing all over again, but in space with spaceships. That's not just it though. In space you get a variety of different missions in which you can colonize planets, eradicate diseased creatures, and even elevate tribal civilizatons!That's not just it though. You get to create basically everything from your creature (which you can change until you get the later stages), to the buildings in which they live and work. Not only that, but you get to create their land vehicles, air vehicles, and boats. Then once you get to the space stage you get to create the spaceship model that your whole empire uses. If you want to play smart during the city and space stages, you can micromanage some of your cities to gain more income. Income is used to purchase vehicles during the city stage, and upgrades for your ship during the space stage. You get simple money during the city stage, but in the space stage, cities produce spice. You can sell the spices that are produced for a lot of money, if you can find the right person to sell them to.Your goal is to reach the center of the galaxy, for who knows what might be there? But many obstacles stand in your way. Deal with them how you wish, because there are multiple ways to get there. Make friends, or dominate others to bring your rule to the whole galaxy. It's up to you. Just remember that everyone needs allies, or just really big guns. Lastly. The game is really monotonous in my opinion. But I like those sorts of games. If you're not a fan of monotonous tasks then you might not be a fan of this game in particular.  Despite my annoyances with this game, I still enjoyed it a lot. Especially the missions that the DLC had to offer. I'd give this game a solid 7/10			"

												Since I've played a little bit, let me tell you why it's awesome: In General The game has multiple stages: Cell stage, Creature Stage, Tribal Stage, Civilization Stage, and Space stage. You can make friends and enemies YOU CAN KILL EVERYONE You can befriend everyone <3 (at least until you get into the civ stage, where everyone hates you) The video above this review makes this game look nothing like it actually is. 3 Different levels of difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard.  Cell stage  EAT  EVERYTHING  AS AN OMNIVORE. EVERYTHIIING!!!! *OR* Eat just plants as an herbivore. Eat just meat as a carnivore What you decide to eat is what you eat for the rest of the game. You can also put on herbivore and carnivore mouths on to eat things other than what you mostly ate in the cell stage BECOME THE MOST MONSTROUS SPERM CELL TO EVER EXIST Eat things for DNA points. Creature Stage  ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. You can literally make almost anything you want. Kill things or socialize with things for dna points to customize your creature. Tribal Stage SPOILER  IF YOU PLAY THIS ON A CARNIVORE RUN ON HARD, PREPARE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ FOR A LONG GAME OF WAR Food is the new DNA. Run out of food and you're screwed.  I'm almost certain that being an herbivore is easier Kill people and destroy their tribes to add to your totem pole Befriend people and add them to your totem pole Hate everyone because they are ALWAYS ♥♥♥♥ING ATTACKING YOU Civilization Stage  Laugh at everyone when you destroy or take over their cities Laugh at everyone who accepts your cheap buy offers Hate every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ military city Place building in your cities in any way you want to.  Space Stage  Have no idea what you are doing Find out what to do Become the second largest empire in the galaxy Have more money than you know what to do with Kill everyone Befriend everyoneThats about all I have to say about this game. Enjoy!			"

												For the record, my hours with this game with the GA expansion are DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE compared to what's being shown here. Like, 600+ hours.Absolutely love this game, I never stop coming back to play it.I will admit, when I first got this game, oh, 4-ish years ago, I was expecting a tad bit more out of it than I saw. Then again, Spore, in and of itself was an INCREDIBLY ambitious game in its early stages. It's not the perfect, all-encompassing game some, like me, might hope it to be, but it is incredibly fun and incredibly challanging on the higher difficulties, ESPECIALLY in space, which is pretty much nigh impossible to completely ""finish"", lest you have no life whatsoever. It's nice and kid-friendly with the cartoonish creature designs, and the quick gameplay up to the space stage is a boon for casual gamers. But for those of us seeking to conquer the galaxy, and get the real sense of action and adventure, the space stage has enough alien genocides, nuclear explosions, and planet busting for even the most hardcore 4X strategy gamer. It's an enjoyable game with a nice mix of everything and quite a few challenges mixed in. If nothing else, play it for the space stage; probably the best, least mundane part of the game.The DLCs add some nice features as well; the new adventure feature in Galactic Adventures adds an interesting new level of complexity and depth to the already complex space stage, and makes nice use of the creature properties you all thought were going to be useless after the creature stage.Side note, FINALLY managed to make a decent-looking human with the in-game parts - a painful ordeal, to be sure.Oh, and make sure not to ♥♥♥♥ off the Grox if you like your ♥♥♥ where it is.

												Highly underappreciated game. What spore lacks in finese it makes up for in scope. Like most SIM games the fun is directly tied into how much you enjoy creating things and being creative. If you don't enjoy spending hours making your creature look like a vampire squirrel and then evolving them into space venturing capitalist rodents, well, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else, once you are past the glitches (there are plenty even now), its a good waste of time and a creative outlet.			"

												Very interesting game to play...really brings out your creative side. When you first start playing, your first reaction is usually, ""Awwww! It's so cute!"" or, ""Oh my god It's going to eat me!"" Let me say that this game is very realistic, and if you love animals, or ""creatures"" you should surely choose to be an herbivore. You choose from Carnivore, Herbivore, and Omnivore. Sometimes you'll say, ""Ugh, there's too much going on!"" or, ""Give me a break!"" But in the end things will calm down and you will begin enjoying the game a lot more once you get the hang of it and what to do and what not to do...the easiest way, and the hardest way. Once you get to space though, the game's pace slows down considerably. You get into kind of a routine and begin doing the same thing over and over again. Some quit at that point, and just keep creating games and stopping at space, but if you get past the more boring or slow-paced parts, it gets fun and ""not-so-boring."" All in all, if you like a game with plenty of chances to show off your creativity, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												There's a lot to be said for spore.Tld;r Spore is a game that features multiple stages of life, each serving as a unique game-mode of sorts, all starring your own custom created lifeform, contending for survival against other randomly generated life form. The biggest flaw in this game is that each mode seems so short, and lacking depth.If the worst thing I could say about this game is there's not enough of it, it could definitely have some worse flaws.It's a really unique and enjoyable experience, with some glaring flaws. Its a game that allows the player to experience the evoulationary stage of their very own creations. It's greatest and worst feature is the various stages of life you play as. more on that later.to describe the game, you start out with a cell that you modify and fight other cells. its an interesting sort of ""big eat small"" game type that last until you eventually evolve into the next stage of life. This next stage of life consists of creating a land walking creature using various parts consisting of heads, mouths, arms legs, and more, to fend for itself among a randomly generated selection of creatures, both gigantic and small. This stage is fun in its own merit, but eventually leads onto a tribal stage.The tribal stage was the most fun for me, a sort of RTS village manager. You select groups of people to roam about the world and gather resources for the village. After this you evolve into a civilization style game, which wasn't bad at all either. You manage cities, their happiness and resource output and whatnot while conquering other cities. After this is a space exploration mode which I haven't played at this time (I know its been out forever!)  "

												I really tried to love this game. It is cute, funny, open-ended, and explores new grounds for videogames. If anything, it is admirable. But is it fun? The mechanics in every evolutionary stage are rather shallow and repetitive, the strategy components are severly limited and the action components reduced to a few button presses once in a while. Exploration falls flat too since the procedural planets are boring and samey.The draw of this game for many seems to be the character creator, as evident by the slew of creature videos on youtube, and it is entertaining for a while, but cannot hold my attention for long.In the end, it is suprisingly... boring.

												Great game, you can abduct civilians and jettison them into space. 10/10But seriously though its a game where u can create your own creature starting from the cell stage through to having inter-galactic wars throughout the galaxy. The galaxy is made up of around 500,000 stars. Each star has its own planets and many have their own civilisations or animals.When you are connected through the internet in spore you will end up seeing other peoples creatures and civilisations pop up in your world. And also your own creatures from other saves.BTW The reason i have so little hours on this is because i played through one of the dlc's in which i have a hundred and something hours			"

There are so many thing to do and evey new game is really a new game and there actually has a entire galaxy to explore. I don't think that I could ever finish this game even if I spent my entire life playing it (really, does anyone has ever finished this game ?).

												I love this game. I originally got the boxed version of it for Christmas a few years ago. Last year I got a new PC, and unfortunately my CD would no longer work. I am so glad that steam had this, as the steam version of this game is essentially DRM Free (Steam is the DRM in this case.) And now I can install it on as many Windows PCs as I want. Unfortunately there is no Mac version, like the boxed edition has. So if you have a Mac, you need to use the boxed version, or the origin version, which has the DRM unfortuneately. The only cons I can think of with this version at least, are sometimes, when you die in the creature stage, the game crashes (only happens after you move nests for the first time, but seems to stop happening once you have a big enough brain to advance to tribal.) And the game may crash when you are placing buildings in your cities in the Civilization or Space Stage. (Usually this only happens in space, when you have LARGE empire, and even then it isn't too killing. Just save before placing buildings.)Now for a list of Pros and Cons:Pros:Very Robust gameplay. 5 stages, Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, Space. I like each of them a lot, but I feel that the Tribe and Civilization stages are waay to short. In the Cell Stage, you are a Cell, and you need to eat, and evolve. In the Creature stage, you are a Creature, and your goal is to develop your brain, while at the same time collecting parts, and improving your Creature. The Tribe and Civilization stages play more like an RTS, and your goal is to dominate all the tribes and civilizations. In the space stage, it is essentially an open-ended sandbox, and you can do pretty much whatever you want. The only downside is you don't have unlimited money, so it isn't a TRUE sandbox.Attention to detail. This game looks quite realistic, but still has that cartoony feel to it. The Water looks very similar to real life water, especially when the sun is reflecting off of it. Creatures, and Plants, with certain paint coats, will also have the sun reflect off of it, and it looks quite pretty. There are also Nebula, and even Supernovas (Which is just eye candy, no stars actually blow up.)Replayability. There are 10 different archetypes in space stage, and each has a unique superpower. The possibilities to get all archetypes are practically endless. The archetypes are, Warrior, Shaman, Trader, Ecologist, Scientist, Knight, Zealot, Diplomat, Bard, and Wanderer. Each has a unique super power, and if you have galatic adventures, can obtain the other super powers via adventures, without losing your current super power. (with the exception of knights and wanderers. The Knight Super Power is impossible to acheive via galactic adventures, only through evolution. And Wanderers do not have a superpower, as that is the archetype you get for starting in space.)Cons:The only one I can think of is the one I listed before, where the game may crash on death in the creature stage, or when building buildings in the Civ or Space Stage. Both are minor, and as long as you save frequently, you should be okay.Oh... and EA has abandoned this game unfortunately. They're too proud of the new Sim City, and the Sims 4 to even consider fixing this game, or making a sequel to this game, which really sucks. In America the servers for this game, are suprisingly still up, but AFAIK the European servers went down, but the Asian and Oceania servers are still up too I think. "

												If you're gonna get it, get it while it's 5 bucks. That is the price it is really worth, maybe 6. This game is a good stepping-stone for the evolution genre, and a few other indie games are following in it's path if you dig around on the internet. It's the first iteration of a still new genre. You can create a variety of your own creatures in the brilliant creature creator, and the main appeal of this is being able to see other people's creations in your world! Cool right?Well EA has abandoned this game, so don't expect to see anything cool other than what the game developers put in there. Sometimes you can see your own creations, so that's cool.Unfortunately, despite the variety of creatures, most of them behave the same way. You a few abilities, ranging from stealth to very limited flying. You can be a herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore.The game has 5 stages that are all pretty different, but the game shines in Creature mode, the second stage. Where you control one creature in your species, and evolve it as it gets more sentient. Like I said before, most creatures behave the same way in Creature mode. They all hang around in their nests and hardly interact with eachother, and if they do they don't do it enough. I wanted to see creatures huntings other creatures, and bird-like creatures and bugs, but all I saw was one wandering into an aggressive territory and getting slaughtered. There is no variety of roles in the ecosystem of the game. It's just ""Five Boogleborfs hanging around a nest. Kill them or sing at them?"" And that's it. Sometimes you see ""Epics"" which are huge creatures, that are indeed epic. Every once in a while a world event happens, like a meteor shower or a UFO flies by. While cool, they don't mean anything.They did a good job of making a world that looks real from far away. But get closer, and you see all sorts of flaws and places for massive improvement.Buy it now while it's 5 bucks. Otherwise I don't recommend. Stick around, in a while ""THRIVE"" will come out. Look it up, it sounds good.EDIT: It's good for kids though. I got this game when I was a little naive to the world of gaming, that's where most of my playtime come from.			"

												I absolutely love creating all sorts of weird monsters and creatures in this game!That aside, I do love this game, but it's nowhere near perfect. The grindy nature of this particular game genre (God Simulators, etc.) kinda wears thin after a while of playing it, making Spore a game that's better in short bursts. Aside from the creation of critters and buildings, the way the gameplay changes keeps it interesting, and the space level (once you make it) is actually quite deep and complex.Recommended? Yes, but only if you liked playing with legos as a kid (which should be everyone) or love God Sim games (which definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea).			"

TL;DR : This is not a game; it's an environment in which you can admire your creature-making and vehicle-making skills in cool situations.  It's very repetetive, but the scope of the game allows for it to be somehow addictive once you reach the space-age.  So yeah, it's great for very casual gamers, but anyone who wants to experience interesting gameplay will find this game lacking.  Pick it up if it's a couple quid, but I wouldn't pay full-price for it.  Also, ignore the expansion packs.This isn't really one cohesive game, but a series of mini-games, so I'll just review each one seperately:Cellular Stage: No fun at all, but it's designed as a tutorial to introduce you to the creature-creation and DNA mechanics; swim towards stuff in 2D to get points once your creature auto-eats it - other creatures for 'bad'/'carnivore' points, plants for 'good'/'herbivore' points; a mixture for 'neutral'/'omnivore' points.Creature Stage: Like the cellular stage, but 3D, and to get the 'good' points, you have to sing, dance and pose your way into getting other creatures to like you.  Creature customisation gets real here and you spend most of your time wandering around picking up skeletons to unlock new parts.  This is the most boring stage IMHO due to it's repetition.Tribal Stage: Exactly like the creature stage apart from instead of unlocking new parts, you unlock buildings to give you weapons to kill, or instruments to win over other tribes; it's only less boring than the creature stage because it passes much more quickly.Civilisation Stage:The overall point of this stage is the same as the tribal stage, but you also get to design vehicles (land / sea / air) and buildings - as the modelling is the most fun part of the whole game, this is real fun.  You have a -little- bit of resource management as when you're putting the buildings in your city, there's an optimal pattern. It also introduces the 'diplomacy' mechanic which is basically 'get people to like you by giving them money, and then ask them to give you everything they own'.  This bit goes by in a flash, but that's good because the most fun part is...Space Stage:This is basically where you apply everything at once - you build spaceships, buildings, vehicles, and even new creatures (once you get the 'creature tweaker' tool for your spaceship).  You can basically take over the whole galaxy by terraforming each planet and putting down colonies...which is fun and satisfying for the first few times, but once you get your first million bucks everything becomes VERY easy and the game stops being fun to play.  It doesn't stop being addictive, however, because you still find yourself saying things like ""If I make my main spaceship look like a star destroyer, can I try and befriend every other alien race who's ships are TIE-fighters so I can fly around with an Imperial fleet?"" and you spend the next several hours exploring the galaxy finding / uplifting new races; or you set yourself the task of entirely wiping out the 'big bad' Grox...which I think is impossible, but still.So yeah, I mean...it's a really great casual game, but if you're after any depth at all you will end up disappointed.  It is very cool flying around in an X-Wing though, and painting every planet white...and setting the ground units to imperial walkers and the air-units to Snow Speeders so you can re-enact the battle of Hoth...

												I've been playing Spore pretty much since it came out, back then it was buggy as hell and unsupported, but that was ON windows Vista, and Vista sucks, I recently brought the game after I moved onto Windows 8, Spore only crashed once, literally.Spore in my opinion is a great game, even though it's EA, but Spore is very creative and smart, starting from a very tiny fish to a full grown Galactic Space Empire, it takes a good amount of time to do the game to get to Space stage, in my opinion, Space stage is the most fun stage since I love space and exploring planets and communicating with other alien races, you can be evil like the Grox and destory alien empires, destory planets and stuff, or you can be really friendly and be friends with many alien races as possible.My favourite easter egg in Spore is finding Earth, out of the 50,000 stars (That's how many stars there are in Spore's game), it's really hard however when you find Earth, you also find all the planets in the solar system apart from Pluto, because Pluto is not a planet anymore, fegits.I highly recommend that you buy it, Spore is very fun.

You'll meet, and kill many funny and cool looking creations. I really do enjoy what the game offers, and the things you can create, and destroy!

Spore is a great game with a ton of unique features that make this game differnt from the others. After playing it again and again i can say that this is a game with much replay value allowing players to experiment with differnt combinations of creature types like becoming an omnivore or becoming a waring civilization or simply making it so your species can finnacially succeed. I can also say that all the different stages add something different to the emersion of gameplay whether your managing food in tribal or designing new vehicles in the civilazation stage.The space stage may seem repetitve and tedious but not only does the rest of the game make up for it but the creators added the Galactic Adventures DLC to make things more interesting. But, as an older games there is expected to be bugs to it graphically or bugs that affect gameplay. The only major one i've come across with my crappy computer was an occasinally crash that shuts the program out. A simple solution is to simply save the game constantly. Besides that there is hours of gameplay that is fun to pick up once and a while. I suggest this to anyone who just wants to play god and screw with life. Even though it says i have only played it for a small amount of time i've been playing it on a seperate file on the DLC for over a hundred hours so listen to some of my advice. "

												Did not live up to its hype.Would be a fine and fun sandbox game, however, if EA's idea of ""game help"" wasn't ""sure, we know as a new Origin user you can't access online features. We know this is a major part of the game you just paid for. We have had an ""unresolved"" on this issue up on our ""help"" page since July. We're aware. We just don't care. In fact, we're shutting down the online servers next year anyhow, so why even bother?""If you did not have an Origin account before June 2013, be aware you will not be able to access patches or online features. Otherwise, it's not a bad game, if a little restrictive.https://help.ea.com/article/spore-login-issue-for-new-origin-customersPlease also see comments below.

												Even if it weren't a colossal disappointment ruined by publisher interferenceEven if you didn't run through all of the stages of the game in about an hour's worth of play to find there's nothing left for you to do but play as another goofy looking monstrosity.Even if the cutesy cartoonish theme didn't lull you into a diabetic coma of  enuuiEven if I didn't have to live with the minor shame of knowing I purchased and built my first computer specifically to play this.It'd still require you to install Origin and only give you 5 activations.I think I bought this for like 5 dollars on sale.

												Amazing.Pros- This is the true meaning of 'customizable'.- You can slowly but surely buy out cities through trading, use your powwer of pink straw hats to spread your religion across the globe, or just blow it all up.(Same goes for the other mode, you've got choices.)- Some of your creations show up on other save files. (E.G. a spaceship belonging to a save in Space Stage abducts one of your pets in Tribal stage)-Several 'stages'  = Cell stage (Ever heard of Agar.io? That's what this is, but cooler.) Eat anything smaller than you. Run away from anything bigger. Have kids. Grow an extra fin. Repeat.  = Creature stage: Grow legs and walk around. Hunt a few species to extinction. Make friends with (relative) giants. Get killed by (actual) giants.  = Tribal stage: Kill everything that moves to death and/or hug everything that moves. (The former is much more reliable, you know.) Also: Avoid the giants.  = Civilization Stage: A simplified version of Sid Meyer's Civilization for dummies that has been simplified, with more customizability. Watch as your trade routes get torn apart by afforementioned giants.  = Space Stage: Make your spaceship and conquer/hug the galaxy. Destroy giants with your kickass lasers and nukes.Cons:- Creature stage can take FOREVER. (Due to giants.)- One or two glitches. (Not many)- A certain cool DLC isn't available anymore.- The Bor- (What? Did I say Borg? I meant Grox) are overpowered, and you can't get the Genesis Dev- (*Cough cough* The staff of life *Cough cough*) because of them.			"

												Summary: 4 Mini-games plus one giant bore.Multiplayer: NoCompletion: Never ends, but I stopped at 20 hrs.Cards: NoCloud: NoSpore is one of those rare games that within 5 minutes of playing it, I felt like I had to complete it. I genuinely enjoyed the beginning stages of the game, but that rush progressively became less and less enchanting with each progressing age.The game is essentially 4 mini-games strung together with 1 giant never-ending game at the end. You start out as a single-cell organism struggling for survival in a world of eat-or-be-eaten. It's a nice, relaxing evolution game, and to be honest, I would have been perfectly fine if the majority of the game was like this. But this age is over all too soon and you'll find yourself on taking your first steps on land.As a terrestrial creature, new challenges arise. It's time to make friends, kill enemies, fight for survival, and forage for food. It's a good progression from the cell stage an it's kind of fun, but not as much as the previous age. Soon, your species will propogate to the point of having their own town. Around this point the game feels like a stripped-down RTS game. You gather resources, forge alliances, crush clans, and expand. It's a rather awkward stage and the gameplay itself is also so radically different that it almost feels out of place.The civlization stage is similar to the tribal stage, but you have entire cities and vehicles to do your bidding. Rather than playing like an RTS game, now it feels like a stripped-down Civlization game. You get to do some major customization now, but it's all cosmetic. As you near the end of the stage, the time comes to launch your first rocket.The Space Age makes up the bulk of the game. Now a space-faring race, you do pretty much what you were doing before but on a much grander scale. Hundreds of planets to explore, most of them look the same-ish, and to be honest, this is easily the most boring part of the game. Play as a Fedex service, do some feng shui on planets, become a trader, there's so much to do in this stage... and yet there's no real goal, other than than reaching a certain part of the galaxy, but the game will still go on regardless.Overall, Spore is... difficult for me to rate. The parts I liked, I liked a lot. The parts I disliked, I got bored to tears. What began as a fun evolution game ultimately ends up as a chore. The amount of micromanagement magnifies tenfold with each passing stage, and since the game changes radically with each stage, it's constantly throwing new stuff at you, while simultaneously rendering old knowledge irrelevant. I'm sure many people enjoy the endgame, but definitely not me. I give this a 7/10. "

												It was a great game in its prime, but since EA stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ about the entire project, Maxis died, and no one actually patches the game anymore - many game-breaking glitches will erase all of your progress in a snap (as Autosaves simply don't exist in game.)I don't reccomend the game whatsoever in its current state, but I certainly would have 3 years ago. Get it while on sale for when it's less than 10 dollars, but otherwise - stay far away. $20 is a lot to pay for something that barely runs on any Modern PC.It's a huge shame, too. Back when it was still being updated and cared about by the developers, Spore was possibly one of the best creature-based games you could get.			"

												There is so much to love about this game. Even in its simplicity it just sucks you in and keeps you playing for hours. You really get invested in the creatures you create and early decisions have long lasting effects with such a wide variety that replayablity is endless. I have one major gripe with this game. There is no option for autosave. Now because of the size of the save files, it takes a few seconds to save, so I get why it was designed without autosave in mind but for the amount of complaining players have done since its release, this game should've been updated with an autosave feature as an option. The reason this bothers me so much, is because the game will occasionally crash. The way the game plays tends to make you forget to frequently save. Between designing your cells, later your creatures, tribes and buildings and playing with them in between, you click on a ""Save and Exit"" button when you finish your design but this saves your creature, not your game. And you are not able to load that creature again when you go back to an old save. I originally had this review as a do not recommend, but with some tweaking the crashes have been brought to a minimum and the amount of fun this game has to offer is just out of this world. Some players may be put off by the early stages and just want to put their creatures into the Space Stage of the game, but I feel that misses the point of Spore. While Spore offers you a ""Creature Creator"" that lets you design your creatures before you play with them, I prefer to create my creatures in the game using their history and experience to unlock DNA parts and giving them long lasting traits which result from your earliest decisions. You also get to share your creations and if logged on to the game, you will see the creatures of other players in your game as well. Overall I have to recommend this game.			"

												This was one of my first games on steam, and I still play it. I have loved everything about this, from the cell stage to the space age, and any other gamer will say the same. I highly recommend it. The graphics aren't great, but somehow that just adds to the feel of evolving your creature, giving it everything it needs to survive and become sentient. Whether you like shooters, RPGs, MMOs, Sandboxes, Indies or just a casual gamer, YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME. so stop reading this reveiw, thinking about whether to spend 20.00 USD on something you won't play, AND BUY IT.

												I shall talk about each stage then my toughts overall, and it will be a big waste of time for no one will read.Stage 1: The first stage is simple, you are a cell, eat other cells, avoid other cells, cell cells with your cell phone, very basic but pretty fun, you can buy upgrades to eat cells better, also you can eat other stuff i geuss, but nobody does that (exept PETA but I doubt they played this game, plus ♥♥♥♥ PETA) Its very simple to that fish game but with cells.Rating: 6.5/10, Its kinda funStage 2: You have evolved and moved on to the genocide creature stage, here you are a land creature and must kill (Or befriend but nobody does that(once again exept for PETA)) other creatures, steal body parts from them, equip the body parts, become stronger, kill more creatures, I think you get it. However it gets much more complicated from there, those were just basic basics, the creator system is very in depth and people create some damn awsome stuff with it, or you know, you could just place OP ♥♥♥♥ all over your creature, that works too. You can also mate, migrate, gr8 b8 and other stuff, this is proably the most famous and praised stage of the game, its a symbol of spore, and its l o a d s a f u n whats that spell? LOADSAFUN.Rating:8/10 great lots of fun too be hadStage 3: The stupid tedious boring annyoing garbage tribal stage, in this stage ♥♥♥♥ starts to get real, you get armor, fight with weapons, and do other ♥♥♥♥ in a RTS style, does that sound fun? WELL ITS NOT.This is easily the worst stage in the game, its slow, monotonous, and annoying, the gameplay is shallow as ♥♥♥♥, the thing feels so much longer than it really is and it just sucks, you can kill other tribes (Once again, ♥♥♥♥ about PETA), and creatures, (PETA)advance as a soicitey, claim some tiki things, make babies, but all of it is executed poorly, its not unplayable, but its not fun either.Rating:5/10  below average Stage 4: OH GOD ITS A RTS AGAIN WH- oh nevermind this is done well.Yep, I LIKE the civilization stage even tough most hate it and even tough i hated the tribal stage, you are probably very confused right now but allow me to explain. You see it may be a RTS again but this time its a GOOD RTS, the gameplay is intresting and deep, the...... um.... well there isnt much to say, I geuss im bad at this ♥♥♥♥. The civilization stage takes place during your species era of civilization holy ♥♥♥♥ mind blown more specificly around the time of it where we live in, you start with a rover thingamajiger and make it get spice, then ♥♥♥♥ gets intresting now in this stage, this might shock you but........... its worth not just killing everything  YOU TRATIOR YOU WORK WITH PETA DONT YOU?! ok the PETA  thing dosent make much sense here, we would proably not consider these animals now that they are as far as humans, now you can do THREE things with other members of your own species, including kill (holy ♥♥♥♥ they really are becoming like humans), join up with, and buy out others (Facebook would be proud), you see, buying out is pretty much the best thing to do, how I do it is, make money, buy or join others, use their ♥♥♥♥ to add to mine and ♥♥♥♥ up a weaker group, buy and join some others to get even stronger, rince and repeat till total domination. You can build ground attacker aswell as ones that sail the seas, and ones that fly (Best ones, ovbs), Its a very fun stage infact..... I prefer it to the creaure stage (Gets stabbed)Rating:8/10 very funStage 5: The final frontier SPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE, Your species enters the Omnicide space age and goes into space to do space things, you start off getting into your ship and riding around for a little while, upducting some hazardous ♥♥♥♥, disposing of it, saving your city, then you go into SPACE! Its time, this is easily the most in depth stage, and im too lazy too go too in-depth, What? Didnt you see the length for the 4th stage reveiw thing? this one in-depth would be MULTIPLE times longer, ♥♥♥♥ that. So heres the shorter version, you encounter many other species and using your ship and its ♥♥♥♥ton of gadgets you kill, team up with, steal from, do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with them (Unless you get rekt). Now in this stage there is some STORY, Holy ♥♥♥♥ right? There are creatures called the Grox who are, well... evil, and they kill ♥♥♥♥ and are all big bad yadda yadda, so you become stronger, go to barren planets, harvest spice, spread your people, join other species, killt them, and its all on a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE map, Near the center of the galaxy is where the grox reside and MAN they dont ♥♥♥♥ around, finding routes to the center while being attacked by legions of ships kicking thy ♥♥♥♥ is VERY tough, you must be very srategic, powerful, and get lucky with where routes lead, or ya know you could just join em, in the end you can reach the center and theres some ♥♥♥♥ about humans IDK.Rating:9/10 Super amazing and easily the highlight of the entire gameOverall rating: 7.5/10The game has its moments, and those moments are great, and it has some okay moments, it also has the tribal stage......................... as a whole the game is good and worth your time, I reccomendAlso holy ♥♥♥♥, i stopped playing at exactly 42 hours, talk about a coincedence.

												It might only say I have 0.2 hours on record, but I played this game before I even knew Steam was a thing.Reviled at the time by many for its ""Always-Online"" gimmick that EA would still use for another decade afterward, Spore was a game that promised the literal ""world"" at its first preview showings, but did it deliver?Honestly? No, but that's old history to most people, the game we got was, and still is, in my humble opinion however, a truly unique and creative experience that is paralleled by very few games.The thing that makes Spore stand out, as with most Maxis games like The Sims, is its creativity. The Spore creature creator to this day is still one of the most interesting and in depth character customization mechanics in the gaming world.Whether you want to go with some creepy, or somewhat realistic, or heck even phallic, your imagination is the limit.Each stage of the game is based on a different stage of an organism, Single Celled, Primal, Tribal, ""Civilization"" (Quite literally), and Galactic.You are going to spend the majority of your time in the Galactic phase as it is the proverbial ""End-Game"" to your adventure.If I had to name any cons for the game, I'd say that each stage up to Galactic is fairly shallow, but in all honesty, this is a rather small complaint because although the game boasts having mutliple stages, it's not a ""Civilazation"" game, the stages are a ""means to an end"" so to speak.My favorite stage is the Galactic stage, simply because once you've gotten to this point, you've kind of ""grown"" with your Creature race and Galactic boasts the most features of any of the stages.The Galactic Adventures DLC essentially adds MMO-esque elements to the Galactic Stage, adding in Fetch-Quests, Escort Quests and the ability to get off on alien planets. While this is cool to break up the monotany of space trading and travel every once in awhile, even with community made quests, you are probably going to play the same 3 or 4 over, and over again.Overall, Spore is a game that is very much remembered but often overlooked for how good it really was. 8/10.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY, THE SERVERS ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN.Now that I've said that, I can explain how fun HALF of this game is.Cell stage is a sort of fun indtroductory mini-game more than a full stage. Just imagine alll those games where you eat stuff to get bigger, then eat creatures smaller than you. That's cell stage.The Creature stage is the best part, or maybe second best part, of the game for me. I loved murdering and consuming all of my neighbours and using their limbs to find new parts to evolve. One annoyance, sometimes I couldn't tell where my species had gone when they migrated.Tribal stage is meh. It's kinda fun at the start, until everyone else starts dominating you and you get your food stolen every ten seconds.City stage is boring. More of the same as tribal stage, but with tanks and boats. Get through this stage as fast as possible.Space stage is just as great as Creature stage, if not better. After being confined to one planet for so long, you finally get to build your spaceship and fly to distant star systems. Make friends with aliens, or hunt those in tribal stage for sport. It's great.In conclusion, the first two stages of the game and the last stage are great, but Tribal and City just seem shambled together. Oh, and there's NO ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY. Screw you EA. Pick this game up when it's on sale for a fiver or so.			"

												Now, I know this things says I have not played long. True. At least not on steam. I have played this game a TON with the CD version of the game. I love how much creativity you can apply to making your creature. I mean, if you want to give your either cute and lovable creature or your horrifying nightmare-inducing monstrosity a documetary-style description, you can do that! Depending on how you play during each stage of the game can decide what abilities you have to work with for the next, and you can even control this by looking at the evolution history to help you steer toward the path you want to take, whether you want to be a peacful dancing species or be that person who says ""I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL!"" and be completley evil (this is the route i like most). Or you could be both. Theres also that option. You can also throw things at other creatures which can surprise them as well as make them dizzy. Anyway, I highly recomend this game as you can choose how you want to play and know when youre going too far in the opposite direction as well as how fun the game is in general.			"

												Such a great game. It didn't age very well, but it's still fun. The Space Stage is so much fun as a huge conquest you can spend, like, a year working on, but the game lacks awesome content. If it had addons like GMod or varied combat like Warframe this would be great, but it's not amazing. Not for the hardcore gamer for sure. Casual gamers, come have fun! (And if you're a completionist... well, let's hope you don't have a job.)			"

												Spore may not be what I was expecting. It may not be as good as I thought it could be. But once I looked past the dissappointment, I realised that there is still a good game here.Let me get the things that upset me out of the way. The Creature stage seems to last too long with little variation. You either kill everyone around you, or charm them. And charming is a bit confusing, so it always boils down to me killing off races of animals and watching the progress bar rise ever so slightly each time.Space stage is practically pointless. I feel that there is no goal in it. Sometimes, there are parts of space you can't  get to because they are just a tiny bit too far away. Cell stage was funner than both of these, which is pretty sad. City Stage is too short. It only lasts an hour and a half, at the most. Which sucks, because it's my favorite stage. You get to command vehicles you created to destroy other cities and conquer them. But the biggest danger in City Stage is turrets, not enemy vehicles.That's about it for the things I dislike, so on the the praising for Spore's creativity.CREATING THINGS IS GREAT. They made spinoffs based only on the Spore Creators, and there is a reason for that. You can construct creatures ranging from spiders with dolphin heads to dragons with butterfly wings and a human nose. It's great. The Vehicle Creators are my absolute favorite part of the game. I have created Spaceships of every shape and size, and i am proud of them. You will never see the same ship twice, unless someone actually made a duplicate. I feel like the game would be cooler if more people played and interacted, creating new creatures, buildings (oh yeah, you can create buildings. not my favorite.), and vehicles. But that's just me. Maybe? People, join me, i'm lonely.Spore is not a bad game, as long as you are creative and can deal with a bit of boring gameplay early on. You can create endless creatures, vehicles, and building with endless variety. The Tribal and City stages are fun, but short. good thing you can repeat them any time. I give Spore a 6/10, and I do recommend this game.(this is my first long review) "

												I played this game about 30 hours (on the c&c dlc which is counted as stand-alone game on steam), and a bunch more a few years back, but I feel there could be much more to do: if you get deep into the game it will gift you with at least 40-50 hours of gameplay imho.Though the First stages might seem the most original and appealing, you may find out instead the space one isn't odd/dull at all. Once you get used to the sci-fi-like RTS aspects of the 2 last levels you'll realise how fun it is to expand your terrestrial empire first and your cosmic one later on.So to sum up I really loved manipulating the genes to form powerful cells or creatures, and I liked badly to customise my vehicles, citisens and structures (the game really lets you use your skills in architecture and design); but the space stage isn't to be understimated - I promise myself I'll get back to it sometimes as it's the one I played the least.

												This game is too quick in terms of progression from cellular organism to space-faring creature. Once you get to space, it's the same shake-and-bake colony making: find planet suitable for life, terraform, colonize, and... do it all over again!In other words, once you get to the ""end-game"" portions of the game, it ends up being very repetitive and boring. Given that EA's servers for the game are also apparently dead, and there being no Steam Workshop at the time of this writing, you don't get to share with others.Basically, the game's missing key features now, there's no support for it, and the DLC content where your space captain goes on adventures is so clunky and buggy, I can't recommend this game anymore.If the game is ever on sale, it might be worth picking up if you've never played it before. Don't get me wrong; the game is fun, it's just that the fun doesn't last after you've done 2 or 3 civilizations.The verdict: this game might be worth $5 if you find yourself playing with character creation screens way too long. Otherwise, spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere.			"

												The first thing everyone asks (or should ask) about a game is ""what kind of game is it?"".Spore((tm) is, well, Spore(tm).It doesn't fit into any one genre, apart from possibly sandbox.There's no other game like it.NOTE: Only mouse over spoilers if you feel you can handle mature content.Swear words can make your head explode if you're not careful.When starting my Spore(tm) game, I chose a planet and a difficulty.I chose ""easy"", because I'm a wimp and I'd never played the game before.Asteroids pelted the planet of my choice in a melodramatic armaggedon, making craters and levelling mountains, splashing into the oceans.The camera zoomed in...in...in...it was deep under the ocean...an asteroid cracked open...and a sperm fused with a corn dog (spermdog?) popped out of the asteroid.Oh wait.That's me.I swam around, chomping up algae and chunks of unnameable meat indiscriminately, until I came across a cell far too big to be legally called a cell (you imposter!).It attempted to swallow me in its ginormous mandibles (of which it had far too many), and I could only swim away, flagella wiggling at  top speed.Eventually I got away, and the game told me to ""call a mate"".I did, and my spermdog sent out a little screech, met another spermdog, and got ready for some lovin'.To all you perverts out there: don't get your hopes up, they just dance around and lay an egg.Sexy.I was allowed to make some tweaks to my cell's design.I gave it spikes, a third eye, and an electric butt.He then hatched from an egg cell thing.This went on for a few minutes, until suddenly my triklopticus (for that is what I named him) grew a brain and started wishing for legs.I then advanced to the Creature stage, which consisted of adding legs to an already absurd design, and watched a dozen little leggy spermdogs run up onto dry land.The Creature stage kept the ""mating"" mechanic, but I was now running around on dry land eating stuff and meeting other species.I had the option of making friends with them or eating them.After ten minutes the ground was littered with cute little cadavers.Eventually, the triklopticus developed into beaked scorpion-like creatures with two legs and arms I named the Ornitank.Then they became vaguely humanoid, and when my brain had sufficiently increased in size, I moved on to the Tribe stage and was treated to a cutscene of my Ornitanks discovering fire.I was allowed to give them clothes, because they'd just invented pants, too.This is where the game took on an Age of Empires twist.I had around six tribesmen, all living in a little hut.I could put stuff around the hut and demand that a baby be made (in which case hearts would appear around the hut, an egg would roll out the door, and hatch) and equip my tribesmen with weapons or instruments.I could put them to work hunting or gathering.I made friends with two neighbouring villages, using the power of music, and three attacked me.Three were burnt down.For ever village allied or destroyed, my totem pole got bigger.Before long, my tribesmen were discussing weapons of mass destruction and plotting to take over the world.They grow up so fast *sniff*.I designed buildings to place in my city in such a way as to increase my income and built an armada of tanks, planes, and ships (also custom designed) to conquer other cities.I gave my Ornitanks new clothes that were slightly more ""civilised"" (among the options I could have chosen was a large blonde moustache) and discovered that the Creature Creator had a ""create animated avatar"" option, so I turned my Ornitank citizen into an animated avatar.After conquering the world, the Ornitanks turned their attention to the stars and inexplicably invented a spaceship that could go between the stars and only take a few minutes doing so (the ship, by the way, is customisable, like creatures, vehicles, and buildings).I made first contact with an alien race that ignored my ship, because they were in the middle of some kind of world war.I sucked one of them up in my tractor beam and dropped him off on my homeworld, for in the Space stage, I am a  very responsible starship captain!I found a spacefaring race that was big and pink with one eye and a freaky mouth, who spoke to me in a high-pitched voice and asked me to eliminate the infect Doughball! to gain their allegiance (apparently Doughball! is misspelt without the exclamation mark) and so after missions from the aliens and my own race (one of which was terraforming a planet) I set up a trade route and an alliance.However, my only complaint about the space age is that after the game spends so long increasing the scale, you end up playing as a captain on a random ship.The best part is going down onto planets that aren't spacefaring and just straight-up abducting people.On top of that, you unlock crop circles and can just zap them onto planets.I kept going to Civilization Stage planets and using the crop circle tool to fuel any alien conspiracy theorists that may/may not exist.And that is how you go from spermdog to galactic god in less than three days.

												I dont know if anyone playtested this before release. I dont know if the game will get better if I persevere. I do know that the first two stages of the game are tedious, a boring chore of a game with a superficial cuteness and charm that wears off in minutes. ""I would really like to play a game as a paramecium"" said nobody, ever - except for the developers of Spore apparently.Edit, after playing for a further 6 hours I progressed a few levels. The game did not improve sufficiently to warrant putting up with the previous stages as an amoeba. I think If I kept playing I might develop some form of intellectual impairment. I doubt that this handicap would be severe enough for me to refer to myself using a term for a small group of soldiers.			"

												Let me get this straight, you want me to tell you a review about this game? Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.			"

												I like game, but beware EA didn't put a whole lot of effort into this game and it crashes rampantly. I highly suggest you save very often or else you'll end up like me and be into the tribal stage when your game crashes and whisks away all your progress down the drain. EA dropped the ball so much that apparently there isn't even an autosave function. This game crashes so much and personally i don't think I'll ever be playing it again. The game itself is very fun as you get to guide the evolution of your species from a single cellular organization all the way to space faring god. EA made a lot of promises about this game that they didn't deliver. So pretty much standard EA behavior.Pros:+ Engaging gameplay+ Enjoyable & somewhat diverse scenarios+ Diversity among creature creations+ Looks good for something made in 2008+ Lots of unique body parts to chose from+ Species specialization (e.g. carnivore, omnivore, herbivore)+ Different creatures/species have different ""voices"" (diversity of creature communications)+ Decent job explaining functions of everthing through all stagesCons:- Stages of evolution rather short- Space stage the longest stage (Dispropotionate compared to other stages)- Cannot continue to gain the evolution points to unlock body parts once you complete a stage- Only real option once completing a stage is advancing the evolution- Rather odd taking over planets in Space stage with your single ship- Actually rather odd doing everthing in the Space stage from your single ship- Rampant crashes- No autosave feature- Very few save slots for different worlds- Too few stages of evolution- Almost zero interaction available during Space stage with nonspace faring civilizations			"

												[Clocked in only 5 hours because I transferred to the galactic launcher but finished my first playthrough using only Spore features not galactic ones]It's a very enjoyable game especially if you love civilization games. Here you start as a freakin single celled organism.What I love with the early stages of the game is that your creature evolves from that single celled organism to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to go with until tribal age.I must say tribal stage up to space age the game changed for me, you stopped evolving and instead start using clothes.Spage Age I must say is pretty freakin huge!!! So huge I can't explore it all and that's just a single galaxy.As you go further in your own civilization you notice less and less species surround you (extiction is common even in outer space because of sentient beings being ♥♥♥♥♥)Recommendations:You should grab Galactic Adventures expansion as it becomes bland after exploring different sectors.If you want the online feature to work, put the game product code you have on steam (you can get it on the CD key of your game [library->games->spore->CD key]) and put it on origin (Origin->add game->put the product code). (there's not much with the online feature though)Regret:I didn't get to kill humans!			"

												This game is amazing. It sparked my creativity when I was young and still finds a way to inspire me today - this game is awesome.I have bought this game about 3 times.Once when the game came out, another after moving houses and losing the CD, and finally (the latest purchase) on Steam. I have countless hours on this game (I mostly play Creepy and Cute DLC; so it wont be showing many hours here).I would recommend to everyone. Especially any parents who want to kick-start their child's creativity.PROS:- Goofy, funny, and entertaining game.- Hours of gameplay and replayability.- Simple and easy to learn controls.- Teaches how civilizations begin and develop (in terms simple enough for youngsters to learn)- Teaches basic biology.- Allows anyone to develop and/or increase their creativity.- Many references to sci-fi movies.- Made by the legend himself: WILL WRIGHT. (Bless his soul)- $15CONS:- May turn your child into a creative freak. Just saying. - No longer supports online functions (from what I know)- The last stage of the game; Space Stage, can be a little overwhelming for youngsters.Bonus con:- No Spore 2 :(			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. It's like 5 game in one that are all interrelated. Extremely fresh and unique. Every stage feel massively different from another. Graphics are great. Sound and music is unique and catchy. Funny cut scenes added charm. Easily worth your time. Don't miss it.			"

												Spore is an interesting, different take on the classic god-type genre of games. You begin as a single cell organsim, happily eating (plants or other organisms, or both!) and eventaully running away or fighting other organisms. As you eat, you gain DNA, which is used to modify your creature, from eyes to appendages used to attack others or defend yourself, and other some modifications that do not require DNA, such as enlarging or reducing the size and shape of your creature, enlongating or shortening your spine, even individual segments of your spine! After you consume enough DNA, you will be able to ""find a mate"" and change anything you like about your creature, including color, color patterns and layers of color and patterns, and anything else you can imagine. Really, the whole point that Spore really drives home is that your creations are only limited by your imagination. Once enough DNA and parts are gathered you can ""evolve"" to the next stage of evolution, in this case, evolving legs. Once you crawl out of the primordial soup and make landfall, you will have a nest for your species to stay in, and the real adventure begins. You will meet other species and decide if you want to befriend them through either ""Impressing"" them through song and dance and whatnot, or kill them into extinction. In the next stage of evolution you have a third option to send them gifts, which they may or may not accept. Each decision you make affects the outcome of your creature. Befriending tribes gives you abilities to make it easier to befriend other species in the future, as does killing them, or gifting, the economic solution. Whenever you successfully befriend, or kill a species, you will be rewarded with new parts to help evolve your creature. Many of these at this stage have actual benefits, such as arms with hands that have sharp claws, which will aid you in taking down some of the tougher species, or other parts that boost your ability to sing, dance and otherwise impress other species. As with the previous stage, once you have collected enough DNA through befriending or conquering species, you will advance to the next stage of evolution, Tribal. (NOTE: When you finish creature stage, before you advance to tribal stage you will be given one last chance to change your creature in any way you see fit. Once you enter tribal stage, NO MORE CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO YOUR CREATURE.)The tribal stage is arguably the most difficult stage because you really have to begin managing your resources. You have to gather food to feed your tribe, and plenty extra if you plan on gifting to other tribes. You have a village and as with the previous stage, instead of parts, you have buildings in your village that will assist your tribe in your goal. At this point it is a good idea to settle on whether you plan on being a war-mongering military society, a happy-go-lucky religious society (you still sing and dance to befriend other tribes, but in the next stage you basically convert new species to your religion in order to become allies) or an economic powerhouse (in the near future, capable of purchasing entire star systems). Once you have  enough allies or conquor enough tribes, you advance to the next stage, Civilization.Civilization stage is much like the creature stage, in that it opens up the game into a new level of depth and this time, micro-management. You will discover Spice, the source of all income, and mine the various spice gysers near and far to increase your income (which replaces DNA) and go crazy with creation. Much like your original creature, you can choose from a preset list from Maxis, or if you signed in at the beginning of the game (or at any time for that matter) you can use or modify any creation by any person who has played Spore. Of course, you can also create your own from the ground up, including a Town  Hall, a Factory, Houses, and Entertainment buildings. You can use these in city planning to create a well-balanced city. Too many factories will boost spice processing, but make your city unhappy and easily susceptible to religious attacks, which are much more effective against unhappy cities. Too many entertainment buildings will make your city happy, but your spice production will suffer. You will learn the proper balance with time, experiment and try different things, which is what Spore is all about! Anyway the objective of this stage is to destroy or ally yourself with other rival factions of your species, which has become the single most dominant sentient creature on your planet. Of course you can also establish trade routes with rival cities and eventually be given the option to purchase them, making them as much yours as a city you started with. Again, eventually you will destroy or ally yourself with all the rival factions on your planet, and advance to the final stage, Space.This is by far and away the most fun stage in the game, and once you reach space stage with one species, you can start a new species at any stage (Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization, or Space) any time you wish. Your species has advanced enough to begin space flight! From this point, the universe is your oyster! The same ways you haved allied yourself, purchased, or conquered others until now remain the same, although, remember that at least in the beginning of space stage, your species exists on but one planet, whereas other species you meet will be spread across several planets and even start systems! If you want an accurate scope of just how huge this game is, zoom out from your planet, to your start system, complete with other planets, to your local star system cluster to eventually the entire galaxy. Every start system, every planet you see you can visit! You can establish colonies on new worlds to expand your empire, meet new species and decide how to deal with them, do missions for them, hunt for valuable artifacts, and even terraform planets from T0 (No atmosphere, very difficult to sustain a profitable colony) to a T3 oasis, with several booming colonies, ripe for the picking with all different kinds of Spice! From this point you can do whatever, go wherever, whenever you want!All in all, if you like creative freedom, an explorative nature, and want to build your own galaxy spanning empire from a single celled organism to the most powerful species in the galaxy, this game is for you! (On a side note, Spore and Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack are completely compatible with Windows 8.1)			"

												EA and Origin accounts made since 2013 DO NOT connect to spore. User created content is unviewable. EA knows about this and has been sitting on this since July of this year. You also cannot create a new account.Of course I didn't know about that til after the fact, at least you can be an informed consumer.EDIT:Was directed to a forum post to fix the issues I was having. It worked! http://steamcommunity.com/app/17390/discussions/0/490123938445529635/#p2Kudos to KoolAidtheRedDespite that, it doesn't excuse EA making things extremely difficult not only to find out what is wrong, but getting around to fixing it.

												All i have to say is this game is more for creative people/ If you want a lot of progression or some kind of rpg type of game this isn't for you (only the creature stage is like that). This game is for people who want to keep coming up with creative creatures and people who like to play things in different ways (evolution paths).This is not supposed to be a professional review but this is just to warn people who aren't very creative or have a hard time playing things more than once to try new ways to play. One thing i will admit though is this game is hard to play just for fun or having a variety of things to do and can get pretty boring.			"

												In the pitiful technical state this game is in, I can not recommend it. The early game phases and the creature creator might be nice and all, but it doesn't help that the game has a tendence of crashing whenever a cutscene plays. Of course, one could regularily save the game, but at least in my case, the game doesn't actually save my progress and always resets to the same point. Add to that EAs more than doubtful business practices (the bundle costing more than the combined cost of it's contents), and you got a mess if there ever was one.			"

												I bought the Spore Complete Pack on sale for 12.47, and I still wish I hadn't wasted the money.  I remember playing the game way back when and it was quite fun, a decent game overall.  But.... it's EA.. I should've known better to think it was really given any REAL effort.One mistake, I'll admit, was my own.  I didn't realize that the game didn't have any autosaving, and you had to save manually.  So when the game crashed, I lost every bit of the game that I'd been playing.Of course, the fact that having my internet go out for a few seconds caused the game to crash... I hadn't expected that to happen.   Nor did I expect to have to create an origin account for the game.   Nor did I expect to have to spend a half an hour getting it to reset my password because every time it accepted a password when I tried to login it said invalid password. ((luckily I was finally able to get a password that worked by saying something derogatory to the company in it.. they had no problem letting that go through it seems, just not a NORMAL password)).  Nor did I expect to have to reboot my entire computer just to be able to log into their servers.   The issues are plenty, and now that I've already spent money on it, I've seen quite a few other people on the net that have had problems with it crashing.   Is the game good?   Sure, it can be fun.   But seeing as how EA infrastructure and coding can destroy just about anything.. well.. good luck if you decide to try it.   I hope you have better luck than I.			"

												I've played the game for, I think, 1000 hours when I was younger, but on a non-Steam-version. I've never had the DLCs.Now I bought Spore and all it's DLCs on Steam-Sale and started to play again. It's such a great game, but also has some flaws. The idea of Spore is AMAZING!But sadly in some stages, the developers didn't put enough effort in it. I think the most developed stage is the last one, where you can travel the whole galaxy. It's amazing how big the galaxy is and I loved terraforming planets to make them able to be inhabited by creatures or to enlarge my empire. I've also always tried to get friends of the Grox (biggest empire in the Space-stage), or even trying to beat them (I've never beaten them, it's too difficult...)The second most developed stage is the second one, where you can develop you own creature, communicate with other ones and explore the planet. The other stages, I have to admit, are a little short, especially the first one, where you are only a cell. It's so much fun to create species, there are many body-parts and many possibilities to combine and even more with the DLC ""Creepy and Cute"". But Sometimes you wish for even more body-parts, maybe some more exciting, or that there are other possibilities for putting them on you species. For example, making things bigger, having scarier mouths, and beeing able to put more parts on your species body than you are allowed now. That's why there are many mods, that make the creating of species much more interesting and sooo great. Go to Youtube and serach for ""Spore creations"" and you'll know what I mean. I'd love to see a Spore 2 where all those flaws are fixed and the developers really put effort in. Many people would probably buy this because they had so much fun with the first one. But sadly after, I think, 9 years, they probably won't develop a Spore 2 and we have to keep playing the fist game. Even though Spore is not the newest game anymore, you should give it a try, because it really can be fun.			"

												Didn't really bother with the online stuff since it's an old game and the servers are probably down.  Having said that loaded up the game started from the begining and was actually impressed I've seen the gameplay for spore a few times never played it myself until now.  Only encountered a small bug where my campsite vanished had to walk out of the area and then back in to fix it.  I say wait for this to be on sale like I did unless you know you want to play spore from 8 pm til 2 am.			"

												Great game! Got it on sale, totally recommend it. One of the best games. Large variety of things to do! I'd give it a 9/10. Stupid EA abandoned this game which should've been really sucessful. Pros/Cons list:Cons:- Stages are short- No HD graphics- EA killed mutiplayerPros: + Maxis created over 1000 creature for you to mess around with+ Creative game+ Fast gameplay+ You can do what you wanna do+ EntertainingOverall I would recommend this game			"

												I've played the game for, I think, 1000 hours when I was younger, but on a non-Steam-version. I've never had the DLCs.Now I bought Spore and all it's DLCs on Steam-Sale and started to play again. It's such a great game, but also has some flaws. The idea of Spore is AMAZING!But sadly in some stages, the developers didn't put enough effort in it. I think the most developed stage is the last one, where you can travel the whole galaxy. It's amazing how big the galaxy is and I loved terraforming planets to make them able to be inhabited by creatures or to enlarge my empire. I've also always tried to get friends of the Grox (biggest empire in the Space-stage), or even trying to beat them (I've never beaten them, it's too difficult...)The second most developed stage is the second one, where you can develop you own creature, communicate with other ones and explore the planet. The other stages, I have to admit, are a little short, especially the first one, where you are only a cell. It's so much fun to create species, there are many body-parts and many possibilities to combine and even more with the DLC ""Creepy and Cute"". But Sometimes you wish for even more body-parts, maybe some more exciting, or that there are other possibilities for putting them on you species.

												Create the universe. Expand existence on planets. Conquer galaxies beyond sight, And choose the future in this wonderful creative game of Spore. Watch the trailer, And you will want to buy this game.Spore is the best I have ever played. The first game I have ever played on steam and it is a WINNER. The trailer is interestingly funny and awesome. Create the future of your single species (No pun intended), And simulate the creator of all things in a universe, Be their ""god"" that guides the existence on a planet. Become the pillars of creation that created the universe. I reccomend you buy this game for it is WORTH BUYING.Enjoy observing life on a planet that goes through the many intense and epic discoveries and troubles and challenges of a normal human life.			"

												REVISED 4/13/14: Spore does have a few hinderances. One great example would be the massive amount of bugs in the game, whether they be subtle or game-breaking. But let's try to ignore those. Spore is a brilliant game, in fact, I love Spore. It has a great cult following communtiy, too. In my opinion, the best stage is the space stage. Really, I like all the stages (except tribal because you can't use cheats :P). I would reccomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers, as it amounts to so much fun.			"

												Spore is one of the best God Simulators out there. It gives you full control over your creature. Over the very skeleton and skin cells of it. If there were 1000 people playing the game at the same time, you can be sure their creatures will be totally unique. You start as a simple cell. Whether carnivore or herbivore (or omnivore). A few million years later you develop legs and hands. You get a better mouth and eyes, and nose. You become who you want to become. You can have 10 eyes and 4 noses, 6 hands and 1 leg, while your mouth is positioned on your knee. You can do literally anything. There are lots of stages in your creature's life. You become the leader of a tribe. And then you lead a whole civilization. Later you go on the adventure on conquering the endless space with it's magnificent sights. Creative people must play this. It's amazing how complex and beautiful a creature can get. Especially when you remember that you started from a simple cell.10/10 "

												I DO recommend this game BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW that I had a issue about corrupted saves and after 3 days of research (one days of cummunicating with EA) I can finnaly run the game proprely BUT only because I reinstalled it on Origin (you know Ea... ). You can buy it on steam and install on Origin and probably save you 3 days... I bought it to my girlfreind at the same time on steam and her game have no issue at all on steam ( but she have an OLD Pc )You have a good PC ? install it on Origin.*******************************************************EDIT********************************************************These are the good points of buying it on steam ( actually 12 $ for the game and the two expensions ) and INTALLING IT on Origin ( use the cd key given by steam via : Right clic on the game/ View CD Key) and add it to your Origin Library.- Do not bug whit ''good'' Pc ( better than a 2008 one)- You can acces the online data ( creatures from other players in your world and more )- You can acces the patch and news- You can have a very good support from the EA team ( if you want to chat online you have to select United-states in the web site )			"

												6/10 - ""Evolution"" of Gaming. =)This concept is really cool. Start as a single cell organism and combine or irradicate others to evolve. This is an open world. Once you develope your creatures build and attributes then the game becomes a strategy based game. Worth $5! Wish it continued with the open world sandbox and didn't convert to strategy.

												Um dos melhores jogos de simulação que já joguei. Joguei muito mesmo quando criança (ele é um pouquinho ""old"" , mas é gold, certeza). Em comparação a outros jogos, ele tem uma temática diferente. Segue a teoria da Evolução, em que você cria um ser vivo e de tempos em tempos ele desenvolve habilidades e suas proles nascem mais inteligentes. Porém Spore é divido em uma espécie de estágios, em que você simula coisas diferentes daquela espécie que você criou (estágios em que você é só uma pobre célula dependente e vivente na água, depois você já se adapta à terra, depois tem uma família, uma população toda  e por fim um planeta - sim você brinca com a galáxia- ). Com Spore você não fica naquela ""mesmisse"" o tempo todo como The Sims ( e sim, é da mesma empresa desenvolvedora Maxis). Bom, para não ficar com uma descrição muito subjetiva, segue abaixo um vídeo perfeitamente explicativo. Ele te toma meia horinha mas tenha paciência, porque vale a pena (a não ser que você realmente não goste do gênero). Por fim, é um jogo divertidíssimo, fácil de mexer e gostoso de jogar (com deliciosos efeitos sonoros e uma rotação de câmera divina -não que isso seja muita coisa).Divirta-se e brinque com a Genética do Darwin  :3

After that you'll meet the tribe stage and next the civilization where things like war,economy or religion comes in.

												A long time ago I dreamt of getting this game as a kid, so many years later I finally got my hands on it and it's even more fun than I expected.  Getting to see your creation evolve from a single cell all the way to a galactic ruler is truly a special experience.  I also find that there is a lot of replay value in this game, I always come back to see what kind or route or creature I can make this time.  If you have an active imagination begging to be let loose on a sandbox world and are willing to challenge yourself to work around the constraints nature has placed on you, then this is the game for you.  Even if you're looking for a more relaxing time, there's an evolutionary stage for everyone.  Keep in mind I have no idea what this game was supposed to be and am only judging it from what I got.  Could this game have turned out better?  Yes.  Is it still fun? Yes. Is it worth the price?  Yes.			"

												This game was awesome right when I started playing it. You start out as a little cell and the gameplay it much like agario in this stage.Then you evolve and grow legs so you can walk the earth in this stage you can either find Parts by roaming the world of extincting a species or allying with them.There is three different ways you can go.You can either be a Herbivore,Omnivore,or a carnivore.The way you pick will effect you for the rest of the game because it gives you special abilitias depending on what you are.Then there is the tribal stage, The tribal stage is where you command you tribe to go and destroy or ally with another village, Either way you pick it will give you either new tools,weapons,or instruments.Then there is the civilization stage where you get to make tanks,ships,and airships. Then either capture,destroy,or ally with all the other cities, you can also send tanks and ships to collect spice. Then there is my personal favorite stage the space stage.In the space stage you upgrade you ship,go through the galaxy allying,fighting, or capturing entire colonies and planets.There is also a species called the Grog that do not trust people.You can also have more than one world.

												when my little borther asked for this game, i am not sure wether this game is good at all. then i tried it, and it kinds of addictive. this game are making you feel like a God, but lesser. with many ways of playing, even tought its need much much of your time when you played it seriously, this game actually good, best for children actually. but maybe some bug improvement might be good.

												I recommend this game highly. I have a few Pros and Cons thoughPros: Lots of freedom with creating your own things, easy to understand, controls are simple and it is not super hard.Cons: Quite a bit buggy, sometimes the saving doesn't work, gets boring once you've beaten the game.That's a list of a few of the things that I dislike and enjoy about the game. Anyways I think it's worth getting.			"

												The game in itself is really quite an interesting concept. However the late game is really quite a drag and for the most part, you will just want it for the monster making aspect. IF however you wish like any person, which to create a galactic empire and control all the planets its impossible. The only problem is a limited amount of bodyparts, colors and parts that can be used and there is no way to allow for more to be added like on steam workshop.Its worth a buy if its on sale.			"

												Update! Got Spore to work with Steam now. So ignore hours played here. I've well over 600+ hours with this game since it's release quite some time ago.So Spore is a God game of sorts, which would be ironic considering it focuses mostly on evolution for what should be the meat of the game. Depending on how you play however, it can still be a good chunk. Starting off from a tiny organism in the primordial soup, you work your way up through the food chain by consuming matter and gaining points to evolve new parts to make you more dangerous, defensive or the alpha being in the micro world. Eventually you gain the ability to have the very basic instincts of a sentient creature, growing legs and walking onto land where you proceed to evolve as before in a much larger world. From there you eventually gain a higher thought process and begin displaying the ability to form a cohesive society capable of thinking. From there you move through what's something of a crude cross between an RTS and several janky game mechanics to befriend or defeat other tribes which appear in the world. Eventually moving on to be the dominant species and begin warring with other nations which spring up. You've several ways to dominate the planet, truth be told, the mechanics behind conquering the world are the same for any path really.And then onto the true meat of the game. Space exploration, terraforming new worlds, meeting new space empires and either kill, conquer or buy worlds from them. And then, the steam for this game begins to die down and the fun train slows substantially. Sure, at first exploring the stars is fun, but after awhile it can begin to become more of a chore to hop around space, meeting certain goals and milestones to improve your ship and empire and defending against aggressive or downright hostile space beings. I will say though, it took a long time, but your ultimate goal is to reach the center of the galaxy. I won't say what you find of course, so the truly curious will have to find their way there or just look it up online like a panzy.Now as for the different stages of evolving a creature, a bit more in depth.Just to note, as you progress through the stages you can choose different paths such as herbivore and carnivore which then translate into other catagories later in the game such as industrious, warlord or peaceful. All of which give some special abilities in the tribal, civilization and space stages and also effect how your creatures evolve in what parts are available in evolution.The first two stages, cell and creature, are fairly similar in mechanics in terms of gaining DNA to evolve. The cell stage is very simple, depending on your difficulty, but typically isn't hard to get through at all. Then the creature stage which uses the same mechanics of the cell stage, but on land and much more three dimensional. The game is a bit silly in how to befriend other creatures, using silly but amusing mechanics. Combat is essentially two animals clawing at each other until one or the other is dead. This is where you begin really planning your creatures evolution a bit more. You can shape it's torso, head and any other appendage to your liking, making everything from humanoid bipedal creatures or a giant ♥♥♥♥♥ hopping around. Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote, weirdo.When it comes to interacting with the world, whether it's combat or communication, it functions quite a bit like an MMO actually. You click where you want to go or use the typical WSAD keys to move around. Hotkeys, 1234 and such will perform actions depending on what you're doing with small cooldown timers. When moving on after you've gotten enough DNA, the camera mechanics and interactions perform roughly the same for the Tribal stage. This is probably the shortest stage there is. You can easily and quickly defeat or befriend other tribes and chances are it'll take about thirty or forty minutes. Operates the same with hotkeys and movement, but more like a badly formed RTS where you can move units around to collect resources and the such.Next is the Civilization stage which is pretty bland to tell the truth. You can design your own land, water and air vehicles in just about whatever fashion you see fit. In terms of conquering, they're all pretty much the same except for trade which allows you to peacefully buy other civilizations land, but to some extent works on the same mechanics. Then you get to the true meat of the game. SPACE. And at first it's pretty amazing with how massive of a galaxy you have to explore. You'll meet a handful of different species near you, explore different planets and stars that you've seen in the sky since you first crawled onto land.Terraforming, now there's a thing. At first it's pretty neat, slowly shaping a world to sustain life, plopping plants and animals to create a stable ecosystem so you can build colonies to populate new worlds. Along with colonizing you can collect a substance found on many planets called Spice. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice. The spice extends life. The spice expands conciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. Actually, no it's just a valuable trading commodity of different colors and rarity. You can trade spices between different systems and eventually, in most cases, be able to buy the system and aquire new planets to claim as your own.Now things start to sort of fall apart when it comes to advancing. For a bit all these things are a bit of fun and in short bursts, it can be. However after awhile the game becomes tedious and more of a task. The expansion for the game, Galactic Adventures, does add a fairly decent amount to do, but comes across as excessively cheesy and hokey, though I imagine the target audience was a bit younger than most of the people actually playing the game or somebody at Maxis and/or EA was smoking the dank and watching far to many kids shows on Saturday morning. But a fair amount, if not almost half of other missions aren't so bad and involve a combat system which reflects what you would have experience back in the creature stage. Just with lasers and such. It does make for a less tedious but slower method to obtain Sporebucks, though you eventually reach the point where expanding your civilization, which requires massive amounts of Sporebucks to upgrade your ship. Keep it up though and this grind isn't to bad, but then you're left with even less goals to pursue as you look forward to the tedious journey to the center of the galaxy.Oh right, your ship. Almost forgot. So you get to design a space ship of any design at the beginning of the Space stage. It doesn't matter what parts you put on it, as your ships abilities, defences and other functions are unlocked in other ways. So the design is purely aesthetic. Controls are the WSAD setup with your cursor acting as a point of aiming. Combat is usually fairly simple and becomes somewhat routine after awhile. Once you upgrade your ship enough though, combat becomes hardly a challenge and becomes more of a management thing in simply making sure your ship stays fueled and powered up.There's not much else to say here. I will note, I remember this game being hyped up beyond belief and being a great letdown to a lot of people. I didn't feel all that disapointed, but felt there was a much greater goal this game could have accomplished rather than slowly fizzling out in its gameplay late game. I'm sure some people find the tasks entertaining for a long time, but I've found it's better in short bursts in the late game, as just about everything else can be done in a matter of six to ten hours.So is this game with the expansions worth $40(USD)? That's a shaky yes. But if you're not willing, wait for a sale. With that, I am about to hit the maximum amount of characters available to write a rev--			"

												This game is one of the best I have ever played, not only is there infinite customization, each stage is a different type of gameplay, first level (cell) is somewhat like feeding frenzy or agar.io, the land creature stage is a third person adventure gameplay, tribal stage is a strategy game such as age of empires, national stage is like Civ V or most other strategy games, and the final stage (space) is more of an open world, infinite exploration, conquer the galaxy kind of game. Overall, no matter what kind of game you like, you will most likely enjoy Spore.10/10 would conquer universe again			"

												I play this game all the time and it never ever gets boring.My friends and I enjoy competeing to see who can make the most creepiest or cutest creature. Anyways about the game,Spore is a very fun and creative game to play.Many achevments can be unlocked and you can even set you own goals.The game is more on the lines of solo than multiplayer,but it would be cool if you could visit other people's planets and creatures.The game is basically a great game where you can create you own creatures and make them go through evolotion.Their are alot of pros I can think of but thankfully not many cons.Here are some:Pros:1. Very positive2. Entertaining3. Creative4. Never ends (As in their are no limits to how many creatures,planet,or games you can make.)Cons:1. Addicting2. Not multiplayer (Although I'm hoping it will be in the future.) Well there are the pros and cons of the game Spore! I hop you found this review useful if you are interested in the game.And if you do buy it and try it,I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do!			"

												I actually like this game quite a bit, honestly, though mostly for Nostalgia reasons and the Creature Builder specificallyGood Parts- you can make aliens of your own design and casually Play God- It's pretty cute - the graphics aren't super realistic and thus haven't suffered too bad with aging, at least aesthetically- This might just be a personal thing bcs I'm a sucker for worldbuilding/storywriting but it's fun to sort of evolve your little alien dude(s) into an empire and like,,, make up their history based on what happens- This game is actually moddable, though be warned bcs it involves dropping files Directly into the game's data folder and you can't share creations made with modded parts- It's also kinda fun to just poke around w/ the data sometimes and mess around w/ the Startup Conditions to unlock Hidden Developer Creators (the Flora and Cell Editors, for example)Bad Parts- It gets really, really repetitive after a while- A lot of people (myself included) have a hard time getting the graphics to actually 'function' and register that you've set them on 'High' - I suspect this is because this game is from like just before the 2010's so it might not know how to run on modern hardware. There's a mod/fix for this somwhere if you go googling but i haven't gotten it to work- There's quite a few bugs but *most* of the major game breaking ones have been fixed for ages.- I have no idea if the Steam version of this has the DRM that it started with - if it does this is a Very Bad Part- The online function is ♥♥♥♥ed on the Steam version - you have to register the game with Origin to get it to go online (though fortunately you do NOT have to buy it again - just register the CD key into it and you're good. You also don't have to bother w/ Origin after this and can never touch it again)Despite the negatives outweighing the positives, I'm still gonna mark this as Recommended as it's a pretty fun game I feel.EDIT TO ADD I'd still wait for it to be on sale to buy it - it's an Alright game but $20 USD for the base game + the DLC is quite a lot and when it's on sale it averages to $15 USD for all three items.

												This game is one of the best I have ever played, not only is there infinite customization, each stage is a different type of gameplay, first level (cell) is somewhat like feeding frenzy or agar.io, the land creature stage is a third person adventure gameplay, tribal stage is a strategy game such as age of empires, national stage is like Civ V or most other strategy games, and the final stage (space) is more of an open world, infinite exploration, conquer the galaxy kind of game. Overall, no matter what kind of game you like, you will most likely enjoy Spore.10/10 would conquer universe again			"

												As long as you're not expecting a very serious game, this game is great.   It has a variety of modes/stages to play in, starting as a basic Cell, evolving through an early creature stage through to a large space-faring species, with the fate of the galaxy in your, seemingly the only capable hands in the entire galaxy.  It is very light-hearted sort of story, even the biggest villains in the universe aren't that bad, and the game itself doesn't take itself very seriously.  The Creators are pretty robust if you have a good imagination, you could create an entire species that looks like Bart Simpson, or ships that look like giant butterflies, very close to anything you want.

												Spore is a very good game. However in the space stage spore gets quite monotonous and boring with the inability to change your characters and space ship. you just make friends or enemies while replying to requests for help to try and keep your ally ships. the stage I liked best was the creature stage. I hope there is an update to make everything more creature stage style.			"

												Purchased on disc back at launch. Repurchased on Steam a while back. All my creations are still cloud saved, and can reuse my old designs from 8 years ago. A+. 10/10As for gameplay, I have broken it down to each stage below:Cell stage is fun, Pac-man-esque without the wall barriers, fun, simple, neat.Creature stage is okay, slightly tedious if your are the sort of player that needs EVERY type of body part before continuing. Tribe stage is very much a one-trick wonder. Don’t over think it, complete quickly, move on.City stage is kinda fun, building cities quickly becomes a copy paste exercise, but tearing down the cities of your enemies through commerce, religion or focer is all equally satisfying!Space stage is the pinnacle of the game, you start with very little, you must work and manage trade routes, and blasting cities apart on neighbouring system to progress. Money starts tight, and pew-pew sounds easier; but allies do help early-mid game. Micro managing planetary spice is annoying to set up, but satisfying  when the wonga rolls in. Ecological disasters and space pirate raiding keeps you from rushing away from home too quickly. The balance is  good between feeling far too easy, and flipping around to a point where a new disaster happens every few minutes. I haven’t got to the end yet. This is definitely a game worth the £15 price tag, from a person who paid full brick and mortar retail at launch. If it’s on sale, snap it up.			"

												Started off as a cell that only ate small peices of meat, just nimble cells trying to stay alive in this world. Got to land, evolved into a spider mixed with a scorpion creature that I like to call ""Stenhi"", striaght outta of Compton. Befriend other species and live in a fluffy teletubby land of peace and happiness, or eradicate them all to the last man, woman, and kindergarten teacher? Murder them all. Why? Because the snake gods demanded blood sacrifices and its not like we were gonna argue. Now enterd the civiliation era, Stenhi with huge tanks and helicopters that served as mobile bases of muderering and oppression. Mostly murderering. Other civiliations not under my rule? I immediately took control, by blowing up everything. Order was mine, citys only filled with houses and factories, no entertainment of any sort, besides The Jackson 5, I was ruling with order. The Stenhi had ruled the planet with order and communism. They had eventually invented the space ship, they soared the stars, met new people. We traded and did missions for them. Then in the end, we murdered each colony, one by one. ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" -Gary Coleman  Order and communism, all throught the galaxy, I don't know what's to come next, but if anything, we'll just murder it.Oh and I almost forgot, 10/10.

												Simply put: this game contains nearly endless amounts of character customization, and that is why I continue to come back to it over and over. Let your imagination be your guide. You can literally spend 100% of your playing time (like I often do, myself) just designing a multitude of different creatures, vehicles (land, sea, and space) and buildings as well. The game reminded me a lot of Black and White, which I used to play near-obessively when I was younger. There's more to the game than just customization and character design, of course. Following the evolutionary story mode itself presents all sorts of interesting scientific, biological, and sociological mechanics. As a gamer, it's the ultimate sense of creative control to supervise and influence a creature's growth and development, along with all the cultural and societal changes that go along with it. It's just so enthralling to raise a creature from infantile stage as a microbe, all the way to a prim-and-proper gentleman of a monster.			"

												This is hard to recommend either way, since it is a game designed to be most fun with the creative mind.If you only want to slap a few limbs together and call it a 'creature' then you might not enjoy the game as much. But if you put thought into the thing you make and find ammusment in watching your designed creature going from singular cell to a galactic empire then you'll certanily find fun in this game. The only downside is that the 3rd and 4th stages of 5 are a bit repetative, and the game is rather short, unless you count the infinite space stage, which can last hours.Then again, some people might just enjoy making giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and having them fly around in butt rockets created in a city filled with buildings shaped like cheese...

Yes, it does not have a wonderfull graphics or breathtaking action (actually it does) but this is a really good game. Kids can spend hours playing it, adulst will enjoy it's madness or simply make a ♥♥♥♥-like creature.I highly recommend it to young gamers.The creature redactor is wonderfull. Make anything your heart desires and it will still look and move fine.The sounds, the music are great. Feel the atmosphere of new-born life and the beauty of space.Enjoy silly jokes while trading alien races :)Meet an Unidentified Walking Objects made by other users while playing. Some things they build are hilarious.You will have an ability to take over the whole galaxy. Is'n it awesome to be an overlord?It is easier to play as a peacefull creature. Be good.Disadvantages are:Sometimes the game does not work. :DIt is hard to beat it only for the first time. Try to find out everything by yourself so the game would be more interesting.Space stage is completely boring without Galactic Adventures. With GA it is just a little less boring.Too easy to understand how the game works. The interaction with animals/tribes/civilisations is too predictable.			"

												Wow I finally decided to get Spore and it's just as expected. Gorgeous game. The level of details is just stunning. So many choices and lovely features. If you guys decide to buy it, I STRONGLY recommend to play in Hard mode so as to extend game time. Because even on hard mode, i'm nearly done with the main game objectives, playing once or twice a week. 17hours total which isn't much but this game is a jewel nonetheless. I'm glad that i bought the game to support the devs instead of torrenting. I created a steam account just to get this lol but now i realise how nice this place is! (: Have fun guys!			"

												I bought this game when it was released in 2006. While Will Wright's original vision of the game was curtailed by EA's desire to rush it out, Spore has a certain charm that I love. When it came to Steam, I decided I needed to buy it again. This and the expansions are really games for people who love to create and create you can! Ships, creatures, builidings, vehicles, planets, missions, and a whole gaxaly's worth of shher fun awaits. It's not a ""serious"" space sim. You have to go into Spore with a sense of humor. It pays a loving if rather quirky tribute to Star Trek and Star Wars and other franchises - there is a HEAVY Hitchhikers CGuide to the Galaxy vibe in Spore. Now, all of that said, the base game is good, but it really shines with the Creature Cereator and goes into warp speed with GalacticAdventures. The latter expansion features on planet missions. There are both Maxis created and user created missions and they range from cute to quite frantic, violent, fast paced affairs.I realize that Spore received mixed reviews. But bear in mind that these reviews were partly informed by the fact that Will Wright was not given time to complete his vision for this game. This game is a guilty pleasure for me amid all the ""serious"" games I play.  Spore is more of a huge creative playground and it does it better than Minecraft at least for me.			"

												Okay just a quick review since the games for 5 bucks.Do I recommend it for 5 bucks? Sure why not?It's kinda fun to play. The idea is great and the gameplay is solid, most of the time.But it does have some lacking attributes.The gameplay its self is like a bunch of mini games put together over the period of a worlds time from the very beginning of life, to the very pinnacle of it.Only dlc you should probably get is the galactic adventures one.

												I do rather love this game, but I won't recommend it.I remember back when it was still in development and little by little sneak peeks were shown and it looked amazingly awesome... and then when it came out it (like so many other games) had been significantly dumbed down for a less complex more mainstream gameplay. Even so there was (and still is) a huge amount of delight to be had in raising your creatures from single celled organisms, chosing their skills by rewriting their DNA from generation to generation until they become civilized and then developing them into the endgame (space exploration) via technological advances.So why no recommendation?Well for a start the game is just outright unstable. The general instability just doesn't seem to be fixable. Everywhere I looked I found it was just an accepted side effect of running the game. So it will crash. And it doesn't autosave. So you must save often. And if you screw up and save after it's begun breaking it will destroy that save game and make it forever unloadable. It's also been ditched by EA so it won't be being fixed.The actual evolutionary stages (barring the last) are just too plain short. I wanted to spend hours on each stage but you zoom forwards, even if you go the completionist route and stick around until you've done every last thing you can. The combat is not great, the social minigame is read a cue and then press one of four buttons (creature stage) three buttons (tribal stage) oh we got rid of the buttons just click on it already (civ stage)The final space stage is huge and is where you will will either spend most of your time, or where you will get quickly fed up and return to the start to create more creatures. There is literally an entire galaxy to take over including a race of extremely unfriendly borg *cough* sorry, I mean Grox towards to the centre. Your creature, that you poured so much time and attention into is replaced by a spaceship and it all gets a bit meh.... Galactic Adventures does try to address this but not well... (I'll deal with that on it's own though).Initially you will ooooh over the creature creator. Eventually you will be frustrated by it's limitations and the relatively restrictive set of main parts. The inability to set a gender/voice for your creature is most evidenced when you create something female looking and it talks like a brawny guy or something cute and sounds like it's just waiting to eat you for breakfast. There are a huge number of really minor fixes that could have been added to this that would have provided some huge quality of life improvements for this game... but despite them being suggested over and over again when the game's developers were still active, they were unfortunately never addressed.I still love Spore. It holds a very special place in my heart, but I can't recommend it. If you still fancy it despite its issues then you'll probably have a great time with it. I'd love to see a sequel - some of the things that were cutting edge when this came out are much more developed now and it could be awesome... unlikely, but still...			"

												The game is a great game, at first... My first 9 hours into the game got me hooked, but once i started space exploration, the game got EXTREMELY boring and repetitive. Sure the galaxy is HUGE and there's soooo much to explore, but after a few hours in space, the same thing happens over and over no matter where you go. The replay value just simply isn't there. I personally bought the game for 12.49 and I will honestly say it's the worst purchase i've made on steam in terms of $$ and hours logged. Edit: If I had just bought the spore game itself without the expansions/dlc (which would amount to $5 on sale), then i could say the game was worth it. So my recommendation to you guys would be to just buy the $5 spore game and not the entire package.			"

												When this game went on sale, I was so stoked for it. I really, REALLY wanted to play this one after playing the DS game quite a while back. $12 for the entire bundle that would normally cost $50? What could possibly go wrong?Oh. Oh. So very, very much.I'm just going to clear something up right now: the 8.1 hours of gametime I have logged at the time of this review were all continuous.It started out simple enough --- start off as a cell, eat food, and get bigger. Eventually I got to land, and all was well. I decided to play the friendly route. I played as an herbivore and tried to befriend every species I came across. Didn't ALWAYS work, but 90% of the time.Then came the tribal era. At this point, somewhere I snapped. A screw or two came loose and I went on a murderous rampage, sending my Gryphon people to slaughter every other tribe. At this point I was still semi-sentient and had to consistently check to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, and that what I was playing was actually happening, for real, on my screen.When the civilization era hit I may as well have been in a damn coma. I was mentally dead and before I knew it I'd captured every city through military force, even mercilessly killing the last empire that was supposed to be my ally.Next thing I knew I was in a spaceship, shooting lasers at my own kind because they were ""infected"".Eventually I was able to leave this game's grasp. But not without some serious self-reflection later.I began peaceful, only to deteriorate into a murderous psychopath who slaughtered every other existing race before turning on my own, ultimately becoming the highest form of dictator.10/10 would kill 99% of the planet again.

												I usually dislike RTS games but Spore is different in my opinion, I abosolutly LOVE how crazy and goofy you can get with your creations! You start from the cell stage and work your way up to creature, tribal, civil, and space. I found that I much prefer the Creature stage mostly because you can be the animal, stalk your pray (if your a meat eater), tear into their flesh and all that good stuff. I just really enjoy being a savage animal. Once you go into the Tribal stage thats when the RTS part of Spore comes in and some people prefer that but like I said I just enjoy being a savage creature killing anything that isn't my own!9/10			"

It works on the not so much gifted computers so it's easy to run.I give it a 9/10. ps: There is a error for some people, when you die in the creature stage you may crash.

												Spore is the type of game that really speaks to me on personal level. Ever since i was a small child, lets say around three years old, i've wanted to be a ♥♥♥♥ creature. No game could ever fulfill this dream i had; I wanted my character to perfectly resemble a ♥♥♥♥♥, whether i wanted that one specifically to or not. This game surpasses my expectations with flying colors! Whether i try to make a raptor, a human, or a simple blob the creature always looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥!			"

												Loved this game when I was a kid. Even with the expansions now, it still has its issues - lack of complexity in all the game modes besides creature and space, no female voices for your creatures, tedious gameplay. And yet, there's something charming about raising your little cell from a tiny bacteria all the way to the conqueror of the galaxy. You can try to make your creature follow some sort of realistic evolution, or make phallic creatures and laugh as the engine makes them wobble around. Though honestly, go with the first one - the game leaves a lot to be desired, but you can patch those holes with your own creativity. (seriously stop making dickmonsters please.)			"

												I hve played this game a lot, and to be honest it is fun but it gets dull for a while. The cell and the beast modes are the more fun I have and I could simply play in those with no problem. Tribe mode is interesting but it gets too much like civilization and then there's too much to do at once. I always lose focus at this point and restart just so I can have fun at cell and beast mode. That said its extremely fun and worth the money. I do wish it had more dlc or allowed for mods. That would be interesting, I recommend it.			"

												Please ignore my pitiful play time. I've been playing on the 'Creepy and Cute' parts pack, where I have 50+ hours.Pick it up in a sale. Not worth £15, but certainly worth £10 or less. Simply the technology in Spore is really quite incredible. All the creators are hugely detailed, and the combinations of creatures, buildings and vehichles is extraordinary.Gameplay wise, there's 5 stages.Cell Stage: Control your cell, eat food, don't get eaten. Seemples. Topdown, swimmy thing. Probably the second or third strongest stage.Creature Stage: Ascend onto Land, and into proper 3 dimensions! Control your creature, meet new species on your to sentience! Either the first or second best stage. Probably on par with the Space stage.Tribal stage: Contol a tribe of your now fully evolved creatures, and become the dominant species. Not too terrible, just the weakest stage. Just a bit repetitive, and the AI gets a bit ropey around here.Civilization Stage: Contol your vehicles, and become the dominant empire. Probably the second worst stage, just repetitive.Space Stage: The finale to Spore, you get to explore space! Unfortunately your spaceship doesn't have any effect on how it plays unlike vehicles in the civ. stage. Empires consisting of other creations are quite nice, and each one (including your own) has a Philosphy and Archetype. Wanderer, Warrior, Shaman, Trader, Scientist, Zealot, Diplomat, Ecologist, Bard or Knight.At the end of each stage, you get either a Red, Blue or Green card. Red cards are for carnivores who kill and pillage. Green is for herbivores who ally and befried, while Blue is a bit of both. Depending on your card selection, you get one of 10 archetypes. Each one gets a ability, and more depending on how many cards you get. Personally, I prefer to choose an Archetype from the Spore Wiki, and aim to be one of them, and evolve from cell to space. Zealot is the best, fanatical frenzy is the bomb.Overall Spore is an excellent game. However, it feels emptier the bigger the game gets. Cell stage it's all small (literally), but your just one cell, it's very personal. As you progress to packs to tribes and eventually cities and spacefaring empires, your little critter you made just isn't...important anymore.			"

Lets just say I don't regret it.  Granted, it is not the most intense game by any means.  And by trying to do a number of things, certain parts are lacking.  But in my opinion, it is well rounded enough to provide a good ammount of fun, and it is a great feeling to take your little single cell gooble all the way up into Space.  There evidentally is a good modding community for the space stuff, so if you're into that, there ya go.  I may not pay full price for it, but definetly put this on a wishlist.			"

												Yes i love this game! Its all about simulation, life, and evolving. So worth money. But it could use a little updates like autosave, maybe some more stages tooIve beaten the game all the way up to galaxy mode in less than half a day. So yes this game is recommended from me and the only tweak Id like added is more stages.			"

												Not bad! It's really entertaining, and I espessially like the custom additions. It had few glitches, and the glitches that I /did/ find didn't effect the game immensely. However, It has crashed once since I started playing it. Unfortunately, this made me lose the game I was on. Luckilly, I wasn't to far into it, and I'm thankful I hadn't gotten any further. I'd recommend this game to people into ""The Sims"" frachise, as well as creative people like myself that would enjoy the customization part of the game.			"

												I find this to be a rather fun and interesting game. If you're not patient enough to sit and try to find all the different parts, you can go from single celled organism to space age in less than 3 hours. But once you hit that final stage there is so much to do. It has blown my mind, between the species evolution,  to the different societal  choices. It's fun, and it's goofy, and the way you play can vary from person to person.			"

The game is great, but to make online work it will take a bit a research. The time to activate it is worth it though and it can bring hours upon hours of fun. It has good building mechanics and can be fun at times with game play. I was a little weird because I enjoy Tribal, Civilization, and Space stage, but I will admit there are some things lacking and the game can get tedious if you only do one strat, however if you mix things up and try new things and designs you can have lots of fun.

Great game if you like to create and like to decide your role in the world (because you not only get to create your creature, you also get to choose how it lives, is it a creature that eats everything? does it kill everyone on sight? or is it a peaceful plant eater out to make friends?).I recomend you look at a lot of youtube videos and decide if it will be a good fit for you.

In case you weren't aware, in this game you guide a creature from it's humble multicellular stages all the way to being a galactic god of sorts. As a child this was super fun to play and I probably would've failed elementary school if my mother hadn't bought a new computer. Anyways, it's 9 years later and this game still totally rocks my a** off. There's an endless array of things to do and with two moderately interesting expansion packs, you might just find the kid in you playing this instead of tending to your worldly responsibilities. Yes it gets criticized for what it's not but that's not really a fair criticism now is it? Witty, far out, and incredible.  10/10			"

Pros:-making creatures-2 super fun stages-educational (in a way)-not laggy at all (most of the time)-if you're on a laptop, you don't need WiFi to play.-you meet random creations-you can create creatures, spaceships, boats, cars, planes, buildings, and more!Cons:-kind of a ""grab it on sale"" game, too expensive-DLC is too expesnsive too-you rarely meet your own creations "

												I recommend this game to anybody and I think this is a title that shouldn't be overlooked. Spore nowadays is too underrated, people say it's not worth the price, it really is. Either way, this game does have its flaws.In the Cell stage, there are certain green creatures that expand, sometimes they can stretch and sometimes even disappear.Even though this game is a title I recommend to anybody, the Tribal and City stages are quite repetetive, it feels more like Clash of Clans, rather than the Beat 'em up free-roaming style of the creature stage and the Cell stages.

												Spore gets a lot of flak for not living up to the expectations piled upon it. It was hailed as the ultimate creation game, building your spieces from the ground up, with many customisation options. And admittedly, it failed at that. But I still enjoy this game for what it is.The gameplay is split into 5 sections, or 'stages'. The Cell Stage, Creature Stage, Tribal, City and Space Stages. Cell, Tribal and City Stages are too short, but fun. The Creature Stage is longer generally, and is where you develop your species. But the Space Stage takes up around 80% or more of the game. Unfortunately, it's really not that interesting. You go around space, finding planets, talking to aliens, killing aliens, and making alliances with aliens. Sounds fun? Not really. It's alright, but extremely repetitive. And as mentioned, it takes up most of the game, with a huge grind to get to the centre of the galaxy. I've never personally finished the game and have no idea how it ends. It's just too grindy. However, it can still be fun for a while.Where the main enjoyment of the game comes from is the creation. It has creators for creatures, vehicles (boats, ground, flying and space), and buildings. While not the most extensive, I have still put many hours into simply making things.Overall, I would give this game a neutral rating if I could, but I enjoy it more than I dislike it, so I'm giving it a positive rating.

												For creative players, even casual players, this is a good choice of game.  One of the most cohesive I've played, at least.  However, since it could have been much more epic than it ended up being, I'd say wait until it's on sale for at least half off to buy it, it's not worth the full list price, in my humble opinion.  Fairly user friendly game, pretty much anyone could play it and grasp the concept easily without needing much outside guidance.			"

												I think this is one of the most interactive games i have ever played. because of its almost unlimited possibilties of creation in this game along with the thousands of creations maxis and even players of the game like me and you have made. some are funny, some are interesting, and some are awesome but. the game is very fun when it comes to the freedom of choice you can be a good person a trader or a conquerer and sometimes you can end up doing a genocide of your own creations or your own creations can kill you and the whole galaxy is yours to explore once you hit the space stage so get this game because it is extremely fun			"

												Let me ask you a question... Would you like to be god?.... I know you would.... everybody would.... and this game is the reason why!!! but that's not enough, let's dissect it piece by piece:1-PRESENTATION AND GRAPHICSFirst of all, this game looks AMAZING on max resolution, even in MY pc's resolution it looks good, and it's like minimum or something, and the animations are very well done, except when you add too many legs to your creature and they get web'd, it's safe to say the animation depends if your creature is designed the way they want it to be.2-SOUNDTRACKThis game's soundtrack is VERY atmospheric, it has a ""wonder"" feel to it, the tracks aren't even that good, they just fit the feeling of spore, it's very hard to describe.3-GAMEPLAYThe game consists on Creation Mode and Story Mode, in creation mode, you create your creation created on the Spore creature creator.......... I'm proud of that sentence..........in story mode you ALSO create your creature, but this time, you go from a cell to a space king, with your own adventure...4-CONCLUSIONThis game is fantastic, only one thing... when you get to space stage... Move on... the game gets boring in space stage, unless you try it out and like it, i personally don't, but i completely recommend you try this game if you're a fan of sandbox games, wth that said, i give SPORE...a 6/10			"

												I remember seeing the trailer for this game on Nick in 2008 when I was 7 years old. Later that year I recieved it for christmas. I had never been more amazed with anything in my life. In case you weren't aware, in this game you guide a creature from it's humble multicellular stages all the way to being a galactic god of sorts. As a child this was super fun to play and I probably would've failed elementary school if my mother hadn't bought a new computer. Anyways, it's 9 years later and this game still totally rocks my a** off. There's an endless array of things to do and with two moderately interesting expansion packs, you might just find the kid in you playing this instead of tending to your worldly responsibilities. Yes it gets criticized for what it's not but that's not really a fair criticism now is it? Witty, far out, and incredible.  10/10			"

Markiplier recommended this game to millions and had fun playing with three of his friends and he made laugh whichs makes me happy so got this game and I love it to death and i cant wait for more! :) I think some people will agree with me that ""Markiplier"" is to blame :D for showing off one of the most hard working, asomely disigned, and beautiful looking games to come around.

You get to create your own creature and evolve it while socialising and defeating other creatures!I love how depending on what actions do take in every stage, it willchange your abilities, ect. later on!There is replay value! - experimenting with your creature's actions, unlcking new things to use in the main game! (play and gain)I love looking at the timeline and seeing how much your creature has changed since the cell stage!The space stage is AMAZING! Its so ""deep"" and detailed! Fantastic! Wow! It is the PINNACLE of spore!!The only thing i dont like is... the cell stage is too short for me! It is still is great- its and amazing introduction to the game, though, i would lovefor it to be longer!I would rate this game 8/10 for its sheer creativity!PS.

												In Spore you start off as a tiny cellular organism, and through adaptation and ingenuity make your way through 5 stages of the game, Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space. The game features a fantastic creature editing kit, which allows you to make anything you want, be it a 6 headed horse, or a reptilian butterfly who practices shamanism. And with the addition of the Galactic Adventures DLC, you can create and share handcrafted quests and missions with other players! It's awesome, Spore ate up my early years of PC gaming, and I can only hope this review will convince you to buy it!			"

Although I do like certain features within the game. Specifically the civilization stage. Who knows I may play this game again and change my mind.Story: Create a creature from cell stage, to creature stage, to Tribal stage, to Civilization stage, to Space stage! Explore and dominate the world or galaxy any way you wish. By ""neutral"", ""hostile"", or ""friendly"" ways of communicating, interacting, or fighting other races throughout the galaxy or on the planet your still on.			"

												I remember seeing the trailer for this game on Nick in 2008 when I was 7 years old. Later that year I recieved it for christmas. I had never been more amazed with anything in my life. In case you weren't aware, in this game you guide a creature from it's humble multicellular stages all the way to being a galactic god of sorts. As a child this was super fun to play and I probably would've failed elementary school if my mother hadn't bought a new computer. Anyways, it's 9 years later and this game still totally rocks my a** off. There's an endless array of things to do and with two moderately interesting expansion packs, you might just find the kid in you playing this instead of tending to your worldly responsibilities. Yes it gets criticized for what it's not but that's not really a fair criticism now is it? Witty, far out, and incredible.  10/10			"

Spore is not limited by the ever-present boundaries of physics or common sense, and even in the later game where you can no longer evolve your creature physically, visiting other planets to find that 8-nosed monstrosity you made as a joke living in harmony with 'normal' creatures is great fun.

If you're not patient enough to sit and try to find all the different parts, you can go from single celled organism to space age in less than 3 hours.

												Under this line is my old review. I'm leaving the bad parts up because this was legitimately a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to happen, but it did get fixed. I still stick to my feelings that EA support is garbageEA did not fix it, EA ignored my tickets for help and flat out ended them without replying. Where I got help was the SPORE Steam forums, so thanks to everyone who replies to crash threads.Ultimately what fixed my game was going to the appdata/roaming section, finding SPORE, and deleting the ""Game"" folder inside the SPORE folder. I then reinstalled spore, and suddenly no more locking up, suddenly saving works.The only crash I get now is when I get killed, if I hit ESC in an attempt to skip the death cinematic (sometimes). But at least now I can save, so I'm happy. _____________________________________________I want to start out by saying I REALLY want to enjoy this game. The gameplay IS fun, but the game is giving me massive problems. I truly mean this. I did get to play some of the game, and what DID work was amazing. I'd love to sink dozens and dozens of hours into this game, but I can't.Start off by the fact there is no sort of auto-save. That sucks. I had to learn the hard way when my game randomly crashed after an hour of playing.No big deal right? I'll just save often, no problemUnfortunately, no, it isn't that easy. Turns out, every time I try to save, SPORE pops up and says something along the lines of, ""Save game has failed, spore will now close.""What? ♥♥♥♥ing what?It gets worse. I've opened SPORE as an application, about 10 times more than I've actually played the game. Now what happens is when I launch the game, it gets through the opening credits and onto the main screen, only to say my data is corrupt. SPORE then proceeds to freeze, SPORE then proceeds to make me lose control of my mouse. ALT F4 doesn't work, Task Manager can't kill it, I'm forced to restart my computer just to even be able to use my computer again.Validating files does not fix it, reinstalling the game does not fix it. It's eternally ♥♥♥♥ed. If anyone has actual helpful advice, I'm all ears. If these issues get fixed, I'll change my review. I'll be endlessly waiting for chat support from EA in the meantime. ""Estimated wait is 5 minutes"" ... an hour later, still waiting...They make all kinds of mentions of ""Email us..."" as one of the options, but as far as I can find, their email is hidden, and the only things they list are live chat, ask community, or phoneClassic EA			"

												Spore is a game that combines games. It does so while keeping the same element that binds together all these playstyles. You create your own- WOAH. To understand Spore's key element, you need to take a look at EVERYTHING it has to offer. You begin emerging from a meteor as a cell, where you swim around the Tidepool searching for food. Depending on what you are (carnivore or herbivore) you eat different creatures, food, and other things. eating gives you DNA, the currency that lets you change up your cell in a way that gives it protection, speed, and tricks. These tricks can then be used during the creature stage, which is where youwalk around the surface of the planet (you get to name it, too!) finding food. Other creatures inhabit the land too, though. You have two options: Friend, or food. You unlock HUNDREDS of new partss to use on your creature, including pincers, cooler eyes and mouths, arms, legs, and the list goes on. afterwards you are trested to the Tribal Stages. Here you select units (which are your own creature army) and tell them where to go. Now you can't change the look of your creature, or even RENAME them. All you can do now is give him some odd looking tribal clothes. Other tribes steal your food (new currency), and it gets pretty hectic. Tribal isn't as good, but its short and brings you to Civilization stage. Here your creature has built towns, trade routes, tanks and fighter jets, designed by YOU. Once again, selected unit-based gameplay, but its more fun than Tribal. i just find it fun to send my army to a small town ready to be conquered. As for the Space Stage, you now control your designed spaceship to conquer or ally other planets. Spore gets a 10/10.			"

												Spore is a game where you create your own creature and survive the harsh lands.There are four different civilizations ( Cell mode, Creature mode, City mode and then you go to Space mode) it's really fun and it gets you using your imagination when making things, even though its a cash taker (i got it for $40.00) its still worth it.

												Spore could have been one of the best games in years. The concept is great, designing each stage with it's own features and gameplay style was an awesome idea, and it's incredibly unique and creative. However, the ""final"" game just feels unfinished. EA either bit off more than they could chew with the game or just intended to hype it up and then abandon it mid-development as a cash grab. (Since it's EA, I kind of expect the latter). However, it's still a pretty good game if you want something light and easy to play with little siblings (like I did) that allows for a lot of creativity. However, don't expect it to be a great game you keep coming back to once you've finished a single playthrough.			"

												If you are looking for a game to play in your spare time I would get this. The game allows you to create whatever you want and however you can NOT go fully in detail and make your character have the same specifictions that you want. The whole thing from Cell to Space is easy and not really fun. IMO the only fun stages are Creature Stage and Space Stage. Otherwise you can easily get through this game in 4 hours to get to space stage. Also once you beat the game their is nothing else to do really. My overall score for this amazing piece of game is 8/10. One down side with this is you have to have sign in with an EA account to get other players creations instead of only Maxis's creatures and vehicles.			"

												Under this line is my old review. I'm leaving the bad parts up because this was legitimately a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to happen, but it did get fixed. I still stick to my feelings that EA support is garbageEA did not fix it, EA ignored my tickets for help and flat out ended them without replying. Where I got help was the SPORE Steam forums, so thanks to everyone who replies to crash threads.Ultimately what fixed my game was going to the appdata/roaming section, finding SPORE, and deleting the ""Game"" folder inside the SPORE folder. I then reinstalled spore, and suddenly no more locking up, suddenly saving works.The only crash I get now is when I get killed, if I hit ESC in an attempt to skip the death cinematic (sometimes). But at least now I can save, so I'm happy. _____________________________________________I want to start out by saying I REALLY want to enjoy this game. The gameplay IS fun, but the game is giving me massive problems. I truly mean this. I did get to play some of the game, and what DID work was amazing. I'd love to sink dozens and dozens of hours into this game, but I can't.Start off by the fact there is no sort of auto-save. That sucks. I had to learn the hard way when my game randomly crashed after an hour of playing.No big deal right? I'll just save often, no problemUnfortunately, no, it isn't that easy. Turns out, every time I try to save, SPORE pops up and says something along the lines of, ""Save game has failed, spore will now close.""What? ♥♥♥♥ing what?It gets worse. I've opened SPORE as an application, about 10 times more than I've actually played the game. Now what happens is when I launch the game, it gets through the opening credits and onto the main screen, only to say my data is corrupt. SPORE then proceeds to freeze, SPORE then proceeds to make me lose control of my mouse. ALT F4 doesn't work, Task Manager can't kill it, I'm forced to restart my computer just to even be able to use my computer again.Validating files does not fix it, reinstalling the game does not fix it. It's eternally ♥♥♥♥ed. If anyone has actual helpful advice, I'm all ears. If these issues get fixed, I'll change my review. I'll be endlessly waiting for chat support from EA in the meantime. ""Estimated wait is 5 minutes"" ... an hour later, still waiting...They make all kinds of mentions of ""Email us..."" as one of the options, but as far as I can find, their email is hidden, and the only things they list are live chat, ask community, or phoneClassic EA			"

												IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS RUNNING SPORE:Go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spore"" and find the file called ""runme.exe"". Right click it and set the compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2.Now go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spore\SporeBin"" and find ""SporeApp.exe"" - do the same, set the compatibility mode to WinXP SP2.This should now work.

												Spore is a game that combines games. It does so while keeping the same element that binds together all these playstyles. You create your own- WOAH. To understand Spore's key element, you need to take a look at EVERYTHING it has to offer. You begin emerging from a meteor as a cell, where you swim around the Tidepool searching for food. Depending on what you are (carnivore or herbivore) you eat different creatures, food, and other things. eating gives you DNA, the currency that lets you change up your cell in a way that gives it protection, speed, and tricks. These tricks can then be used during the creature stage, which is where youwalk around the surface of the planet (you get to name it, too!) finding food. Other creatures inhabit the land too, though. You have two options: Friend, or food. You unlock HUNDREDS of new partss to use on your creature, including pincers, cooler eyes and mouths, arms, legs, and the list goes on. afterwards you are trested to the Tribal Stages. Here you select units (which are your own creature army) and tell them where to go. Now you can't change the look of your creature, or even RENAME them. All you can do now is give him some odd looking tribal clothes. Other tribes steal your food (new currency), and it gets pretty hectic. Tribal isn't as good, but its short and brings you to Civilization stage. Here your creature has built towns, trade routes, tanks and fighter jets, designed by YOU. Once again, selected unit-based gameplay, but its more fun than Tribal. i just find it fun to send my army to a small town ready to be conquered. As for the Space Stage, you now control your designed spaceship to conquer or ally other planets. Spore gets a 10/10.			"

Its an organism's progression, from single-celled to galactic empire, except you control it the whole way through. The creator is essentially made of options. Maxis really went out of their way to make sure there was a diverse pool of creatures to encounter throughout the game. I give spore 9.99999 out of 10. PS: when you unlock tribal stage, evolve one more time and make it look as cool as possible regardless of stats; they don't really affect anything after you finish creature stage.			"

Although I do like certain features within the game. Specifically the civilization stage. Who knows I may play this game again and change my mind.Story: Create a creature from cell stage, to creature stage, to Tribal stage, to Civilization stage, to Space stage!
