												Door Kickers is one of those pleasant surprises that comes every now and then.This is essentially a Top Down SWAT Team Simulator that is extremely Tactical. (And I'm not using the word just because it's cool)How would I describe Door Kickers ?This game reminds me of older releases that change the way FPSes are played such as Rainbow Six and SWAT.This is a slow and methodical game as it'll brutally punish you if a mistake have been made. Thought and precise movements must be taken into account if you wish for all of your troopers to survive that one bloody great gunfight.How does this game differ itself from the rest ?First of all, it is innovative. This is done in the style of the briefing phase in Rainbow Six, but it is completely real time with pausing mechanics so you are able to change your plan on the fly other than having to exit to the planning phase and change your movements and start over.How is this game tactical ?Well, the RPS 'Best Tactics of 2014' says for itself.Not enough, aye ?Fine. Door Kickers is one of those games that shines during situations where you can't just go guns blazing.For example,there is a hostage taker standing right behind the hostage facing toward the only entry point of the room.Now, being the Top Down game that Door Kickers is, there is no third dimension so when your team step into the room, the hostage taker will open fire and hit the hostage before he hits you.So what do you do ?1. Bang the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... I meant a flashbang. Blind him so your team has time to move around and neutralise him without harming the hostage2. If there is a window, you can send a trooper to flank him from a different angle.Multiple ways to problem solve, is it enough evidence that this game is tactical ?No ?Well, the game has different kinds of situations that you have to adapt to, such as- Eliminate Hostiles : It's basically Terrorist Hunt. Go in, kill all the baddies, win.- Hostage Rescue : It's just like Terrorist Hunt, but with Hostages in it. Possibility of an Execution though.- Stop Execution : A baddie in the area is about to blow the brains out of someone and you have to stop them.- Bomb Defusal : Well, the name says it all.- Dope Raid : Recover evidence mainly dope, and dope papers.- Warrant Arrest : Again, name says it all.- Protect VIP : ... I don't really have to describe this one at all, do I ?- Robbery in Progress : Somehow, the devs know how lazy I get when I need to describe things.What ? Still not enough ? Are you kidding me...Fine.The game has an arsenal of trooper classes, weapons, and equipment to outfit your team to suit the situationClasses include (If you haven't seen the video above)- Pointman : Only armed with a pistol, has the highest mobility and is the fastest during entry, but isn't the best at range- Assaulter : Guy with the guns. Basically, guy that shoots all the baddies for you.- Breacher : As the name implies, he breaches door ways, clear rooms, and corridors in hasty manner. I like to call him ""Hobo with a Shotgun""- Shield : The guy that you would want to bring when the baddies bring their big guns.- Stealth : Shhhh... I'm trying to think of a description for this one... Damn it, keep quiet! I'm trying to think!Weapons range from simple submachine guns such as the MP5A3 to meaner rifles like the G36C to a punch in the face like the Mossberg 590.Sidearms ? No problem! Glocks, 1911s, and P226s, anything is in store! Just need to trade in your gold stars!Oh, we got loads of equipments, Flashbang, Breaching Charges, Tasers, even a little handheld machine that allows you to picklock faster!So as you can see, this game is completely tacticool...WHAT? NOT ENOUGH!? Bruh, I'm done. I got nothing else. You can go watch them YouTube videos and find them all out on your own. I ain't gonna tell you everything man.Oh, but you want the know the truth !? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.Anyways, I love this game. One of my favourite games, as you can see, spent over 100 hours on this thing.If I could rename my girlfriend, I would name her ""Window Smashers"".Thank you for reading my Review. It's probably too long, but heck. At least I got it out there, right ?			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is one of the most extreme tactical SWAT games I have ever played. It offers hugely evolving gameplay and a load of weapon combinations to suit your playstyle. You will be able to use armories from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, US, etc.) and also have different forms of each weapon (Silences, or non-silenced) for you to be able to in stealthily or blow your way into the enemy lines. You will also have the option of creativity as each time you do a mission you will want a new strategy, and it allows you to have multiple ways of getting into a room, from pick-locking a door to blowing it down with C4 or shottgunning the lock. You will also enjoy the challenging gameplay of only having a limited amount of men and will likely be outnumbered, forcing you to strategize and plan instead of rushing them like it's a Third-person shooter.Also note this game is being created by a small, indie team. So you will not get updates every other day, but it seems so far they have been having extremely large updates every two weeks, which likely means they love there buyers so much they are over working themselves.If you have the money, and enjoy planning and then watching your men burst in and dominate the enemy or have one thing go wrong and watch your team get slaughtered, then buy the game. It's fairly cheap and really innovative to the market, it's also in early access so there is so much more to come and it's completely playable and almost bug free in its current state. "

												I couldn't expect something amazing due to tons of mediocre indie-games nowdays, but this one, GOD...9.5/10Pros:- music is just brilliant = 40% of whole atmosphere (like Payday 1/2)- very rich tactics- really fast and smooth client- simultaneously shutting down 4 enemies by 4 troopers spawns huge 0rgasm. Sadly, this is not a joke :(- tons of missions and ways to complete them. I mean, TONS- slick and easy UI- mods support- mission generator + built-in mission maker + possibility to share it- this is how every Warhammer40k tactical game should look like, just change the skin and you got mindbreaking legendary crusadeCons:- lack of narrative briefing for missions like story, characters and intrigue (remembering Gunpoint), just short descriptions- when multiple troopers paths are crossed it is becomes too hard to micro-command like look there, step here- RNG sometimes looks weird, like one try you one-shot everything and another one you're wasting whole magazine for one guy- sometimes your troopers AI just stuck stopping your unit before some doors- I know this is not the core, but I guess with some gorgeous graphics engine it would look just marvellous. Anyway, these guys did so amazing game, it's just very good VS best.Verdict:It was long time ago since I was so satisfied with some game. For tactics genre this title has everything, this is how small team stomps most of AAA brands.			"

												* 5 Trooper Classes plus Sniper (Mission Dependent)* 70+ Weapons and Gear Items* Six Campaigns (Perma-death)* 80 Independent Missions* Viewable Replays* Global and Individual Stat Tracking* Cross Platform Import/Export Saves* Mission Generator* Level Editor* Steam Workshop* 43 Achievements* 8 Different Trading Cards* No SympathyDoor Kickers harks back to a time when gamers were thought to be intelligent. A little bit of information is given to the player about gameplay mechanics and the rest is left up to them to figure out through trial and error. This, in part, is why there's no ""do it this way to win"" approach to informing the player. Inspired by the planning stages of Rainbow Six, with a SWAT aesthetic, and turned into a feature length game, it all makes sense. A player must learn to play the game much like they must learn to understand how to deal with the situation in which their troopers find themselves. Or be left to suffer the consequences. Although it's possible to make arrests and to subdue assailants with a taser, that's not where the emphasis lies. The opponents you're dealing with are all presumed to be heavily armed and willing to kill you on site based on the knowledge that they most likely already have. Once you understand that, the gear and equipment options available in-game will make a lot more sense. That is why this game is more comparable to Rainbow Six than Swat 3 or 4. It's not about getting a conviction but dishing out the punishment because the verdict has already been made.I highly recommend this game. But that recommendation entirely depends on the type of gamer you are. This game is for the thinker. Sometimes you'll make a plan that will take a few seconds and so will the mission. Other times, you'll spend a few hours only for the mission to fail. It's not the game's fault, nor is it yours. That's just a harsh reality and simply a matter of learning from such mistakes. If you want mindless satisfaction, are looking for a game that plays itself, or were born yesterday, this is not the game for you. This game is a challenge, your enjoyment will entirely depend on whether or not you'll accept it as such and rise to the occasion. So the question is: do you accept the challenge?			"

												Doorkickers is a 2D, Top Down tactical strategy game with real-time and pause. This title has been on my radar for a very long time and I decided to pick it up during summersale. Now I have finally played it and I have to say that it's great!If you enjoy games like Xcom you will most likely have fun with doorkickers, or if you have an interest in swat games and tactics planning. This game have so many levels and challenges you can complete. Also there's a story, although it felt just like the normal quick games I would say. You can also create your own maps and download others for unlimited fun! Save hostages, kill bad guys and capture wanted criminals. Its intense at times but it's always fun to play!Doorkickers comes with all the neat steam features like achievement, steam cloud, etc. Game runs well and you have a good options menu. You level up your soldiers in game and unlock new classes and weapons.This game is great and I would strongly recommend everyone to at least try it out at some point. This is one of the only good games that came out of early access!			"

												This game is top notch! If you loved the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4, you'll probably love this even more. Fan of RTS and action games, you must give this one a shot. This is basically one of those games where it gets better and better as you get used to the mechanics and unlock new stuff.Door Kickers is a tactical RTS game where you take control of a SWAT team and save the day through hostage rescue missions, bomb defusal missions, VIP escorts and everything else a SWAT-based game should have. The game can be played either by planning everything at the start of a level and watch as the team executes your orders (Rainbow Six style) or by taking control of your units in real-time. You can also do both, since the action can be paused at any time (recommended for starters).PROS+ Tactical SWAT gameplay at its finest. Assign equipment to each unit, plan and execute any way you want; easy to pick up and play.+ Many guns to choose from and different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages.+ Very high replayability: lots of individual and varied missions, campaigns, map editor, random mission generator and great mod support.+ Awesome soundtrack and clean graphics that match the atmosphere of the game.+ Still gets updated with additional free content and bug fixes.CONS- Slightly frustrating at times- Some Workshop mods may be incompatible because of the new updates.Personal rating: 9/10 "

												Pros+solid gameplay+passable sound effects+good level design, and distinguishable terrain. You won't get confused as to what's what. Very useful for this type of game+Ability to plan out the execution of an entire mission, and watch your men methodically carry it out in seconds.+Ai works well at following said plan  +Customization: Lots of gear to choose from and unlock.+Level designer/randomizer: Unlimited replayabilityCons- A little bit pricey for my taste. I prefer $10-15 at most for an indie game of this quality- Still a few bugs to iron out- Can get hard to plan moves for your last member on your team, as the order lines stack up Techical issues-Can't seem to plan my men to swap their weapons twice during the planning phase. I can tell my men at a certain point to pull out their secondaries, but I'm unable to tell them to swap back. I have to wait till they actually change weapons to order them swap back at a later time. Can be annoying when trying to unlock achievements for each level.-Unable to hide other units command lines during planning phase. When you have commands issued for a large amount of soldiers, it looks like pasta all over the place. Can make it very hard to issue orders to the last soldier on your squad. -Sometimes I want to order a certain swat member to throw a flash bang through a door, but a nearby teamate stacked on the door recieves the order instead. The game needs a toggle function for ordering stacked teamates to do something instead of the default choice. -When cancelling a command, it sometimes does not dissapear, making you have to backtrack your soldiers moves a good bit to fix it, or restart them completely.Rating: 8.5/10===========Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Sound effects: 7/10Ai: 9/10Replayability: 10/10 "

												it's pretty obvious that the best way to kill terrorists is by kicking doors down. they get real scared by that stuff. following on from that, door kickers is a game where you kick doors down and then save hostages/clear houses of terrorists. I am being unnecessarily facetious here, it's a really fun game but it's really difficult as well. if you like XCOM and stuff then you'll enjoy this game. also this game is better than real life because my mum and dad only let me open and close doors, not kick em or blow them up. life sucks huh.

												I got this game as a birthday present from a distant friend. He knew my passion for strategy and planning.It is hard to add to the many other positive reviews. On the plus side, this game is well-thought, simple, and yet it allows for various degrees of sophistication. In particular, I like the opportunity to try different gaming styles (planner, aggressive, solo, non-lethal, etc.). This adds to a high degree of replayability, with achievements that will satisfy all the min-maxers around the globe. Another praiseworthy feature is the possibilty to download further content, both official and user-generated.On the aesthetic side, scenarios are pleasing to the eye and graphics are detailed without overworking the engine (as it is expected in such 2D map games).I didn't really like the star system, becaue it rewards timekeepers over perfectionists. Moreover, it makes it very easy to access powerful gear very early in the game, but apparently that's also true for real life: some of the most effective guns in the world are not the most expensive, and have been around for ages. Random mission generator is a bit boring, though, and this game's strength are the campaign and official missions, each of them with their own peculiarity (storming the embassy, freeing a cruise ship, boarding a plane, etc.). In my version of the game I miss a ""shuffle"" button for randomly generated maps: this means I have to enter and exit the menu to generate new keys and new scenarios. Finally, although background audio effects are interesting at first, they become repetitive quite soon.Overall, my judgement is more than positive, because the pros clearly outweight the few cons of the game. My congratulations to all developers, artist, and producers for such a neat product. Also, a big thank you to Texisthelex for having sent me this gift.			"

								This game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick. The gameplay is smooth and the actions percise. This game is a great way to teach people to watch their sectors at all times and to stay alert. Using real world tactics in this game does actually benefit and it makes you look even more badass in the replays. Even in alpha I find this addictive and fun and the editor and generator is a great way to extend replayability. Keep up the good work devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a great game and has the makings of a great CQB training aid.  The survival of your officers is heavily based on your ability to control your tactical angles.  Real tactics, techniques, and procedures work (for the most part).  As an added bonus, you can create videos of your playthroughs, which you can then edit and use it to help train your team, whether it be a video game clan, paintball, airsoft, or even actual military and law enforcement.  By having a clear display of each officer's field of view, you can accurately portray sectors of fire and emphasize an understanding of the importance of angles.  Add to this that you can create your own levels with nothing more than some photo editing software, and you have the ability to create any training aid or game level you wish, complex or simple.Currently, this game is in Alpha.   Right now, the game has a feel of many Android or Apple games, with a bunch of sequentially harder scenarios that you attempt to earn three stars on.  Time is the primary factor for achieving the three stars, which is somewhat counter to how a SWAT team actually acts.  Slow and safe is often preferred to fast and loose.  Things have gotten a bit deeper as the game has progressed through its Alpha stage, with the addition of different classes, levels of armor, rank progression of your officers, and training unlocks.  Updates have come at a very steady pace, and have consistantly added new great features that make me happy I bought the game.This game can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.  Do you want to intricately plan out your entire team's movement with go codes and then press play and see what happens?  Or do you want to work through the scenario as it plays out, pausing and unpausing to make changes on the fly or control an officer's field of fire directly?  Either way works, and it's up to you.This game is so much fun.  You can run through a quick scenario to get your fix, or you can try for the best score on a hard level for hours.  With new scenarios being added constantly by the community, and the ability to create random missions from any map, you have an endless amount of replay value.			"

YouTube™ Video: Door Kickers Review 

			Views: 1,101		

			We take a look at the tactical real time strategy game Door Kickers. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Door Kickers is a very interesting top down tactical real time strategy game where you control a team of SWAT agents with the task of eliminating groups of terrorists who are held up in a variety of increasingly difficult and hostile scenarios. The game offers a large amount of depth and content with fully customizable SWAT team, weapons, gear, and classes. The game shines in the planning stage where you are put in control of laying out the exact movements and actions of each SWAT agent, choose whether to go in guns blazing and blast down the door, or take a more stealthy approach and use spy cams to monitor your enemy’s movements before entering. You can take as many or as few times as you wish to pause the game on the fly mid action and adjust your plans to adapt to the hectic battlefield that unfolds as your agents press forward into the enemies territory; however, by far the most satisfying and rewarding part of the game is when you preplan and successfully defeat all the enemies in single attempt without pausing to adjust. The game has a very satisfying level of difficulty that will definitely force you to retry missions multiple times until you learn from your mistakes, which at times may feel frustrating due to the varying random difficulty spikes that you will encounter, but this only adds more to the level of satisfaction you will feel when you successfully complete the mission. Upon completion of a mission you are scored by a 3 star system that varies based on your performance, the stars you earn are then used as the currency to upgrade your gear and purchase new weapons. The game features a ton of playable content, offering tons of levels to play in single player, campaign, and both a level and mission editor to create your own levels and share them via Steam Workshop Mods. The game offers an incredibly high amount of content and depth with a very high replay-ability value, the game is truly an indie gem that has done an excellent job at captivating the feel from the Rainbow Six series and bringing it to 2014. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												A hostage crisis in the suburbs. The troopers move up to the entrance cautiously, wary of potential threats in the vicinity.You stack up against the door. Your teammate moves to the front, his Kimber drawn. You have the advantage of marksmanship, training and skill and you both know it. But you are still up against many.You take a deep breath and blast off the door handle with your Mossberg. the door swings open and your teammate fires 3 well placed shots. A body hits the ground.""THE COPS ARE HERE"" rings down the hallway and you hear the mulitple doors opening and closing.Your heart pounds furiously.No time or chance to back down, and you charge into the lion's den, sending the first hostile you see down with a single blast of 00.Simply put, this game is like Rainbow Six from a real-time-strategy/top-down perspective, where you control SWAT troopers as they conduct raids against criminals and terrorists.Each game is highly lethal, and most demand a certain time limit to be met, most of which happens to be a minute or two. Every move you take requires very careful planning.Is there a blind spot unaccounted for?Is there someone covering me?Is someone's line of sight blocked by another, possibly endangering both?Your operators are well trained and will easily take down multiple hostiles at once, but they aren't God. A single fatal mistake in planning or an unprecendented move by a hostile will more often than not lead to their swift and violent demise, whether it's a burst of MAC-10 fire from the side or single 7.62mm round from a AK-47.In a game where every second counts you have to get used to controlling every operator at any point in time. Watching flanks, breaching rooms, using tactical manoeuvres to clear, all have to be done in a single fluid motion. On drug busting operations prepare to launch a 6 man offensive on an entire port, where you have to simultaneously control all your fireteams and keep them alive, and secure the evidence before the cartel gets a chance to destroy it.Your classes are clearly defined. The Pointman, who is extremely mobile and deadly in tight spaces but will easily get swamped by numbers. The Assault, who can both be a close quarter fire-hose with a submachine gun for laying accurate and well controlled bursts or a mid-range specialist with an assault rifle, dishing out accurate semi automatic fire that stops people in their tracks, but lose your close range mobility and versatility.The Breacher who can blast doors open and engage multiple enemies with buckshot but quickly get outgunned at mid-ranges and risk collateral damage from the pellet spread.The Stealth who are good mid range specialists who will put hostiles to sleep silently but will lose their edge in closer engagements.The Shield who can block most incoming shots but can only use a pistol and may not have the mobility in close spaces or the accuracy for long escort missions.Skill is required to make the best out of every trooper you train for every situation and make sure everyone comes out alive.You spend more time planning alone than executing, and you will get frustrated sometimes from the frequent restarting but every completed mission grants a never-ending sense of pride.PROS:1. Excellent AI. Troopers are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will react to defend themselves and hostiles will actively flank and investigate sources of noise.2. Tight map design that pose a challenge to players3. Customisation is well-controlled and delivered with a clear focus on maximising the trooper's usability on the field over the simple mindless pimp-your-gun-to-be-special attachment chucking we see in many other games4. Price. I got this on sale for a measly 3 bucks and it's been worth every penny.5. Comprehensive controls and a decent How-to guide for quickly jumping in.6. Minimalistic UI that tells you what you need and what you need alone and great graphics.7. Immersive atmosphere that gets your heart pumping every time a raid is initiated and keeps you coming back for more.8. A decent bare-bones progression system that rewards you with better troop quality for future raids but doesn't go as far as to become a grindfest.9. As if the above aren't enough there is workshop content with plenty of diversity. Want a new scenario? Try a pirate ship raid. Want to satisfy your gun fetish? Get mods that increase the number of weapons available at your disposal.CONS:1. An unforgiving currency (star) system that renders you in a tight spot if you make a costly mistake in your investment, where you potentially lose the ability to progress yet are unable to earn more to buy the gear you need.

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a Indie, Simulation, and Strategy game developed by the folks over at Killhouse Games. It was added to steam on September 3rd, 2013. The game features a mix of real time strategy with a tactical stop and go pause mode that allows you to analyze situations, and make your plans for each map. There is a small amount of customization in the current build of the game but that is simply due to the early access nature of the game. The gameplay is pretty great, however it can be rage inducing at times. The main idea is to kill the bad guys and have at least one of your own team mates left standing at the end. In some cases there are hostages to rescue which can put a timer on the level. All the levels can be completed in a small time window . Ultimately you want to play a level as fast as possible with little to no casualties. The game is a early access game and thus has many features missing. With that said the game is great as it is right now. Of course a few flaws that I’m not sure are bugs or overlooked design. For example there are times when I open a door and my character is looking directly at a person and will mow them and 3 other people down without being shot. Then there are times where the same guy will open the door and sing love songs to the enemies and thus getting domed (shot in the mother♥♥♥♥ing skull). It feels like r.n.g and less bug but who am I to say. This was the only real issue I had with the game. Especialy on the one level at the beach where I had one guy left, and there was one enemy left. My guy opens the door to the bathroom and both the ai and my character stand their in a stand off for about fifteen seconds before the ai shoots my guy in the face…..The levels can be played in many ways, the best is just to find a style that suits you. For most of my levels I set a path for my guys to run and it worked. I very rarely had to pause the game after my initial plan. However if you want you can breach doors. After breaching a room, you can pause the room to setup what to do next. The breaching, and or DOOR KICKING is the core of the game. You have several ways to breach. You can just kick a door in and hope your guys don’t get blasted before they can see through the door. You can also breach with a flashbang where they open a door and throw a flashbang in. Again however if your guy is standing directly infront of the door you risk getting shot and killed so it is best to do it from the side. Then there is the breaching charge where you setup a charge on the door and can detonate it. This stuns most of the people in the room giving you an advantage. You can also use a snake cam to see under the doors. The game has no multiplayer but the developers say it MIGHT come later. The game also has a mission editor , however I did not play around with that yet. It does mean the game will have many mods and games with mods are always better because of it! The game as single player is a lot of fun and I definitely suggest anyone who likes tactical strategy games to make this purchase. The game is worth every god damn dime. As far as early access games go this is one of the better ones on steam. I will of course do a re-review of the game upon full release of the game. You want a score don’t you? WELL F&CK YOU! … No seriously here is my score for the early access of Door Kickers. Door Kickers gets a Drastik Measure 8.2 (82)			"

												Started playing Nov 2015.Easy to pick-up and play, very difficult to master. I was not expecting so many missions and so many weapon choices, its very impressive. Its fun taking different approaches to missions and the good kind of trail & error towards finishing each level. Eventually you may become good enough to beat any level in just the planning stage, before it has played out in real time. Its a great accomplishment.Some missions require a bit of luck, and occasionally death/failure feels cheap. But you can always make your own missions if you get sick of the hundreds of dev made levels and campaigns.			"

												I'll admit, I haven't gotten very far, but the bit of it I did play was exceptionally good for what its supposed to be. The controls do seem to be a bit difficult to master, but at least for the simple mechanics, you do catch on quickly.The action is quite tactical, no nonsense. I definitely get the feeling that there is an incredible amount of depth in the game, and already I'm looking forward to playing again.The built in mod-ability and mission generation, combined with the fact that the game is built around its solid mechanics (rather than any sort of linear narrative) seems to ensure that the ""dollars spent"":""hours of fun"" ratio is quite favorable.

 < Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes > A tactical strategy game that you can play in 2 modes, Real-Time or Planning Mode ( Kinda like transistor ) and kicking doors never been so funThe game has a very large set of levels and its possibly endless, Around 80+ levels on Single Missions, And Also a lot of levels On campaign mode, And a lot of community created maps (Via level editor) And Theres also a Random Mission Generator which is really cool!.you choose the map size the scenario and the difficulty, so yeah I meant it when I said Endless...But the fun does not last that long well it depends on your taste, gonna get to this in a moment.You can customize every Swat member of yours, changing their gear and what not, Changing from assaulter to breacher and stealth or point-man Pistols, or pistols+rifles or shotguns or swat shield...etc.Fun to use equipment's, such as a spy-cam to peak through a door and you move it left or right, or a breaching charge to plant on a door and blow it up to knockdown/kill enemies, And of course flash bangs, Stingers and more.On each level you get stars which you can use to unlock more Equipment's , Stronger/heavier shields or armors or weapons just an example.I really like the game control, You can assign your units to ( A(alpha) B(Beta) C(Charlie) D(Delta) ) And assign plans to each which they will execute after you press the assigned button on UI or keyboard, Really good to coordinate your unit movements ( Shields first, snipers last) and execute the perfect plan which takes some serious thinking.At some levels you also get a sniper that auto-locks on targets on your sight, You can press Tab to order him to switch to another target and S to take the shot.The enemy responds are pretty clever, they don't just mess around, you'd usually need to flashbang them or flank them or use any method to distract them to avoid allied losses.The game music is very good and gives you the mood to focus on your plans, or pumps you up to go break sh*t and kill everyone.Game levels are pretty great, Although there are a lot of levels you don't see them getting repeated.Game difficulty is pretty hard, And keeps getting harder as you go on.Single Mission Mode, Is a set of 80+ levels that you play each with its mission and different level layout, You could skip the first ones and jump to the last.Campaign mode, Has no story its just a set of levels that you keep on playing with limited swat units, when you finish a level with some causalities they don't come back in the next level so you have to be careful and usually restart when they die, Around 5 Campaigns each is about 4 to 9 Levels, with completely different layouts, It also has the caption ( More to come ) so thats good I guess, they want to add more.Leveling up your squad to the next level gets you access to the next Class ( Which I mentioned earlier the Stealth or Breacher .. etc ) Apparently there are (Doctrines) points that you get awarded by leveling up your squad level, And use them in a Skill-Tree to give you more abilities and accuracy and more.Of-course you level up by receiving the exp award at the end of every level.The game has a lot of achievements, At first they are easy to obtain but the later ones are pure hell this is fun for grinders.Level editor is easy to use, And power it with your imagination, Create a hostage rescue, Annihilation, DrugBust, Arrest, Robbery, Vip Secure, Stop the execution And of-course Defuse the bomb.2 mods that already exists that adds some levels and a few stuff ( Christmas mod, Template mod )  The Other SideSo now after all the good has been said let me tell you about the other side.Although the game is really good it has its own fair share of cons.Sometimes my units becomes dull and throws the bomb although I specifically stopped the action by pressing the delete icon, and sometimes they also become very slow to react when an enemy appear that i'v been waiting for, takes them time to take the shot and sometimes they'd kill my units before they even reacted to seeing them, I don't know if this is how the game wants it to be just saying.I really dislike it when a unit throws a Bomb it has to wait before making a move, I understand that's how it works in reality but most of the time the delay backfires because it reaches them after the effect of the Flash-bang wore off, and it goes there to die.Some levels are fairly hard and others are insanely unfair and frustrating, reach the point where you just keep on doing it again and again and again and going full-throttle until your units mans up and takes the shot accurately and miraculously you win.Reason why I said ( Apparently there are doctrine points ) Its because I saw it the first time I launched the game but forgotten about it, And the game has no hints or anything to show me or remind me to use it in main-menu, I was missing around my rank and accidentally saw it lol... Which brings me to the next point.Lack of tutorials, I don't mind this but if you are the type that wont go without them just a heads-up (There is a how to play guide)Units becomes stupid when they collide with each other, they just stop and do not perform their next action instead of turning around the unit or object.There is a bugged level in campaign which made it impossible to me to finish the 2nd one ( so I skipped to the next one ) In which a mission where I'm supposed to secure the VIP and bring him back to the safe zone, And usually killing all hostiles gets the job done and leaving no need to get the hostages but this one required it, So I go set next to him so he'd follow me but he never did, Played it around 9 times already and never got to finish it....was incredibly frustrating.LIKE I mentioned at the beginning of the review after a while the game may gets boring depends on your taste.As for me after around 7 hours I started getting really bored, Although the game has a lot of different levels, The feeling stays the same, Be careful and quick to finish the mission blah blah, Gets a bit boring in my own opinion, They should'v made a way to spice it up with more challenges and stuff, Again thats just me, There are people who played this for over 25+ hours and did not complain at all.If you don't want to read all that PROS : 1 - Tactical-type game that requires strategy and thinking, Difficult but fun.2 - A lot of levels to play, And a random mission generator, Campaigns and Community Maps.3 - A lot of Weapons, Utilities (Gadgets) And support gear to unlock.4 - Customizing every unit in every mission to make it best suitable for the current level.5 - A lot of achievements to grind on, Trading cards and Steam-Cloud.6 - Great game music and sound effects, gets that thinking mode of yours pumping.CONS : 1 - Sometimes it gets kinda frustrating on how some levels are ridiculously difficult compared to later ones.2 - A few clunkiness in character movements colliding with each other and slow reactions in some cases.3 - A few bugs I found on certain levels which made some impossible to finish and the rest just 10 times harder.Also something I really liked about the game.The terrorists are not portrayed as Arabs, They always make terrorists in video games to look and sound like Arabs *cough*Cs*Cough* and more games ... It frustrates me makes me feel discriminated against sometimes although i love those games, BUT it was really refreshing and nice to see a game that made a different approach.TL;DRA game for the tactical shooter fans, definitely worth its full price, Hard as HELL and takes some LONG ♥♥♥ time to complete, and even longer to 100%, And to get all the level ups and unlock everything, i'd say 30+ hours.Very fun game Although this review might not show it but I enjoyed it a lot 8/10			"

												This is strategy at its core! The tactical options are amazing while the controls are kept fairly simple as opposed to, say, Frozen Synapse. I think it cuts all the necessary clutter for this to be on of the best tactical games of recent times, and the power you feel while your masterplan unfolds is tremendous. Fan of any tactical games, Rainbow Sixes, SWATs or the like? Play this!			"

												Best tactics in 2014 for a reason. Recommended and gifted by a ""friend"" of mine (Nanamil) in return for all my collected Friendship tokens. It's a simple but challenging game from the topdown perspective in wich you take the role of a squad leader guiding a good amount of S.W.A.T's through an almost endless amount of levels (thanks to Steam's Workshop)- each one different in artstyle, size, and possible ways to accomplish the goal.""But whats the goal?"" you might ask now and I dont even feel ashamed saying that its cliche Counter -Terrorist missions such as bomb defusal, hostage rescuing, eliminating all hostiles etc... But in this game it feels more satisfying than in most games that tried to be tactical or stealth in the past few years (no matter if Topdown, Fps, Third-person ) and thats why I can highly recommend it to a wide range of gamers...those who love Real-Time-Strategy but also those who love stealth or action in general. Its some of the best games for a quick casual ""turn-your-head-off"" after work / school and kills all the boredom. And for me it's just even more motivation that most achievments are more of rewards for actually good playing rather than grinding and more grinding and more grinding... Since I believe this game could run on ANY PC out there you dont need to worry about your Rig...just enjoy it if you like ~5 bucks for many hours of fun seems like a good deal, eh? :P "

												Cops & Robbers is one of the all-time classic games of make-believe; the eternal battle between good and evil, played out in every playground for generations. And it doesn't stop there – we grow up, but the primal attraction of that conflict never leaves us, and we replace pointed fingers and 'pew pew' noises with films, books, and video games.Door Kickers is one of those video games. Developed by KillHouse Games, its top-down tactics and emphasis on planning invite comparisons to those games that have best captured the sense of modern day Cops & Robbers; the SWAT series, and Rainbow Six, before Vegas went and ruined everything. It's been in Early Access for quite a while, but has seen a great deal of community feedback and development as a result. Now that it's reached full release status, how does it hold up against its peers?Be under no illusions – this is no arcade-style run & gun. Door Kickers lets you plan an entire mission in advance and, once the action gets going, you have free use of the pause feature to adjust things on-the-fly. Don't think this makes things easy though – this is a brutally difficult game from the very start, and will not tolerate the impatient or imprecise. You may be in command of a highly-trained squad of police officers, but you're never more than one forgotten corner, or one misplaced order away from an abrupt, messy death, and a mission restart. This is a game that teaches the player with quick but violent lessons; assume there are enemies everywhere, move cautiously using cover, and always, always check those corners.Things aren't helped by the often questionable AI of your officers. I often found them spotting an enemy, but then ignoring them – sometimes turning their backs on them entirely, and necessitating my manual intervention to force them to engage. This isn't a novel problem; in Frozen Synapse, if you want a unit to forget about enemies and just hustle, you must specifically order that unit to ignore threats. Here, though, you must specify if you want an officer to wait until there are no living enemies. When gun-toting criminals can ruin your day in seconds, it just feels like the wrong way around.When it does go right, though, it's a fantastic experience; an orgy of meticulously-executed violence, taking place in mere seconds. I rarely make use of replay features in games, but here I found myself re-watching successful missions just to bask in the glory of the perfect plan.Rather than giving you a random bunch of men for each mission, Door Kickers gives you a permanent squad, with each officer earning their own experience points. Customisation is surprisingly comprehensive, allowing you to change the name, appearance, and loadout of each member of the team. Initially, the selection of equipment is limited, but you can unlock more by playing through missions and earning points. Many of the missions, especially later ones, are simply too difficult without equipment upgrades, so there's a strong incentive to perfect the early scenarios and gear up as much as possible. Successful missions also earn 'doctrine points,' which you can spend on skill upgrades which apply to everyone in your team – these cover things like accuracy improvements, and new tactics. Sadly, while doctrine points can be re-specced, there's no way to 'buy back' points spent on equipment. This is especially frustrating given that grinding missions does not earn you more points – there are a maximum of 3 points to be earned, total, in any scenario. If you buy some gear and then realise you need something else for a later mission, you're stuffed.Missions are split into three campaigns and a huge selection of standalone scenarios. In practice, the campaigns are little more than several missions strung together, offering no real plot, but with the added difficulty of dead officers staying dead for the duration of the campaign, so you'll want to play it safe with your best troopers.The missions themselves vary from basic room-to-room clearing, through hostage-rescue or bomb-defusal scenarios, to the excellent drug busts, in which you must collect evidence while enemies scramble to destroy it. There's also a competent random mission generator, and a robust level editor with Steam Workshop support, in case you exhaust the 100+ levels on offer, so replayability is a big draw.Once you get into a mission, the big draw of Door Kickers is the planning interface. A much-loved feature of classic tactical games, it allows you to plan – in theory – an entire mission in advance. Then it's just a matter of hitting play and watching your squad do the dirty work. In practice, once you're past the first two or three missions, it's almost impossible to do the whole thing in one go if you want to prevent the wholesale slaughter of your hapless officers. In particular, it's impossible to use the 'magic wand' (a camera on a stick) in an automated plan, since it requires manual control to scan a room – never mind the fact that you inexplicably can't use it to peek around corners.Between the enjoyable gameplay, appealing visuals, and the return of mission planning, it's difficult not to recommend Door Kickers to anyone with enough patience to tolerate the difficulty curve.

												In the search for the ideal top-down tactical shooter, I've tried Hotline Miami (too twitchy), Forzen Synapse (too random), Monaco (close, but too gimmicky), and recent XCOMs (on the abstract side). None of them quite scratch the itch created by Julian Gollop games. Until Door Kickers.The heart of the game is a series of buildings your SWAT team must clear of bad guys. Sometimes there's another objective such rescuing hostages or collecting evidence before the suspects can destroy it. These require various tactics and give the game flavor. But the core remains moving from one room to the next shooting people who are trying to shoot you.Every character possesses some level of agency. Enemies (AKA, tangos) respond to sounds and other cues in reasonable ways. For instance, they might turn to face the door your pointman is forcing. Alternatively, they might decide to shoot the hostages or destroy the evidence. Your operators might ignore orders in order to respond to immediate threats. In fact, you don't order them to fire at all; you tell them where to go and they just take care of business.As a result, you can set up a plan at the start of a level and let the game play itself. I know that sounds boring, but it really isn't. Plans involve dozens of little decisions, such as how to breach a door, where to toss a flashbang, when to turn to check a hallway and so on. You can charge though most levels with a lone shooter (there are achievements for it) or carefully coordinate a full team with go signals. If your plan works, the payoff is a minute or two of perfectly choreographed violence.Truthfully, however, perfect planning doesn't happen the first time around. More often I need to adjust because I failed check a blind spot or I blundered into shotgun crossfire. Plans can be redrawn on the fly or you can pause the action to give yourself time to think. Immediately after completion of a level, I find myself restarting it so that I can fine tune the plan.There is an overarching game of unlocking tactics, roles and armament. Faster times unlock up to three stars for buying new guns, body armor and equipment. Officers earn experience points which open up new roles (assaulter, breacher, stealth and shield) and tactics. Missions can technically be played in any order, but the effect of the leveling system is to gate off more difficult levels. Skipping missions or forgetting to upgrade increases the challenge quickly.On the other hand, once you have a stronger team, it's rewarding to go back to earlier levels and get an improved result. In addition, campaigns are unlocked once your squad levels up to a certain point. However, don't think of campaigns as stories since they are just missions strung together to force you to pay the consequences for deaths and injuries. I'd complain campaigns are too shallow if I weren't excited to play new maps.Not that there's any lack of maps. In addition to 84 single missions and 6 campaigns, there are user-created missions for download and a map generator. These mean you will never need to play the same mission over again, but they also highlight the skill of official level designers. Levels designed by other users are wildly inconstant in challenge and quality. The generated levels can be anywhere from boring to near impossible depending on which settings you use and how the random number generator rolls.In the final analysis, Door Kickers provides copious amounts of tactical decision making with simple controls and plenty of chrome.

One of the best real-time tactics games on Steam.Having finished all of the single missions and all of the campaigns, both in Normal and in Iron Man, I believe I'm in a position to write a few things about this game. I don't usually write Steam reviews, but Door Kickers is a special game that deserves recommendation. As someone who is very interested in tactical gaming, the top-down tactics offered by this game are very enjoyable.The game gives you control over a team of SWAT operators and tasks you with defeating the bad guys and completing missions such as rescuing hostages, arresting a suspect, securing evidence, preventing escape of the suspects or escorting a VIP. There are different ways to play the game, but the way I play it (and I guess the most obvious style of play) is real-time with pause. The way I usually do the missions is like this: I draw actions for my troopers, let them play out those actions, pause, assess the situation and then plan my next move. You can also play the game in 100% real-time or even prepare the entire mission in the planning phase if you want. It's a lot more difficult and challenging to do, but the option is there. There is no 'true' method of playing the game.It's a challenging game. The guns are deadly. That goes both ways. If you don't want any of your troopers to get killed in one or two shots, you better make sure that you watch your sectors and assume that there is danger around every corner. The game mercilessly punishes you for your mistakes, but the rules are fair and if you lose a trooper it's almost always due to your own mistake.Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Door Kickers is the fact that a number of real-life tactics can be applied to it, and that these are often the most effective. The best way to clear a simple room is the way real operators often do it: stack your troopers near the door, open or breach it, throw a flashbang (tip: use them excessively), enter the room, establish points of domination along the nearest wall(s) and let your troopers shoot all of the bad guys in their own respective sector. Take a look at the top-down illustrations in this military field manual[www.globalsecurity.org]. Some of the tactics that are shown in that chapter actually work in Door Kickers. That is an impressive feat, and it highlights the developer's understanding of real-world CQC fights and tactics. Because of this, Door Kickers is arguably one of the more realistic small-scale tactics games there are.It's not without flaws. From time to time, your troopers will make a stupid mistake which may get one of them killed, such as when they accidentally throw a grenade against the wall instead of into the room. And they cannot perform certain basic tasks like leaning and crouching, though that might have been a design decision. But overall, the controls are very fleshed out and the game is very enjoyable to play as is. It allows a certain degree of freedom in how to approach each situation: your stealth approach doesn't work? Kit out your team with harder-hitting assault rifles. Can't prevent a hostage execution in time? Try a different route or be more aggressive. Having a lot of trouble eliminating an armoured tango? Invest in one of the guns that offer better armour penetration. Or just throw more flashbangs. More flashbangs are always good. Some of the equipment that works in certain situations will not work in other situations, and vice-versa. All of the equipment in the game has utility, although some are more useful than others.Pros: Real-world room clearing fundamentals work (at least some of them). Deadly guns; challenging. Different ways to play. Plenty of content: at the time of writing 84 official missions and 6 campaigns, Iron Man mode, a level editor, mod support and fan-made content. Very suitable for short gameplay sessions. Even if you can't finish a mission in time, at least you've learned a few things about that mission, arming you with knowledge for the next time you go in. Good replay value.Cons: Grenades can only be thrown in a horizontal line. You can't throw one over a wall or a vehicle. Lack of crouch makes it impossible to present a smaller target or move underneath a window without being spotted. Again, may be a design decision. Some of the weapon stats do not always give the player a clear understanding of the weapon's performance.Door Kickers 2 is currently in development, but the first game is still very much worth buying and playing. If you're looking for a good top-down tactics game, look no further.			"

												Do you really like tactical games? This is the game for you. Take control of a SWAT team and take them through various police scenarios such as hostage rescues, imminent hostage executions, drug raids, arrest warrants, and VIP escorts. There are many weapons that have their own individual stats as well as a variety of different equipment from different types of kevlar vests that protect more or less from different angles (front, rear, and sides), to different types of grenades (flashbangs, stun grenades). There's other ways of breaching such as using breaching charges, shotguns, bolt cutters, and much more. This game reminds me of the old Rainbow Six games and the SWAT games as well.			"

												One of the best games i've played in a long time, will be perfect for those nostalgic about the old SWAT games. While being highly addictive, its mechanics are extremely simple and easy to understand. Yet there lies a great challenge in executing them flawlessly, and succeding with your objectives without losing any of your men.Lots of content in it in form of single missions, campaigns, mod support and mission generator, so there's essentially an endless amounts of mission to go on. There's also some basic customization to get you a bit emotionally attached to your men (and women). However it seems that there are no female voices, so females will report in with male voices. No mp or coop yet, but I think they are planning to add that after phone versions release.Sidenote: If you use steam overlay a lot keep in mind that the shift key locks the path, so after you've been to the overlay press shift once to make the controls normal again.

Early Access Review
								REVERSE WARNING: This is actually the only Early Access game that I bought without regretting it later.Door Kickers is a solid top-down 2D tactical SWAT strategy / tactical / shooter title. You draw your troopers' paths with your mouse, place waypoints and commands and then watch the action unfold according to your plan. There is also the option to pause the action in real-time and switch orders on the fly. The game went through many iterations and improvements during early access, both frequent and meaningful in content and changes / fixes.The biggest draws of the game (apart from the obvious - existing in a great genre that is virtually abandoned) is the fact that it has Steam Workshop support and an integrated level editor allowing for infinite content. When the core gameplay mechanics are as polished and as fun, even simple user-made maps can add tons of replayability to a game that is already quite large in beta form.I bought this game in December 2013 and watched it blossom into the beautiful thing it is today, a couple of months before its final release. I recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who is interested in the genre.			"

												This game has been on my wishlist for two holiday sales. Since I usually don't buy any ""wargames"" or straight up shooters I was hesitant to buy it, but finally gave in, when it was 50% off, thinking what's there to loose with the steam refund system?To my astonishment, it's a ""simple"" strategy game and that's just up my alley. Plan your way in with your squad, level them up, get new equipment and defuse dangerous situations: rescue hostages, defuse bombs, kill hostiles, save the day.The game itselfs has a huge amount of levels out of the box and with a superb workshop integration can be expanded indefinitely by community made levels and items. It's also really, really easy to make your own maps as a level editor is already integrated int the game. If you don't want to make anything too fancy (new texture, objects, round rooms) you'll be extremely happy with the in-game options for designing new levels.It really is a steal for any price (if you're looking at this review and the game is also 50% off, don't hesitate and just get it!)Here's the checklist of what you can expect:PROs:+ huge amount of levels+ great replayability (play with different squad members, play with different equipment, play from different entry-zones...)+ adequate learning-curve (easy levels to get used to the mechanics)+ ability to play any level at any chosen time (no unlocking levels, everything is available right from the start, though not every level is a good idea to play right away)+ controls are great with and uncluttered and handy interface+ squad members can be renamed and given their own design+ great steam workshop integration+ integrated level editor+ price for what you get is absolutely adequate+ replay ability from almost any starting point within a levelCONs:- campaign mode needs better warning for what happens to killed squad members (once you've figured it out though, you'll remember forever)- not all stats on items are relevant when equippedOverall: 8/10			"

												It's a shame I didn't reviewed this game earlier, cause Door Kickers definitely should be recommended :)About year ago(30.Sep.2013) I got Door Kickers as Early Access game and then I wrote:""Even for Alpha/Early Access Door Kickers looks so promising and fun.What game lacks for now(from my point of view) - non-lethal weapons, handcuffing and negotiating, by ""negotiating"" I mean - trying to force suspects to surrender and if something goes wrong you're free to shoot.In SWAT-2 before entry you have to negotiate with suspects by ""throwing phone"" or calling to the building directly - this gave you time to plan your entry or even trade out hostages.After that you could go dynamic or stealth according to situation, but all time from start to the end you advancing - slow or fast.But the main feature was that all time you was trying to take all suspects alive, save hostages and try to avoid losing officers.If you will add this-like flavor(no need to copy, just give it flavor as you see it), damn I promise that I'll buy second copy @ Steam :D""After a year of development, Dev  Team added all these features, except ""negotiating"", - but that's ok for me. Without this feature Door Kickers plays like R6 and that's not bad at all.Besides, they have added lot of new features:New modes like ""Drug busting"", ""Hostage Rescue"" and etc.Tons of maps.Scenario Editor.Video Export.Three amazing campaigns.Lot of toys for your Good Guys Team.Sniper Assist Workshop intergrationAnd many, many more... :)Anyway, would definetly recommend Door Kickers for anyone who played and liked Rainbow 6(R6: Rogue Spear and R6: Raven Shield) and/or SWAT 2, 3 & 4.

								Overall the game is solid. It has a lot of potential to be a great game in the long run. The dev's put a lot of attention into it, and there are frequent updates. It's one of the ""good"" early access game on steam.The only thing I would hope to see in the future is a better tutorial system for new players, and more detailed options within  the menus.9/10			"

												So, to begin, I really wanted to like this game from the offset. I love Frozen Synapse and the idea of tactical, top down, squad shooters. I dived in with high expectations from all the praise I saw. The result of this endeavor was to be disappointed more than I have been in a long time by a game. I will say now - the game is solid enough. However, I encountered certain aspects of the gameplay that just broke it for me. Primarily, the lack of any form of viable introduction or tutorial. I know it has some moving pictures and whatnot, but all that it covers is simple enough to figure out on your own. There is no explanation for how to time entries into a room with a flashbang properly, no explanation why equipping weapons to some of the troops just outright doesnt work. The secondary problems are... well... mentioned above. It is a massive hassle to control the squad. There are no elegant mechanics like in Frozen Synapse that allow for a time delay or no-aim movement. It also makes control difficult due to bulky command images that cross over and make clicking on them a chore. A lack of any explanation as to why upgrading your soldiers abilities doesnt seem to transfer into the tactical game also makes the game frustrating. In short, bar the issues above, the game is spot on. Animation, sound, idea, everything. It is just a crying shame that actually playing it felt like work rather than enjoyment. Sadly I didnt enjoy the game at all and wanted to just make sure that the reason is out there.			"

												Door Kickers is a top down, tactical, strategy, shooter, hybrid developed by Killhouse Games. The core gameplay of Door Kickers is controlling a squad of trained SWAT team members as you clear out various locations, ranging from drug dens to warehouse's. The player can pause the game and enter planing mode. In this mode the player and set where their team will move and face to cover every angle. In this mode the player can also prep their squad to breach doors, throw grenades and set various other orders. Once the player resumes time the team will do the actions in real-time, the squad can also be controlled in real-time. The story comes from the games campaigns. Each campaign has permadeath for the squad members, so if a squad member dies in the first mission, they will not be available for any other mission, unless the first mission is restarted. Multiple campaigns with different difficulties, lengths and missions add a fair amount of replay value to the game. Campaigns, however, are locked until the player reaches a high enough profile level. Door Kickers also comes with single missions, some being training missions but most being more challenging. A random mission generator is also available. The player can choose the size of the map and how difficult it is, adding even more replay value. Door Kickers has various classes to be unlocked, from shields to breacher's, all with their own tools, weapons, and customizable names. There are well over 100 weapons and tools for the various classes. Players can complete missions any way they see fit, charging in with assault rifles and shields or stealthy with suppressed submachine guns. Players have complete control of how they execute a mission. Door Kickers does a fair amount right: Has a large variety of guns and classesHas great replay value from various maps and game modesAddictive Fantastic sound designThe art style fits wellDoor Kickers does a few things wrong: The player must unlock the campaignThe guns can be expensive to unlockDoesn't keep the player interested over timeCan be to easy/hard based on skill levelSurprisingly hard to remain stealthyOverall Door kickers is a solid title. With a price tag of $21.99CND, it is a bit pricy for someone who doesn't commonly enjoy this genre of game. If Door Kickers goes on sale, pick it up and try it out, it's a great deal of fun and great for killing some time. Have a good one ~Doc			"

												i was watching some youtube videos and there was this video with the title ""Door Kickers , Suits and Ski masks"" ( Bluedrake's channel ),i watched the video,i thought the game looked cool and ok but i wasn't sure if i should get the it or not...i bought the game during the last sale and it's fantastic,this is one of those games that you have to actually play to realize how good it is,you can read reviews,watch gameplay videos,etc,etc but you'll never get how good it is unless you play it!at first the game starts with really simple and easy missions but as you progress missions keep getting harder and longer and eventually our tactical shooter turns into a puzzle game :| it will get to the point where you have to actually make plans for your every single action,and with each mistake you're risking losing your troops or failing the mission....i'm only half way through the third campaign but the game has already gotten so intense that i actually pause the game,check behind every single door and i think for a few minute trying to make 1 single but successful plan (never works and i end up restarting the level after 10 minutes xD )we're looking at a top-down tactical shooter that despise it's simple mechanics is insanely challenging and fun to play,it's really addictive too,i couldn't stop playing after finishing the first few missions.one of the best indie games that has been released recently with awesome Developers behind it,they update their game frequently with new content and they definitely deserve more attention and support...

												""I love it when a plan comes together!""A mix of Rainbow Six, Swat and Frozen Synapse.I bought this on a hunch, and I was not disappointed.I did not think I would spend this many hours in a game with such simple mechanic.I discovered how challenging and complex it actually is.How satisfying it is when you watch your teams breach and clear rooms with stunning efficiency, and how mad you get when the bad guys put a bullet in one of your operators because you told him to watch the wrong corner.I told you it was more complex than I thought, right?On some of the bigger maps it can sometimes get confusing when your operators movement-lines you draw on the ground get too close to each other. This causes you to adjust the wrong operator sometimes and can be really annoying.I find myself wishing for a feature to temporary hide specific operators lines, so you can adjust that single operator that covers the wrong door in the tangled mess of lines going everywhere.

Early Access Review
								Executing a perfect hostage rescue with simultaneous door breaches and flashbangs and a synchronized sniper shot through the window feels good. It doesn't even require crazy APM skills!This is a very enjoyable squad tactics singleplayer game, real time with pause for orders. It's like Swat and early Rainbow Sixes combined with Frozen Synapse with a bit of Xcom-like squad development and permadeath. Missions are quick and intensive deathpuzzles with randomized parts and there's already a pretty well functioning random mission generator that's probably going to get even better. The top-down 2D style is neat looking while functional and the environments are nicely detailed.Currently there's about 70 normal (not randomly generated) missions so it's got lots of content. It's already felt like a complete product in alpha and beta so I find it impossible that it would become worse as the development approaches 1.0 and more features are put in. Really good for those 15-minute lunch break-style playing timeslots.			"

Everything works smoothly and as expected and there is more content than I could have imagined.  I'm not even done with all the single player missions (NOT INCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN), never mind having 3 stars on all of them.  If you're a fan of top down tactics, you can't go wrong with this game.  Pros:Workshop support for extra nostalgia addonsControlsArtContent QuantityContent QualityCons:I can't make a Shield Trooper and another trooper go at the same pace automatically, instead the guy behind winds up walking ahead of the shield so then he gets shot in the face a lot.

Solid tactical gameplay with a great feel to it.The gameplay is divided into two parts, the planning phase and execution phase. The planning allows you to set up waypoints and stops using radio commands. Once in the execution phase you can watch your plan unfold or at any moment take direct control of your men. Add to that troop customization, gadgets, classes and squad perks, and you've got an enjoyable experience at hand.To me the game comes across as polished and well made. I enjoy the graphical style and the sound and atmosphere is good. The big challenge lies in creating a plan that'll allow you to sit back and just watch the execution phase. Difficult, but very satisfying when it works.			"

												A fun little top-down single-player room clearing game. You usually control a small team, eventually composed of various classes, with a number of tools. You can make elaborate plans and/or clear in real time. Lots of workshop maps. If it's too easy, you can set various challenges for yourself, like tasing and arresting wherever possible instead of shooting, or doing the campaigns with permadeath on for your team members. Seems to be updated periodically. You can pause whenever and leave where you left off, nice when just taking a quick break.TL;DR: It's groovy.			"

												Pause. Plan. Execute.The concept is pretty simple to pick up, but difficult to master.  There is nothing more satisfying, however, than watching a plan that you've spent time carefully fine tuning and perfecting to flawlessly be carried out by a squad of 8 who proceed to drop bad guys like its the new fad, save hostages, and defuse bombs; all of which occurs in a matter of seconds.There are 3 campaigns, close to a hundred single missions, and an in-game map editor to create your own missions.  Lastly, my favorite, a scenario generator in which you chose the size of the map and the amount of resistance you're ready to throat punch and the game generates a mission for you.  All of this leads to a lot of replayability.Also included, is a progression and load out system that allows you to customize every member of your squad, from class and weapon selection to special equiptment, portrait, and names.It's easy to see this game as a quick tactical shooting session and only expect to play in short increments, but its even easier to get hooked and start trying new strategies and techniques to get that 3 star rating on a mission.At $20 I can see many people waiting for this to go on sale, but I can assure you that it is absolutely worth it's price.

												What a great game! There is literally no down side. The only thing that hurts it, is actually one of it's better points. That being that it is too open ended to be played any one way.The level of challenge is up to you. Can you pre plan an entire mission without losing any troopers? Will you try to make arrest or just shoot everyone? Will you go the stealth way, the hard way, the quick way? Any way you choose will require very carfull planning. It's a simple game containing near infinite complexity. The one corner you fail to check, is the one that gets some one killed. So what do you get for your money? Everything but multiplayer (which is still being considered). It's one of the most replayable games I've ever played. 100 stock single missions, 6 big campaigns with a hardcore mode that save permadeath of your officers. You can always do any of this more perfectly, or all preplanned, or step by step, and if you run out of fun in about a year or 2, there is a easy mission / map editor and if that wears thin, it's already modded and workshopped to epic magnitude. It's RPG, TDS, RTS all in one. It shows you how to play, but never tells you how to play. If I told you how the game is played and a what I think of each aspect it would take 10 pages. Just watch the vids and keep in mind what I said. Best 20$ game this year. I'm gonna keep an eye on Killhouse. They seem to love the craft. I feel the feels inside for them. Sniff.... "

												Rainbow Six without uPlay SWAT4 without having to steal it (seriously, how is that game not on Steam OR GoG??)----In truth, it is like neither of these games. Except perhaps in that you're playing a military-ish squad of dudes with a variety of weapons and tools available.You drag your cursor to tell your individual dudes where to go, not to directly move them, the idea is that you're setting a plan (or altering a plan as needed) and then your SWAT team members execute that plan, shooting at any evildoers along the way. And you can only see what your squad can see via line-of-sight, which means controlling the direction your dudes are facing is of equal importance; it works nothing like most shooters, most of the real gameplay is in the planning stage (in my opinion at least; you actually can play it by ear with some degree of success but you'll almost never get a perfect run doing it that way)Reminded me a lot of Hotline Miami (1), in that, you're gonna screw up a lot, you're gonna swear nigh incoherently A LOT, but somehow still manages to be really really fun, and when you pull off a perfect mission its like SCREW YOU I AM THE SUPERIOR MIND (after failing it to comedic effect 9000 times first). And the fact that restarting and trying again takes next to no time at all, which is good because if you had to watch even a short loading screen every time you restart a mission it'd get tedious real fast.Lots of content, and if it isn't enough for you somehow, full Workshop Support (new maps, skins, guns, FULL support). And a mission generator, which I'm pretty sure everyone uses to cheap some achievements but I've heard it can also generate actual fun missions of whatever difficulty you like (which can be refreshing after you run out of interesting racial slurs to let loose after you've done something marvelously stupid and screwed up an otherwise perfect run on a really hard mission)			"

												You command a SWAT Team in different scenarios, be it simply eliminating all the terrorists or missions that include hostages or bombs to defuse.The level variety is great, the different types of mission always make the game seem fresh and provide a challenge.One mission might be a rather simple (but still demanding) run-and-gun assault on a hideout with not much pressure, another one might give you a small 20second window to eliminate a terrorist threatening a hostage.The levels can be approached rather casual if you don't mind casualties, but they are still challenging.Most players will rather take a more tactical approach where you minimize the collateral damage and have a ""more elite"" execution of your plan.The tactical possibilities for each mission seem endless with the variety of weapons and classes.Every mission can be completed with 0 (failed) to 3 stars depending on your performance with additional challenges that add replay value such as ""Only use real time combat"" or ""Only use one plan to finish the mission"", as well as the classic ""Beat this time"".The AI is good and always makes you think twice about your next move, their position also varies from try to try.Conclusion: A really engaging, challenging game that always leaves you satisfied after a mission. Quite some customization (weapons), leveling (different classes, experience, small ""perks"") options and enough missions to keep you busy for a while.Last but not least a small video that showcases how a mission works out after a few hours into the game (created with the ingame replay-to-video function)

												This is definitely one of my favourite games of 2014. It may confuse people looking at the 2D grafics when I say this game is amazing in every aspect of it. But everything fits nicely: The grafics don't hide information and for me they manage to be detailed enough convey the narrative while giving my enough space for using my own imagination. The UI is simple and easy to use. The sound effects are subtle (which is important, as you are going to hear them way too often when trying to get a perfect rating on a map). And the equipment is surprisingly well balanced, and personally I prefer balance to realism (it is really hard to explain why two .223 rem rifles with 10"" barrels, even if one is a long-stroke piston system and one short-stroke, would have so different power levels, but in the game, this makes both interesting). All leads to a very good immersion.The difficulty level is somewhat self-adjusting, as most maps are easy to finish. But getting 3 stars, using only one plan, no interaction afterwards? That takes more than a lunch break.It is not perfect yet, there could be some interface improvements when it comes to several troopers breaching the same door (whose tools are used) and a bit more synchronizing for cooperative action. And minor flaws like having female troopers but only a male voice set. And the three campaigns could do with some story texts. But these are trivial things that one will find in AAA productions, too.From a software developer's perspective: Recently, I backed three games (on Kickstarter and elsewhere).  Two (Wasteland, Jagged Alliance: Flashback) were a huge disappointment. Doorkickers was the only game that managed to continuously improve, seemed to have tight feedback cycles and was thought through from the beginning, so huge features did not come in late and were error-prone. And they polished their product before release. This speaks of a great development process and makes ""In the killhouse"" a company I would love to work with (if I were a game dev).			"

												If you like games such as SWAT 4 and the Rainbow Six games of old, then you will most likely enjoy this.There are a few different modes of play. Single missions (there are a lot!) allow you to essentially practice. The first few limit you to using only 2 good fellows against a small number of enemies with a mix of objectives. The objectives I have encountered so far are include (and you may have multiples of these on a mission) killing all the enemies, saving hostages, retrieving evidence, arresting a high profile suspect and escorting a VIP. There is also a random mission generator where you get to pick how big the map is and how strong the resistance is. Also you can create your own maps or download new ones from the Steam Workshop.The campaign mode can be unlocked after levelling up your squad by completing single missions. In this mode, if your troopers get injured they will be out of action for the next mission to recover, if they die they are dead. Dead as a dodo. Luckily you can restart the mission (don't leave the mission though!). However, there is also a hardcore mode, which will prevent you from doing this.Completing missions gives your squad experience (divvied up between the used members depending on how well they performed). As your squad levels up, you unlock more classes and also skill points to spend on improving the overall squad's reactions times and accuracy and a few other benefits. It also scores you out of 3 stars depending on how well you got your squad to perform. To get maximum score you need to and keep all your squaddies alive and complete all the objectives within the time limit. Those stars you can then spend on unlocking new weapons and equipment.Speaking of which. any tactical shooter would not be complete without giving you the option to swap out your gear. Each man has a slot for a primary and secondary weapon, armour, 2 small equipments such as flashbangs, breaching charges or lockpicks and 1 large equipment such as a camera to poke under doors or a massive hammer to smash down locked doors. There is quite a nice variety of weapons and equipment but I have found that there are only a couple of weapons I use anyway. There is one caveat: different classes allow and/or limit the equipment each guy can have.There are currently 5 classes playable: Pointman, Assault, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman, as far as I can tell, is meant for high speed and mobility encounters (as I found with the VIP missions – if you don't get to him fast enough they shoot him!). You can only use a pistol but if used correctly, or if you have some meatier backup, then this isn't a problem. The Assault class gives you the option to equip some rifles or SMGs and is pretty self explanatory. The Shield class drops the primary weapon in favour for a ballistic shield. The level of protection the shield gives depends on which one you use but don't leave him on his own, he can only use a pistol. The Breacher uses shotguns which allows you to quickly blow locked doors off their hinges and is obviously handy in close quarters. Just don't send this guy into a small room with hostages in! The final class is Stealth. Essentially you get some suppressed weapons, which (not surprisingly) reduces the amount of noise you make.So what is the gameplay like? Well at the beginning of the mission you get to pick who you want to bring along and then place them in the predefined starting locations. Then you can plan out your mission before hit the play button. Once started you can pause at any time and make adjustments where necessary. The UI is very easy to use and entering rooms is far easier than any of the FPS games. How many times have you been trying to prepare a flashbang, only to accidentally open the door and have an AK47 in your nose? That isn't going to happen here (unless you like surprises and to go in all guns blazing).The AI can be lethal and you will want to make sure you keep those doors and corners covered just in case someone decides to take you on. Surprising the AI is always the best option but once they know you're there they will usually be ready for you in the next room or sometimes kill a hostage or start destroying evidence so you will have to be fast. If they are ready for you, you won't want your guys stacking up in front of the door waiting for the flashbang to go off. Those few seconds can get your entire squad killed, get them in cover or stacked either side of it! Or if there are no hostages in there, just use and breaching charge and blow them all to hell.This is definitely worth picking up and if you see it on sale, you have no excuse. Great game.			"

Door Kickers focuses on managing your team to complete various complex missions, ranging from killing a set amount of hostiles, to rescuing hostages, to disarming bombs, to arresting a specific target.Door Kickers really shines with its Real-time strategy elements, which reminds me a lot of the classic real time strategy shooter, Jagged Alliance. It allows you to choose to pause the game at any time to manage your team, using really simple and intuitive controls. I was surprised at how easy everything worked once I understood how to play.I found Door Kickers to be really fun to play. It does take a bit of time getting used to the controls and managing your team, but once you get the controls down you can easily get addicted to playing the game and finding new ways to complete the missions. You can also edit and create your own levels using the built in game editor, adding hours of extra game content.THE GOOD- A refreshing gameplay experience- An interesting blend of puzzle and action- Huge variety of weapons and equipment- Addicting gameplay, you feel the need to beat every level in one plan and with one soldierTHE BAD- Weak toturial- Stealth class seems to make Assaulter unnecessary- Can be frustrating at timesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

								If you want a tactical, fun, infinitely replayable SWAT sim, you will adore this game. Especially with the monthly updates form the great dev team, this game is defiantely worth your money! For those who are interested in it, it is easily mod-able and has aboth a built in random level generator and an ability to make your own custom ones. I would definately give this game 10/10!			"

												First I should point out a misconception I had with this game that led to a negative review at first. This planning in this game is really not designed for you to make a perfect masterplan for each mission in one go. In my first hours of the game I was making long elaborate plans but elements of chance make this really unreliable. You can run a perfect plan one time and then run the exact plan again but maybe a shot will miss or an enemy spawns in the wrong place and that run is completely ruined, so you just restart over and over till it lines in your favor and that is not a fun way to play.Sure the game gives you the tools to make a masterplan like that but the inability to edit any of that plan without almost completely redoing it should be a sure sign that that is not the intended way to play.Once I dropped making plans and instead ran a little, paused, worked a bit more, etc I enjoyed this game much much more than at the start. One other thing is that the game really needs more non-lethal tactics, I recently took down a dificult 22 enemy level with only the tazers but ooooh many was that janky. When lots of enemies are tazed in a row the pathfinding makes it that you can only pick up one of them at a time, meaning I had to always have somebody on guard for when the other guys stood back up, and sometimes it didnt register that I was arresting them and then they got stuck in the throwing grenade animation for some reason?? Overall the game really doesnt seem to expect people to play this way which makes me wonder why they included the tazer at all.Other than that it's a lot of fun and thats about all there is to be said.

												Mods.Mods mods mods.(Don't mind the hours, I played this on another account)The most appealing thing for me from this game is the insane ease of modding. You can make a gun that fires at 10000 RPM, create a nuclear grenade, have a BULLET weapon fire two shots, or have armor that makes your troops invincible by just changing a line of code in a text file. I'm not exaggerating.Or maybe not. Maybe you feel like that all Carbines/ARs are completely stuck in Semi-Auto is silly for you and you want to make them fire in bursts or auto. Maybe you feel like a weapon is a bit underpriced or overpowered. Make some quick tweaks why not.You can also modify any official level in the game. Not only does that give many easy templates to work with and learn the editor without a tutorial, you can have a two dozen enemies in the first map just 'cause.You can also change parameters like how fast your troopers move, how fast they aim, their FOV, etc. I know some people like testing that kind of stuff in video games.Basically, you don't have to go to an obscure folder, download three different programs to extract the contents of a file, and then extract that files' contents (and realize you're pretty limited). Nope, just lovely, lovely text files. They also have developer notes to explain what each thing does.Some deverlopers say that their game has modding support. There's that and there's this. You don't get this much freedom in most modern games anymore.Just you know, don't use any of that to cheat. Cus' that's just being mean and not appreciate the effort the devs made into the levels.I hope this review does more than justify the price. (If it's not been already by other reviews)			"

												Door Kickers is a solid game and you might enjoy it (the crushing majority does, as it seems). But for me personally, it was a disappointment. I was really hyped about this game according to the trailers, there was no demo, and the game didn't live up to my expectations.I expected this to be more arcade-like, instead it's more of a planning/puzzle game. That wouldn't be a problem, but I don't like how it's implemented. There are basically two modes you can operate in: full-ahead planning or realtime mode.Full-ahead planning In full-ahead planning, you try to plan the whole operation (or most of it) in advance, and then just hit play and watch the action. It takes a long time, but if it works out, it is satisfactory. The problems are clunky controls and a lot of important stuff missing. Basic things like ""look around the whole room in 360° angle and shoot all enemies then go on"" are impossible. Instead you can look in one direction, then move a short distance, then look into different direction, then move a short distance, then look into other direction, ... until you cover the whole room. Even if your soldier encounters an enemy, he's happy to follow all the other orders including looking into a completely different direction, turning back to his enemy (what?!). So you need to use ""thumb up"" mark after every single move to make sure he actually kills the enemy before going away. That gets tiring quickly. A basic AI for your soldiers would be nice, but it's not there, you have to micromanage everything. So the soldier goes according to the plan even if there's a shootout 3 meters away from him. The soldier doesn't automatically take cover even though there's a cover spot half a meter away from him. People might argue this game is about micromanaging. Well, OK (I didn't expect that), but you can hardly do that in full-ahead planning, because enemy positions are random. And the developers give you no means to intelligently react to enemy encounters, neither in planning mode nor when executing the action (see the point below). Editing the plan in the middle is impossible. You have just spent 10 minutes carefully planning everything, and then you figure out that in the very second room you forgot to check the closet. You want to tweak the plan a bit. But guess what - you have to delete the whole plan after the second room, do the adjustments, and then re-create it again from scratch from that point forward. There's no way to edit the prepared plan in the middle. This is so glaring overlook then I can't explain it - for me, this was a showstopper for planning the action ahead. It also applies to real-time modifications to the plan (when you already started executing the actions) - no way to do that, it will destroy the rest of your plan. Say goodbye to intelligently reacting to unexpected events. Synchronizing actions from multiple soldiers is a major PITA. Something as basic as waiting for a flash bang to explode is not implemented. The soldier who threw the flash bang waits a bit (it seems), but the others do not. If you do not throw it through a door but around a corner, no one waits. So you need to do manual synchronization using ABCD codes. A lot of manual chore. If you have two soldiers, one with a shield, you get the obvious idea - one can go in front, shielding them, and the second behind him, shooting from the cover when he sees enemies. But no, there's no way to instruct them to go as a group.Realtime mode In realtime mode (well, almost real time, you usually plan just a few steps ahead and then unpause it), you need to micromanage everything, but at least everything works exactly as you intended - soldiers are properly synchronized, they don't rush into rooms before flashbangs explode, etc. However, if anything goes wrong and you need to restart the mission, it's an immense chore instructing them through all the rooms again, and again, and again. You can't save and reuse parts of previous plans. You can't toggle them to semi-AI mode and make them a bit smarter. So instead of spending a lot of time planning, you spend a lot of time redoing all your previous realtime instructions many times over. The realtime mode pains could be save by allowing the player to do ""snapshots"" - quicksaves and quickloads, but that's not there. Or perhaps offering to save and recall short-time plans for individual rooms, but that's not there either.So, in summary, I felt that I'm either frustrated by inadequate controls in full-ahead planning mode, or that I'm repeating the same short-time realtime plans over and over again, until I finally finished the level. I couldn't enjoy it.There are some technical issues as well, which annoyed me: Multimedia keys don't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. Alt+tab doesn't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. But then it glitches, and even though you are switched to other applications, Door Kickers are still displayed on top of them (so you can't see what you're doing). On top of that, you can't switch back to DK. That basically means you must try to kill the game blindly, or restart the computer, just because of using Alt+Tab (and of course you'll lose all unsaved progress). I'm using GNOME as a desktop environment, might be an issue specific to that.Aside from the technical issues, I like sound effects of this game, music is OK, but I don't like the graphics. First, the absolutely top down perspective doesn't look good, just a bit of isometric view would work much better. Second, the graphics are ugly and blurry, and the texture quality (or artwork quality, however you want to call that) is low. I have correct resolution set, but the whole game looks upscaled and far from crystal clear as I expected.			"

												Now before I go into my review I want to make one thing clear. I love this game. It is a very cool experience for those looking for a tactical strategy challenge of commanding a swat team breaching a building. However, there are just a few things that ruin the experience for me in some cases.First: The AIThe biggest problem that I have with the enemy AI is that they constantly open doors and just run out of them without and moments thought instead of posting up and keeping there guns trained on a door as they should be doing. Watching my guys mow down half of the enemy on one level just because they kept moving down a narrow hallway instead of fortifying themselves really broke my immersion.Second: Lack of Surrender OptionIf I was playing a military game, I wouldn't have a problem with my troops just gunning down unsuspecting enemies, and inspite of what people might think, SWAT team members are NOT allowed to open fire first unless they give proper warning and demand surrender from the enemy. The fact that this doesn't happen, and for a game that I assume is supposed to be simulating SWAT team breaches, really is disappointing when you compare it to something like SWAT 4 which this game seems to emulate from a strategic standpoint.Third: IrratationNow while some people may get the joy of going through a level for an hour trying to create the perfect plan, that isn't me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to do a level only a few times and not have to rely on trial and error mechanics to complete a level. And when I do complete one I don't feel sastisfaction at all.Fourth: ProgressionTo be fair, I'm not sure what progression system I would have chosen for this game, but I don't know if a star system like on mobiles games would have been the route I went. Really makes grinding extremely annoying. Plus I end up just not using most of the weapons and only go for the ones that are the best in the game.Fifth: Hostage Death = RestartThis is probably this most frustrating aspect of this game. I'm not sure what real life SWAT would consider a hostage being killed a failure, but being forced to restart the entire level just because one hostage out of like 12 gets killed is overly punishing. Especially if you consider that the SAS (I know its not SWAT but still) raid on the Iranian Embassy was considered a success even though a hostage was killed in the siege.Sixth: PriceFor a game that is $20, it just doesn't feel like it is worth $20 in the end. (I would recommend this game for $5 when it goes on sale but no more) DISAVOWED. $5 definitely pick this up, $10 sure, $15 eh pushing it but would still recommend, $20 no (at least for me). Some people might think this game is worth $20, which is perfectly fine if they believe so, but for me personally $15 would probably be a better base price tag.Overall, its a great concept and a good game, but it needs to lower its price and work on some of its flaws before I can change my review to positive.

Door Kickers - 8.5/10 Door Kickers is an addicting and challenging game, that hooked me from the first level. Much like Hotline Miami, the theme of a SWAT team making dangerous and daring rescue attempts is merely a cover up for Door Kickers' core puzzle like mechanics. The awesome feeling of pulling off a succsessful three star rescue attempt, after carefully planning down to the micro level each individual action of our members is second to none.The game presents you with several ways to access missions and earn currency (currency allows you to purchase different weapons and gear). Playing missions in each of the campaigns (there are currently 6 campaigns) Playing each of the over 100 standalone missions Downloading maps from the workshop (These do not get you currency) Making your own maps (These do not get you currency)The unlockable gear allows you to customise each opertive and in the later game it often makes sense to give each of your opperative a weapoin tailored to what they will have to do. Alongside this, there are also 5 classes, Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. They each have unique weapons and some shared weapons, as well as unique equipment.There is lots of good things to say about Door Kickers, but there are also a few issue at the moment. You are not able to reshape the path of an opperative without getting rid of all the rest of the path. The unlock system can be tedious at times and it can sometimes feel like a grind. Sometimes when you spend a long time creating a plan in order to get three stars, and then you have to quit the game or you feel like changing levels. There is no way to save your plan so you have to remake it when you come back.Overall door kickers is a great game that will easily last you 20 hours, and most likely even more. It is a particullarly good game to just pick up and play for short ammount of time, once you have unlocked a few of the weapons. BUY IT!			"

												It's nice, reminds me of  SWAT 4.It seems like a lot to take in, and certainly it takes a few mission runs before you become used to all the options available to you. But once you've gotten a few missions under your belt, ordering your squad elements and moving along with them becomes second nature. The structure of the campaign seems to mimic this standard learning curve, as the first few missions are rather simple and easy, but the difficulty ramps up considerably in the later missions, where you'll find complicated building architecture and numerous heavily armed suspects.

Summary: The game is awesome & full of tactical challenges.I've got this game in a bundle sale few months back, that's why it was untouched before. Recently I saw the announcement of the sequel so I though let's complete the first game. The game is really well made. Although it is top-down perspective but still graphical details are quite good. The game is challenging and it takes quite a precision planning to get 3 stars.Game play is very simple to learn but hard to master. You'll be presented with a map with few goons (default game comes with 6 campaigns and 75+ standalone maps), some time bomb or hostage or evidences (campaign only). You have to choose 2 or 4 or 8 soldiers and deploy in different location throughout the maps. Locations are pre-defined. Then you have to invade the map and kill the goons or capture the evidences or stop the bomb timer or rescue hostages. However, it requires precision timing and path / action assignment to coordinated attacks so that your soldiers don’t get injured (or killed). In hostage rescue situation, you’ll have to do it multiple times because you’ll die a lot or a goon has killed a hostage (strictly not allowed). This part is really challenging for softcore gamer like me.If I want to give point to this game, I’d give 8 out of 10. One of the best indie game in recent time. A must-have title.PS: This game has mod support; Steam workshop has lots of community created maps for more enjoyment. "

								A lot more fun than it should be. Part Rainbow 6 (the original) planning, part SWAT 2 RTS. It deserves a better description but that's pretty close as far as fun goes in my mind. Workshop support only increases the game's stock. Maps, sounds, skins and weapons are already abundant on the shop. Challenging in all the right ways. Plenty of stat tracking and rankings for those with a competitive edge. Can't remember the last down a top-down or a RTS game warranted the same attention from me, perfect game to pick up and put down at will.Don't let the hours fool you, I've been playing this in alpha form long before it was Greenlit and added to Steam. If you like throwing bangs, slicing pies, T-zoning, stacking and generally going HAM; do yourself a favor and pick it up.			"

												Fantastic game. Highly recommended. Harkens back to Rainbow Six (as you'll constantly read). Focusing on this game, however, it has solid gameplay mechanics. And is fair in it's execution. I did run in to one level that I couldn’t figure out but that was one level out of hundreds. And yes, this game has 100s of prebuilt scenarios. Also, it has a random mission generator. You get your money's worth and it's fun. There is not too much story -- actually, no story is fair to note but there is are 3 different ""campaigns"" that you can go through. Also the aforementioned 100s of missions and then the mission generator. So, again, a ton of content to be had. I don't have many complaints with the game. I suppose I wish it explained some the gear a bit better but for the most part you figure it out. To the best of my knowledge, a good portion of items are interchangeable. I could be wrong, who knows... Strongly recommended. Just buy it. Don't wait for a sale or anything silly. If you enjoy rainbow six (the planning phase, I should mention) and you like strat games, just buy it. It's an indie; support these guys and they can then bring out more awesome games.  The game is well optimized. It runs on my older laptops with ease as far as I can tell. No performance concerns to note.  "

												UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: I've just passed 100 hours in the game. Still pretty much a lot of fun. The developers have announced they are working on new updates expected before the end of the year to include an enhanced editor and more gameplay modes. So even if you aren't interested right now, put it on your wishlist and it might be on an upcoming Steam Sale.UPDATE: I'm posting a short update to this review. I've just passed eighty(80) hours in the game. The developers have released two updates, adding some new features and fixing some small bugs. The Steam Workshop community is very actively supporting the game (I have several mods there myself). Still highly recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you are at all interested in the subject you should definitely give it a look. The game is already well supported by the community and the Steam Workshop has some excellent mods, weapons and levels already. It's the old SWAT or Rainbow Six from a top down, 2D perspective that puts more emphasis on planning than quick reactions. Check out some of the Let's Play videos out there, or some mission video captures posted on my YouTube channel for more information.Now that it is in release, there are even more interesting features, the major ones being multistory buildings and drug busts where you have to race to seize the evidence before the bad guys dispose of it. Three campaigns have been added, which are a series of linked missions (also with some branched, optional missions) where you are limited to your existing roster. Without giving away any spoilers, there are a couple of really large maps set on a waterfront and a train station that combine long sight distances, dangerous approaches and unusual rooms and buildings. The game is pretty much bug free due to the long alpha period, with only a couple of minor items that have to be addressed. There is an excellent level editor that works pretty well, the only really awkward part being the current need to edit the background image (which is the floor or ground of the map) outside of the editor, should you want one that isn't the default grey warehouse floor. The developers have stated that they intend to add that background editing ability into the in-game editor. Also of note is the excellent Mission Generator. You select the size of the level and the amount of opposition and the game generates a random seed. Then you select either ""KillHouse"" (for a training map) or ""House"" (for a real world map) and the game generates a mission using one of the maps in the game. The mission could be just to eliminate hostiles, or escort a VIP, or run a drug bust, or rescue hostages. It's a real challenge because it's newly generated. Overall this is an excellent value for the price; three campaigns, 80 official missions (once you enable the two new missions via the Mods interface), a Mission Generator and tons of mods already in the Workshop. Highly Recommended.			"

												I had seen videos of Doorkickers before receiving it in a bundle.  I have played games such as Frozen Synapse and Jagged Alliance 2, and found the tactical genre to be a bit of a mixed bag.  So when I saw videos of Doorkickers, I didn't think much of it.  SInce it came with a bundle of other games I liked, I gave Doorkickers a shot.And it was far more enjoyable than trailers and gameplay videos could get across.The joy of Doorckickers is primarily the tactical system.  From movement to breaching to cover and co-ordination, you have to think about them all, and the game lets you control it in a simple and easy to use interface.  The method of control is also flexible: you can plan every move in advance and let the scenario play out, or you can pause at any time to alter the gameplan when things go sideways.  Changes can be made in real-time as well.  The end result of all of this control and flexibility is a deep tactical planning stage followed by a typically short but explosive rush of action.Each mission stage is a layout of a building, structure, or outdoor location.  Warehouses, beach villas, parking garages, multi-story luxury apartments, and more... with Steam Workshop and a built-in editor, the variety in size, complexity, and tactical options are impressive.  You can play one off missions or dive into multi-mission campaigns where injury and death are long-term inhibiting factors.  A hardcore ironman mode is available to prevent repeated attempts at a mission to save key teammates from injury or death.Most missions have multiple tactical approaches based on which officers and gear you use.  Some missions are somewhat linear and can be approached methodically, while others usually turn into controlled chaos that you pray doesn't get you killed.  There is an element of RNG to shot accuracy, stopping power, and enemy numbers, but solid tactical choices can be made to deal with it.The squad you control is manned by officers you can customize in name, callsign, appearance, and gear.  Skill perks are squad training that all officers get the benefit of.  Roles include pointman, assaulter, breacher, stealth, and shield.  Each fills a vital part of the tactics, and they feel useful in their dominant environments.  When the mission changes, you can change up all gear and role assignments.Weapons range from the ubiquitous handgun, SMGs and carbines, shotguns, and non-lethals.  The variety of weaponry is sufficient, and a slew can be added with the Workshop.  Gear includes various armors, tactical grenades, cameras, and breaching devices.  It's fun to switch up loadouts, but there isn't too much here to overload the player with inventory management.There are bonuses in each mission to encourage different playstyles.  Lone wolf tasks you with clearing a mission with one officer, which casn be incredibly difficult.  One award is given for playing entirel in realtime with no pauses.  Lastly, an award can be earned for planning an entire breach and clear in advance, hitting play, and succeeding with no pauses or changes to the gameplan.  This last award is the most satisfying of all, and when 5-10 minutes of planning leads to a flawless execution of a 3-4 minute mission... the exhileration is real.  You can also save replays within the game, or export the replay to a video file to share and cherish always.Bottom line is that this game is a tactical dream that can be played for short bursts or full-auto for hours.  The variety and depth provide a solid amount of content.  Mods extend the life of the game and add all sorts of new weapons, gear, and interface alternatives.If your satisfaction is partly predicated on price, I would wager $10 to be wholly worthwhile.  That's 50% off the standard price, which might be steep for most.  Luckily, the game has been around a while and sales on this title are frequent.So gear up and get tactical!  It's time to sweep this hot spot like an efficient wave of justice.			"

												Door kickers is Awesome!Your OfficersYou can have a total of 10 officers. You will give each officer a class which you can change at any time before a mission starts. There are 5 classes total, 4 to unlock. You start with Pointman and unlock Assaulter, Shield, Breacher and finally Stealth. You then customize each officers class specific gear.Officer Ranking and Squad RankingEach officer has his or her own rank which increases as they complete missions successfully. Their skill level increases with rank. As your officers rank up so does your overall squad rank. DoctrineEach time your squad rank increases you gain a doctrine point. These points are spent on pistol skills, long gun skills and shotgun skills. These skills are passive and improve every officer regardless of their rank.DeathYour officers can die permanently and will be replaced with rookie officers if you choose to continue after a  successful mission. If you restart the mission you will still have that said officer for consecutive attempts.Missions and GearEach mission has a 3 star rating system. Each star awarded is currency to unlock gear. Gear is unlocked for the entire squad once you spend the stars. There are single missions, campaign missions and a mission generator for random missions. There is also the mission editor and steam workshop. You can plan a mission from beginning to end before you start. You can also pause the game anytime to plan as you go. If you are really brave you don't have to pause at all. It is very rewarding to watch your officers execute a perfect plan. You can even save replays and export videos in game. ConclusionIt takes 10 minutes to plan a mission and anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes to execute the takedowns. This game could probably be used as a training tool if given to the right people. Door kickers is all about tacticle planning and strategy. Very fun game to play! Easily worth the full price but if you see it on sale don't hesitate to pick this one up. "

												Door Kickers was a huge surprise for me. A friend gifted me a copy and I have to say Door Kickers is like drugs, once it gets a hold of you you just don't want to stop playing. Door Kickers has you managing a SWAT team with upgradeable skills and equipment. During the missions there are a variety of objectives such as collecting evidence, defusing bombs, saving hostages, or just eliminating hostiles. You set up your team at the beginning of the mission and then plan out what they are going to do, once you press play the SWAT team runs into action performing all teh actions you set before hand. Now in Door Kickers you can watch your plan play out on screen, hoping for the best and restart if something goes awry, however if you are not worried about getting a ""perfect plan"" you can pause and modify your actions for your team at any time! There are a few different options when it comes to mission modes. You have the single missions, for quick play, you have the mission generator that lets you generate missions based on a few different parameters, and then you have the campaigns. There are a good handful of playable campaigns each with a variety of challenges and difficulties. If you couple that with the tons of different equipment and classes each SWAT member can have you are talking tons of gameplay and variation! If it did not sound like it could be any better Door Kickers also has mod and Steam workshop support! If any of the above sounds interesting I urge you to check out Door Kickers, or even the upcoming Door Kickers 2!			"

https://libertariangaming.org/?p=1465 <better version of my review in the link behind!Doorkickers is an indie RTS/Puzzle game which involves you leading a SWAT team through missions. I've been following this game since late Alpha and have enjoyed it since it's early form. The gameplay is quite simple, but is hard to master. Basically you give your team check points to go to through the mission area. You tell them where to go, where to face, what to use and so on. It's somewhat similar to the mission planning of the old Rainbow Six games but now in live action, with a live pause available. The game features five classes that your officers can pick from. Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman is the fastest through the door, but only wields a handgun. The Assaulter packs either an SMG or an assault rifle and is best at ranged gun fights. Breachers wield shotguns and can blow doorlocks off. Stealth wield silenced weapons and move quieter. Shield men wield large shields that stop bullets. In my opinion, most of the classes are useful, but I don't really use the shields as they are slow, and are doomed if they are flanked.There is about 80 single missions, 3 campaigns, a random mission generator and an simple editor so there is a lot of content on offer. The campaigns aren't very story driven, at all. There isn't a paragraph describing any story. I'm not saying it ruins the experience but it would have been nice to have that. Officers do take injuries during missions and can die, but this only really affects the campaign. The campaigns are quite short, but entertaining, and are worth replaying for experience points and stars (explained later). Although this game is mainly about planning, there is a bit of luck involved. I'd say it's 9/10 planning and 1/10 luck. Just know that ♥♥♥♥ poor planning leads to ♥♥♥♥ poor performance. One great thing about this game, is you can wing it, or plan the whole mission out (which gives a bonus in EXP).You unfortunately do have to unlock equipment during the game. Troopers level up during missions, and your entire squad levels up as well. Leveling troopers grants them better speed with shooting and using tools and accuracy. Leveling the squad grants doctrine points which grant all members improved abilities such as accuracy boosts, and one shot door breaching. It also gives access to more classes, as you only start with pointmen.Another thing worth noting is that you have to unlock weapons, by acquiring stars during missions. You get one for completing, one for having all troopers alive and one for beating it under time. It can be challenging getting all 3 stars on some missions but the rewards are worth it.One complaint I will make is that you have to erase all of your checkpoints ahead of a checkpoint if you want to make changes. This can make it more time consuming to change plans. I also find that sometimes I accidentally erase points which can be very frustrating.Another issue is the new story mechanic. Some missions have multiple levels but to be honest changing between them is quite awkward in my opinion and I feel the game would be better without them. My other complaint is that this game doesn't have a solid tutorial. Fortunately you can practice all you like on the single missions without an issue. The graphics of this game are quite simple, but I honestly think it's unfair to expect better from a 3 man indie team considering the scale of this game, and it's certainly better looking than a Unity engine game and to be honest the menu background looks great.Doorkickers has been my first adventure into PC indie gaming, and easily the best. A small, and passionate team who actually listen to the players, and use the advice to develop a competent and entertaining game that was realistically achievable. I'd give Doorkickers a 9/10.			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down SWAT 3/4, so far it is very polished and very fun, open ended with the ability to do the mission as you please, either gung-ho and loud, or stealthy with suppresors. With more to come, including modding abilities and steam workshop uploading, this bad boy has not only awesome replayability at it's current Alpha state (Alpha 9), it is destined to have more bang for your buck at its basement bargain price. Pick it up today!OK, so let's update this review. This is one of those games that had early access, and I was very impressed with what they were working towards. Lose internet for six months, the Alpha kept me satisfied. Get back online, get the updates, and ERROR HOUSTON WE HAS PROBS. Damn game wouldn't start. So go to the forums, and shoot some basics to the devs, they have me drop them a real email with my problems.Within an hour, the co-founder of the dev comany was doing some troubleshooting (DAN, YOU ROCK!), got my pertinent info, and all problems solved. Needless to say, this game surpassed my initial expectations in Alpha. This game is the ♥♥♥♥, yo. Get it, especially if you're a strategy fan, this is just the bees knees.			"

												In a world where there probably will not be a Swat 5, this is your substitute. Do not look at any others, as this currently IS it. And even for a top down shooter experience, this thing ain't a bad substitute either. You get that same sort of pull your hair out ""BUT THE ♥♥♥♥ER WAS RIGHT THERE"" experience that you do in Swat 4, and of course the much more fun sigh of relief when you actually DO experience everything perfectly.Plus, the shorter levels and plethora of mods make this an excellent reimagning on the genre, and alleviate some of the more rage quittingly high levels of difficulty that Swat 4 became equally famous for...

												This is a great game, and it doesn't have a difficult learning curve to the play style.  First, you take over a SWAT team that consists of ten members with varying attributes in marksmanship, assault shooting(close quarters), and field skills(a skill that speeds up the ability to disarm bombs for instance).Since the game is in the top down mode, you are able to script out the directions you want your team members to move, provide covering fire, which doors to breach etc...  This is done before the match, and if you realize you made a mistake during the fight, you're able to pause, and re-adjust your routes, and covering fire; or you can make adjustments in real time.  As I said earlier, it's not a difficult learning curve, once you realize it's about applying covering fire for teams moving in open areas, or stacking alongside a room you're about to throw a flash bang in.  There is limitless possibilities you can create within the scenarios.The game offers 80 missions(and often, when updates happen, more missions appear).  You can also create your own quick missions with varying styles.  Which means you can go in just to kill the enemies, capture and arrest individuals without lethal harm, disarm bombs and rescue hostages.  The game offers 5 campaigns at the time of this review, and they each have an additional 5-6 missions of varying difficulty.  This is not to forget that Steam Workshop is enabled for this game, and you're honestly left with so many choices that just about everyone can find something they're comfortable with(ie: you can apply mods for military type actions, with military weapons , or extra police type actions for instance).The game progresses your characters by the number of missions that they accomplish, and the skills being applied are done for you.  It's up to you, and the mission to decide which of your team members gets placed in the action(for instance if you're disarming a bomb, you'll want someone with high field skills).  You'll also get experience to level up, which then you can unlock perks from a tree of skills to enhance skills with firearms(pistols, shotguns and rifles/carbines).  The game unlocks after certain levels as you can get different character sets, like breachers(shotguns), stealth(silenced weapons and movement), and using police shields to add extra defense to your team members.  Yet there is even more, you gain stars by completing missions(1 to 3 stars depending on what conditions are met), which the stars can be turned into buying upgraded weapons, body armor, accessories(tazer, breaching kit for example.  You basically have full control on what your team needs to complete the mission.This game doesn't have too many flaws(at least when I've played), and the developers are still really active in producing content for the game.  What I do find enjoyable about this game is that it feels satisfying every time I play.  I don't feel like I have to commit 2 to 3 hours a day to enjoy the game.  I can honestly play a single mission, or 30 minutes and I won't feel disappointed in what I've accomplished; and certainly there is enough it do in this game to have you lose track of time and play hours at a time if you wish.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a tactical game where you're able to do all the planning and adjusting real time.  You won't be disappointed.10/10			"

Door Kickers is particularly enjoyable if you're into Police or Military Tactical Response/SWAT or Special Forces, but even if you're not, it's still an amazing and rewarding tactical game that enables you to think, plan and execute different strategies in a variety of different scenarios. It's NOT an exceedingly difficult game by any means, but there is plenty of room for perfectionist work if you so desire. Although the trailers play at full speed, there is a tactical pause feature that lets you think, plan and execute your strategies as fast or slow as you want. Would recommend Door Kickers to everyone! Lots of very cool new stuff is promised in the near future, such as Snipers, Ballistic Shields, Tazers, and a Campaign (in addition to the dozens of single missions currently available).

								When I first played Door Kickers it was a few missions in a shoothouse with a few guys available. Since then the team has added loads to a very easy to learn but tricky and satisfying to perfect game model. It brings back memories of the early Swat games and the tenseness of entering a room is great. The balance between direct controlling units and ordering team mates via go commands allows for some immensely satisfying moments when it all goes slickly. Some times it doesn't and everyone dies, tough luck it was your fault not the game, you learn and then do it all over again slightly better. All in all it is just nice to see a greenlit game that is well put together and well supported.			"

												Door Kickers is a pause and plan RTS with a focus on high energy, high impact tactical gunfights.  You normally control a team of 2-8 SWAT personnel and are charged with eliminating tangoes, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages and all sorts of other goodness.  The planning is intuitive & easy to implement.  It can be done entirely through mouse commands or by using the keyboard to trigger go codes.  Gameplay is fast and lethal - your SWAT wear body armor, but that doesn't mean they won't go down if someone empties a MAC-10 at them or if they step out in front of a shotgun.  As a result, you're constantly planning how best to win the fight before your man is ever in view - distracting the enemies by popping a trooper into view and then flanking them, stunning them with flashbang grenades or whatever other fiendish tricks you manage to pull off.  Enemy A.I. varies from cautious (hunker down and wait) to aggressive (investigate gunfire/other loud sounds) and changes between playings.  Most of the more complex scenarios offer several possible enemy set ups, deemphasizing puzzle-based planning and providing a more organic experience (is that room to the left clear or can it be safely ignored?).  The enemies carry a full range of weapons and can even load up on heavy body armor - there are an unrealistically large number of tangos, but this yields a more satisfying experience and you'll find yourself going along with it.Moreover, I have been playing Door Kickers since the alpha and, with each new iteration, the game has continued to grow and evole.  The dedication of Killhouse Games to delivering the best product possible has been something to behold and I can say that from personal experience they are very receptive to feedback from the community.   They have worked hard to pack a lot of value into the package - at present there are over seventy single player maps, plus three campaigns, a random scenario generator and an editor to enable users to design their own maps.  The game itself offers a wide variety of experiences, from simple missions that can be knocked out in a few minutes (when you're just looking for a quick release during downtime) to large, complex hostage rescues which require both planning and precision to pull off.In short, this is one of the best computer game purchases I have made over the last couple years - if any of the above sounds appealing then I highly recommend picking the game up.

												Fantastic game. Worth every penny.If you have played any of the previous SWAT or Rainbow Six games, you can expect a similar strategic style, albeit in a top down isometric view. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master type games, where you will constantly perfect strategies and re-run missions to achieve 3-star ratings. The game rewards your hard work with unlockables, specifically new guns and gadgets. There is also a level up system, similar to that of the XCOM series, where specific officers will improve their abilities as they are involved in missions. There is a mixture of both campaigns and time-trial based single missions and already an abundance of content.The game already has a vibrant modding scene, which is great because this game lends itself to the creation of new maps and guns. It already feels like there is far too much to do in it.The game is also extremely polished. There are a couple of small bugs here and there, but it's highly unlikely you will encounter anything game-breaking.Highly recommended!			"

												Door Kickers is an awesome real-time action strategy game where you take control of a swat team during numerous raids.There is a level generator which will (to your choice) give you either a map created by the game developers with a random mission and random placement of the bad guys, or a killhouse which is a completely random place, never before created for another user.Amazing game 10/10.

												This is one of the best tatical games I have played in a long time. While I am still figuring out the full logistics of the game, it has been so fun, that a review was in order. Getting started is easy as the tutorial gives you all of the necessary elements of the game and it takes a few tries before you become an adept. Even then, you are always learning and changing game plans or ideas as you progress through the game. Customization is at its best and a great perk this game has to offer are the ai's, which are placed randomly at the start of every level and seem to have great logic to them. I have not seen the ai's do stupid stuff such as stand around like dummies, in fact, I actually had one terrorist come out of the house to shoot my cop. This means that restarting each scenario will always be slightly different making past plans fruitless agianst new attempts putting this game as another one with a hundred plus hours on it.			"

												WOW yea definatley a keeper after a less than a hour its well worth buying especially on sale. I get really sceptical about certain games especialy games like this but let me tell you its a good buy. ProsGreat graphics (for a top down)Great stratigic sense ie. planning your route what angles to look ect.Easy to learn as few pointers but not rediculious to where you want them to go away it has a tutorial and it literally is a             screen that tells you the motions and waht to press for what - again very easy to learnCons:  (not many)Cant start campaign until lvl 6 but it doesnt take long to get there but by then youll have ample time to get good at controlsNothing else I've found yet for cons Must buy!!!

												When I play the first mission, it's very fresh, but after several mission, it's a bit tedious, for you need playing a lot to unlock the careers and skills, weapons, equipments.And I only have 2 troopers and handgun at first...Luckily enough flash grenade and they will never die...It's easy at first, so I just kill them. I realize the hostile will notice that the troopers here once you make some sound and they will make some actions, but the their position is terrible at first, so it doesn't bring any trouble to me. Until the 10th mission, I got trouble, big trouble...They attack me at my rear! I only got 2 troopers to against more than 5 guys and I got nothing to stop the sound with kicking, flashing or gun! So you really need some tactic, also skills and good weapon may needed.I also tried the Campaign, different from the Mission, you will lose your troopers if they dead. But don't worry, only works in the Campaign and you can reset it anytime you want( such as you got no chance to win).Still playing, so I'll keep updating this review.			"

								Door Kickers adds a great level of polish and accessibility to a hardcore tactical game. It plays quite similarly to Frozen Synapse, or the planning phase from old-school Rainbow 6, but your troopers are extremely easy to control and manage. You can either try to develop the perfect plan from the get-go, or pause the action and modify your plan on-the-fly as you react to enemy movement. Speaking of the enemy, the AI in this game is fantastic. The enemy AI will move around the map, patrol, react to sound and fighting, and surprise the hell out of you by flanking your men that you thought were perfectly surrounded in cover. Add to this a potent blend of customization, and wide range of tactical options at your disposal (you can play as a silent death squad, with all recon troops, or with a band of door-breaching shotgun-wielding fighters, or anything in between).

								This is one of the most refeshing takes on tactical shooters I've played in the past few years. Everything in this game is simple to allow just about anyone to pick it up and play, yet still allows an immense sense of depth and tactics. I'm a huge miltary nerd when it comes to CQC tactics, needless to say I couldnt checkout fast enough when I figured out what this game actually was. It cures that tactical itch that hasen't been touched since the early Rainbow Six / Ghost recon days. Yeah it's THAT good. This game is an unforgiving monster, but at the same time is as sweet as candy when you know what your doing. Setting up your entire plan in one step, then watching all your men carry them out with precision... that's something that never fails to bring a smile to my face. I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early, and every alpha that gets released I find myself saying ""How did I live without this?"" This game started out solid, and improves by leaps and bounds with every alpha released. The Devs. are also a great group of guys, always listining to the fans for feedback and future ideas. Two thumbs up to all of you at Killhouse, you guys are freaking awesome!			"

												Doorkickers is TOTALLY COMPELLING. You maneuver your team (often just two operatives in the early missions) through a space, using a waypoint order system - and you can pause at any time to issue new orders or completely change your plan. And every map has slightly randomized enemy placement, so you can't just learn the board and precisely plan for it; one run thru will go wonderfully, but on a second try for more points, both operatives will be killed when the enemy placement changes just a bit. So it becomes not about learning the maps, but learning good tactical discipline, regardless of the map. And enemies are smart; I've been snuck up on and ambushed. By going back through the early missions several times with untested, rookie operatives I was able to unlock the Assaulter class quite quickly - what has been described as a 'grind' looks a lot more like skill refinement, to me. When I got to a campaign mission and was completely owned - repeatedly - on the second map, I realized my command of my abilities was quite lacking, and went back to polish up. I've also been watching some enjoyably brief Let's Plays (by RedatMath) and seeing I haven't even used certain tools in my early arsenal, like the camera wand or breaching charges. So complaints of having to grind for simple tools don't resonate with me - the game feels like it's asking me to gain mastery with my starting toolset before widening it. Overall, I'm finding it a very enjoyable tactical hole to climb inside; there's always another way to handle a room, another challenge from a room with too many entrances, and another door that needs to be viciously kicked and stormed through. 10/10 would run in and get shot again.

												Honestly I love this game, I've own this game for about a couple days now, and I've already wasted 11 hours into it.I'm going to base this game on 3 categories: Price, A.I., Replayability1st the price 10/10. Well to be honest when I had first seen this game I thought it was a fairly simple game that would be worth, at max $5, but then I looked further into it, and for the amount of content this game offers $20 is more than a fair price. This game offers not only 6 seperate campaigns (With their own lengths and difficulties) 70+ missions (seperate from the campaigns) steam workshop availibility, but also your own map creator. Now honestly how many other games give you this much content for just $202nd the A.I 8/10. The A.I. could use some improvement I will admit, but people saying that the A.I. doesn't fortify in a room are wrong, the A.I. do fortify in rooms, for example on the single player mission Cartel Beach Party (Unfortunately the chief wasn't invited and was very displeased about it, so he had told a small handful of the best troopers to go in there and end the party.) the A.I. do fortify, how they fortify I will not tell, you'll have to find that out on your own. There a multitidue of other misisons the A.I. fortify on, but this mission is the best example (at least to my knowledge)3rd replayability 10/10. This game is all about replayability, there is tons of ways you could go about beating every mission, want to go full stealth ops on every mission? Go ahead! Want to just shotgun the sh!t out of everyone? Be my guest! Want to try and beat every mission with your most well seasoned trooper? Do as you please, no one is stopping you! Other than the multitude of ways you could go about beating every mission you can also challenge yourself by trying to beat your old highscores on every mission. (Or at least getting 3 stars on every mission)			"

								This is a great game for those of you that enjoyed games like the Swat series, Jagged Alliance, and ""Breach & Clear (On Android/iOS systems and or Tactical and strategy enthusist.  This game combines tactical with strategy allowing you to setup your SWAT team by choosing the weaponery, stacking your units on a door to either breach/bang/c2/kick/shoot the door, and sweep the room guns blazing or going stealth. Amazingly the game allows you to pause and coordinate your manuvers. For example if I want my men to look a certain direction when sweeping a room, it allows me to do it with ease. The gameplay is pretty straight foward and easy, it can be tough though, espicially if you don't coordinate wisely. In other words it's very easy to have a man down so be careful. Lastly, the A.I. is pretty good, sometimes they all end up coming to you which can be unrealistic but other times they can be super realistic. Espcially when you have a hostage sceneario. The hostage A.I. are pretty complex too, If you kill the other suspects for every shot the hostage taker hears, he takes a gamble on whether he will kill the hostage, wait, or investiage. If you're LE, Military, or just love being tactical, this is the game for you! "

												WARNING:Most of my complains here are after the 12 hour mark, but in future content may be added which fixes the issues I have.Doorkickers is a top down SWAT simulater where you control a small team and plan different raids. You have a planning stage for each map where you could take 30 minutes making sure you cover everthingthing, or you can go by the seat of your pants, since you can pause time and give orders in the raid itself. Doorkickers is mostly about planning each mission to perfection, and at the beginning it's great- the maps are small, you can generally plan the whole thing out and make no alterations to that plan and it's wonderfully tense as everyone dies in a few hits. However, after around 12 hours it all falls apart- maps are larger and there are more enemies, so you have to be flexible and this means no more planning for the entire mission, it's more room by room. Gang members get bullet proof vests, high powered weapons and explosives (WHAT?!) so they tend to be massively over powered, and this ruins the balancing that was perfect before.Really, aside from some control issues and not being able to plan for team members dying the beginning of the game was a good 9/10 but after it was watching it slowly die off. I will recommend it for the fun that could be had but it really was disappointing "

												This is an amazing real-time strategy game. Not only does it have tons of content (5 classes, 70+ missions plus 5 campaigns with another 38 missions), it requires well-thought out plans to progress. This game makes you feel like a real SWAT commander, just like the old Rainbow Six and SWAT games. I also love how detailed the levels are. But the number 1 reason I love this game is the AI. Most enemies run to cover or hide, like real terrorists would, and as soon as they hear cops, they execute hostages (Which is why you need to be stealthy, just like the SWAT when they rescue people). Then there are operators who stealthily throw grenades through windows before you even see them (smart, huh?). The game may sound really difficult, and it is ( I had a to try a mission full of operators 600+ times! ). Luckily the game has a restart button you can press when somebody dies (unless you are playing iroman, like the hardcore.) My only complaints are some missions favour the AI, and there is one mission I cant get more than 1 star on because sometimes an enemy is outside the map. Overall, this was a great game that i enjoyed, and I look forward to any new games that Kill House may release. Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9.5/10Music 10/10Overall: 9/10 "

Door Kickers is a top down tactical, turn based SWAT-style game.  The game alsoallows for mods, and they provide the tools for player to generate new levels,adding to the already large amount of content the game contains and encouragingreplay-ability.  Each level includes stars to encourage proficient play, as wellas challenges for the missions, which also encourages players to replay levelsto try for better scores.The UI is basic click and drag, as you position your SWAT team members in eachmission to try to immobilize the enemy.  You cannot plan too far ahead, however,as the enemies randomize their patrol routes and pathing.  The gamealso utilizesthe restart function well, so that you can learn from mistakes and correct them.Weapons have a skill set, and individual players have skill sets as well, whichgives the players a chance to customize the game to their preference.  Thedifferent player abilities as well as the variety of weapons and their customi-zation are very well balanced.The abundance of variety in this game take away from any linear feel, as well asthe randomization of the enemies.  The game is very just, and at no time did Ifeel like my time was wasted.  This game does everything that it set out to verywell.  I enjoyed my time playing this game, and can easily recommend it.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												I cannot recomment this game in good conscience.  It is a great concept, but its excecution is so flawed that it is often more frustrating than enjoyable!There are a number of bugs/flaws which makes for a frustrating experience.  For one, you cannot delete all the checkpionts, so you find yourself making mistakes and then having to undo your entire plan because a point that you definitely do not want, decides it wants to stay.On top of this, the men do not always listen to your commands.  I have a mission where I have to breach a number of doors and my men surprise me by deciding if and when to throw their flash bangs!  So I went to 80-90% success, only to have this kind of ridiculous mistake happen and have to start all over!Your men are in fact untrained dumbskies!  If, for example, they are told to breach a door, but that door gets opened by the enemy, your men get to that point and sit there like sitting ducks.  So you can have a perfect plan that goes down in flames because a door, which they think they need to breach is already open and they don't know what to do from there.The randomness is a bit too random, sometimes, baddies are just piled into a room, so a perfect plan goes bad because you simply cannot cover everyone.  In real life, thee men do not hang out in three corners of a room waiting for something to happen!There are a lot of missions and content, but they all seem to be the same.  It would have been much better if the missions were progressive, you learning new skills and dealing with intentional situations.  This feels like empty game play that is very redundant.These combined makes the game too frustrating to truly enjoy!			"

												Tango down! Doorkickers brings back many nostalgic memories combined from Rainbow Six on the Playstation and SWAT 4 on the PC. I've already spent numerous hours kicking down doors until my hands went numb acquiring every single achievement. As the achievement states, I've seen it all. Good luck troopers and get hustling!

												9/10 As a cop myself this game is pretty damn kewl. It's a good way to excersice your mind after a long day. You really can control every thing the officers do. From where they look at exactly the right moment to when to reload and perfectly timing a breach into a building. High replayablility value as well. I've enjoyed going back to missions and trying different ways of completing them. Workshop content improves the game even more so adding even more customization. I like the fact that you have to upgrade the officers as well. The fact that they progress makes you start to choose favorites and invest yourself into the game further. 9/10			"

								Door Kickers is an amazing example of tactical strategy done right.  It allows you to plan meticulously as you coordinate the actions of your team to deal with a multitude of law enforcement mission scenarios.  Once your plan is drafted execute and witness your officers engage; top down action rarely seems so tense.I have had some disappointments commiting to early access games in the past but DK is throughly enjoyable, addictive and intelligent.  The devs have done some incredible work and as the game grows I can only see it getting better.  If this wasn't enough there is a wonderful modding system and steam workshop support.  What a sweet game.			"

								Door kickers is great. Its easy to understand but hard to master and the single screen levels are great for killing five mins here and there. The game is about guiding a Armed team of presumably cops through a level capping bad guys, saving hostages and defusing bombs. It’s like a top down version of rainbow six. The levels are varied as are the unit types and the game play is fast yet addictive. You’ll want to get you times as fast as possible while incurring no team deaths again very similar to rainbow six. I also respect the developers of this indie title, they’ve been working hard to continually update the game and the updates are always big deals that add a lot of new content or features. They are also very good at interacting with their consumers and those that bought the game early. It’s jus t anice touch of class that is sometimes lacking. The integration of Steam Workshop is also awesome. In all Doorkickers is awesome and I’ve spent a lot of time with it. I genuinely look forward to the next update as they always do something pretty cool. "

												If you like tactical games, or even have a passing interested in strategy games, I highly recommend picking this one up. If you are like me and played and loved old school SWAT/Rainbow Six games, then you owe it to yourself to buy this right now.Cons:- A bit pricey compared to other indie games of similar (high) quality- Some difficulty spikes: the progression of difficulty in both campaigns and separate maps could be smoother, though it never feels impossiblePros:- Great music- Amazingly simple yet effective controls- Overall wonderful atmosphere for such simple graphics- Nice sense of progression (even with failed missions) with both individual team member and squad leveling without it entirely revolving around power gained from leveling up- Lots of content, with multiple campaigns, individual maps with rankings, a random mission generator, a mission builder, and plenty more to download on steam workshopMeh:- Sound effects are merely ok- Some odd bugs here and there that take you out of the experience, but aren't game-breaking- Destructible environments would've been niceTLDR: Well worth your time and effort as a strategy gamer.

												A very nice and strategic, top-down game where you control a squad of SWAT members. You can either plan your attack before hand and execute the perfect police-raid, or improvise and command your squad while in action. You can level your squad and unlock new weapons and equipment, like stun-grenades and tazers for non-lethal raids, or advanced combat rifles if you need to get a more hands on approach. Once you level up your squad you can attempt the Campaigns, where, if your members die, they actually die and you have to fare without them. Definetly worth the cheap price for a nice solo game experience.			"

												This is probably one of the best tactical games I've ever played.Every mission requires precise planning, a good loadout for the situation, and teamwork. You can't just run in and shoot up the place and win. You must use your squad to execute precise maneuvers in order to complete the objective with minimal SWAT casualties. For example, using a spy camera will give you the upper hand when breaching a door, so you know the enemy positions before entering the room, and your squad will know where to aim beforehand. In other situations, using the spy camera is not the best option, because there might only be a small hallway on the other side of the door, and checking first might slow you down, as you are racing the clock. Most missions will have an objective time goal, which you must beat to get the maximum amount of points, so completing the mission in a quick, clean manner is the optimal goal.Now, twenty dollars might seem like a hefty price for a game like this, but there are three main campaigns, each with at least an hour or more in them, and a ton of single missions, mostly involving just clearing a compound of bad guys. The Steam Workshop offers many player-made campaigns, many of which are very well-made and add many hours of playtime to this game. In my opinion, $20 is a worthy price for this game, but if this isn't at the top of your wishlist, I would reccomend buying it when it goes on sale.			"

												Everyday we see released games that are unfinished, unpolished, messy, missing key features, as if the developers never really played their own games to realize what any person can in 5 minutes gameplay.Door Kickers is none of those things. Door Kickers is a polished, finished and well designed game. The designer didn't try to do anything that wasn't needed but didn't left anything that was needed out either. There is clearly an attention to detail. It's one of those games where programmers spent hours resolving issues that you probably don't even realize but they are there to make your whole experience much better than average, so they are worh it. Graphically the game looks amazing and the Interface is very smooth feeling that is part of the game and not really just an interface.It is a small game, yes, one that you probably won't play every day during a long period of time but it's still very worth the money. Highly recommend if you are looking for a game to enjoy without needing to highly commit to it.10/10			"

												Reminds me of Frozen Synapse, which is an excellent game, with the exception that you can pause at any time, or you can choose not to pause ever and just guide your troops in real time. The more difficult missions are like puzzles where you have to manage your limited number of team members but still cover all the possible angles where an enemy might try to take you by surprise. You may also have an additional requirement besides just neutralizing all the enemies (""tangos""), such as saving all the hostages. The situation might be that the enemies will start shooting the hostages in one minute, and you must make your way to them quickly enough, or there might be a time bomb to defuse. On some levels you get sniper support, with the sniper somewhere off the screen, able to shoot any enemy that happens to, say, stand in front of a right (or wrong, for him) window. The game also gives you star ratings for each level, and there are additional achievements, such as completing a level with a single trooper, so I find the replay value is very good. Recommended!

												A fantastic squad-based shooter. I played both this and Breach and Clear in close proximity to one another and love the flexibility Door Kickers in how you play it - you can play it as nearly a RTS and give commands on the fly (though you can't give commands to bulk groups of folks) or you can draft a single plan for the entire mission for all of your troopers - complete with commands to synchronize actions - or anywhere in between (I tend to plot out the first room or two and then react dynamically to whatever is happening by pausing and drawing up new plans for the next few seconds).Cons - you do tend to see the same layouts over and over again - even with random missions, troopers aren't radically different from one another in their personalities.I also wish that there was some form of negotiation option to try to talk to folks while also inserting your SWAT team and performing recon or stealth takedowns - something approaching aspects of SWAT 2 with occasional non-violent resolutions. I do wish that more missions featured 4 man teams.Great tactical game and an absolute blast. Very much recommend this title.			"

												    Door Kickers. Tactical, top down simulation game in which you are in full control of a highly trained SWAT team. Oh yeah, it's brilliant.    The objectives are usually very straight-forward: eliminate all hostiles (or tangos, as they call them), save the captives and/or apprehend the suspects(s). However, every level offers a new location, with unpredictable enemy spawns and new tactics to be developed. Over time and the completion of missions four new classes will be unlocked: Pointman (the starter  class), Assualter (essentially a Pointman with an assualt rifle), Shield (carries a tactical shield which takes most damage), Breacher (shotgun wielding units for close quarters combat and making dramatic entrances) and Stealth (probably the most dynamic, effective classes, although more difficult to design practical tactics for). Stars earned in finishing levels quickly and with minimal casualties can be spent on new weapons and tools.     The main thing to know is the freedom that this game offers. There are so many ways to fulfil objectives that it is unlikely that in a group of 100 people (maybe even more), one person will use the same tactics and methods of completing the mission. You can choose what units you use, where to put them, where to move them from there, how to enter a building, when to enter a building, and many more.     There are, however, a few cons to this game. For instance, it is very common for the game to quit responding while launching for the first time in a while. After quiting and relaunching all is normally resolved, though it is worth mentioning. Also, unit control occasionally will act up, allowing me to only control one officer at once. A simple quit of the level will normally fix the issue though. I am fully aware of how unimportant these are, and in turn will note these are not significant enough to be a reason to not purchase the game.    All in all, Door Kickers is a marvelous example of how games of the genre should be, and deserves more attention. I would give it 9/10. Well done, Killhouse.			"

												Topdown tactics. Tweakable plans. Scenarios, campaigns, unit promotions, unlockable gear, mission-generator, level editor, mission-replays, exportable videos, moddable. The AI will punish your mistakes and you will fail a lot. But when you conceive the perfect plan & watch your team execute it -- that's sweet!			"

												Really nice squad level pause-enabled RTS with a SWAT theme. I've played both this and Breach and Clear and like both but Door Kickers gives you a little more control over precision operations. Think of a top-down Rainbow Six, with role-playing game elements too. Very addicting for those interested in this type of game, and with lots to do: plenty of single missions with achievements, several campaigns, a random scenario generator, and a map maker. There are already many user-made contributions to the community. The developer really seems to enjoy working on this game and there is what seems to be pretty good involvement on their site's bulletin board. This game is a steal on sale and bargain even at regular price.			"

												Impressevly good tactical strategy. Last time I was so exited by tactial game in 2005, it was SWAT4. Door Kickers is something middle of SWAT4 and Frozen Synapse. Before the mission you picking troopers and gear like it was in SWAT4, and mission gameplay is very similar to Frozen Synapse, but here you can set pause whenever you want.The game has a lot of content: 5 classes of troopers, lots of unlockable guns, 3 branches in perks tree, 5 campains, more then 80 single missions, level editor and level generator(!). If it's not enough for you, visit Steam Workshop, there are a lot of extra content created by community. As I can see the game is fully moddable - guns mods, realism mods and visual mods are available.Game control is very tabletishh, but as i can see there is no tablet version of this game. Another bad thing is that Door Kickers is single player game only, but as written in description of the game - ""(but MP might come later)"".4/5			"

												This is a game that could have made soo much more fun for me but sadly they made 1 stupid story mission impossible for me to successfully make it thru without getting one of my soldiers killed. It is not only the point that I didnt made that particular mission, but this mission made me feel like any weapon you achieve and any soldier you upgrade - well that all this doesnt matter. There are heavy foes that sometimes (if they want to kill) your whole squad OR if you lucky get killed like stupid dolls - there is just such a big random luck factor that I dearly dislike: 1. enemys will behave and spawn differently each time you start a map 2. your guys sometimes kill 10 heavy guys in a row without getting shot and you dont even really aim that prezisely at them, and sometimes they get killed by one guy but having the same equipment worn as with the previous with which you had killed 10 foes in a row and at the same areas and stuff. 3. I played the whole non story mission stuff and unlocked good guns, armor but it rarely made an impact on that one particular mission. Plus, I leveld my soldiers too.I was at a point were I really began to love this game - but now I hate it thoroughly - now it seems to me that I've wasted a lot of time for nothing. I deleted it and I never want to play this game again.  "

												This' a great game that reminds me of Swat 4 I have played this game for many hours to only finish the skirmishes I still havent played the campaign, with many more skirmishes coming excluding all the community mods.Pros:-- Lots of replayability - Lots of weapons, equipment, unit potrate art and 5 unique classes- Strategic Cons:-- The SWAT team is slightly trigger happy they'd rather kill you than arrest you. (American Police?)- If I want to arrest someone I have to equip taser, shoot, manually (breaks gameflow and orignal plan execution) order them to arrest criminal then switch back to main weapon. The arresting mechanic would have been better if after a flashbang you can scream ""everyone down"" or shoot the leg or arm but no its only as I stated earlier.- After the sledgehammer and bolt cutters are deployed the swat member freezes for about 3 seconds instead of getting out of the way making them a target to enemy fire immediately dying. The developers could have had them automatically move out the way instead of just standing there getting killed simtanously preventing his teammates shooting back. Non of the cons are game breakers there are ways around them but if it wasnt for the cons this game would have been perfect.			"

Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Be roughly familiar with firearms terminology.Major Theme: Well constructed, UGC friendly, top down tactics shooter.Bought at Price: $5.50 (Steam Sale)I quite enjoyed this game, but I certainly wouldn’t place it into the “must play” or “should play” for most people.

If you are not familiar with some of the firearms terminology used extensively throughout the game, you will find that things don’t make sense. One such example is level III vs. IIIA armor. There’s a wide selection of gear to pick from (a surprise in such games), and purely picking based on stats and names will lend you a bad time.That being said, 12 hours of gameplay certainly gets across the point of the game, and that’s where you should find yourself with a complete campaign, and all the weapons you want unlocked.

Unlocks in this game are very much like other games in this genre, where points/stars from mission ratings allow you to unlock gear and weapons. If you end up doing poorly, you will obviously receive fewer stars and thus less gear and weapons.Levels and campaigns are unique and interesting – but just as in Breach & Clear – the maps could do with more dynamic elements to them. Perhaps this will be explored in Door Kickers 2?

To tide players over until the release of the next game, Door Kickers extensively supports user generated content (UGC), where you can add more maps, UI changes, and core gameplay changes as well. The level editor could have used more polish, but certainly does get the job done.Just recently I have noticed stuttering in my game for a few seconds here and there. I haven’t been able to track down the source of this, but it’s manageable. Your experience will most likely be different in this regard.If you are in a tussle in choosing between Door Kickers and Breach & Clear, I would recommend Door Kickers. You can see my review on the other game, as well as note the large difference in playtime I have.			"

												I like what this game going for.  However, I have several problems with this game.Editing paths when making a plan  is a hassle.  I wish it was something I can overlook but since it's the main tool to use in the game,  I can't.  It's not efficient so you have to workaround the problems with UI. I really hope they clean this up with door kickers 2, if not then I'll be pretty disappointed with that game.  I don't think this game would have such positive reviews if everyone had to finish the missions without pausing since the there are several issues with UI.I like how the AI reacts to your actions such as busting down a door.  I'm not too fond of them being able to spawn in random/different locations.  The reason for this is because it can be tedious coming up with a solid plan as editing paths are a pain. If they imrpove the UI in door kickers 2 then I wouldn't mind random spawns for enemies.  You may find several problems with your plan if it involves flashbangs.   Switching between pause and real time sort of eliminates some of the problems that come up when making a plan.   It's cool in a way, I'm glad it's there, but then it's not really challenging.  $15 would be a more appropriate price tag in my opinion.  BUGS:An obnoxious buzzing sound that won't go away happens often when loading a new level.  Usually, it goes away when you restart so it's not a big issue.  But I saw iron man mode? that you can enable and I believe it mentioned something about not being allowed to restart missions.  I don't know if it causes a problem there.			"

Door KickersI picked up Door Kickers during the summer sale, planning on spending some time in it while I was stuck using a laptop out of state. I was pleasantly surprised in many ways, and while this title does have a few setbacks it is a fairly fun indie title that I can't help but praise.GraphicsDoor Kickers is a top-down 2D tactics game, meaning I will critique it less for level of detail and more for art-style and consistency. The official content is appealing to look at, though a SWAT team wearing tan uniforms is an odd sight. Community-created content varies, but in general the game looks fairly decent. My primary complaint is that textures will become blurry as you zoom in. You'll also notice that the enemies you face will regularly use the same sprites, and that levels reuse quite a few assets between each-other.

AudioThis game features fairly decent audio design, but my main complaint is how repetitive the ambient sounds are. You'll start hearing the same voices on TVs and radios, and the same shouts emanating from mooks before they are helplessly gunned down by your troops. Eventually, you'll find yourself repeating the TV announcers in your head, staying a second ahead of their words. I will complement game for its soundtrack, though; it works well, is pleasant to listen to, and suits the style/setting of Door Kickers.PerformanceThis game performs very well on virtually any system, due to its 2D sprite-based nature. No issues there, as I would've hoped.GameplayDoor Kickers revolves around planning out an entry route for a SWAT team in various situations, where your primary goal is typically to eliminate all hostiles and possibly defuse a bomb in the process. It is fast-paced, unforgiving, and fun to play. However, there are a few faults with it. The unlock system prevents you from accessing very interesting content such as the Stealth class until after you've spent multiple hours in-game, and the planning system seems to be developed with touchscreens in mind, which makes the process of modifying orders that have already been created very difficult at best. Despite this, I still found that it was fun enough to last for quite a few hours, and I still haven't finished even a third of the game's content.

I definitely approve of the game's position here.VerdictDoor Kickers is a very fun indie title to waste some time on, thanks to its light weight, fast-paced yet tactical gameplay which is sure to appeal to fans of Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon. However, I don't believe its production value is quite high enough to justify a purchase at full price. It's definitely fun, but it isn't quite $19.99 wholesale fun. I will be keeping my eye on the development of its sequel, 'Door Kickers 2 - Task Force North', however, as that title looks like it will have considerably higher production value and quality.I would recommend Door Kickers, but would suggest waiting for a sale.

												Door Kickers is a top-down real-time tactical shooter (shooter in leiu of a more appropriate term - the shooting is automatic and your buds are very competent at running and gunning) in which the player controls a team of SWAT (?) (Armed police, S.T.A.R.S., whatevs) operators tasked with completing an objective at a given location.The objectives typically take the form of a. Kill all the bad guys, b. Arrest a certain specific badguy, or c. Rescue a bunch of helpless hostages.  In most cases objectives of the B & C variety can be over-ruled by killing all the bad guys anyway.During each mission, your task is to choose and path your operators through the building/mission-zone.  This involves selecting means of entry, equipping your team with the correct weapons and breach equipment and otherwise generally co-ordinating your buds so they can support each other by fire, hold down certain angles, throw flashbangs and grenades and escort hostages.The over-world gameplay takes the form of a squad roster in which you may allocate each operator to a specific skill class alongside individual stats and some (seemingly inexhaustible) operator avatars.  From here the player can choose to play a single mission, to gain star economy for in-game upgrades, or embark on a longer campaign - a series of missions which, perhaps with the exception of the first, are enormously expansive and super intricate.Gameplay is nice, ergonomic and smooth and for the vast majority entirely mouse driven.  Though played in real time, the mechanics hinge a lot on the ability to pause and re-plot paths for your dudes.  Cheevos await anyone who can execute an entire mission from a single plot-line before the mission.I have only two gripes about the game really. First, the throwing of flashbangs or other grenades through closed doors is somewhat sluggish and counter-intuitive.  Often, though you've set him to peek the door after he throw's the grenade, your trooper will sit idly taking bullets to his non-mobile ♥♥♥.Secondly, and perhaps minorly, I would love to be able to export my ossom mission completion playthroughs but this function while tantalising me constantly, is not available on Mac.  Devs, plz fix.These tiny gripes aside, Door Kickers is a fantastically gripping game with a well thought out single player campaign.  The weapons and equipment are good in vanilla and, I must say, enhanced tenfold by Gunworld's IoV - Instruments of Violence item pack.Excellent game.  You'll be engaged for hours.			"

								""If you are considering a tactical squad based shooter to go in your steam list, this is the best I've seen in a while.""well, I've been a fan of early access for a while to my detrement. I like the system of replaying a game because it updated i guess, but this game is a hidden gem in a pile of coal. the way they made and make this game allows for easy to play hard to master and really makes you plan before attacking instead of just charging in. While playing i kept finishing a mission then watching the replay of the game just to see how i could've tightened up my movement, get more efficient kills and and avoid making mistakes I made before. For example; I played a garage map, and I breached this one room to stun and rush the enemy down, I ignored the bathroom assuming it was empty and it appears there was one terrorist in the room that walked out and killed one of my guys.However this game does have some downfalls. I feel the developers planned, and probably still plan to, get the player to attach to certain characters and troops. Sadly, I don't get that from this game. The gear also seems quite one sided, having your breachers to equip semi-auto shotguns because its more efficient and equipping the stronger gear so that you have less chance of failure. Perhaps a technology tree so that you can move to those stronger weapons would help, or just balancing the guns all out.Aside the problems I do like this game enough to follow through the development and play i every update so i don't miss anything, I really like what they've done already and the future plans sounds fantastic. If you are considering a tactical squad based shooter to go in your steam list, this is the best I've seen in a while.8/10			"

												This gamme is a game that I personally have been following since the very earliest of early access for it. This game is a fantastic 2D swat strategy game. You go into a mission, observe your environment, see what soldiers should be sent in and at what locations they should be sent in at. This game requires though to complete the variety of mission types with maximum efficiency. This game has given me hours of fun and frustation in equal amounts. This game constantly provides me with the thrill of split second decisions that could save a man or cause them all to die. Now that this game is officially out it has all the features that I myself have been waiting for, this includes multiple campaigns, troop customisation, leveling your squads, a random mission generator, and hours of enjoyment as you hone yours and your soldiers abilities. Overall I feel this game is worth every penny.			"

												85/100Solid SWAT game..(very similar to ""Breach & Clear"", but view from above like ""Frozen Synapse"")easy to spend 30+hours without even touching the Campaign ;)PRO:-Quite realistic Level-Design (decorations, surroundings, sounds, ..)-Different classes for each merc (can be changed fast before missions)-Favorite Template for each class can be saved -> faster adjustment of merc equipment-Completing missions earns you points (1-3 depending on your performance)-Extra Challenges for each mission get you additional EXP-lots of weapons to enable (for earned points)CON:-Skill development is maxed at lvl 21-Some missions are plain unfair-Some weapons+skills are not worth it (too weak)-A few missions+challenges are just possible after hours of reloadingI recommend it for anyone loving Stealth games, especially Breach´n Clear , Frozen Synapse and similar games.Birdview from above might not be as much enjoyable though ,if you´re used to 3D Stealth-action aka Splinter Cell /Metal Gear /..

												This game is totally worth it's price. You are in command of your own SWAT team which task is to: defuse bombs, kill terrorists or cartel members, rescue hostages and escort VIPs. While playing trough the different campaigns or single missions you earn points to spend on your equipment and your doctrine. It includes a map editor and an active mod community. "

												Very addicting game.This game has an emphasis on efficiency.  Trying to alter your breaching routes/methods to get your time down and fewer casualties.  The hostiles are never quite in the same place either.  Easy game to be okay at, Hard to be Great at.  Truly a game where there's 100 ways to do the same thing, but thousands of ways not to do it.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the best games ever. I'm not kidding. I have quite a few games; all Battlefields, CS:GO, Rust, DayZ, numerous race games, all Hitmans, but I prefer this game. Why?Well, I love this game, you can play it anytime, any duration that you like. Spend fifteen minutes on a plan, or just rush in and control all the troopers in real-time. I prefer a combination, planning a bit ahead and then work further in real-time.Cons:- I like the police versus criminals idea- I like the old-fashion top-down view- I like that you (new feature!) can throw grenades and flashbangs around corners- I like the ballistic shields and different weapons- I like the different roles (shotgun, rifle, pistol, etc.)What should improve:Nothing in general, it's a good game. Okay, the AI could use some more unpredictability.Summary: I love this game! :D			"

												In Door Kickers, you take control of a SWAT team in a variety of different hostile situations. It is a top down, 2D realtime strategy game that allows you to make critical decisions at a moment's notice or plan entire missions from the very beginning of an operation. After a few hours of playing the Single Missions, I fell in love with Door Kickers. The controls are simple and easy to understand, and watching your plans in action is always satisfying. The sheer amount of different scenarios, ranging from hostage situations to raiding criminal headquarters, makes each mission feel like a new tactical challenge for your SWAT team. With 6 campaigns, 70+ Official Single Missons, Level Generator, unlockable gear, and downloadable mods, Door Kickers has plenty of content to keep you busy.Although I enjoyed Door Kickers, there are a few minor flaws. The game offers you dozens of unlockable gear such as guns and equipment, but I found myself using what I was comfortable with and had no trouble throughout the game. My only incentive to unlock and test all the guns was for the achievement. Also, there were a few situations in the Single Missions and Campaign that feel unbalanced and in favor of the AI.Overall, Door Kickers was an addicting and enjoyable strategy game from start to finish.

												I'm so glad this project finally finished and become much much better.I'm an old school gamer. I bought this game the first day it showed on steam as alpha. I played a lot of Rainbow Six 1&2 in the past, and this game brings me the same atmosphere and feeling.The developers are very friendly and fixed the bug I reported very quickly. They also surprise me as well. With the random generator, we can bring more fun and custom fan missions.Overall, it's a good game, especially for a gamer like me. Bring back the old memories.			"

												Great tactical game. Takes a bit to get used to the UI but it works well once learned, it's not a standard rip-off of the Starcraft of C&C interface and this is why people might have a bit of a learning curve before you can get into the gameplay. It only took my an hour to get almost everything memorized, not that bad. This game has random maps, pre-made single maps and campaigns. Going through the single maps alone would take a long long time. Campaigns can take a while especially if you have to restart some particularly overly hard missions. Once you play all those most games would be done and become boring, right? Luckily there is a random map generator. You can set size and enemy parameters, and since you don't know exactly what you are going to run in to it ends up being fun for long periods. Even if I have 5 minutes I can run one or two random killhouse maps. Or if I want to spend 3 hours playing a tactical game I can and it still doesn't get dull.Tactically there are various ways to overcome each scenario. You can lockpick a locked door or break it down, or you can use special tools to lockpick it faster or break it faster but these tools take up an inventory slot and are heavier. Or you could use a breacher with a shotgun, but that shotgun becomes the primary weapon and is only useful at short range. There is a give and take to each option and all are viable pending your playstyle and how you want to approach that whole level. And this is just locked doors. The constant variation in the maps and multiple ways to approach each type of situation keeps it varied. Some maps you cannot flank the armored guy and have to face him head on, if you do not have the right equipment you will likely suffer. Sometimes there are too many rooms to flashbang each one so you have to adapt to opening doors and clearing rooms in a different way sweeping around the corner from a wider angle. The game doesn't feel dull even after a long time playing. Gameplay is top-notch and the devs plan on adding to it with co-op and multiplayer eventually. This game has longevity, it hasn't gotten dull yet and I have plenty of hours in it already. It can be played in short spurts or long sessions without an issue. It's a tactical game that requires some thinking. Controls are more than functional and become natural to use with a little bit of time in the game to do exactly what you want down to smaller details like how you want to walk around a corner with a sweeping curve instead of walking straight in. There are various classes that all play differently and can change your play style immensely from one map to another depending on team loadout. You can respec your doctrine points aka skills and you can change classes freely any time you want. I have nothing but good things to say about this game so yes I recommend it. It has been on sale a few times but even full price this is a good one to pick up.			"

 Door Kickers! It's a late night, I ned sleep, but instead I'm writing reviews.  Why? Anyway, I'll make it a moderate sized review I guess, TL;DR at the bottom. Instead of going over every detail like other reviews, I'll go over the little  nooks and crannies only , and not in any order, so let's get to it!  I have a lot more hours on Door Kickers than it seems, I've played the iPad version a lot and lots of offline hours. Progession This game is pretty nice on progression to be honest. You have one class (I'll go over the classes in a second} and as your squad ""levels"" up, you obtain new classes,  until you get all 5 of them. There are also  stars , which you get for completing certain challenges, such as playing the mission using a single plan, or playing without ever pausing in real-life. With stars, you can buy  new weapons, armor and pretty much everything else . Every time your squad levels up, you get  doctorine points . These can be used to teach our squad special tactics, making them more effective.  Replayablity This game has a  nice freaking sheet  ton of replayablity. The AI makes  different decisions  and spawn in different preset spots (so they  can and will  repeat). There are a ridiculous amount of ways to complete each mission, be it with continuous sync throughout, splitting up to speed it up, or just trying out the best weapons for every situation!  Let's not forget that there's a  ♥♥♥♥ing mission generator  that ♥♥♥♥♥ out missions for you to play that feel like a normal one! Also the steam workshop is utilized pretty well so you can find lots of maps made by people using the level editor. Music   Meh.  The music is alright, but then it just starts turning into some dubstep crap, but if you're fine with a 60 seconds of dubstep or just love it in general, then you'll like it. Gamemodes (WIP)These are the gamemodes you'll play  Clear Hostiles Hostage Rescue Stop Execution Bomb DefusalArrest WarrentDope RaidsRobbery In Progress Some of the above, on a ship or plane or something really cool like that. WIP YEs, I'm tired, I'd appreciate a like or two pretty please though! I'll work on it very soon! "

They have diiferent classes with different specialties which can vary the different ways you play the game.

												This is an incredibly addictive strategy game whereby you command a team of SWAT officers in raids on various compounds.  This game boasts a fairly hefty list of single missions, and a number of multi-layered campaigns.  The briefings are simple, with no overblown storyline - just the basic facts of how many Tangos, and what your objectives are.  How you go about assaulting the compounds is essentially up to you.The player generally gets to command a team of 2-8 officers that, as you progress grow in skill.  The more you play, the more unlocks become available, allowing even more playing styles through different classes (Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth, and Shield).Insertion points are fixed, but there are generally some options as to where your team will start from, and who you include on the assault.The game provides an interesting playing experience with it being almost turn-based - but not.  The player has the ability to pause the game and command their officers in where to move, where to look, and basic actions.  This can be done in real time, but more success is had by trusting in your officers AI.  At any point, if you feel your orders aren't working, you can freeze time and change your commands, allowing you to command (somewhat) on the fly.I picked this game up on sale earlier today and have spent around 6 hours playing - so the value for money is high.This is a great game for short stints - allowing you to log in and make an attempt or two at a difficult target, without too much commitment out of your day.  Or, you can just spend hours grinding your way through the various levels.The game is very much like chess, where you need to think a few moves ahead.Basic knowledge of MOUT/urban warfare can help, but trial and error can eventually be as effective.  Just remember to check those corners!The AI Tangos are quality, with numerous classes to go up against.  Just don't be upset if a hostage taker decides to kill their comodoty before they turn the gun on you.The UI isn't perfect and I still fumble with issuing breaching commands on a 'go command', but remember the 7 P's and you'll do alright:  'Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents ♥♥♥♥ Poor Performance'.4/5			"

												Door kickers is a game about kicking doors and shoot up the place...no really it's pretty much that. The game has you planning and executing plans from a top down view in which you can setup your teams of Swat officers and plan their route to breach, bang and clear the mission. Want to deal with a room full of enemies watching the doors? Simple you can set your 2 teams of officers to each door and have them kick the door in or blow the door open, then flash and start shooting everyone dead. It feels wonderful.==========The Good==========1. Gameplay - Having this feeling of being a swat team commander or a tactical planner is rather fun but also difficult as you must plan every step to ensure the mission goes to plan. You have to adapt to the situation because if you don't you can get your team killed or a hostage. Lucky the game gives you many options to do your job, you can customize your officers giving them from aggressive equipment such as riot shields, grenades, breaching charges and your weapons of choice from SMG to shotguns. However you also can go in more passive using stun grenades, tasers or even take everyone out quietly with silencers to make it as if you were never there.It goes the same with planning the mission, you can plan every step, every choice such as blowing up a door, using flash or grenade or just kick doors. You can also set it where you can play the mission yourself having full control over each unit in real time or you can set everything up with waypoints and execution orders (they allow you to set up when to breach or move out or hold a location) and simply watch your plan come to life. 2. Levels - I found the level designs rather fun and enjoyable. You have levels with multiple floors, some with windows in which sometimes you have a sniper element that can help take out targets for you. And on top of that you can use their ingame map editor to make your own crazy missions. There are also a lot of missions to play through and 3 stories to go through with the cool element of if you lose an officer...they stay dead...no replacement making it a bit more challenging.=======The 50/50=======1. Difficulty - There are times where missions can feel very difficult and needs the best plan or just luck to win. This can be annoying at times but overall it helps fuels the challenge of being a tactical planner. For example there are missions where you must save a hostage and disarm a bomb however if you plan the mission poorly you can end up having a hostage shot or the bomb going off before you reach it...making timing everything. So expect to re-work your plans over and over.======Overall======It's a fun police type tactical shooter for those wanting to either take control of each unit and do everything real time or be a planner and watch your plan go to work. There is again a lot of customization and maps to play to keep you busy and most of all a lot of enemies to deal with.   "

												I got this game in early September 2013, when it was in early access. I liked it as it was then (and it was well worth the rather cheap price at that point), and it has only improved. I see that it won best tactics game of 2014, and this makes me feel a little pride, knowing that I have supported it from the beginning :) Your team is pretty customizable. You can rename each trooper, select from a number of different portraits, choose each trooper's class, and also customize their equipment and weapon loadout. There are several different campaigns to undertake, each with different focuses, enemies, and situations. There's also a bunch of individual missions you can try. For extras, there is a mission generator, map editor, and you have access to the workshop. You can download maps, etc from the workshop which is always nice. The gameplay is characterized by pausing and unpausing (or, not). You can pause, and while paused click and drag each trooper's path through the level, designating actions to do once they reach a door (like flashbanging it and clearing), which way to scan when they reach a certain point, and so forth. You can map out as much or as little at a time as you want. There is a bonus if you successfully run through the level fully mapping it out in the beginning, and not interfering. There's also a bonus for completing the level with just 1 trooper. Hopefully this makes sense. The selection of equipment and tools, combined with classes, can make for plenty of replay value. You could run 1 level many different ways depending on which troopers you use, what equipment they have, and how they enter a building, room, or area. For instance you might run the level very differently if you have one or two stealth troopers on the mission, than if you have a pointman with a pistol, assaulter with a rifle, or breacher with a shotgun. I certainly recommend this game. "

												85/100Solid SWAT game..(very similar to ""Breach & Clear"", but view from above like ""Frozen Synapse"")easy to spend 30+hours without even touching the Campaign ;)PRO:-Quite realistic Level-Design (decorations, surroundings, sounds, ..)-Different classes for each merc (can be changed fast before missions)-Favorite Template for each class can be saved -> faster adjustment of merc equipment-Completing missions earns you points (1-3 depending on your performance)-Extra Challenges for each mission get you additional EXP-lots of weapons to enable (for earned points)CON:-Skill development is maxed at lvl 21-Some missions are plain unfair-Some weapons+skills are not worth it (too weak)-A few missions+challenges are just possible after hours of reloadingI recommend it for anyone loving Stealth games, especially Breach´n Clear , Frozen Synapse and similar games.Birdview from above might not be as much enjoyable though ,if you´re used to 3D Stealth-action aka Splinter Cell /Metal Gear /..

												I have to say, for its worth, it's a pretty solid and sure game. Interesting take on the ""breach and secure"" scenarios presented with Law-enforcement/Police agencies. Complicated at first, however given time and some basic understanding, works out pretty well, and thus allows for more complex operations to be tried out!Really good, I quite like it, nice little tactical-top-down breach and clear game. First of it's kind to address this kind of genre, from what I can see.Thumbs up all round!			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down real-time tactical shooter (shooter in leiu of a more appropriate term - the shooting is automatic and your buds are very competent at running and gunning) in which the player controls a team of SWAT (?) (Armed police, S.T.A.R.S., whatevs) operators tasked with completing an objective at a given location.The objectives typically take the form of a. Kill all the bad guys, b. Arrest a certain specific badguy, or c. Rescue a bunch of helpless hostages.  In most cases objectives of the B & C variety can be over-ruled by killing all the bad guys anyway.During each mission, your task is to choose and path your operators through the building/mission-zone.  This involves selecting means of entry, equipping your team with the correct weapons and breach equipment and otherwise generally co-ordinating your buds so they can support each other by fire, hold down certain angles, throw flashbangs and grenades and escort hostages.The over-world gameplay takes the form of a squad roster in which you may allocate each operator to a specific skill class alongside individual stats and some (seemingly inexhaustible) operator avatars.  From here the player can choose to play a single mission, to gain star economy for in-game upgrades, or embark on a longer campaign - a series of missions which, perhaps with the exception of the first, are enormously expansive and super intricate.Gameplay is nice, ergonomic and smooth and for the vast majority entirely mouse driven.  Though played in real time, the mechanics hinge a lot on the ability to pause and re-plot paths for your dudes.  Cheevos await anyone who can execute an entire mission from a single plot-line before the mission.I have only two gripes about the game really. First, the throwing of flashbangs or other grenades through closed doors is somewhat sluggish and counter-intuitive.  Often, though you've set him to peek the door after he throw's the grenade, your trooper will sit idly taking bullets to his non-mobile ♥♥♥.Secondly, and perhaps minorly, I would love to be able to export my ossom mission completion playthroughs but this function while tantalising me constantly, is not available on Mac.  Devs, plz fix.These tiny gripes aside, Door Kickers is a fantastically gripping game with a well thought out single player campaign.  The weapons and equipment are good in vanilla and, I must say, enhanced tenfold by Gunworld's IoV - Instruments of Violence item pack.Excellent game.  You'll be engaged for hours.			"

												Door kickers is a game about kicking doors and shoot up the place...no really it's pretty much that. The game has you planning and executing plans from a top down view in which you can setup your teams of Swat officers and plan their route to breach, bang and clear the mission. Want to deal with a room full of enemies watching the doors? Simple you can set your 2 teams of officers to each door and have them kick the door in or blow the door open, then flash and start shooting everyone dead. It feels wonderful.==========The Good==========1. Gameplay - Having this feeling of being a swat team commander or a tactical planner is rather fun but also difficult as you must plan every step to ensure the mission goes to plan. You have to adapt to the situation because if you don't you can get your team killed or a hostage. Lucky the game gives you many options to do your job, you can customize your officers giving them from aggressive equipment such as riot shields, grenades, breaching charges and your weapons of choice from SMG to shotguns. However you also can go in more passive using stun grenades, tasers or even take everyone out quietly with silencers to make it as if you were never there.It goes the same with planning the mission, you can plan every step, every choice such as blowing up a door, using flash or grenade or just kick doors. You can also set it where you can play the mission yourself having full control over each unit in real time or you can set everything up with waypoints and execution orders (they allow you to set up when to breach or move out or hold a location) and simply watch your plan come to life. 2. Levels - I found the level designs rather fun and enjoyable. You have levels with multiple floors, some with windows in which sometimes you have a sniper element that can help take out targets for you. And on top of that you can use their ingame map editor to make your own crazy missions. There are also a lot of missions to play through and 3 stories to go through with the cool element of if you lose an officer...they stay dead...no replacement making it a bit more challenging.=======The 50/50=======1. Difficulty - There are times where missions can feel very difficult and needs the best plan or just luck to win. This can be annoying at times but overall it helps fuels the challenge of being a tactical planner. For example there are missions where you must save a hostage and disarm a bomb however if you plan the mission poorly you can end up having a hostage shot or the bomb going off before you reach it...making timing everything. So expect to re-work your plans over and over.======Overall======It's a fun police type tactical shooter for those wanting to either take control of each unit and do everything real time or be a planner and watch your plan go to work. There is again a lot of customization and maps to play to keep you busy and most of all a lot of enemies to deal with.   "

												I got this game in early September 2013, when it was in early access. I liked it as it was then (and it was well worth the rather cheap price at that point), and it has only improved. I see that it won best tactics game of 2014, and this makes me feel a little pride, knowing that I have supported it from the beginning :) Your team is pretty customizable. You can rename each trooper, select from a number of different portraits, choose each trooper's class, and also customize their equipment and weapon loadout. There are several different campaigns to undertake, each with different focuses, enemies, and situations. There's also a bunch of individual missions you can try. For extras, there is a mission generator, map editor, and you have access to the workshop. You can download maps, etc from the workshop which is always nice. The gameplay is characterized by pausing and unpausing (or, not). You can pause, and while paused click and drag each trooper's path through the level, designating actions to do once they reach a door (like flashbanging it and clearing), which way to scan when they reach a certain point, and so forth. You can map out as much or as little at a time as you want. There is a bonus if you successfully run through the level fully mapping it out in the beginning, and not interfering. There's also a bonus for completing the level with just 1 trooper. Hopefully this makes sense. The selection of equipment and tools, combined with classes, can make for plenty of replay value. You could run 1 level many different ways depending on which troopers you use, what equipment they have, and how they enter a building, room, or area. For instance you might run the level very differently if you have one or two stealth troopers on the mission, than if you have a pointman with a pistol, assaulter with a rifle, or breacher with a shotgun. I certainly recommend this game. "

												The full price of $19.99 is a little expensive in my opinion however at 85% off during the summer sale this game is only $2.99 and it is well worth it. Door Kickers is a very nicely made strategy game with multiple classes of units such as assaulters with automatic rifles and breachers who carry a shield and are more resilient to enemy fire. When Starting a level you can attempt to plan the whole mission out from start to finish or micromanage your unitis in real time. You are also able to pause the action to adjust your plan if needed at any point during a level.			"

												First of All, I really love this game. Fantastic. So I cant completely see the negative sides to this game. However I will try my best at looking at the good and bad points of the game.Pro:Very tactical gameplay. The gameplay is very much a learning experience because you learn through doing missions for example that different methods of destructing doors are important if you want to sneak in, or breach in and kill everyone in 2 seconds. Good soundtracks. I personally think that the soundtrack works greatly with the game and makes the game more interesting.Good voices. All your soldiers have voices to which adds a personality to the characters you play with.Con:Some minor bugs such as crashing after clicking to often or the soundtrack hanging up and repating one note for 10 seconds. Well its top down view. I personally like top down view but I would understand if people dont like that. However I dont understand why you would buy the game if you didnt like top down view.			"

												Rainbow Six planning phase as a refined standalone game.This is a top-down pausable real-time strategy where you guide a squad of special forces through various missions (hostage rescue, bomb defusal, arrests, evidence grab or plain good old terrorist hunt). Before the start of the mission you are able to set up a plan and then watch it play out - however you can adjust it to your liking at any moment and have a limited direct control of separate fighters. Furthermore every fighter is customizable with the ability to select a loadout suitable for various tasks (akin to SWAT4).The game comes with several campaigns and a huge amount of single missions, as well as a battle generator. Missions have a degree of replayability due to random enemy positions and numbers each time. If that's not enough there is a built-in mission editor - meaning you can also download many great user missions from Steam Workshop.Steam Workshop further offers more variety by having mods that add new squad skins, new weapons and gear.The only downside of note is an interface, which no doubt was affected by the mobile version - there's a lot of scrolling and clicking through to get to the stuff you want, especially after you've installed some mods. The game also gets repetitive after a while - same as its ""bigger"" brethren - classic R6 and SWAT series.			"

One of my favourite mods is the Rainbow Six sound mod. It brings me back to the end of the 90's / start of 00 when the Tom Clancy games were at their best. Such good memories of the Rainbow six days ""Open, Flash and clear on Zulu"" #Runs in backwards and kills the hostagesAlso the game plays like Hotline Miami, so if you liked that game you'll love this.I can't say much more.

												If you love SWAT 4 (or know what it is), then you'll love Door Kickers. Both are tactical kill-the-terries games but they only differ in perspective, SWAT 4 being an FPS and Door Kickers being a Top-Down Strategy Planner. Comparing the 2 games sounds far-fetched but in terms of replayability, customization and difficulty/challenge, Door Kickers gives you that edge just as SWAT 4 did. I've put hours into this game and I just keep coming back for more. :D "

												My enjoyment of this game followed an inverted bell curve - at first I was elated. The dip came somewhere between my 20th and 30th mission, where the difficulty started ramping up faster than I could cope with. I was quite frustrated for a while but kept trying to wade forward. And sure enough, once my knowledge of the game mechanics accumulated past a certain critical mass it was only upwards on that bell curve, toward permanent satisfaction. To limit the length of this review, I'd like to touch up only on things that I didn't like as I'm sure the positives are thoroughly described by others. there are no collisions between units. While this makes the game easier, I kinda expected having to manage this aspect of CQB - avoiding a jam when moving in cramped spaces. And here instead you can stack your whole squad on one space like some sort of Shiva with 20 arms, wielding 8 guns, 2 tasers and a shield. And it's a very valid tactic. as an aside to the above, there is also no friendly fire though I don't mind. there are multi-layered levels (ex. a house with an additional floor) but time moves forward only on the floor you are observing. This is an engine deficiency acknowledged by the devs and it's here to stay. Sort of embarassing. the interface used for drawing paths is pretty clunky. It's hard to use precisely, and even harder if you're trying to map out a complicated plan in a tight space because of all the markers. It took me like 3 hours and some googling to figure out how to strafe. The option to ""bend"" an existing path is either missing or I haven't found it.  there is a fair amount of bugs, particularly related to handcuffing. in the hardest, endgame levels you are kinda undergunned and seriously struggling to defeat the body armor of enemies. I appreciate that police arsenals are not the same as military, yet it feels wrong. there is a bit too much randomness in the outcome of firefights. Even the best plan will sometimes be defeated by RNG.But yeah, in the end I agree with the Overwhelmingly Positive rating. This game will satisfy almost any fan of tactical combat. It's extremely addictive and feels rewarding to improve in.			"

												I had the pleasure of looking at DoorKickers way back in Alpha and then again at the full release version. I'm glad it made it all the way through. It reminds me a lot of the tactical planner in pre-Raven Shield Rainbow Six games. You can carefully plan out your teams entry into an area swarming of enemies and maybe even hostages or adapt a plan on the fly. It can be pretty challenging too! The game has a fair amount of pre-made content for the price and also offers a stage builder to extend that further. KillHouse Games provided me with a review copy to produce a first impressions video. If you'd like to see the game in motion and hear some more thoughts consider checking out the video below.

												A lot of people compare Door Kickers to Breach & Clear, and even The Masterplan. Where this is probably a good comparison in terms of genre and what to expect, Door Kickers is far more fluid and boasts a rather active community giving the game experience a slight edge over Breach & Clear and perhaps a lasting experience.The concept is pretty simple. You run a SWAT-like squad which you are able to level up through single missions (""training"") and get to equip them with weapon and armour upgrades as you complete missions, level up your squad and gain ""roster stars"". These you spend on upgrades. You can also gain a type of skill point that you can use to improve the 3 basic weapon trees: hand-guns, assault, shot-guns. These all become bigger, brighter and better as you progress and start to unlock other roles for your squad: breacher, assaulter, stealth and a shielder. The workshop community have already created a large array of mission rooms and campaigns, but there is also an editor in-game and random room creator that help to gain those level ups before tackling the storyline campaigns. This isn't your Real World SWAT team. Don't expect negotiation abilities, or actual SWAT tactics to retrieve hostages. The game borrows from SWAT. Once you can accept that, then the game is pretty fun. You can stop/pause to plot within the mission or campaign, or run it fluidly which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Fog of War obscures rooms and areas, so trying to clear out a biker gang hideout, or safely escort a VIP from a train station can be daunting, exciting and full of action if you don't pick the right squad members or plot your actions carefully. Leave no door unopened. Even if it is a toilet. Tangos hide in toilets.Overall, if you want something harking back to the old SWAT games, you may not like Door Kickers not keeping to SWAT regulations and realism. Otherwise, if you like using spy cameras to check out rooms for the bad guys, breaching with a shot gun, or using a shield guy as a decoy whilst you flank from behind some cars in a parking garage, you will probably really enjoy Door Kickers.

								Easily one of the most intense top down games I've ever played. The ability to have multiple entry strategies whether that be placing a charge on the door, shooting the lock, or tossing in a flashbang makes the outcomes of just a single room almost immeasurable. The AI is great as well. If you take a more stealthy approach, the enemies may not be watching the door waiting for you. But if you charge through the house blasting everyone with shotguns, expect them to be in cover waiting for your squad to barge in. Also, even though on the menu it says its in the ""Alpha"" phase you could mistake this for a finished game. I've spent almost 4 hours in it I think and haven't seen a single bug or experienced an issue. The best 15 dollars I've ever spent. I hope its finished soon. If you can drop 15 dollars, put it into this game. You won't be dissappointed.			"

												Well, what should I say? I played this game for quite a long time (mostly cracked (yeah-yeah, I know I know...)) now and after I saw that this game is so cheap at the moment, I instantly bought it. This game is unique. It's pretty intense and there isn't any better feeling if your plan works perfect. Really. Also, you need some time to get throught it. Of course you can do it like Rambo and just run throught the whole map, but if you want to play it right, like a real SWAT Team... oh boy that will be hard! Seriously, it's really hard thanks to the random spawns and co. If you want a game where you need to think about your actions, this game will fit you pretty well. If you want a game with some badass shooting, this game will fit you pretty well. If you just want to kick some doors... well, guess what? This game will fit you extremly well! Seriously, buy that game now, it's way too cheap for such an amazing game!			"

												Doorkickers in an awesome semi-realistic top-down pause/play Urban Ops tactical planning game (a lot of words, i know), focusing on police and counter-terrorism scenarios. It has exceptional value for your money, and the devs are decent enough to actually bring a good game out of early acces. That shouldn't have to be a plus, but it is.Your SWAT team is fully levlable with it's own skill tree, seperate from the leveling of each individual team member, and the unlocking of new gear for your team, which adds to the feeling of progression and depth of the game. There are a LOT of ways to complete most levels, and as you unlock new gear you can go back and solve a scenario in a new and better way, improving replayability. Your team members die permanently (and is replaced by a rookie police officer) if you don't restart a mission where someone died, which gives every tactical decission you make a distinct feeling of importance. For someone with basic experience with military urban ops tactics, gameplay feels intuitive and realistic in that real life techniques and equipment are successfull when applied apropriately within the game. It's rewarding that I can jump straight into the game, learn the controlls, and instantly see how a good plan works, and a bad plan don't, and know EXACTLY why.One of the few problems i have with the game (which is completely subjective, and perhaps even a part of the intended difficulty) is that as the maps become bigger and the enemies more numeorus it becomes VERY tedious to make a working plan beforehand, and you basically have to ""test"" your way through the level. Another problem I have is that it gets problematic to controll bigger teams when you want them to walk the same path but perform different actions and cover different sectors, because their waypoints and routes overlap and create an unmanagable cluster. There should be a better way to toggle between the units and finalize/hide certain units' actions (maybe there is, but i missed it?).Another thing I wish was improved is the intelligence and behviour of the AI enemies. Considering they are hardened terrorists and seasoned criminals they're pretty stupid. This is really a realism issue, and not a gameplay issue, as I do mostly enjoy the game and it's dificulty as it is.			"

A lot less fiddly/granular than Frozen Synapse but this makes it more fun somehow. Would love to see an XCOM mod/version with more destructible objects.Can be very random, a plus for some, as makes some scenarios much harder to solve.

Each restart round is randomised so your plan needs to be really good.

When you restart the mission after everyone gets killed, it keeps your previous mission plan so you can tweak it until you get the full 3 stars.

												 First ""tactical"" game I've seen in a while that actually deserves the name. One of maybe three games I've played ever, wherein you could actually use real-world tactics, and those tactics not only work, but they work in-game, for the same reasons they work in real life. Button-hooks, cross-overs, ""slicing the pie"", etc. etc. This could be used as a kind of ""sim-lite"" for real-world operators-in-training, who just want to see tactics in action, while exploring why they work. Beyond that, it's a fairly entertaining game, giving you all the gear choices, squad-building, and planning that you need for a game to actually be ""tactical"", a term that is either misused these days, or avoided for fear of losing the instant gratification and hand-holding market. With both one-off missions, several campaigns (with more to come, apparently), random mission generator, and Steam Workshop support, there's endless hours of play available. I do have some relatively minor complaints, though. For one, any tactical game that uses a weapon and gear unlock system breaks my immersion just a tad. Real world units don't have to unlock weapons and gear. They simply use what they feel best fits the task at hand. So I kind of wish they would have gone the classic Rainbow Six route, where everything is at your disposal from the get-go. Also, there are some rather unrealistic balancing issues. Targets wearing body armor are human bullet sponges. I've watched in amusement, as my full-armored operator unloaded round after round of 5.56 from an M4 into one of these vested ""tangos"" at point-blank range, only to watch the target giggle, scratch his nuts, wink at my wife, and blow my up-armored operator away with a few rounds from his sub-gun. I'm sorry, but no vest exists that will stop a full-powered rifle round without at least incurring incapacitating trauma on the wearer. But no mind, it's just a game after all. Just frustrating at times. I've also gotten the sense that the developers understood ""rate-of-fire"" to be more important/significant than stopping power, which is ridiculous. I'm not claiming to be one of them, but if you talk to anyone with any experience in a job where firearms use and training was in the job description, they'll tell you that 99.9% of the time, you're going to use that full-auto weapon in semi-auto mode, and you're trained that way for a reason. Accuracy and stopping power are what keep you alive, and rate-of-fire negates accuracy, and therefor also negates stopping power (because you're not hitting anything), as it increases. But again, not a big deal. It's just kind of awkward when you get the sense that your MP5 on full-auto, is somehow proving more effective than that M4 with well-placed shots.All in all, this is a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactics and planning! I've already put an obscene number of hours into this one, with many more to come!			"

												Ich habe das Spiel einige Zeit beobachtet. Das Grundkonzept hat mich von Anfang an angesprochen jedoch war ich sehr skeptisch was die Umsetzung anbelangt. Nach vielem hin und her habe ich im Sale zugeschlagen und muss sagen: Es lohnt sich. Natürlich nur für diejenigen die auf diese Art von spielen abfahren. Im Grunde ist es eine Huldigung an Spiele wie Rainbow Six oder SWAT. Trotzdem ist es eben was eigenes. Man könnte auch sagen man hat viel aus wenig gemacht und das Spiel ist der beste Beweis das es eben nicht immer tripple A Grafik sein muss um zu überzeugen. Die Spielmechanik ist einfach und intuitiv und schafft es mit wenig viel zu erreichen. Keine Komplexen Fingerverreckungen um einen Zugriff zu planen. Viel mehr ein rundes Interface das man schnell verinnerlicht. Die Soundkulisse ist gut wenn auch nicht perfekt. Wenn während eines Zugriffs ständig der gleiche Hintergrund-Loop abläuft können einem sogar US Sirenen mitunter auf den Keks gehen.Eine große Auswahl an Missionen in Verbindung mit einer ausreichenden Auswahl an Ausrüstung u. Waffen lassen einem genug freiraum und wem das nicht reicht der kann sich ja mit dem Editor befassen. Dazu kann ich allerdings noch gar nichts sagen da ich mich damit noch nicht befasst habe. Fazit: Ein feines Game für Fans des Genre, für alle anderen etwas das man im Sale ruhig mal ergattern kann jedoch beim Vollpreis wohl er nicht überzeugen wird. "

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

								An addictive time killer. Kick doors, kick asses. Shoot first, ask questions later.Missions are quick, so you don't get bored. The level editor\generator is handy when you run out of missions.			"

								You kick down a lot of doors. Or blow them in. Then you kill things. Or they kill you. Pretty simple. Every time you kick a door one of two things will happen:1. Your team will clear the room.2. ♥♥♥♥ will hit the fan and everyone of your team will die in a hail of bullets.Get this.			"

												I absolutely f**king LOVE this game. If this game appeals to you in the slightest, then bloody buy it! One of my favourite PC exclusive games ever, I just cannot pull myself away. Although I want to as it is so f**king enjoyable but the campaign is ridiculously short so far. However, there is over 70 single missions which sort of make up for it. I just can't wait for there to be more campaign missions. The game mechanics can sometimes be a bit glitchy and frustrate me, which ends up in my favourite soldier getting slaughtered and thus having to restart the whole mission. But, other than the short campaign and confusing (at times) mechanics, I can't think of a single fault with this game.Just. F**king. Buy it!			"

												Ich habe das Spiel einige Zeit beobachtet. Das Grundkonzept hat mich von Anfang an angesprochen jedoch war ich sehr skeptisch was die Umsetzung anbelangt. Nach vielem hin und her habe ich im Sale zugeschlagen und muss sagen: Es lohnt sich. Natürlich nur für diejenigen die auf diese Art von spielen abfahren. Im Grunde ist es eine Huldigung an Spiele wie Rainbow Six oder SWAT. Trotzdem ist es eben was eigenes. Man könnte auch sagen man hat viel aus wenig gemacht und das Spiel ist der beste Beweis das es eben nicht immer tripple A Grafik sein muss um zu überzeugen. Die Spielmechanik ist einfach und intuitiv und schafft es mit wenig viel zu erreichen. Keine Komplexen Fingerverreckungen um einen Zugriff zu planen. Viel mehr ein rundes Interface das man schnell verinnerlicht. Die Soundkulisse ist gut wenn auch nicht perfekt. Wenn während eines Zugriffs ständig der gleiche Hintergrund-Loop abläuft können einem sogar US Sirenen mitunter auf den Keks gehen.Eine große Auswahl an Missionen in Verbindung mit einer ausreichenden Auswahl an Ausrüstung u. Waffen lassen einem genug freiraum und wem das nicht reicht der kann sich ja mit dem Editor befassen. Dazu kann ich allerdings noch gar nichts sagen da ich mich damit noch nicht befasst habe. Fazit: Ein feines Game für Fans des Genre, für alle anderen etwas das man im Sale ruhig mal ergattern kann jedoch beim Vollpreis wohl er nicht überzeugen wird. "

								Very good tactical/party based strategy game with RPG elements like skill trees, recruits level up as they get experience, etc. For the low price, game is a great RTS with pause abilities so you can, if you wish, plan out the teams strategy until the guestimated end of a situation, hit the play button and issue ""Go Commands"" with num pad buttons without ever needing to play it like a turn based strategy.This game has a suprising amount of depth, steam workshop support with great themed addons(WW2 weapons, etc.) randomized scenarios which really keeps the game alive for me, and a full fledged campaign which I actually enjoyed playing through for the first time in awhile, even though none of my recruits survived from the first mission, to last mission, I still had veteran officers due to the games class/leveling system. Also re-placement of an officer in barracks  with a new recruit after you loose someone on a mission, can really throw a wrench in your long term plans in the campaign. Which only adds more depth and a desire to complete missions without loosing any of your team, which gives you a reason to go back and get that 5 star mission rating that was too hard earlier in the game, while you use said mission to train new veterans.

												If the trailer interests you in the game, then get it. It's as good as it looks.If you liked Frozen Synapse but wish it was a little more organic and less chess-like, this is your game.If you like re-playability through perfection, then 90% of the scenarios have medals that you can earn by beating it under one of three conditions. (You can do them all at the same time or in separate runs). 1) Lone Wolf - Complete the stage with one team member deployed. 2) Real Time - Do not manually pause the game from start to the end of the operation.3) One Plan - Create a tactical plan for your team, then succeed using that plan without any interference from you.Also a 3 star rating for each level. Did you beat it within mission par time? Did you lose any men?Tons of scenarios to keep you busy (100+), and even a couple campaign modes of increasing difficulty. (Not really any story, but there's links between each level)Lots of backdrops. Cruise ships, Grocery Stores, Bars, Police Stations, Autoshops, docks, subways, vacation homes... you name it.Possible Scenarios: Bomb, Hostage, Elimination, Execution (Hostage but with a timer), and Robbery.This game is amazing. Oh yeah and there's a mission editor and Steam Workshop support. WHAT. Get this game.			"

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

												Highly tactical game that is essentially about finding the best way to get your officers to kill all the Druggies, Terrorists, Junkies, etcetera. The action can be fast and brutal, or slow and methodical, with the multiple classes, dozens upon dozens of missions, and all manner of weapons and potential ways to win in the fast-paced gameplay of Door Kickers.Open-ended tactical action with loads of potential gameplay, PLUS Steam Workshop and an active modding community. This didn't win 'Best Tactics 2014' for nothing (Rock Paper Shotgun), and I say it shows. Rainbow Six if it was top-down and you were a floating policeman god, some may say (There's also mods to make it Rainbow Six). There's much more, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, I say.If you like what you're reading, I say go take a look at some (more, if you already have) videos before deciding if you want to spend money on this (because it's smart, of course). Highly recommended for fans of tactical shooters and strategy games alike.Apologies for any major issues or minor errors, I should be asleep. But Door Kickers.			"

								This game is awesome, who doesn't want to break a door down and blow a terrorist head off?I've played the game for a couple hours so far, it fun and very interesting, however, remember that this is still an alpha, so not even a beta yet, so don't expect everything to be polished or the game to be at its full. The game can be pretty frustrating at times, for example I don't understand the use of stealth weapons, it doesn't change anything, enemies hear you and come to investigate. I hate this, i like playing stealthy by as soon as one shot from a stealth weapon  goes off, enemies come to see what the noise was then ♥♥♥♥ turns into cluster ♥♥♥♥ central. I do hope they actually fix this, if they did then this game would definitely be on my top 5 game list. There's this a lot missing from the game, for example not all of the upgrades are available, there's no campaign so you just go through different stages and shoot at people. One of the most frustrating missions are hostage rescue missions, at first they are nice and all but after a couple stages, they start executing hostages, so if you break a door or shoot at someone, you have 5 seconds to reach the hostages before they are executed,  which isn't easy in a big house/office... Also, it seems SWAT doesn't care much for hostages, if they see an enemy and there's a hostage in-between them, they just shoot at them and kill the hostage, which is especially annoying since if you kill a hostage, or a hostage dies, it's mission failed. Don't expect it to be a Call of Duty like game where one person takes on an entire building full of terrorists, you will almost always be out-numbered so you have to plan ahead of time, and be ready to adapt when things don't go your way.  I would recommend this game if you like games like XCOM but remember, this is still an alpha and there's a lot missing. "

I very nearly bought the mobile version until i realised it is available on steam. this is the only game that has ever made me feel guilty about a sale its perfect for both keyboard and tablet modes on my surface, So far I can only see one fault with it. in the first campain I failed a specific mission over and over again because my units could not fire fast enough so the hostage kept getting executed. however it has a level builder, mod support, 6 campaigns with more on the way and loads of loadout possibilitiesthis game is well worth the £15 I should have paid for it rather than the £2 from the sale			"

												Door kickers is easily the best tactical game ever and will provide loads of fun.. Also becomes very intense when playing campaign mode because when a operator dies he dies for good and you lose all of his xp.. He will be replaced on your roster but with a new level 0 operator.. This makes every life important and the strategies ever more important.. As a bad strategy could mean the death of an operator.. Or worse, Many operators.. Overall I think this game is amazing and I enjoy playing it a lot.. If you are looking for a good tactical/strategy game then I highly recommend this game!			"

												Great game.  Very addicting, mostly short levels.  Only complaint is that it can get repetative after you fully understand how to effectively clear rooms and unlock all the gear that you're ever going to use, but it takes quite a while to get to that point.			"

												I'm only a bit in to the game, but already loving this game a lot. The interface is not always great (it's easy to lose track of each person's path when they overlap, for example), but I really like the premise. It takes careful planning and good coordination to succeed, which it should in this type of game. But the game doesn't make you succeed through repetition. It is possible to clear every mission on the first try if you plan well.			"

												This game has a lot of annoying UI problems - most of which are minor, but they add up - but other than that it's pretty good.The game mechanics are solid, if a bit unrealistic in parts. For example, enemies can hit you with grenades when you're inside a house and they're outside, down the street. (The grenade appears to go over the exterior wall of a house and through the roof.) Cover isn't very consistent. Some cars give you cover; others don't. It has an iron-man mode, which I appreciate. The unit classes are a bit unbalanced in that some are much more useful than others, but it doesn't matter too much.The game has you executing civilians without warning and without giving them a chance to surrender, so you basically play a bad cop in a police state, but then we're all used to games being murder simulators anyway. The game calls the criminals ""terrorists"", which is about as accurate as calling them ""communists"". I'm slightly bothered by the promotion of terrorist hysteria and the dilution of the word ""terrorist"" into meaninglessness, but oh well.The map designs are pretty good, but it seems that you either need luck or prescience to beat some of them without casualties, which is a bit unfortunate. The game comes with an editor that lets you make your own scenarios and share them for other people to play.The game doesn't have a manual or a decent tutorial, but you can probably figure it out.The developer is very active in the forums and frequently responds to questions, which I greatly appreciate, but I'm not sure how good he is at fixing bugs. (I know of at least one problem that he said would be fixed ""in the next update"", but that was in August 2014 and it's still not fixed as of June 2015. Maybe he forgot or maybe he changed his mind. I don't know.)The existing campaigns and missions seem like they'll provide at least 20 hours of play, and there are supposed to be more campaigns coming. I don't know whether the developer will make good on that promise, but it's nice that the game is supposed to continue to grow in the future.Overall, the game has lots of little problems that detract from the enjoyment but even so it's still fun.

												 First ""tactical"" game I've seen in a while that actually deserves the name. One of maybe three games I've played ever, wherein you could actually use real-world tactics, and those tactics not only work, but they work in-game, for the same reasons they work in real life. Button-hooks, cross-overs, ""slicing the pie"", etc. etc. This could be used as a kind of ""sim-lite"" for real-world operators-in-training, who just want to see tactics in action, while exploring why they work. Beyond that, it's a fairly entertaining game, giving you all the gear choices, squad-building, and planning that you need for a game to actually be ""tactical"", a term that is either misused these days, or avoided for fear of losing the instant gratification and hand-holding market. With both one-off missions, several campaigns (with more to come, apparently), random mission generator, and Steam Workshop support, there's endless hours of play available. I do have some relatively minor complaints, though. For one, any tactical game that uses a weapon and gear unlock system breaks my immersion just a tad. Real world units don't have to unlock weapons and gear. They simply use what they feel best fits the task at hand. So I kind of wish they would have gone the classic Rainbow Six route, where everything is at your disposal from the get-go. Also, there are some rather unrealistic balancing issues. Targets wearing body armor are human bullet sponges. I've watched in amusement, as my full-armored operator unloaded round after round of 5.56 from an M4 into one of these vested ""tangos"" at point-blank range, only to watch the target giggle, scratch his nuts, wink at my wife, and blow my up-armored operator away with a few rounds from his sub-gun. I'm sorry, but no vest exists that will stop a full-powered rifle round without at least incurring incapacitating trauma on the wearer. But no mind, it's just a game after all. Just frustrating at times. I've also gotten the sense that the developers understood ""rate-of-fire"" to be more important/significant than stopping power, which is ridiculous. I'm not claiming to be one of them, but if you talk to anyone with any experience in a job where firearms use and training was in the job description, they'll tell you that 99.9% of the time, you're going to use that full-auto weapon in semi-auto mode, and you're trained that way for a reason. Accuracy and stopping power are what keep you alive, and rate-of-fire negates accuracy, and therefor also negates stopping power (because you're not hitting anything), as it increases. But again, not a big deal. It's just kind of awkward when you get the sense that your MP5 on full-auto, is somehow proving more effective than that M4 with well-placed shots.All in all, this is a great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactics and planning! I've already put an obscene number of hours into this one, with many more to come!			"

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

												Ich habe das Spiel einige Zeit beobachtet. Das Grundkonzept hat mich von Anfang an angesprochen jedoch war ich sehr skeptisch was die Umsetzung anbelangt. Nach vielem hin und her habe ich im Sale zugeschlagen und muss sagen: Es lohnt sich. Natürlich nur für diejenigen die auf diese Art von spielen abfahren. Im Grunde ist es eine Huldigung an Spiele wie Rainbow Six oder SWAT. Trotzdem ist es eben was eigenes. Man könnte auch sagen man hat viel aus wenig gemacht und das Spiel ist der beste Beweis das es eben nicht immer tripple A Grafik sein muss um zu überzeugen. Die Spielmechanik ist einfach und intuitiv und schafft es mit wenig viel zu erreichen. Keine Komplexen Fingerverreckungen um einen Zugriff zu planen. Viel mehr ein rundes Interface das man schnell verinnerlicht. Die Soundkulisse ist gut wenn auch nicht perfekt. Wenn während eines Zugriffs ständig der gleiche Hintergrund-Loop abläuft können einem sogar US Sirenen mitunter auf den Keks gehen.Eine große Auswahl an Missionen in Verbindung mit einer ausreichenden Auswahl an Ausrüstung u. Waffen lassen einem genug freiraum und wem das nicht reicht der kann sich ja mit dem Editor befassen. Dazu kann ich allerdings noch gar nichts sagen da ich mich damit noch nicht befasst habe. Fazit: Ein feines Game für Fans des Genre, für alle anderen etwas das man im Sale ruhig mal ergattern kann jedoch beim Vollpreis wohl er nicht überzeugen wird. "

												I got Door Kickers as part of a Humble Bundle so I was pleasantly surprised when I got an awesome game that I didn't really intend to buy!This game is awesome. Great mix of paused and real-time gameplay. Can't really say anything good about this other than what you've already seen in other reviews.The downsides I've come across may be unique to my experience though, and are worth pointing out:1) The controls took quite awhile to get the hang of. I didn't feel like I had a clue for the first 3 hours or so of gameplay. This was off-putting at first. I almost stopped playing but was glad I decided to take a break and come back the next day and try again. It also helped a lot to turn on colored paths in the options menu. Not sure why that's not a default.2) Somehow I totally missed the ""Doctrines"". I'm not sure if this was ever explained early on in the game, but I was about 30 missions in before I realized that existed. I got to a certain mission that I had a really hard time beating, then was about to take a break. I went back to the main menu to quit and finally saw ""Doctrines: 9"". I spent those and then immediately destroyed the mission. They make a big difference! Missing it may have been totally my fault, but if it's not made obvious that they exist, it would be an improvement if they highlighted those at some point.			"

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

								Super little game. Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.If you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.  The idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.Advancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and ""Squad Doctrine"" group training options.Gear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.POST RELEASE additional comments:There are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.I've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.  If you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

												Probably the closest we'll ever get to another SWAT game. You get a selection of weapons and equipment to complete missions, from stun guns to stinger grenades to M4s. Then you're asked to complete levels in times that would make the SAS sweat. Tasks can range from rescuing hostages to defusing bombs, to simply killng all enemies in the level. Intricate planning is a must - one mistake and that trooper you've been so proud of will be eating dirt in a second. You're not tougher than the enemies, so be smarter. It's a tough, rewarding, fun strategy game with oodles of content (single levels, campaigns, and a mission generator). Well worth full price, and on sale, it's a steal.			"

I'll use my units to clear each room, one at a time, pausing to figure out the next steps. Does it always go to plan? Hell no, but i have a LOT of fun failing.

												Almost immediately after I’m spotted, the bad guys kill the hostage. I take a brief moment to unleash a string of curses and rack my brain. There must be another route I can take, another plan that would give this scenario a happy ending. I tinker with the map and reset, and soon I hear a meaty splat as the hostage gets killed again.Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that. Played from a top-down, pausable view, this is the game that happens when Rainbow Six’s planning stage grows up and finds a home on a modern engine. It is also one of the most finely detailed, cleverly executed puzzle games I’ve played in years.Fog of warEach mission in Door Kickers starts with a deployment phase. Within this phase, I see the target house as a set of blueprints, atop which I can change shooters’ equipment and starting positions. As missions become more complex, the deployment phase becomes where I make some of my most important decisions. Door Kickers is a great tactical game because it is a great question generator:Are there narrow hallways? Will all firefights be up close? Are there hostages? Do I have sharpshooter support? Is there furniture? Is there evidence to save? Do the bad guys have bigger guns than me? Every piece of information changes the ideal approach and forces adaptation.After the deployment screen, the mission begins with time paused. From the paused overview, I drag paths for officers to follow, change the direction they’re covering, and order them to breach a door. This simple array of options becomes a complicated choreography of death pretty fast. In later missions, my eight officers follow a dance routine with hundreds of steps, pauses, shooting angles, and go-codes. Giving these orders is straightforward and malleable, but the interface is missing some important functions. If I give two units overlapping paths (walking single-file next to a wall, for example), I don’t have any way of selecting one trail over another when I want to edit it. To work around this, I have my units walk behind and to the side of each other, but that’s frequently a poor decision, tactics-wise. With eight officers in a narrow hallways, it also gets downright silly.Some of the other limitations of this system are simply built into the game engine: there’s no crouching or leaning, so the game’s combat takes place entirely on a two-dimensional plane with straight lines. It rarely feels as flat as it is, but there are occasions where I would love to stack a crouched unit under a standing unit, and these are the times when the game’s simulation feels most like a puzzle game and least like a camera looking down on a real-life SWAT situation.

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

								The mechanics in this game are just top notch, they are easy to grasp, can be combined easily, offer a very deep tactical experience, but above all else, they are fun. I had to play the same mission about 20 times before I made it through without losing a man, and I had fun the whole time. Any game where you can fail over and over again and still be having fun is a damn good game in my book.			"

												Good game, many levels, hard challenges.I enjoyed the game a lot.But: Plan ahead, adjust when needed - this sounds nice.The downside to this: once you interact directly, all the detailed and time-consuming plan is voided.So one has to start to micro-manage :-(And especially for the harder/later levels: as time is often being limited, not all angles can be covered all the time.Together with random factors ... your plan might still work out once in a while just by luck.So replay often enough and ""Fortuna"" might roll the dices in your favor once.Call that realistic, but it started to annoy me.That said, good game and also an easy one to get back in.

												This game is great!I did get it on sale for 85% off, I don't think it would be worth the full price, but then again I must admit I'm cheap.Door Kickers involves strategically moving your SWAT units, taking down terrorists, rescuing hostages and more!I must say that the random map generator can be buggy at times because it may create a room with no doors to access the inside of the room, but from what I have seen, this bug is very rare.So if this is ever on-sale I consider this game a must-buy for strategy fans, and if you still aren't sure if you are going to like it, there are always other reviews, youtube videos, and the steam refund system to help you make your choice. So what do you have to lose? Give it a go! "

												Well, what should I say? I played this game for quite a long time (mostly cracked (yeah-yeah, I know I know...)) now and after I saw that this game is so cheap at the moment, I instantly bought it. This game is unique. It's pretty intense and there isn't any better feeling if your plan works perfect. Really. Also, you need some time to get throught it. Of course you can do it like Rambo and just run throught the whole map, but if you want to play it right, like a real SWAT Team... oh boy that will be hard! Seriously, it's really hard thanks to the random spawns and co. If you want a game where you need to think about your actions, this game will fit you pretty well. If you want a game with some badass shooting, this game will fit you pretty well. If you just want to kick some doors... well, guess what? This game will fit you extremly well! Seriously, buy that game now, it's way too cheap for such an amazing game!			"

												This game is a completely hidden gem. The content is massive and it's completely unassuming. I have been fooled by the top down 2D'ness of the game. Yet behind that facade of what might seem like a ""cheap"" game, are 3 campaigns, *80* (yes, EIGHTY) single missions with a variety of modes like 'Terrorist Hunt', 'Hostage Rescue', and a random mission generator to boot. Not only that, player made custom missions can be downloaded through the workshop.A variety of equipment are available, and it's extremely realistic. The added fact that all rifles are fired on single shot merrits mentioning, as firing assault rifles on full auto are only in movies or untrained armies. This game in my opinion, is far better than SWAT 4 or even the original Rainbow Six series were.			"

												Doorkickers feels a little bit like Rainbow Six 3, without the FPS part.You manage a squad of 2+ (depending on the mission) officers who have to clear a building, secure evidence or rescue hostages.Before starting the actual mission, you are to forge a plan of how to tackle the situation.You can give orders to each officer individually so that in the end they work together to clear the building as quickly and safely as possible.You may also give each officer different weapons, or a completely different class.Need a shielder? No problem.Or rather a breacher? You got it.A stealther? Sure.If you are not satisfied with certain aspects of the game, the modding community is doing their job for sure.From different/new weapons or armours, to completely new classes and obviously loads of user made maps.The cartoonish graphics are definitely no throw off. You will be way too focused on your tactics trying to keep your officers alive than to check out the beautiful flower pots in the bathroom.Just don't go thinking ""Easy peasy"". You will have your squad killed easier than one would think. A proper planning phase is half a victory.Now grab your gear and get on the truck. We are Oscar Mike in 5.

												Awesome game, simple graphics, 2D, and yet very fun. It's a tactical strategy game where you customize your own squad, names, callsigns, loadouts, and roles (like shield, stealth, assaulter, breacher and pointman) and assign them to missions, and there are a ton of missions, premade missions, campaigns, community-made missions, mission generator and mission editor as well. The replayability is enormous and you can just keep playing different missions for hours.Different objectives like hostages, bomb defusals, pure hostile killing, etc, The design of the plan system is very nice and well-made, you can plan out tactics and pause at any time of the game. You can make a whole plan from the start of the mission, or you can play a more real-time playstyle where your plan is improvised as the operation goes, or a combination of both.If you are interested in conducting anti-terrorist/crime operations(e.g. SWAT) and is not too picky with the graphics, you should definitely give this a try.  It's got the Rainbow Six/SWAT atmosphere but the gameplay style of XCOM converted to real-time.8/10			"

												Really fun game to play!Looks?Reminds me of GTA 2  but with better graphics.Controls?Your mouse is almost exclusively sufficient. Keyboard use only for Go codes (A, B, C, D), sniper fire and some CTRL (locked view) and SHIFT key to highlight only selected paths. There are minor problems with complicated plans when lots of paths overlaps (even using SHIFFT) but TBH you can always be more precisie or just fix it when action goes live. Diversity of missions?More than enough. Bombs disarming, hostage rescue, VIP escorting, arresting bad guys, dope raids and simple enemy elimination.Guns and equipment?Quite a selection, especially gun wise but almost everything must be unlocked. Still when you find the fitting gun for all of your classes the selection will be just between classes (at least that was my case). Good guys?Well there are only three main stats for each officer and they are progressing without your choice but you can feel the difference between good and bad shooter especially with bad aiming gun. Bad guys?Enought to make it interesting but could be quite more. AI is quite good and on default missions there is several spawn points for bad guys, so it makes it more interesting.Maps?Plenty of different and really challenging ones.Is it tactical?Hell yeah it is ... but when you master most of the missions and use of pause you can kill everyone with one guy ... mostly. I had a lot of sneaky situations and they are planned to ambush you if you are not carefull. Some rage but no rage quits and that pleasant feeling when you finally do this.Replayibilty?With random missions and maps generator? Big. With steam workshop and plenty of maps, missions, guns, unit looks etc.? Quite bigger. Is it worth it?Hell yeah!

												Door Kickers is a top-down strategy game that puts you in a command of SWAT team. You have your SWAT team on disposal and you need to kick many doors (hence the name) and kill many bad guys.You can plan your assault and/or move your SWAT members in real time, also you can pause the time to make precise instructions for troops.The biggest plus of this game is modding. This game is not out too long but there are many mods: total conversion, skin mods, weapon mods, levels which can be published to workshop from in-game so this adds to great, infinite replayability.So yeah, I recommend this gameTIP: don't give names to your squad members of your family and friends because they will get brutally murdered by a terrorist that you missed in that one corner where you didn't expect him "

								Door Kickers is basically the original SWAT/Rainbow Six from a top-down perspective.It has simplified the gameplay for a more casual approach.It supports mods and you can already download the Rainbow Six mod for a nostalgic trip down memory lane.Its simplicity does leave you craving for a proper Rainbow Six game, which we all know is not going to happen anytime soon.Hopefully a potential sequel to Door Kickers will have more complex ai and more depth.Buy if you are a fan of tactical games with more time spent planning ahead rather than the actual action.Avoid if you don't have patience.

												Edit: Apparantly there is an android version - it just isn't available for MY android units, unfortunately. Rating: 8/10Replayability: HighBudget: Too expensive - Once it drops to about 5 Eur, I recommend getting it. Lenght: Endless. This entertaining little title isn't a full game with a story and such. It's an entertaining small game with good functions and a cheap setup, that works really well as a minor entertainment module on a tablet - It's a wonder it's not out for android yet! This could even feasibly be played on a phone. It's a really fun game, especially for people who enjoy games like Rainbow Six, SWAT, Xcom or the old Commandos series. I'd say the game has less depth than the goldie-oldies like Commandos, and it appears to have no multiplayer function, which could have been interesting - You know, sort of co-op, each player controls half the available team and can see each other's plans. Watch a let's play of this title before you get it! I wouldn't say this is a game you're going to binge-play, nor is it a game you will play occupationally, but it's good to have on a windows tablet or light-end laptop for train rides, plane rides, killing time in lunchbreaks or what not. If you have an Ipad (I don't), the game will serve you much better - I hope it comes out for android too, as it would become much more usable for people in general. It's sort of the same ""type"" (not to confuse with genre) as FTL, the sort of game that has a lot of entertainment value without really having any real depht.

There is limitless content, the missions, the workshop missions, the generator, the editor, you just can't run out of levels.On top of just being a good top down strat game, it does really well at progression. There is many types of assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment at your fingertips to complete a mission. You must use your Officers to get their skills up, and condition them to get better at aiming, and reaction time.Overall, I rate this game 9/10.I highly reccomended it.			"

												Door Kickers is one of my favorite games. It requires you to think about every little move, and placement constantly. There is limitless content, the missions, the workshop missions, the generator, the editor, you just can't run out of levels.On top of just being a good top down strat game, it does really well at progression. There is many types of assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment at your fingertips to complete a mission. You must use your Officers to get their skills up, and condition them to get better at aiming, and reaction time.Overall, I rate this game 9/10.I highly reccomended it.			"

												Awesome game, simple graphics, 2D, and yet very fun. It's a tactical strategy game where you customize your own squad, names, callsigns, loadouts, and roles (like shield, stealth, assaulter, breacher and pointman) and assign them to missions, and there are a ton of missions, premade missions, campaigns, community-made missions, mission generator and mission editor as well. The replayability is enormous and you can just keep playing different missions for hours.Different objectives like hostages, bomb defusals, pure hostile killing, etc, The design of the plan system is very nice and well-made, you can plan out tactics and pause at any time of the game. You can make a whole plan from the start of the mission, or you can play a more real-time playstyle where your plan is improvised as the operation goes, or a combination of both.If you are interested in conducting anti-terrorist/crime operations(e.g. SWAT) and is not too picky with the graphics, you should definitely give this a try.  It's got the Rainbow Six/SWAT atmosphere but the gameplay style of XCOM converted to real-time.8/10			"

												Edit: Apparantly there is an android version - it just isn't available for MY android units, unfortunately. Rating: 8/10Replayability: HighBudget: Too expensive - Once it drops to about 5 Eur, I recommend getting it. Lenght: Endless. This entertaining little title isn't a full game with a story and such. It's an entertaining small game with good functions and a cheap setup, that works really well as a minor entertainment module on a tablet - It's a wonder it's not out for android yet! This could even feasibly be played on a phone. It's a really fun game, especially for people who enjoy games like Rainbow Six, SWAT, Xcom or the old Commandos series. I'd say the game has less depth than the goldie-oldies like Commandos, and it appears to have no multiplayer function, which could have been interesting - You know, sort of co-op, each player controls half the available team and can see each other's plans. Watch a let's play of this title before you get it! I wouldn't say this is a game you're going to binge-play, nor is it a game you will play occupationally, but it's good to have on a windows tablet or light-end laptop for train rides, plane rides, killing time in lunchbreaks or what not. If you have an Ipad (I don't), the game will serve you much better - I hope it comes out for android too, as it would become much more usable for people in general. It's sort of the same ""type"" (not to confuse with genre) as FTL, the sort of game that has a lot of entertainment value without really having any real depht. I find that I enjoy these minimalistic games a lot.			"

												It took a few hours for me to begin truly enjoying Door Kickers, and it was only after: A. I began to see it more as a puzzle game than a tactical shooter and B. stopped deploying 2-8 exact clones and diversified my squad.  This game has high replay value, a nicely paced learning curve, and creates genuine thrills when a plan comes together.  I have a few small complaints (mainly the inconsistency of the AI towards hostages), but for its price this was a steal for the hours I will continue to get out of it.			"

												GREAT game that was well worth the price (woo holiday sale!) Planning out your unit's movements and facings is surprisingly intuitive, and the go-code mechanic helps keep your guys coordinated. Your units feel competently trained but not godlike, and the enemies are challenging without being frustrating. Pretty much every time one of my units dies, it's immediately apparent it's because I forgot to plan for some variable/check that corner/messed up my pathing/some other personal error rather than my units not shooting straight.Each officer can be customized with different class, weapons, support options, armor, and a tool, and each choice feels meaningful. For example, if I want the officer to stay in the back of an open area and provide cover, I'll make him an assault and give him a carbine for range and stopping power and heavy armor since he won't have to move as much. If I want to run the same officer through a drug bust, I'll change him to a pointman (stealth once I've unlocked it), give him a silenced pistol and light armor so he can quickly and quietly run through the hideout and secure the evidence before it's destroyed.The game almost feels puzzle like, in that it encourages players to find the optimum route through each map to guarantee success no matter enemy placement (something the game tests by mixing up where the enemies are on each map) with a well though out plan, rather than simply winging it on the fly (although that is possible, especially if you want to make effective use of the spy cam). Notably, the player is rewarded on some maps for executing the perfect plan by planning everything once, then hitting go and doing nothing but watch the action. It maintains a good balance in difficulty as well. The game rarely feels too easy, but it also rarely feels frustrating or overwhelming in difficulty.Progression is surprisngly well thought out, starting players on a simple kill house with a handful of badguys and a pair of officers, cutting their teeth in before introducing door entry, different classes, hostage rescue, and arresting/escorting mechanics.I haven't messed with the ingame editor yet, but its very presence almost guarantees near infinite replayability. Currently, there is a wide selection of challenging single missions, and four campaigns (a string of 5 or 6 missions), with a 5th having a confirmed release date and more being promised.			"

												It's awesome. ""Overwhelmingly positive"" not only says it all but is dead-on.It feels not new but completely novel at the same time. I thought it'd finally be a game where you can just click play and enjoy it in between busy times (which you can) but so far it's only addictive and I can't stop playing.Planing out your raids, trying to get every little detail right, every little corner of the room covered is just heaps of fun. And I'm not even at the level yet where I would try to get the challenges done or challenge myself. It feels like one of those games where you keep thinking ""yes, finally someone realized that graphics isn't all and gameplay is the important part of a game"". If there are any glitches or graphics aren't good (it feels like they are just amazing enough for this game) than I haven't realized any of that because I'm completely sucked into the window in the middle of the screen where all the action is happening.

*** I bought this game during the 2014 year-end Steam sale, and played when I got back to my uni before the finals week, most of the time off-line (>80% of my playtime) due to a massive flood disaster. So at the time this is written, I have played almost 100 hours offline, and only 13 hours with Steam online, which is why Steam only clocks me as have played only 13 hours.Oh and one more thing: I like writing, so my review is going to be REALLY long.Now with that out of the way, I'm going to get to reviewing Door Kickers (DK).What is Door Kickers?You know what Rainbow Six (R6) is? If you don't, scroll down to the bottom of my review where I tell you a bit about R6. If you do, well, that's what DK is, except for three differences: DK is a top-down tactical shooter / R6 is an FPS tactical shooter DK is very easy and light to just pick up and play, whenever, wherever. Coffee break, lunch hour, taking a sh*t (if there will ever be a tablet version, which is very much possible if the dev bothers), doing your whatever thing with your laptop at Starbucks, etc. DK has you control a SWAT team with a considerably wide range of Law Enforcement Organization (LEO)-level gear / R6 has you control a bunch of hardened and specialized team of tacticool genius-level operator dudes and chicks bearing a very-wide range of military-grade toysThat's it. The rest, everything you remember from your fondest R6 days - choosing, equipping and leveling up your squads (with different classes), breach gadgets, planning your maneuvers, your button-hooks, wedges/pies, rescuing hostages, defusing bombs, capturing HVTs, retrieving intel/evidence, or straight-up delivering 'Merica to the bad guys - it's all there, AND THEN SOME: ""Doctrine"" system - a set of RPG-like skill trees, each specializing in different weapons and engagement discipline. DK is constantly updated with new contents such as campaigns and maps by both the devs and the awesomely capable community. DK has loads of awesome mods in the workshop. ATM there are: an R6-themed sound overhaul, loads of new military-grade weapons and operator skins for those who want a change in atmosphere, and tons of custom maps designed by the community. DK lets you watch a replay of your mission, record it with a built-in recorder, and even choose a point from your replay, and re-do the mission from said point. LEVEL EDITOR - need I say more?So, with the basic features explained, what are the pros and cons?PROS: A mix of casual and hardcore: play how you want - easy-breezy, smash and shoot your way into the sh*t (which will most likely get your team or the hostage killed), OR take your time with recon (slow is smooth, smooth is fast), OR a mix of both (scout a bit, get in and improvise as necessary). Like R6, watching the result of your hardly-worked planning go down (especially when it goes right), like when your team is smoothly moving in, covering every angle, or when they smash in hard and fast and smack the bad guys who's having their thumbs up their behind, is simply indescribable. Config files are easy to manipulate, which lets you alter the in-game assets (weapons stats and attributes etc.) to your preference, also makes modding easier Replay feature Considerable replayability Awesome community-made contents Devs that DELIVARRRRSCONS: MIGHT get boring once you've aced all the maps and campaigns, and have run out of custom contents to play around with, but that's a given with any single-player games. Last I checked, the replay feature is still a little imperfect, where it sometimes ""desyncs"" and fail to play to the end. IMHO the breaching features can still be polished, in terms of set-pieces, such as a more snappy flash-entry or frag-entry. Not enough non-lethal options: so far there's only the taser-gun, but the workshop is quick to remedy this by offering a wide array of community-made non-lethal options (the super-painful-non-lethal-but-I-might-as-well-be-dead-if-I-get-shot-with-this bean bag rounds, rubber/silicone bullets, etc.)So, do you recommend it?Does the leader of a popular religion defecate in remote areas of the forest?11/10 as far am I'm concerned, and I'm not even kidding.What in the hell is R6?You see, most of you who are below 20 most probably haven't heard of the R6 series, apart from the Vegas installments which are NOT what R6 really is. R6 is a hardcore tactical shooter where you control a team of counter-terrorist squad during various tactically-demanding operations, be it recon, seek & destroy, search & rescue, and bomb defusal. The R6 initiative, a fictional covert counter-terrorist organization born from the mind of the great Tom Clancy (a great, great author, despite the heavy political bias in his novels), specializes in going where the regular LEO can't go or has been terribly outmatched, where a swift and precise tactical intervention is severely needed, and where the faintest of the slightest hint of NATO involvement will stir up some real sh*t, so even the most specialest and tacticoolest of operators can't go. Oh, wait, that last bit is Splinter Cell. Sorry.You see, at least as far as I understand from my various encounter with Hollywood pop-culture, there are a few levels of domestic LEO, which deals in different levels of criminal situations: Some drunk guy smacked his loud-mouthed wife about? You send out a dispatch so the local PD on his beat will go in and check it out. Convenience store in a stick-up? Local PD. A junkie with an illegal 9mm he got from Motherf*cker Jones is holding his neighbor for ransom because he can't afford his fix? You might wanna call the SWAT to back the local PD up, just in case it really gets out of hand. Local gang drinking party turned into a violent shootout because of a domestic disturbance warrant serve turned a little too serious? A homosexual man and his totally straight crew decides to rob a sleepy bank, but it turned into a messy hostage situation? Definitely call in the SWAT, AND the FBI HRT. A maniacal cartel kingpin from across the border decides that the Narc, ATF and/or Feds have been too nosy and destroyed too much of their business decides to send a hit squad and shoot up a local PD HQ? An extremist militant cell rounded up and locked in a huge bunch of civs in a big library and set-off a timed dirty bomb in it? The UN conference was smashed in and every world leader is held hostage with demands of the US to hand over all their nukes? THESE, you call in the R6. Except for the last part with the UN? Yeah that's definitely Ghost Recon turf. "

												very easy to learn as the controls are quite simple, but quite an in depth game thats highly addictive.one thing i really love about this game is that it takes about 3 seconds to load to the main menu, after which everything instantly loads the second you click it. that means i can load up and be straight into it within a very quick amount of time.drawing a path for your team to follow is quite fluid, if your wobbly on the mouse your teams path will be too.insert commands easily onto that path, so they will CLEAR !  a room before moving on, strafe a certain direction, or wait for a go code.use the single missions to level up your team, unlock better weapons, shields, armor, tools etc by earning stars. once something is unlocked its free to assign to any other team member.once your team is good enough you can start doing campaigns.theres virtually hundreds of maps to choose from, and a steam workshop to add even more gear and maps.unlock new squad types like assaulter, breacher, shield and improve them by earning doctrine points to spend on perks for each class.weapon type and loadout will have a big effect on how your team maneuvers, its fire rate, accuracy, stopping power or clip size.assaulting an airplane to save some hostages? maybe the pistols will allow you to maneuver around easier and change targets quicker to fire off a few well placed rounds rather than trying to use a clumsy shotgun or spray machine gun fire about.use a camera under the door to spot targets, blow open the door, flashbang, give the go signal with a ""go code"" to assault rooms full of terrorists from different doorways, save the hostages, disarm bombs, and taze the guy you have a warrant for.i give it 80/100 dead terrorists			"

												The concept of Frozen Synapse remastered into a Rainbow Six vision. This game plays great and can be enjoyed for many hours thanks to the huge amount of single missions, the decent-length campaigns, the mission generator and the Steam Workshop support. Great buy, especially when it's on sale (got more hours in than some AAA games).Now go out there, breach and watch your corners. "

												In my years of gaming, I have seen many great products come and go. Great products like Rainbow Six and SWAT as they made their mark in the gaming world. You tend to look back on those games and ask yourself this question. Does anyone still remember those days? How they helped pave the way for tactical strategy in games?When Door Kickers came along, the answer couldn't have been more clear. ""♥♥♥♥ yeah we remember!"" What's good about the game:-The deep tactical planning, choose from a wide variety of weapons and equipment to plan your approach. (You can even change their names if you're into that sort of thing.) Use your troopers to their maxium potiental to get the job done and bring everyone home safe. Espically in Iron Man mode you will have to take your planning very seriously as every  trooper death only makes your job harder.  -Open-ended planning, missions can be completed in several different ways. It will be up to you to determine what is the best course of action. -Random enemy placement. In most if not all cases, the odds will be stacked against you. You will face off against several tangos (bad guys) armed to the teeth and not knowing for sure of how many  are there or their location adds tenson to the action. Just because you have a plan figured out, doesn't mean things can't go wrong. -The ability to do two different playstyles. The first being a pause, plan, action playstyle. Before your troopers get into the thick of it, you can pause the game and develop a course of action for them. Tell who to go where, where to look, where to strafe, etc. Then watch it unfold when you switch it to real time. The second being what I call wing-it mode. You can play the entire mission in real time and make things up as you go. So players that aren't into the whole stop and think style aren't forced to play that way. -Numerous amount of missions and counting. There are several missions to be completed in this game, all of which have a lot of replayablity to them. Single missions, campagns, custom player-made missions, randomly generated missions. It feels practically endless to what can be done to have missions.  Furthermore, as of the time of this review, the developers are still adding missions, content, and improvements to the game.-Mod support. Something about the game you want to change up? Things like new weapons, gear,etc? Odds are there is a mod that fits the bill and there are quite a few to choose from. -The bits of comedic relief. Though this game has an overall serious tone, there are bits of humor thrown in that is quite amusing to lighten the mood a little when needed. It's not obnoxious or intrusive ethier, it's well timed and unexpected.  I'm not to going to spoil them as I'll leave them to be discovered yourself. ;)I honestly can't think of anything serious to complain about with Door Kickers. It's an overall well made and addicting tactical strategy game that is worthy of your money and time.  Even at full price, you get a lot for twenty dollars.  "

												S.W.A.T. meets the original Rainbow Six planning interface with a plethora of missions, agents, weapons and achievements to keep the hungriest tactical fanatic engaged.  This game surprised me in how well it captures tactical close quarters combat in urban environments with such a simple yet effective presentation / UI.  The graphics are detailed and communicate a sense of realism without trying to be photorealistic.But where the game really shines is in the depth of strategy that is involved in developing a plan and executing it with flawless precision.  The only thing that gives that a run for its money is when things go horribly wrong and you still manage to salvage the mission through quick thinking, dumb blind luck and grit.  Rarely do you feel like you ""got away"" with something due to A.I. glitches which further elevates the feeling of success when you pull of a great plan.If you like strategy games do yourself a favour and give this one a go.

												The store page description said it clear: Real Time with Free Pause No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces Realistic but action packed Those points made me buy the game, and I was never disappointed. Door Kickers is best SWAT type tactical strategy you will ever play. The game offers many customization for your squad, many type of weapons and tools to choose from. There are tons of missions and campaigns, with ability to build your own mission and share it on steamwrokshop. The main things that made me really enjoy this game is the planning, the more you plan and make sure you use the right tools in right position the more of chance you will pass the mission, the beautiful thing that once you hit the unpause button you will see how your orchestrated plan going, and if it works as you plan and succeed, you will feel the satisfaction in such way that you will never feel it in any other similar game. The game use simple 2D graphics, but with many details to reload and recoil of each weapon.I totally recommend this game for any tactical games fans, it is great value of money. "

												What ""SWAT 2"" should have been, and what we all longed for it to be. A top-down/isometric strategic version of ""SWAT"", not the RPG/Action-based first game, but the squad-based TPS/FPS versions that followed. Unfortunately, ""SWAT 2"" was a critical and popular failure. Still, the promise of it kept many of us coming back to it, despite it's inherant design flaws, and managing SWAT vehicles was always fun.Fresh from the fields of ""Breach & Clear"", a top-down & isometric military CQB mobile port (clear and away better than most AAA titles) I'm pleasanlty surpsied this takes that concept, though admittedly without trying to, and brings it to the real time confines of SWAT CQB situations.Placed squarley between the simplistic, but involving ""Breach & Clear""and the sophistication and complexity of (some might say, overly difficult) ""Frozen Synapse"", ""Door Kickers"" is ""SWAT 2 - Re-Imagained"" (without the vehicles, of course).As ""Breach & Clear 2"" is going to ramp up the looks and gameplay for it's PC base, built upon it's on it's sales so far (taking it to preactically AAA standards), I have high, very high hopes that ""Door Kickers 2"" will finally be the ultimate ""SWAT"" tactical game we strategy nuts have always wanted.Unitl then. I have Tangos to take down, hsotages to rescue, and sitruations to control without being remonstrated by Samuel S. Jackson. Many, many challenges yet to face with my team of gungho ""Cold Zero"" sharpshooters.Honestly: 8.5/10, even though my time-in-game does not reflect just how enamoured I am with this gem.			"

												(To preface, this was originally written as a not-recommended and has changed back and forth many times. My thoughts are still exactly the same, but my tolerance of the problems has increased a little bit as time goes on. Take from that what you will.)If I could give this game a ""Neutral"" rather than a ""Recommended"", I would do that instead.This game has a lot of strong pros and a lot of strong cons. I'd recommend reading the details to determine if the game is for you rather than taking the recommend at face value!So the best way I can describe this game is if you take Frozen Synapse and SWAT (4, not 3) and combine them into a game with quick objectives and short but satisfying levels. You'll be tasked to take your organized team, breach and enter various locations, and complete various objectives such as neutralizing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retreiving evidence, and such.You can either choose to plan out your assault completely from the start and play it out, or you can organize it in chunks with a handy pause function. Pausing makes the game a bit easier but making a single plan can be very rewarding.The game has a mission generator (which is less of a generator since it basically grabs a random mission layout and randomizes the enemy and objective layout). There's a lot of content here for you to keep playing, granted you don't mind having a limited amount of variety in the way of objectives and how you handle them (which is not a bad thing since that's a lot how real scenarios play out - like the book).Real life tactics can come into handy play here minus a few key ideas such as leaning- though I'm not sure how it would work given its control scheme......Which is where the problems start to become evident.You see, the way you set a path for your SWAT members to follow is you click and drag them one. In order to place actions along the path, you create nodes on it by right clicking. This makes sense in theory but it has several hangups which severly ruin the flow. Rather than having to delete parts of your path manually to change them, you just pick a part earlier and draw from there which will erase everything that comes after that spot. Unfortunately, it's very easy to do this by accident and the game lacks any sort of undo functionality. This can result in you spending upwards to 5 - 10 minutes making an intricate path only to accidentally change the wrong team member's path or mis click, wasting your time having to redo it.The game also has a large auto-snap when highlighting notes, making precision very difficilt. If you have multiple teammates on a similar path with each of their nodes next to each other, the game turns into a frustrating pixel hunt trying to get the correct officer in the correct part of the path.The game also has some problematic design choices that clash with the subject matter. Namely that the game wants to you play very fast score wise (and some missions require you to be fast with as quick as a 10 second or less time limit for hostages) yet actively discourages fast playing with realistic health and mobility stats that change with weaponry and body armor. In order to get 3 stars for the mission, one of the requirements is to beat a certain time. This wouldn't be a problem but these times are very unforgiving, often forcing you to ignore your officer's safety in favor of working very quickly. Often you'll find that you won't have time use a spy camera or silently pick a lock as you'll compromise your score.Now, if score was only for personal gratification and leaderboards, I wouldn't have a problem with this design. However, you use the stars that you unlock in order to purchase other weapons, body armor, and tools. If you're earning less stars per mission, you're going to progress a bit slower.The progression itself isn't terribly slow, but it also feels like a system that's designed to limit the players' toolsets rather than give them options. It's restrictive and ultimately pointless as a lot of unlockables aren't worth it compared to the superior options. What you'll most likely do (and a lot of players also recommend this) is to find an easy generated mission and grind it until you have all the stars you need to unlock what you want. You won't be doing it for long, as unlocked items are unlocked for everybody (as opposed to per officer), I feel like this artificially extends playtime rather than actively engaging the player. This could have been done better. It's not a dealbreaker but it's also needlessly frustrating for the first one or two hours of play.This isn't to suggest that the game is bad, however. Like I already said, if I could give this game a Neutral rating, I would.While I didn't experiment much with it, the game has a really neat campaign mode where officers that are killed during missions are permenently dead. Since you also train your officers as part of the progression system, this can make for a really interesting dynamic where you need to take the risk of sending in your best trained officers to deal with a mission but have the possibility of losing them, or sending in worse officers at the risk of performing the mission not as well. It's not terribly fleshed out, but it's still interesting.The game can also be really satisfying when you're not fighting the mechanics or design choices. It's a really strong idea and it works well enough, but some of the execution falls a bit flat.If it sounds like these things wouldn't bother you much or you're willing to look past them, then by all means pick this game up- as there is a lot of fun to be had here. However, if you think these will bother you, then either wait until this game is on sale or wait for Door Kickers 2. Apparently some issues may be fixed there and I think it's worth keeping note of.Hopefully this helped! And yes, I know this review will have a very low number of votes because people downvote most negative reviews for whatever reason. So thanks for reading if you got this far!			"

												I consider this game a spiritual successor to the original Rainbow Six titles. You select your roster, change their loadouts for the mission, plan their points of entry and the paths they'll take during the mission, then you watch it all come to life. If you're quick enough, you can change your squad members' tactics on the fly in real-time, or you can just pause the action and make your adjustments from there. All in all, this game feels very good and it's easy to lose hours retrying one mission just to make it come out perfectly.Unlike Rainbow Six, you actually have to unlock all of the different weapons and specializations which gives the game a bit of an RPG feel, if not a bit frustrating for people who immediately want to use an assault rifle. There's multiple stock campaigns, and a good amount of user-created content as well. If you're looking for a true spiritual successor to OG R6, and are willing to settle for top-down graphics, this game is for you.			"

												PROS: Huge amount of doors you can kick. Also, you can kill many door owners who doesn't want their doors being kicked.CONS: There are doors that can't be kicked. Developers should focus in that issue as soon as possible.  Why every door owner is a NRA member? That's confusing for non american players and it's not explained by the game plot.SUMMARY:If you like kicking furniture to splinters and get into hard troubles with violent landlords, this game is highly recommended.Don't buy It if you have too much carpentry sensibility. Furniture explicitly suffers in this game.			"

												During a 50% off sale, the dev Vulpe told me this game was worth more than £7, and that it was the cheapest it was going to be. I quote him directly: ""The game will not be discounted lower than 50%"". I like to think of myself as a generous man, but his comment on the price not going any lower only brought out my love and desire to take on a challenge. The waiting game began. Months and months passed, and the summer sale had begun. I see Door Kickers with a 60% off tag, but my excitement is contained. Not even a grin or smirk is shown. I wasn't going to give in this easily. It's 3 minutes until the new daily and flash sales begin. I refresh the Steam store at 6PM on the dot. I browse the deals, and to my disappointment, Door Kickers has not been discounted further. A week passes and the 60% is still there.  Not a single daily or flash has contained this game. My mind is filled with Vulpe's manic laughter, I hallucinate him & Gabe knocking at my door. I have nightmares where they tear my wallet from my pants and spend all my money gifting Door Kickers to people I'm not even friends with. I want to take the plunge, but my instinct tells me it isn't over yet. I've been sitting at my computer for 4 days straight now. Just waiting for new sales, refreshing over and over. I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. It's 6AM. I refresh the store for the morning flash sale. There it is. Door Kickers, 75% off. I sit in silence at first. I feel relief, and I feel pain. A tear falls down my cheek, and I click add to cart. I pay £3.75 and the game is mine. I sit back in my chair as the game installs, and laugh like I've lost my mind. I did it, I thought to myself. I persevered and reaped the rewards.I'm 3 hours into the game, and I start crying. Vulpe, you were right; I can confirm this game is worth more than £7. Thank you for this emotional journey. Well played, Vulpe. Well played.			"

								Door Kickers. I couldnt say enough good things about this game. For just being in alpha with ""limited features"" this is probably been the best few hours of my whole gaming collection of stratagy. The depth of the stratagy available and the cool sound of ""tango down"" every few seconds. If you like rts/action games this is well worth its price. Infinate replayability with generated missions plus many hand crafted scenarios make me really anticipate the campaign they have to offer. Fun game, like the kind of fun i used to have when i first started playing games. BUY THIS.			"

Product received for free
												Playing this game for the first time felt like finding a hidden gem in my library. I got it in a bundle because I love team tactics inside turn-based games (UFO: EU child, here) but took my sweet time to try it. So happy I did.Fast-paced, mission driven game where you are constantly improving and rewards you with a huge sense of accomplishment. You can tinker with almost everything, creating mini-games inside the game, deepening the many challenges/goals that Doorkickers already puts in place for you.If you like managing a squad (roles,inventory) and sending them to fight ""tangos"" using a great mix of RTS with pause/pre-planning Frozen Synapse style combat, give Doorkickers a try.

												Wanted to log at least 10 hours into the game before I wrote anything about it.Now I have, so here it goes.This game. Is ♥♥♥♥ing. great.I'm the type of person who enjoys tactical games. From strategy games (Company of Heroes) to tactical shooters (Arma series, CS:GO, anything involving tactics) to turn based tactic games (Arma Tactics, other misc mobile-esque games of the such) This game fits the bill perfectly for a tactical experience. It's fast paced enough to keep tensions high, and the ability to pause and issue orders lets you think before you act. Unfortuantely, I was raised in the Post-SWAT games era, so I've not had a chance to play SWAT 4 (anyone want to sell me their copy? Kidding of course); but this game comes about as close to the experience as I think I'm going to get. I'm well on my way to 20 hours, and the way I approach video games is, if I can get a 1$/1Hour of entertainment ratio, it was money well spent, and that is certainly going to happen with this game.

												Do you like a tactical shooter? That requires you to think, plan, and rapidly respond to situations? If not, then you might as well leave. If you try to run and gun your entire squad will die in no less than 5-10 seconds (I wish I was joking), This game is brutal, but it is so rewarding when you win without losing  a single squad member, and it's a helluva lotta fun getting there. Bottom line is that this game is incredible, but it depends on what type of game you like. If you're the Call of Duty, run and gun player this game isn't for you. If you're the Arma II, tactical shooter who likes stratgey, this game is a must buy. it's so much fun and best of all, it's constantly being updated! Honestly, get this game!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely fantastic. It is really engaging, features character customization and REALLY makes you think about your next move. It is very fluid and the controls are well made and simple to use, featuring real time strategy.Despite it being Early Access, this game feels very clean and finished. You have to clear rooms and save hostages, take out all the enemies and defuse bombs.The one and ONLY gripe I have is just the way the room clearing works. The game ends when you have killed all terrorists, even if you haven't cleared the other rooms. Personally, this slightly ruins the immersion for me and it would be great if the developers could fix this.Brilliant game and well worth the price. 9/10 :)			"

												This is without doubt one of the best tactical games I've played in a long time. This is the kind of game that the PC was made for and thrives on. It reminds me of a perticular title I played way back when on the Amiga, called Eagles Nest, which was fantastic fun and was also top down. We older players appreciate this kind of game where thinking is a little more important than blasting, and when on the odd occasion I do get to play, its good to play a game like this. This game has made Christmas this year in particular very enjoyable and I can't rate it highly enough. If you like tactics and a game you can jump right into, and is not too taxing this is it.			"

												Bought this game quite recently, but already I love it. It's a great overhead 2D game where you control a SWAT team and have to command them tactically through hostile situations. Here's a quick overview:PROS(+++) Mission Variety -- There are many types of missions: there are ""clear all hostiles"" missions, hostage rescues, domb defusal, arrests, friendly escorts, and even a mode where you must collect evidence before criminals destory it. The game has plenty of ""official missions"", which are pre-rendered maps with variations of these missions; you can play these many times to improve your results and earn medals. It also has campaigns, which make the injuries and deaths on your squad have permanence and require you to safely lead your men through each mission. Most importantly, however, is the random mission generator, which picks maps at random and assigns varying scenarios and missions, or genreates maps for you to clear; this is especially fun when you set the genration options to random and aren't sure what you'll get in terms of enemy strength. Finally, there is a map editor and the ability to download other people's maps, and with the devs themselves adding new missions and campaigns as the game goes on, the challenges won't likely run out anytime soon.(++) Squad Scaling -- Throwing a little RPG into the mix, the game provides you with experience -- both for each trooper and the squad as a whole -- after each mission. These can be used to unlock skills for the whole squad, and each trooper will increase their own stats as you use them. You also unlock more weapons and equipment as you earn stars for completing missions quickly and without losing men, and its fun to level and gear up as you beat more and more missions, making armored or armed enemeies easier to handle.(++) Enjoyable gameplay -- The enemy varieties and randomness in each mission gives each scenario a freshness, and requires you to keep thinking through encounters instead of just doing the same thing over and over (although the restart button is there when you need it). It's a great experience if you've ever wanted to command a SWAT team and hear them shout ""Clear! Clear!"" as they systematically put bullets into hostiles.CONS(-) Controls/Interface -- Once you get used to them, the path-drawing/command-giving controls are fairly intuitive and work 90% of the time. However, as I've found with a few top-down tactics games, you don't always get the full level of control you'd want when working with your men. In certain cases, such as when two trooper's paths overlap or giving orders that stack commands on door opening, you'll misclick and put your shotgunner in front of your riot shielder or send a man through a door backwards. There are a few things the interface could do to alleviate this (such as perhaps showing unit paths one at a time, or giving a little more control over what order door opening actions are performed in) but overall it is a minor problem that usually causes little trouble once you know what to watch for.(-) Squad Scaling -- I know this was under PROS as well, but I found that my squad was fully trained and upgraded with the gear I wanted after only a few hours of gameplay. The rest of the upgrades, then, just felt like I was unlocking gear for the sake of using up my XP or stars, and now, though I still enjoy the missions, I've run out of things to unlock. Perhaps adding more unlockables or more squad skill trees would help keep advancement fresh as the game is played longer, though the focus of this game is on individual tactical missions and not squad progression.OVERALLIf you ever dreamed of virtually barking tactical decisions over radio to a SWAT team engaging hostiles, get this game. Hours of fun for sure. "

												This is a game about door kicking. You get to kick a lot of doors, under many different circumstances. You have a squad of door kickers who somehow get better at other things, but not so much at door kicking.Usually there are people on the other side of the doors you kicked. They don't like you and shoot at you. I can only presume they are upset because they would have liked to kick the doors themselves. You can buy better weapons and armor to deal with these unpleasant interruptions better so you can get back to door kicking.Some doors can't be kicked right away. You have to do things to them first. Basically, they're playing hard to get. But they want to get kicked, and you'll kick them eventually. You know they like it.			"

												For those who have struggle systems and wish they could cop Rainbow Six: Siege, Door Kickers is more than just an adequate substitute; it is a tactical game worthy of play and praise on its own terms. KillHouse Games has done its homework in terms of researching the qualities of guns such as the P90, the Benelli M4 (Joint Service Combat Shotgun), Tarvor, SAR-21 and more. This research extends to considering factors such as cornering with large weapons and reload speeds. For those looking for a good tactics game, they need not look farther than Door Kickers.Full Review at Geeks Under Grace	[www.geeksundergrace.com] "

												Tactical top down graphics SWAT game with the same buzz you get from a first person shooter game.Layout your plans as you go and tactically secure your objectives.Plenty of action as well as tactics.Endless replay value with mission generator and easy to use map maker, together with regular updates.

												Doorkickers is a fun, challenging shooting puzzle game with a tactical paintjob and some forgetable RPG elements. Let me start by saying that Door Kickers is not what I really hoped it to be: a spiritual successor to the Swat line of games. Remember those? They were the counter to most shooting games because you could get the best victory with the fewest shots fired. A careful and well-planned approach was more useful than  running and gunning. Being cautious was almost always better than being fast. Door kickers has none of that. The goal is generally to kill everyone besides your team that has a gun on the map. DK isn't a police simulator or even that much of a tactical simulator (for reasons I'll go into below)- it's a puzzle game. But it's fun and I found it delivered plenty. In general DK wants you to complete the mission without losing any of your guys and in the shortest time possible. This usually means killing all suspects but you're also tasked with preventing the execution of hostages and demolition of bombs. Keep in mind not only are the suspects absurdly numerous but they throw grenades at your guys. Yeah. There are also some extra goals for each mission, like using a single trooper, not pausing, or using only one plan. These are sometimes neat little challenges but other times are frustrating or, sometimes, impossible due to the design of the mission (some impossible challenges have been removed in patches, I suspect more will be later). As I said there's not much cautiousness allowed if you want the full score for a mission. Instead you go in fast and if it doesn't work, just restart and try again. Repeat until you succeed below the time limit. It seems the newly added campaign missions are a little less strict for time. You can build your squad but there's not much individualism there. You can put backer's names and faces in to personalize a trooper but that's it: no backstories, special skilles, interactions, etc. Fans of Jagged Allience (or to some degree Swat 2) shouldn't expect much here. Troopers advance in 3 skills as they go along but I honestly can't tell much of a difference between an expert and novice trooper. You can gain your whole squad certain skills\upgrades which are sometimes useful but many are bizarre in that they replicate what should be normal behavior. For example: being able to hold fire when not under threat. Given the micromanagement elsewhere I don't see why it's even an upgrade instead of an inate ability. It's really tiring to be trying to do a stealthy approach and the guy you've armed with a carbine decides to blow away an enemy across the map who has no idea what's going on, thereby alerting everyone. The ""skill"" in question would also be much more useful if it were a toggle rather than the way it is implemented as a button that must be pressed every time one wants to fire. I'm also not sure how a squad needs to ""learn"" how to open doors instead of noisily kicking them. I've tried both, and opening a door is easier and more tactically sound!There are lots of guns and devices. Most are redundent and add little but it's nice to have some variety. Some of the weapon stats are very unrealistic. It seems that a .45 caliber pistol is easily more powerful ('stopping power') than a UMP45, which is basically the very same cartridge in a longer barrel and therefore more velocity. Looking at the stats it might even be more powerful than a assault rifle! It doesn't make any sense and I'm not sure if it's as a 'balance' issue or rule of cool. There really is no arresting necessary, except for those missions that present unarmed subjects specifically targeted for arrest. Nor is it easy to arrest suspects, as they never voluntarily drop their weapons and the troopers don't give them a chance to do so anyway. The only real way I've found to arrest armed suspects is to tase them and then cuff them while they are disabled. This is a tricky and very risky move when there's more than one suspect around and there's really no reason to do it since putting a bullet through someone leads to the same result.   The enemy AI is pretty dumb. There's a mod to leave dead bodies on the ground instead of having them vanish and I think I know why it is not the default... it looks absurd how many bodies will be lying in the same spot. You'd think once you kill the first 3 guys who walk out a door there would be a change in tactics. That would be a mistake. By all means, keep shooting them as they march out as if they're cattle. The only thing stopping you is the need to occasionally change magazines (from your unlimited supply) and the time ticking away. But on later missions the poor AI is hidden with absolutely STUPID levels of armor for the enemies who, while still dumb, will manage to murder your troopers immediately upon seeing them from 150 yards away. ♥♥♥♥, why don't we hire these criminals? They're vastly better than anything the good guys can do. Plus they never have to reload (had a guy firing a shotgun at me for 2 minutes without pause). Friendly AI is also robotic (the only thing giving the bad guys a fighting chance in addition to their absurd numbers and lots of access points). You need to micromanage everything if you want to get a good result, to the extent where you need to manually direct the troopers in a 'slicing pie' movement to clear a doorway (otherwise they'll tend to sorta just charge in and promptly get shot). Troopers will respond to being shot... eventually... but that seems to be the only stimulus that will get their attention. They seem to be of two minds as to whether they'll address a threat in an area not specifically designated as 'their' cover zone. Usually this means they'll ignore it if it's important and engage it like flies on ♥♥♥♥ if it's NOT important. So if there's two bad guys and one is disco dancing while the other is moving to shoot the hostage, it seems like the troopers go for the dancer. Well, okay, can't blame them for that, but I wish there was a way to designate a target out of several visible. So if it sounds like I'm negative about this game, it's just because I wanted something a little more like Swat 2. But the game is addictive and if you buy it knowing you're getting a tacticalish puzzle shooter you can have a lot of fun. It's nice to play things out in slow motion and the RT\Pause action works quite well (on single story buildings). Watching the replay afterwards can be fun as it brings everything together. The dev-team seems responsive to the community and there is modding (as well as a mission editor). It strikes me as one of those games that just demands 'one more try' even when you should probably be out mowing the lawn. I believe I paid $15 for the early access and that seems to me to be a good price-point for the game.			"

Product received for free
												Playing this game for the first time felt like finding a hidden gem in my library. I got it in a bundle because I love team tactics inside turn-based games (UFO: EU child, here) but took my sweet time to try it. So happy I did.Fast-paced, mission driven game where you are constantly improving and rewards you with a huge sense of accomplishment. You can tinker with almost everything, creating mini-games inside the game, deepening the many challenges/goals that Doorkickers already puts in place for you.If you like managing a squad (roles,inventory) and sending them to fight ""tangos"" using a great mix of RTS with pause/pre-planning Frozen Synapse style combat, give Doorkickers a try.

												This is without doubt one of the best tactical games I've played in a long time. This is the kind of game that the PC was made for and thrives on. It reminds me of a perticular title I played way back when on the Amiga, called Eagles Nest, which was fantastic fun and was also top down. We older players appreciate this kind of game where thinking is a little more important than blasting, and when on the odd occasion I do get to play, its good to play a game like this. This game has made Christmas this year in particular very enjoyable and I can't rate it highly enough. If you like tactics and a game you can jump right into, and is not too taxing this is it.			"

								At first Glance I thought this game was going to be terrable, but I gave it a chance and purchased it. Then I started playing it, and it was actually really fun. It is kind of a puzzle game, that takes what most games would just turn into a call of duty style shooter and forces you to use real stratagy. I highly recomend getting this if you like RTS or Puzzle Games.			"

												Great fun, for a great price, especially on sale. Watch in rage or satisfaction as the plan to clear a mansion that you spent 30 minutes on either gets you killed in seconds or executes perfectly. Plenty of mod support too. I don't really have problems with the game (again, that price tag doesn't leave much room for nitpicks) but I wish there was more realism in weapon stats, more abilities when around doors, cover, enemies, hostages, etc, and prettier/more stylized graphics.

It's fun, there's different ways to get to every objective, lots of tactics involved.You need luck too, but that's just a minor thing, and it makes things even more realistic.Graphics are nicely done, sound could be better (so... my ""Angela"" has a male voice?) but it's good enough, maybe a few more character customization options would be nice.HOWEVER, there are two things that prevent me from recommending the game.BUGSI've just completed the ""Cartel Beach Party"" mission, it took me about an hour to get three stars in it. That's because the plan I was using (which is the one I think is best to accomplish this goal) relied pretty heavily in having two shields and two assaulters, with shields opening the doors to small rooms while assaulters had to flashbang and then kill the guys in the bigger areas, plus the final shootout in the living room. The problems here are four:1. Shields ALWAYS turn their back to a door while opening it, getting hit AT LEAST once each time.2. Shields sometime go through the doors before opening them, exposing themselves to enemy fire.3. Enemies can sometimes shoot through walls if they're close to a unit.4. Units sometimes get stuck in front of doors with their guns lowered, exposing themselves to enemy fire and not reacting.This is far more than what I can stand, considering these bugs compromised my mission to the point I had to restart it 20+ times to get lucky enough not to get hit.STARSThe Stars system is beyond frustrating. You get X stars based on how many stars you get in a mission, and they only count once (unless you get a higher rank, in that case the latest obtained stars are added). With items costing 10+ stars, and with stars being non-farmable, a poor equipment choice will doom your missions to failure.I got 3 stars on almost every mission up to the first rescue missions, and (probably) wasted my stars in not-so-good equipment. Now, I can still progress in the game, but I think my units would last longer with, say, a better armor.They really need to change the Stars to something new, or at least make them farmable.In the very end, it's a shame this game has these two problems. Other than that, it's a great game.			"

												A quick summary of a mission plan in this game.-Tactic works properly checking every corner and eliminating everyone in each room without setting foot inside.Killed a hostage-Second try you try to engage at distanceSomebody's in the room behind you-You have one guy watch the room while the other shootsEntry fails when your flashbang bounces off an enemy-You remake your entire team for assault and recon so recon check every room, extract hostages and lay down explosives for the assaults as well as collecting evidence, the assaults go in, set off the explosives, rescue any missed hostages and complete any remaining objectives. Plan for use works perfectly.Assault killed when a charge backfires and a terrorist comes out of the lavoratory. Recon die later to heavy fire.-You send one guy in, randomly with a shotgunMission complete in 20 seconds.			"

 NOTE: This review was last updated on 19 Dec, 2014 @ 4:49pm. Things I talked about may now be irrelevant. I will update this review in the near future as I have stopped progressively playing Doorkickers.As much as want to enjoy Door Kickers, as I am a big fan of Tactic RTS's , this one has given me the most frustation yet, and not in a good, challenging way either. Although my hours spent on this game at the time of this review is few, the movement mechanics have already hindered a positive impression from me. Often times, the fault in my plans is not in my ability, but in the broken mechanics of the game. When things work out and bugs such as shooting at the wall because the target is to my characters adjacent isn't a problem, the game is fun. Watching my team swiftly move in and clearing the area under a designated time feel rewarding and I can see what the dev's envision. But, having a constant struggle with things like redoing my carefully laid out plan because adding a step would somehow erase the previous ones, or, being unable to peak around the corner of a doorway because the action menu of breaching methods block my cursor from selecting my move node, breaks the experience for me. Among all my concerns however, the two big annoyances are when my team disregards the assigned command call (ex. Alpha, Bravo), and moves in on their own, and, when the units move before clearing a newly breached room. The work around for for the first issue is to redo my whole plan which, as mentioned before, is a chore that takes away from the fun. Although my review has mostly been negative, this is not a bad game at all. In fact, I would recommend you to give it as try as this review is soley based on my own critique. You may overlook these minor flaws and thoroughly enjoy this game. But for me, these minor issues were little details that became a major hassle as I played on.			"

												Good game, but there is one MAJOR flaw that's annoying me to make me give it a negative review: Sometime when you quit a misson during campaign, for example when you double press ESC, then instead of quiting the game, you're actually starting the campaign from the beginning(not in iron man mod). Something is very wrong with the game interference. This issur ruined my hours of gameplay and mood for playing it again.			"

												The game is quite fun, and there are some elements I'm excited about that are hard to find in other games. However, there are some serious flaws that made me not want to recommend this game.The biggest reason is the nonsense ""progression system"", squad leveling and classes. It simply doesn't make that you only start with pistols, but later, once you have ""progressed"", you can replay the missions with more and usually *better* equipment! It just makes the game easier and more boring faster. The classes determine what equipment can be used, and it's pretty arbitrary. For example,the point man class can only use pistols. That is, no SMGs(!) It seems the reason is because the pointman has to be fast. But come on, not even a small SMG? And the speed brings me to another point:Your 'troopers' walk at different speeds depending on their class and loadout. This makes sense, but it causes trouble; if you want to keep some formation while moving you will often find some of your troopers either running ahead of the others or lagging behind. According to the loading screen tips your troopers can shoot over each other's heads when in tight formation, but there's no way to know if you've achieved that. The speed difference / lack of proper formation also messes up timing.Synchronizing actions is a real hassle. You get four (4) 'go codes' which can be used for synchronizing actions. This is not enough! For example, if you want to stack up at a corner, throw a flashbang around it and then have your stack move out you will have to use two go codes: One for stacking up before your pointman throws the flashbang, and another to keep the rest of your stack moving out before the flashbang has been deployed.The planning editor is quite horrible. It's easy to make mistakes, and making changes is difficult or even impossible forcing you to delete potentially large parts of your plan.Lastly, I *really* hate when your troopers say ""no tangos"". It's too easy to misinterpret as ""tangos""!! It's quite minor, but it's been driving me crazy.			"

												The game is so great. I played an very very early alpha build and totally loved it as it kind of reminded me of original SWAT 1 and SWAT 2 games but with precision as a focus. At that point I was sceptical of it and I wasn't sure if it's really going to make it out of alpha and to the full product. Now it's on steam and it's even better than I expected with the addition of custom loudouts, full mod support, randomly generated missions etc.It's great and well worth the price. Only thing that it lacks is a borderless fullscreen.			"

												Very fun game. Simple but intuitive and also has tactical depth. The game also looks really good with some nice lighting effects and variety of missions from docks, to house calls and offices. I think also what is great about Door Kickers is the amount of workshop mods available. Some of them are brilliant and really enhance the game.Well worth checking this out.			"

								If you're a fan of any of the SWAT games or just like the tactical/spec-ops genre, buy this game. It's simple, yet unforgiving. The Devs constantly add what you would want in a game like this, and with a mission generator, you won't go bored. Defintely worth the money if you can spare it.			"

												I've played less than an hour of this game and I'm already extremely impressed with it. I saw that it was on sale during the Summer Sale and that it was cheap, so I bought it on an impusle. I can already say it was a steal. The game seems very realistic, and it is unforgiving in a good way. It forces you to plan every detail meticulously, and if one thing goes wrong, everything can go wrong. An incredible strategy game, would buy it again for full price.			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a really good game which I recommend to all of my friends, but also to all the internert strangers. At first it is daunting to get all the basics down, but once you have those and know how to work your team, it is an absolute beaut of a game. It always feels great when I manage to clear out a level full of hostiles quickly and quietly, managing to save all the hostages from execution. It is a simple game to use, but it is also challenging at the same time, as it is no easy achievement to gain all three stars on all the levels. If you don't get it until now - BUY THIS GAME! :)			"

												This is honestly one of the most satisfying games I've played, and I honestly feel bad for not having more hours on it in comparison to my thousands on other games. (My problem is that I don't play single player games too extensively at all really...) THIS GAME, is amazing if you like tactical and rewarding engagements that YOU decide who wins not by reflexes, not by superior weaponry most of the time either but by playing, rather out-playing your contestants and manuevering to victory. Yes, this is a ""Police"" game but that's really only in the sense that you save hostages and stuff so most of it is really comparable to military operations in urban terrain which is some of the MOST demanding, tactically speaking, kind of operations. ANGLES are either your friend or your enemy depending on how you work them, teamwork among your units is imperative, and rewarding is it ever when you do a whole mission without losing a teammember or not getting shot due to methodical and tactical commanding on your part it's amazing!! This game is almost comparable to Counter Strike in the tactical sense of needing to use your equipment to gain an advantage over the naturally-advantageous defenders and then capitalize on gains you make into their whatever it may be at the given mission. In other words, this is the only game I've BOTHERED writing a review for so far so you KNOW it's seriously amazing given that right??!!			"

												In most respects this is a fun, thoughtfully executed game but it is rendered almost unplayable because of the lack of an ""undo"" option. This lack, combined with the fact that it is very easy to accidentally delete the convoluted plans required to avoid pausing during levels, makes the planning phase of the game all too often an exercise in frustration. Until some kind of undo functionality is added into the game, I would not recommend it unless you want to play the levels in small chunks, pausing to issue orders every few seconds (thus removing most of the interest and challenge).

								A very promising early access game. You control a swat team from a top down perspective, and command them. It plays like an rts but with a pause mechanic, so you can pause the game whenever you want, and take a look at your situation and issue commands. The game really feels complete already, it feels polished and is full of content. If you run out of vanilla content, it has steam workshop as well. Definitely worth the small asking price of $15. If you like forming a complex plan, and then watching it all play out, this is the game for you.			"

												Simply the best swat tactical game u can ever have played!This game has a iron man mode and for those who dont know what that is it basically means if a person dies in ur team he stays dead forever.U can customize ur swat members which adds a bit more depth to ur squad as u try to keep urself or even ur friends alive XD ur swat members after every campaign and ur swat members WILL DIE sometimes due to bad luck, bad planning etc..BUT ur swat members who died will be replenish with fresh recruits after every campaign. Gameplay....Simply amazing...U will start of as a rookie squad of swat members and u will gradually build them up to higher lvls and u will definitelty want them to come back alive trust me XD and increase ur squads level to unlock 4 classes currently.Which all play out very differently.The assaulter who wields the mg, The shield guy who is basically a meat shield for ur men and the pointmen who are very mobile so that they can get to the hostages fast before they are killed.....After every mission u get rosters which are basically points for u to buy new weapons, armour, gadgets ..etc for ur swat team.Now mods also extend this game's life as modders mod this game with new campaigns and levels which increases the replaypility which is awesome!A must have for hardcore players who love strategy :)			"

												I bought this thinking it would be similar to Frozen Synapse, but more recent version and a different flavour - police instead of highly abstract. It is similar but not as fun and much more frustrating.The main limitations I found which ruined the game for me were:1) It's very easy to accidentally mis-click and delete your entire plan - with no undo button... To Bad(TM)2) No way to add waypoints in the middle of paths - other than to redo everything3) No way to undo 'look this way' command other than lots of nodes (which isn't really a problem, except...)4) Nodes cannot be moved.I didn't play much because I kept accidentally deleting my plans. But, I did like the door breach methods and the RPG elements (buying weapons, levelling up guys). Never got round to the Campaign, because it's locked behind a level wall - can't play until level 6.I really wanted to like the game, but the utter frustration!!!			"

												The game gets repetitive really quickly. It felt like I was just shoving my team members straight into a meat grinder the entire time and I found it nearly impossible to complete any of the campaigns. There are some serious balancing issues, the game seems to feel and react as if the player is supposed to be a master tactician; every mission feels like you need to play through it until you're sick of it, and then some. I memorized several of the single mission maps just in order to beat them and properly plan everything out. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that's not a fan of extreme foreplanning and painstaking grinds.			"

The game worked well and delivered what it promised, but maybe I was just less interested in this particular concept than I first thoguht.  I did think the upgrading and equipment progression mechnics didn't make a ton of sense in the context of the game, or should have been implemented differently.			"

												It could be a great wtih a real planning system and AI.The planning is too arcade and confusionary for a real complex strategy; if it were like the first ""Rainbow Six"" series, it would be a 10/10. It's so lame that even the old ""Commandos"" is ten time better than this crappy thing.Also, more important, AI is very dumb. For example, entry men shoots straight to the tangos even with a hostage in between, killing him and making the mission fail stupidly. Or the same mission will end in a success or a fail depending on the mood of your troops: sometimes they see the enemy and shoot at it, other times they are blind and wait silently to be killed.Different weapons have controversial effects: the entry men kills better with a mp5 than a M4, even at long range. The stopping power and the balistics is not even taken in consideration.Enemies are in number of 20, you're in mission in 4, while in real entries attacking troops would be at least the same.I can never imagine how the community can write mostly positive reviews, seriously, you have real issues with tactical games: you accept all the crap that comes to the market only because is happy coloured and runs on iPad.Paid € 2,58 with a coupon, don't spend more on this ♥♥♥♥.Uninstalled after 5 hours of game.

												Decent game, but definitely not very tactically deep, and certainly not very fun gameplay-wise. The gameplay itself boils down to mastering a room clearing technique, and once you figure this out, the game becomes very simple. Not much variety in the inventory, and frankly, once you unlock the Assault class, you have everything you need to beat the game outright. The RPG elements that are introduced are very shallow and don't really differentiate your squad members. The various roles in the squad are pretty superfluous, and at later stages, Assault is the only really valuable role you can take. Cover system is very mediocre, with your troops more or less being a gun that you point with your mouse. No dynamic AI, no functional cover shooting. What you have is a game that consists of everything that made the old Rainbow Six games good, but without the same polish that made them fun. Fun diversion for a few hours, but not an 8/10 game.

												Notice how most of the top reviews have under ten hours play time? Yeah. The game wears thin very quickly. Also, the enemies have random spawning on every map. This may sound fine at first, but it's annoying because someimes you do have the perfect plan but RNG desides to screw you. And many times your squad doesn't fire back at enemies and they just stand there to get shot at. It's a very shallow game despite what the tag lines say.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but is horrible, there is no good tutorial to learn the basic mechanics, there are no commands for your troops to advance without shooting, and waipoint to move your troops get stuck all the time with walls or objects. Don't buy it, it's really not worth it, you are going to play four missions and get frustrated by the control system. Besides, the ""campaign"" has no story, its just some missions pulled together.

												Despite being a pretty simple game, Door Kickers is extremely well implemented. The gameplay is smooth, challenging and quite exciting once you get going.The system it uses for upgrades is initially a bit frustrating, requiring a bit of grinding to get enough stars to buy decent equipment but once you get past the first hour of gameplay you'll have most of the end-game items you'd want.For once, the single-mission content is larger than the structured story-line missions to the point where I still haven't managed to finish them all yet. The challenges are a bit on the simplistic side though, I'd like to see a wider variety of bonus challenges (like finishing a map using a specific type of trooper, or without firing a shot) but it's hard to complain with something like 100 levels to master.Definitely worth a purchase, and certainly not unfinished content.

												This game is amazing. It's simple, fun, and easy to understand. Sometimes it gets hard but you can always start over. It's easy as in it throws you in there with no tutorial. LOL GOOD LUCK. It's fun to figure it out. The music is nice, the graphics are amazingly well done, and the animation is on point. Lots of tools for people who are really into strategy and also for people like me, lots of tools you can ignore and get the job done, just a bit less efficiently. (Try losing half your team, oops.) There is a lot of content, many missions and maps to play. Overall this game is well worth the 20 bucks. 8/10 P.S. Avast doesn't want anyone to have fun. There is an issue with this game and compatibility with Avast. I contacted their support and got a brief response. ""Hi, It seems AVAST recently started deleting .dll files from our game (even though they're from the known open-source ffmpeg project).You need to pause AVAST, check the game's Steam cache (which will re-download those .dlls) and start the game.If you try running the game with AVAST turned on, it will delete them again, so you need to keep it paused. Unfortunately we don't have a proper solution yet, since it's out of our control, but we're working on it."" Damn you Avast and your anti-Doorkickers campaign.

												For those of you who enjoyed the planning phase in the original Rainbow 6 games. This is a full game made out of that with a few extra features.For those of you who didn't, its a realtime tactial strategy game, played from a top down perspective where you deal with different situations by commanding your team to breach and clear rooms. kill tangos, and attempt to complete a variety of diffenet objectives and challenges.As you level up you unlock more abilities that improve your team as well as new weapons and equipment. Its very good and I highly recommend it. You can even install a mod that tha changes the sounds effects and music to that of the orginal Rainbow 6 Rogue spear. Sold! "

Early Access Review
								Absolutely the best top down strategy game out there, the animations are super smooth and the equipment and weapons to use is so expansive its unbelievable. You can literally play this differently every time thanks to the mission generator so i'll be putting a lot more hours into this game. Definitely Indie game of the year 10/10.			"

												I wish there was a way to give a game something in between a thumbs up and a thumbs down. Unfortunately, if I have to choose one, I have to give this game a thumbs down.It's not a bad game. It's just that I've played it before. But the last time I played it it was called Frozen Synapse. And that's the main issue. This game brings nothing at all new or improved to the table. If you've played X-Com or Frozen Synapse or any number of similar games, then you've already played this game.The concept itself is unfortuantely pretty thin. I mean, there's only so many ways you can blow away bad guys in different apartments. It gets repetetive fast, especially if you've already played similar games.			"

												This game screams out to fans of Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Metal Gear Solid. The planning options in this game are expansive, and offer players an outstanding amount of ways to complete a mission. There is no ""best way"" to finish a mission on this game. Assault classes have the armor to withstand bullets head-on, while stealth units are quick enough to clear rooms of enemies without alerting the rest of the area. This game offers so much in the area of replayability, by allowing users to pick different ways to breach, kill, or arrest.I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to, it's just an awesome game that definitely needs a buy if you're a fan of any kind of tactical, stealth simulator.

												Great real-time-with-pause tactical game. You have a squad of swat operatives and take missions with them to kill baddies, rescue hostages, defuse the bomb. Each mission starts with planning mode, where you can choose weapons and gear for your guys and plan movement and actions for completing objectives. Then you hit big red button and watch. You can pause and change plan any time, and even can play in real time, but this is latter is less effective. After mission you earn stars based on performance which you can use to buy upgrades like new weapons and gear.Highly recommended if you like squad-based tactical games.			"

												You have to pick locked doors before kicking them open, i.e. breaking them to pieces. Oh, and get lost with that crappy dubstep soundtrack.Moreover, have fun elaborating plans for a perfect rating - with RNG.I like the logic of the rating system.""Oh, the mission took you 30 seconds instead of 20? Bad luck, two stars for you.""Next try:""Sir, expendable trooper #2 got badly injured! I don't know if he can ever wield a gun again!""""That doesn't matter, you did it in 19 seconds this time! Perfect, three stars for you!""As much as I like challenges, they somehow have to fit into a game. These ones just break the immersion.Furthermore, the game doesn't really explain anything. The tutorial consists of eight video clips and it only covers the gameplay basics which are basically ""Spacebar to pause, left click to walk and right click for actions.""What about important stuff such as troop management, the ranking system, classes and doctrines? Nah, the complicated stuff you have to figure out yourself.The controls are extremely weird. Without strafing you don't have any chance at all, but sometimes your troopers suddenly stop strafing or they keep strafing when you don't want them to.I guess with a bit of training you get used to them and the game becomes more fun.However, this game threw so much ♥♥♥♥ at me in the first hour that I'm not motivated to play any further. I'm just gonna stick to the old Rainbow Six games.			"

												The general gameplay is nice. If you liked the old Rainbow Six games, where you could plan the mission and then lean back and watch the computer execute it, you're gonna like this game too. Its an easy time killer.However I expierience a lot of bugs, eg: sometimes the plan does not get saved when you fail a mission so hours of planning are gone. Sometimes go codes dont apply anymore. Worst case you have to plan a players path from scratch. Sometimes it is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to select the right player to give him commands. Those kinda things really do mess with the gaming expierence. Also when you want player a and b to push at the same time, but you want just player a to throw a flashbang, player b wont wait for the flashbang, but runs in immediately once the go code was given. thats plenty stupid...Although the game per se is nice for the money, I dont recommend it, until those problems get fixed.

												It's a really good tactics game. Pros - Tons of levels.- Tons of armour.- Tons of weapons.- Tons of utilities and support gear.- Voiced characters.- Alternate appearances for characters.- Workshop support.- Level creator.- XP which leads to upgrades.- Allows mission replays so you can see where you went wrong if you died. Cons- Female officers will speak like men. - Can be very difficult during some missions.- Caps aren't available when customizing callsigns OR names.- Steep price tag if it isn't on offer.- REALLY, REALLY fiddly to give your officers directions. 4/5 times you try to flash bang a door, then go through, the UI will just reset and make you redo your plan again. - Some missions are damn near impossible to complete. Fire gun. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Fire taser. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Try and stealth it, shoot the bloke who's closest to the ONLY hostage. Oops you failed it.			"

												I bought the game on summer sale for a very low price.  Despite this, I'm just under 2 hours and am submitting for refund.At first I thought was a decent pass of time.  But when I got down to actually doing the gold star objectives, I found it incredibly frustrating for a few reasons:-Very often i'll move from point to point with enemies in plain sight and not fire at them-Very often I'll be firing at an enemy but for some reason will disengage and move on to next point regardless of the fact that the not killed enemy is still firing at me-Cannot set rotation points at key spots (like, doors/breaching), which makes the ""Live Play"" or ""Finish in a single set of waypoints"" objectives near impossible without just random dumb luck of the positioning of the enemies upon entering a roomThe randomness of behavior of the enemies is actually a fun point and makes the replays decent, but when your own character seems to be doing things completely counter-intuitive to your purpose (kill enemies in plain sight), it's frustrating and even for the price ($3) I find I've gotten bored of the game quickly in 2 attemps to sit and play it now and I'd rather this money go toward another game.

												Although I was really looking forward to playing this title, I was very disappointed about the gameplay. The tactical side is unplayable in my opinion. XCOM and Breach & Clear are far better titles in that respect. The turn-based tactival gameplay in those games is just superior. In this game it feels clunky, un-fair and completely random. You cannot choose which way your soldiers look, you cannot get them to look around corners and stay in cover that way, the planning is awfull and that just turned me off.I do like the soldier-interface and the levelling aspect of your team's capabilities and weapons, but that just doesn't make up for the clunkiness of the rest of the game.I might just be spoiled by the above mentioned games, which might make this review a bit biased, but as there are alot of positive reviews for this title, I am not very concerned about the impact this review will make.

												This game should be awessome. It's both about action and tactics. Unfortunately it's totally overrun with gamebreaking bugs that makes it almost impossible to play. The biggest irony is that it's called ""doorkickers"" since the doorkicking mechanism contains one of the most severe issues in the entire game: You cannot place yourself in the doorway. By dooing that the dooropening UI hides the UI that allows you to turn in a direction, throw grenades or shoot until there is no threat. Also, backing to the menu does not pause the game, so if there is a tiny flaw in your plan, you want to restart the mission, your entire plan might get eraised. Another thing that drives me crazy is that it impossible to do small changes to your plan. Adjusting it early removes everything after that. So all in all. This game have potential to be extremely good, unfortunately the developers decided to not employ a single tester. It really shows.  "

												This game looks good, and for the first couple of hours of gameplay I enjoyed it quite a lot.Utlimately it turns out to be a poorly designed and frustrating game. First issue for me, no difficulty levels. We don't all have the same abilities playing this type of game, difficulty levels are a must for me.I just got stuck on the first evidence mission, where, as far as I can determine, it is impossible to get in the front door without alerting the goon sitting next to it. So I played a couple of individual missions to get enough stars to buy a lock pick device. Zero improvement, doesn't work at all.			"

												Has a lot of potential, but doesn't really deliver. It's a good game, but the leveling system restricting so much strangles the game and holds it short of being a great. Deployments limited to 2 people in the beginning and continue to impliment deployment restrictions in a force:resistance ratio is very restricting and is a real drag as it doesn't focus on strategy as much as bunch up and walk through together as opposed to getting stratigic assault from multiple angles requiring more consideration of strategic locationing. I'm not saying it's a bad game, I am merely stating that I wouldn't recommend it - though it is funny watching people get mad about my review.On the upside, this would be a great game for a modder.I had hoped that people would be smart enough to work it out, but clearly not, so I have edited my review.

												Amazing game, well worthy of all the praise it gets.The developers are constantly updating, tweaking and adding to the game, and I hear that there is even a multiplayer/co-op mode coming, either for free in a patch, or maybe as paid DLC. Either way, I will take it. These guys deserve every penny.One of the only truly great games to go through early access AND it actually made it to a full release AND it is still supported by the devs now.Very easy to just start playing, it's one of those games that is pretty easy to learn, but difficult to master, especially as the maps go on and get bigger and the enemy get smarter and much much tougher.Workshop support is nice, and there are some truly stunning mods out there, such as the highly rated sound mod that adds almost 100% realistic weapon sounds to every gun in the game, or the many many weapon packs out there that add great weapons from P-90 SMG's to the aliens pulse rifle (ridiculously overpowered, but still good fun).The progression system works nicely, the skill tree is good (although a little small), adding some nice ""abilities"" to your troopers, such as knowing how to use cover better, better aim with pistols or whatever, using double-tap to make sure enemy are put down quickly. All work nicely to bring your officers in line with the rising difficulty as you get to the tougher maps later on.I seriously can't recommend this game enough. Whether you want to plan as you go, pausing every few seconds, or you want to just go it in real time, dragging the path for your troopers and watching them follow as you go, or you (like me) want to plan everything from the beginning, hit the go button and watch your troopers die quickly :) The game allows any one of these methods, or a mix of all at once, planning a mission from start, then pausing and starting a new plan in the middle (because things start to go sideways), and then just keeping it going in real time, moving your troopers around the map to pick off any stragglers and/or moving any hostages to safety that you couldn't see whilst you were originally planning the assault.The game is great, does exactly what it says on the tin, and does it pretty much perfectly in every way.Worth every penny, and the devs definitely deserve their cash, 100%			"

												Great game until it isnt. Can't play because the settings are at the bottom of the page and for some reason the window was enlarged and now I can't fix it. pls put ur settings at the top of the page. I tried everything to fix this and it doesnt work. I have tried changing the launch from properties but like I said nothing is working. Even though I am upset, for the hour and a half I played it I had fun. I would say that if you have a windows you should get this game but if you have a Mac OSX like I do than you should keep in mind that messing with the settings can F up your game.			"

												Not worth the money imo.It starts out fun, but its gets challenging with some time. I like a challenge, but most times it is just sheer luck if you don't want to plan a attack.Planning is good, the tactics are great. But sometimes it really depends on where the enemies are. Sometimes not planning will work first try, and sometimes you wont succeed for many times.			"

												The game seemingly has lots of potential... but I can't quite place my finger on why I don't like it. The progression system is interesting I guess, but the actual gameplay is clunky. For as complex/time restricted as some of the stages are, the game really needs to have better AI. I get that it is a strategy game, but your AI end up doing boneheaded things or reacting in dumb ways to new threats. And line of sight down some hallways and at some angles will destroy your team without them having the opportunity to fire back.			"

												This game is a huge amount of fun, very much like Breach and Clear, for exactly 48 minutes, very much like Breach and Clear.By minute 50 you've seen everything the game can do, unlocked enough points to have what you really want, and the rest is just a varying degree of your OCD completionist disorder.Wait for a Steam Sale or Humble Bumble.

												great concept / poor execution. the controls are horrendous, as you are often struggling to get your troops to move the way you want. there seems to be two playstyles to the game, one where you plan out everything in advance, another where you pause/unpause as you react to the situation. the first relies on too much trial and error as map information is incomplete, and the second one is a nightmare because of the poor controls.5/10			"

												The controls are hard to get a handle of. It feels more complicated than it needs to be. More options don't mean better design. I wanted to love it but I had to drop it. I feel like this was designed for mobile, yet I can only imagine this being way more difficult on mobile.			"

												I already requested a refund. Good luck.Your UI is broken, selecting movement types, moving at all, moving waypoints around, removing or placing additional waypoints etc. are all impossible or break the gameplay flow, causing your character to spazz out, having to remake an entire plan from scratch because I misclicked somewhere.This is unjustifyable, for a game that looks like it was made for some game jam, released half a year ago, went through a lengthy early access period, etc. My apologies, but if you can't find the issues yourself with one simple playthrough, don't expect me to report it for you.
