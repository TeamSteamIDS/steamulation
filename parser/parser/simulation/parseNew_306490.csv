tl;dr version: if you like trains, steam, horn sounds and the spirit of exploration, don't hesitate to spend your 5 bucks on this and give it a try.Ooooh my, i used to spend hours and hours in this game back in the day, just meditating at all those toy trains doing their job from A to B, back and forth.For its price on steam now, i guess it's worth the money and you could give it a try. Yes, this game could've been deeper into the economics and route planning, the controls and menus could've been done better and there should've definitely been an order queue for multiple car and locomotive constructing, but eh, it's still a very cosy game to spend some of your time on.For: + pleasant graphics, music and atmosphere of the 19th century America,+ a campaign mode where you cross the country coast to coast developing your network,+ lots of locomotives and car types being gradually unlocked, + ability to upgrade trains, depots, city districts, manufacturing companies and what not as the trade volume grows+ ability to rob and sabotage your opponentsAgainst:- the menus and controls could've definitely been better- the limitation of train route length to 5 stations- certain technical problems (see below) IMPORTANT NOTICE: The optimization in this game kinda sucked a decade ago, making my PC lag when processing lots of trains in a widely developed railroad network by the middle of the campaign mode. I don't think this should be a problem with the modern PCs, but the code is kind of unstable as it is now: i myself cannot access savegame files as the application reacts with a crash to every attempt to load them. Be warned.			"

												Great game idea but written with a bunch of DLLs that date back many years. Causes very frustrating lock-ups every few minutes. Would be wonderful if somebody re-compiled it with later OSs and Direct X versions in mind.			"

Update:  After playing it again on Steam, ive noticed that the lag spikes are gone.played for several hours and no problem.If you like games like  Locomotion,Railroad,OpenTTD you sure would like this one.Original text:The rerelease of Jowood's Railroad Pioneer is a welcome one, the itself is from 2003 and is still a lot of fun.The gameplay is a mix of Transport Tycoon and Industry Gaint, with exploration and Train bonus upgrades.//----But be aware of the freezing problems after the 4th mission, this was in the orginal version also.there is a solution patch made by Jowood in the German version which could be applied to the US versionpatch name: Railroad_Pioneer_Update_107UP.exeI'm unsure if this is possible with the Steam version--//			"

												Best game ever as I remembered it….Mostly because I was younger and I did not get past the later missions. The game is ridden with bugs, which makes playing after the 5th or 6th campaign mission very difficult. Be sure to keep your track layout as simple as possible because otherwise your game will start mem leaking and ultimately crash. I really like the some of the mechanics in this game, eg setting up trading routes, getting the objectives etc. Most missions also have some extra replayability in it if you want to grab some extra medals, do some more missions, finish in your mission in a shorter time etc..I would really like to recommend this game if it weren't for the bugs/memleaks (remember to save often) But it still is the best railroad sim I ever played with some very good mechanics and gameplay elements.

												It is not easy but it is fun. You'll start off maybe restarting your missions a couple of times to find the right paths, You have to hire Prospectors, Trappers and even gunslingers to clear the way ahead. Th engines are realistic, as is rate of travel and carryng capacity. You'll have to be careful to keep a reserve for repairs too. I played this game to death 10 years ago. They fixed the bugs I remember, it plays fine on WIN 7, and just plug your IPod or phone in to play music and turn off the soundtrack. It is worth every penny of $4. Enjoy.			"

												It's an alright game. A bit basic take on TTD and one that feels sorta dated in comparison if only because of its 3d graphics. Overall it's worth 5 dollars or less, I got about that much out of the game; If you like games like TTD, go for it, but don't really expect anything much.If you're looking for an era based Railroad game or one with some depth, try Railroad tycoon 2 on here or download Open TTD.

Just have caution to save games cause sometimes game wont load your saved game and just give u a exception and this problem its not uncommun. =SCampaing could be a little longer and videos between missions have some audio issues. They have a good game in hands with a litlle more effort this could be a good game, but for now buy it only if u really are in the mood to play a train game.			"

												This game is fun in all respects. If you love train sims, building trains, building up the train stations, and all the economics of such game play... then this is the game for you. Kinda. First it's old and could use an HD update, second the mechanics are rather confussing at times, third... well the game just doesnt allow you to do high end train routes. For what its worth, they give you a fun wild west pioneer themed game, just make sure you get it on a deal. Not worth more than $5.P.S. Note: The game crashes at times, so save often.			"

												This game has some unique and cool mechanics wich haven't been seen ever in other games of the genre , however the graphics are a bit dated , even for 2003 standards and it can also crash sometimes . The game also suffers from a lack of content , besides the campaign mode there's little else to do in the game .Nevertheless it is a fun game , even if it could have been alot better .Final score : 6.5 / 10 ( OK )Full video review :

												This game only offers steam locomotives and its missions are positioned somewhere between 1850 to 1900.The game spans across the territory of United States and the missions let you build the Trans Continental Railroad starting from New York and ending in San Francisco. There are 10 missions and starting with the 4th, competitor AIs shows up on the map. The AI is not configurable and in some cases (and when you still didn't get the feel of the game) it can prove difficult. When fighting an AI your goal is to deliver more goods or transport more people to/from the city where you meet and compete. When someone wins the city, a monopoly sets in that lasts for 60 days.I initially owned the CD version of this game that had some major problems (memory leaks) in the 8th mission especially when building Oil Rig stations.  The steam version has a similar problem (not as bad) in the 6th mission. I would just stay away from those Oil Rigs or just save before building a station there and if the lag appears just reload the game from that point.When the game lags it almost becomes unplayable. The image just freezes and the days keep going in the background. You can end up losing 90% of your time just waiting for the game to unfreeze. But there is a workaround for this, you can just increase the bribe in the city hall and bribe everyone without having to work with your trains to send/receive goods. This only happened in the 6th mission for me, but Oil Rig stations may create additional problems.Railroad Pioneer has the potential to be a great track laying and train management tycoon type game.Unfortunately, it fails to deliver smooth gameplay mostly due to bugs/memory leaks. I would say that it is a good game and if you are patient with the bugs it's a must play for train tycoon fans. Definitely not a starter for those getting into this type of game. (The graphics are better than Railroad Tycoon 3 and my opinion is that the game aged pretty well, the multiplayer is also cool but has very few scenarios)			"
