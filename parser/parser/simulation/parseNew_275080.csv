												I created a pair of post offices, staffed them, bought them vehicles and a few amenities, set routes and fixed prices. All of that took roughly ten minutes. I spent the next 50 minutes doing other things in real life. I cooked some soup, put together a decent sandwich (it even had some lemon zest in it), made a banana split, went to the bathroom, and got some things from my car that I'd forgotten earlier in the day. The whole time, the game was at 3x speed. I occasionally hit ""ok"" on the dialog that told me the day was over, but most of my time was afk.I came back to the game and found that after a week, nothing interesting had happened. My operation flowed smoothly and made me a good return. Given a month I could open another office, given a year and I could probably edge out my competition with decent advertisements and expanded service.Here's the thing - the game played itself. All i did was set it up. There's no management, the prices were already reasonable, there were never any problems, and I didn't have to do anything. Other tycoon games give you a reason to keep playing - more things to build, more people to attract, more stuff to see. This one doesn't - it's over as soon as you've finished setting it up. It's barren and simple. It's so simple that I can't recommend it, because you won't get anything out of it, unless you're looking for a screensaver that doesn't move, but takes ten minutes to set up.Glancing over the developer's history, it seems clear that this is common. Produce a bargain bin game that's very simplistic, release a new one every couple months. And hey, they apparently make enough money to stay afloat, so cheers to that. Given how many games I play that were made by people who tried 10x as hard and came out roughly equal to this one, I can't really decry someone who is literally in business making this sort of thing.

												This feels like an in-browser flash game and I would play the hell out of this game 7 to 10 years ago.   The tutorial is patronizing and slapped together, but at the same time, makes the most basic spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.  I mean, if you want to show every person who plays your game that you really don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥ do exactly that. I played the game on normal difficulty first time through and it was like sucker-punching a toddler.  Did I win? Yes.  Was it satisfying? Only slightly.  You get a significant amount of cash to start with, so reckless expansion wins the game. Period.Other details just reinforce that the developers did not take great any care when polishing this game.  For example, in your post office, you can get different equipment.  A magazine rack, an A/C unit, etc.  A decent game would have a description for each like: “Looks like someone took out all the nudie mags” or “Keep your customers cool so they don't go... postal”.  See? I just made those up in 20 seconds.  Instead, each and every item just says “Customers like a post office with a/n <item_name_here>.”  Even the sound effects/""music"" doesn't have a long enough loop.  Either play this game on mute or prepared to listen to the same ""people talking in a store"" sound byte played every 6 seconds.  Disappointing.At a base prince of 9.99 USD at the time of this review, I cannot possibly recommend such a game. There are free mods for Skyrim that have had more love poured into them than this garbage.			"

												The potential is there, but the implementation is very lacking. The UI is very clunky, and the game is at once very micro-mangement intensive while making it hard to actually monitor status and figure out what needs to be done. Feels unpolished.			"

												Fun for the first hours, than you quickly realize ""how to play"" this game and you are left with a boring game that lacks any depths.The UI is terrible and requires so many clicks to setup a Post Office, making you wonder if it is really a Steam game or just a mobile game.There is no campaigns, no different scenarios, no customization (you can buy air conditioners, plants...but only in the same spot in all your Post Offices,lol...), no late-game (there are only post offices, forget about set-up distribution centers to tweak the flow of packages, airplanes to deliver between towns).Get it only if you can buy it cheap (got it in a bundle for 1 dollar along with other games), don't buy at full price, it isn't worth even 7 bucks.

												I was enjoying the game until I realized how much clicking I was doing later once you become established. Sadly there is no form of ease of use menu management it is point and click each item indivualy and repeat whenever you want to add a new vehicle. There is no buy X amount or saved vehicle settings for creating a new vehicle. The simplest way to fix this is to have a menu specificly for the different type of mail vehicles have a global < local < individual settings. Where the global and local only need to be read when the vehicle is created to set the default. What it also needs is a place multiple function where with mailbox you have click confirm on each indivual one later on I ended up placing 100 at once so either a drag box selection or confirm after you selected both or even better incorporate both. These are fatal flaws that make the game tedious to play. Other than that it's fun.			"

												******* Adding this on 6-Jan-2015******Game seems to be abandoned by the dev, no more updates, so yea... no patches, no fixes, no updates, nothing... So you should consider that before buying this game.. If you ask for my suggestion about to buy it or not, I'd still buy it, but at hell big discount, like 90% at least.This is the link to their first ever, and last seen updatehttp://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791435159972/announcements/detail/1424570746448987052This is the link for their so called ""community suggested updates"", which was never really botheredhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/275080/discussions/0/540734792228897478/********************************************This game doesn't have complex systems as compared to most of the sims out there, so I'll say this is a beginner friendly for those who are new to simulation games. However, I would not recommend it to those who are looking for sim with complex and advance system like Cities in Motion series. If you getting this, you should really get it while it's on sale! Okay ._. enough of my boring talk, let's take a look at my reviewOverall game play rating : 7.4/10 (average of whatever score i gave below)Money Value : 4/10 For $14.99, I personally think it's a bit too high, so grab it while it's on sale! The game should be around $4.99 in my opinion. (YES, I'm cheapskate x_x) Again, grab it while it's on sale!Graphic presentation : 10/10Kinda old school isometric artwork, it's simple, it's clean, it's neat, it's beautiful. BGM : 7/10You don't get to choose your BGM, but the existing one is good enough for us to play with.User Interface : 7/10Everything is simple enough, it's easy to learn and easy to monitor, but there's no hot key binded to any of them. Simplicity : 9/10Yes, the game is really simple, you probably won't go bankrupt any time soon. But it's still fun! Cons:- The game is slow... Even with the speed option, it's still slow at max speed... (might improve soon, because people are really complaining bout this). - Though the game's graphic seems really simple, the recommended processor is at dual core 2.4 GHz, I'm running it on Core i5 1.6 GHz, living in warm climate (about 32 degree celcius outside at afternoon), it caused my laptop to overheat without proper air ventilation (fancy word for getting table fan and cooling pad to give my laptop a blow jo...b). Pros:- The game is not dead! I mean, there's still update for improvement and bug fixes!- The game is not complex! (for those who don't like complicated sims)			"

												Post Master is an intriquing game. You have the ability to run your own privately ran post service much of the likes of UPS and FedEx. You start out in a medium sized post office in a small commercial city and you're trying your best to get your mail service up and running by getting workers for your post office, a fleet of vehicles, and their routes assigned. The game starts out slow though as you're only running a limited amount of routes and trying to invest in infastructure to increase your mail coverage of the local area. It's quite enjoyable. I haven't played much as of yet though I can at least give a brief overview of the features.You basically micromanage both your post offices keeping track of demand of your business while trying your best to get enough service. You can invest in new vehicles, add amenities to your post offices to keep customers/employees happy, and also hire enough employees such as customer service(front desk workers) and sorters. In the garage, you can choose the vehicles you want to buy but you must first unlock them as well as other things via Bonus Stars which are an alternative currency of sorts which is earned via the Missions system or District Competitions. These bonus stars unlock items to place in your post office, new vehicles, and helps pay for advertising runs. Vehicles though are from bicycles to big trucks with fuel cost, maintence, etc becoming higher but also allowing you to use less vehicles and take in more demand by increase storage capacity of the vehicles. However, you're also competing against rival companies for a market and coverage. Offer the best coverage, best priced service, and you might be able to conquer a city. On my current playthrough, i'm trying to get a hold of the commercial market in town before moving onto another town entirely. I have my competition on me but i'm currently at the biggest advantage in terms of price and coverage. I've invested alot in infastructure and i'm sitting at at over 60% of the market of the town as mine. Competition is a great feature of any serious business sim or any sim in general as it keeps you on your toes. It means that I must constantly invest in new infastructure in order to keep a hold of the market. It's stressful and fun all at the same time.The last thing is the graphics and music. The game style reminds me of Sim City, plays a little like Transport Tycoon, but it more focused on mail as being the games title. The music is calming but I wouldn't listen to it for extended play as i'd recommend for any deep sim fan who will spend hours on one game. The game also has very nice ambiance which without music would really bring the world to life. It's the one thing that I like hearing because it makes it feel like a real place. Kind of wish though there was vehicle traffic of general traffic as it would add alot to the game. It's great as is though and if any future updates come then I think i'll put tons of hours into it. So, if you're into micromanagement, I recommend this game. It's worth the price. Not expensive, not too cheap. You get what you pay for and it's awesome.Edit: So this review has been sitting here awhile but i'd like to add that the dev did one or two updates then abandoned the game. There's some short little fun in it every once in awhile but it's not a game that'll dedicate all your time. It's fun is the equivalent of a mobile game.			"

												This game advertized itself as some sort of super realistic, amazing, revolutionary game.It was not.This game has incredibly repetitive gameplay. Unlike games like prison architect, this game only has one thing to do: buy trucks and deliver mail. This game would be ok if it were a 99 cent mobile game but is in no way worth $14.99 though I have seen games worse than this before, this was the first of the terrible games that I was tricked into buying via false advertizing. Do not buy this game.			"

												Okay.  Where to start...Graphics:  Very simple, cartoony buildings and landscapes.  The game almost looks like a slightly polished SimCity 2k, right down to the building models.  It's uncanny.  In the large post office garages, the vehicle interaction and information tabs actually go outside the border of the building screen, and can be hard to see with the city in the background.Audio:  Not a lot of variety in the background music loop.  Note the singular noun there.  It all sounds the same.  Sound effects and incidentals are okay.Control:  Clickdrag to pan the window gets a little annoying at times.  I'd also like the ability to zoom out further to save me the trouble.Interface:  Simple, but it works 95% of the time.  An area I would suggest for polishing would be for changes in paths and other variables to go into effect while the game is paused instead of having to unpause the game, then pause it again to go back to what you were doing.Gameplay:  Incredibly uninspired.  A sim junkie can figure out how to game the engine within the first hour or so.  Get both your first and second post offices fully developed (which can take maybe two hours after you've taken the engine back behind the tool shed), and you can then just leave it running and walk away while the money pours in.  On medium difficulty, I completed all of the ""missions"" and eliminated my AI competitor by day 45 or so using the walk-away method.Bugs:  Surprisingly few and far between.  Kudos on this.Final thoughts:  This is a very shallow game across the board, definitely not worth the full $15.00 price tag.  This game is categorized under the ""casual games"" category, and should have been priced as such (if this were maybe half the price, it'd be a little bit more reasonable and falls in line with the one-and-done depth).  Save your money and spend it on something with a lot more teeth and replay value.			"

												While not as open world as Transport Tycoon or as expansive as SimCity, Post Master has a lot going for it in the business simulation world. Post Master is a great game from a publisher turned developer.If you ever thought about running your own post office, or are sure you can do better than your local post office, give Post Master a try.

I was very dissapointed in this because the controls are very bad and it does not get better with time.

												fastest gameplay speed is so painfully slow that a single day in the simulation takes real-time what seems like a half hour or more. And, after the workday ends, the clock continues to slowly increment instead of switching to the next day. It doesn't have much depth, but I wouldn't mind that as long as I could actually play the game. Instead, it feels like a screensaver after the first ten minutes. Perhaps if the game devs address the speed issue I will play it again, but as of right now it feels unplayable.			"

You can find mobile games for a 10th of the price that are much better, with better graphics, and have clearly had much more time spent on them.			"

												This game is kinda awful.  I bought it when it was on sale because I wanted the trading cards/badge.  I enjoy stamp collecting as a hobby, and I thought a PostMaster badge would be cute.  I tried to play the game though and... It's like a cheap, awkward, and really boring SimCity.I thought the instructions/controls were a bit confusing.  Or maybe they aren't and I was just too bored to really care to figure them out.  It's not like it really matted, It didn't feel like there's really any reward for doing a good job.And maybe these faults could have been forgiven if it actually felt postal related.  As I said before, I bought this because I have an interest in stamps and postal history.  If it were just a boring game I'd probably be okay with enjoying some cute postal imagery.  Unfortunately the whole thing looks uninspired.  There's nothing really to even signify you are running a post office or package delivery.  If it weren't for the shadows of generic post box shapes, I could easily assume I was running a bus route, street cleaner, ice cream truck, etc.  The most post office imagery you'll find in this game is from the trading cards.

												After a couple of hours of playing, all I can say is that the game looks like it has potential, but I kind of got the feeling that's all there is to it. Sure, I got my post office, I hired a couple of clerks, a couple of sorters, a few vehicles to collect and deliver letters, and I even got to buy another post office, linked them together and so on. So I switch to Fast Forward, watch as everything happens, and....  I'd say that's a nice start, but okay, what now? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a bad game, and the mere couple of hours I spent playing are hardly a fair chance, but so far, this game seems like it could be great foundations for a better game, but I'm not sure it's worth much on its own. I will update this review as I give this game at least another hour of playing before giving up, it's definitely worth at least that much. :)			"

												Want to love simulation games and can't wrap your head around massive numbers and calculations, strenuous start-up procedures and lack of proper tutorials?Step forth Post Master. Excalibur brings a neat little simulation-lite that will tickle your management requirements without drowning you in complicated elements.Take your post office to the top, crush your rival and own the city. As the game continues, the city expands and the oppurtunities increase, this also means you're constantly having to re-think post office placement and routes. My one gripe in the game is that there is only a single rival post office, having multiple rivals would be fun for people who find one rival too easy - you can eliminate them from the game completely.

												I see a lot of people being very negative about this game. Some even compared it to OTTD which seems rather harsh to me because they are so different. So I will give my 2 cents so far.This is not the best game ever, yet it is not a bad game either as portrayed by many here. You choose a difficulty. Set up your employees (post sorters, customer handling and security) and vehicles (bikes to trucks with each different costs and benefits). For each vehicle you have to set the service it will do (post collection or delivery for instance) and its specific route and working hours. After a while you want to expand and buy more offices to increase your coverage of the cities and thus increase your customer satisfaction (reputation). You earn stars for being better than your competitor and some generic missions like build 5 vehicles. Stars are needed for unlocking upgrades and advertisement.The tutorial is also not horrible. It does what it needs to do, although it has some spelling errors in them. The game is quite easy to get into. So if you want a more casual game than for instance OTTD, then I recommend it.I personally paid 2 euro for the bundle and I don't feel ripped of about it at all.Some also complained about the dev's not supporting this anymore. I have played 3 hours so far and I have only encountered 1 bug in which a popup appeared where it shouldn't. However this did not effect my game in any (negative) way. So honestly I think the devs delivered a nice little working game.Someone said before that you can make soup in the mean time: that is true. This is overall very laid back and you do not have to micromanage except for the priority deliveries which you have to assign a vehicle to. Apart from that, I only had to micromanage when I bought new vehicles and I would readjust all routes so no routes would overlap.			"

												Some people  did not like this game, but it is a decent Sims game. I'm fairly new to simulation games so this is a game starter game to have. The graphics are decent, music is catchy and the pace of the game is good. Seasoned players may not like it, but it is good for beginners. The tutorial is fairly good. I wouldn't buy it at full price, but if you catch it on sale it is a good buy.			"

												I have a physical copy of this game I would have played about 25 hours, my computer uninstalled a few programs and unfortunately, Post Master was one of them. I tried reinstalling the game and was given a Steam key. That's how I got it for free. On here at least.Post Master, when playing, I didn't think of this as the other Indie games I own. This game was too busy making me into bringing my company up from the ground.""To us! Competing with the big-boys now. Always ready to go the extra mile. Always ready to do whatever it takes."" ~ Tom King (Here's the video if you don't get the reference and haven't watched good TV in a while.)You could tell how happy I was to be succeeding.Although this game is not graphically amazing, the gameplay is a solid 9.5/10. But I think the music is a 10. I'll run the game and leave the intro music running while I'm doing something else.I'd show my friends this game, then nag them to buy it. So get it or I'll nag you to get it too :)			"

												The game's premise is fairly simple: dominate the market, overcoming your competitors in the shipping letters, parcel, and package business. The game starts by dumping you to the city screen and it's not intuitive what you should do. Though, the buttons all seem to have tool tips, there's no tutorial or explanation as to how to what you need to start your empire and it's a fairly large hurdle to overcome.Not only are you left to wonder what to do such as how to collect letters and begin the business end of things but once you get going it's still not entirely clear: will trucks sent out on a delivery run also pick up at all? No? If I manage to link two post offices will the driver also bring mail back to their home office with them?Similarly, You need to task a vehicle with 'post office transfer' it's not a given considering the 'link' screen and icon just kind of highlight the fact your post office isn't linked -- they don't actually enable you link them unless you've already set a vehicle to transfer. Every action is vague in what it encompasses.The one postive aspect of the interface is that there are a few good graphs and charts that show whether you're making or loosing money and how.And even overcoming the interface and being somewhat successful all of the non-starting items must be unlocked with 'stars' as well as money. You can't just buy a car with your money, you need to have the mystical in-game currency of 'stars' as well. Stars can be earned by doing things like advertising and getting non-steam achievements.Overall, this isn't really a great idea for a game but whatever merit there is in the idea is absolutely killed by the implementation.

												I absolutely love this game being a game from a fairly small studio which I honestly had never heard of but I definately will be chacking into their other games. I think this game is a great effort for a small company and they did a good job at it, its obviously not going to be anything like 'Sim City' or another big game like that but I think the idea and implementation of the game are great. One thing I feel I would like to see in a update or DLC or the second in the series is the game adapting more over time so new type things being available as you get further into the game. I would also like to see the map being alot bigger as I found it very restrictive so maybe when you conquer one area another place gets revealed as this then stops the game being limited.I feel that first glance this game is very confusing and at the start I know it is the first hour or so I played I did terrible I tried again and did I think that you need to play the game for quite a while to make it good.

												Overall, this game makes for an ok introduction to business sims.  But even a minimally experienced player will likely find it lacking in depth and challenge.  While I can easily point out several things that could use improvement, I find myself hard pressed to choose something that this game does well.- Control over your business is minimal and easily maxed out given a little time.  There are very few upgrades to speak of beyond vehicles.- While you can easily upgrade a vehicle from one type to the next, you can not do the same with your facilities.  Instead you must wait for another location to randomly become available for sale.- When a new facility spot becomes available, the prices can vary drastically, and may not even be capable of housing the size of facility you need.  No information is given to why this is.- Other upgrades within your facility are quickly unlocked, incredibly cheap, and give no real indication of how they effect your business.  Upgrades improve “customer/staff morale” but no hard data is given to how this effects your business.- You can spend money training your employees, but the effect is temporary.  If your staff is over-worked by physical load, it makes more sense to open another facility rather than trying to train them.- All of this is over-shadowed by the mysterious “fault” graph.  You are told, the higher a number is the worse the problem, but aren’t given any parameters as to what they are measuring.  You start with “Coverage” at near 100% “fault” but can open two more facilities in your starting town that will allow you to give every service to every block in your first town and it will only drop to maybe 85% “fault.”- “Competitor Fault” is another bit of information it gives, stating that it means “your competitor has better prices and coverage.”  But again, there’s no useful feedback to what that means.  What price are they transporting at?  Where are they taking business from?  You can see their offices and sometimes their vehicles, but nothing useful enough to actually compete.- The only thing that really requires an immediate reaction is “high-priority packages.”  Little mission bubbles that pop up every once in awhile.  You designate a vehicle solely to transport these; quick responses reward money and stars to unlock upgrades.  But keeping a dedicated courier for those packages is not worth the investment.  Package events may happen once every couple of in-game days and the reward could be easily passed if that same vehicle worked on deliveries/pick-ups  instead.In the end, every facet of the game can be improved upon.  There eventually came a point where I had no real connection to what I was doing. The colored sliders would go up and down, but there was no real feedback.  I had no idea how things were being changed.  I was watching a screen-saver of driving ants and climbing numbers.  Even at the discounted $3 I spent, I don’t feel I got my money’s worth.			"

												An extremely simplified simulation of a mail system that is nothing but boring whether you are doing well or poorly, and even on the fastest speed you have to wait AGES for days to pass. Try OpenTTD instead, it has mail amongst all the other transport system types in it, and is free, or normal Transport Tycoon on ipad. Seriously though the game just has you buy cars set routes by blocks and wait. The office upgrades feel arbitrary and the whole system feels bland.			"

												This game is very difficult. If your not good at numbers and have a fear of being in debt, don't play.Post Master is more of a tycoon game, you make post offices, create routes, transfer mail, and set the price. If your prices are high, you'll fail instantly. If you set them moderately, you'll make money, which means more transport.Overall, this game is my new favorite.			"

												Got this game in one of the Humble Bundles, I believe. The game seems promising at first, but you will quickly realize that after about 5 minutes of setting things up with your post offices and delivery/pickup routes, there is little to nothing to do for a considerable amount of time.I do not recommend this game.

												The tutorial is terrible, being both painful due to light blue text on a white background and because it's boring. You could sum up the entire thing with tooltips. The ambient sound effects are also terrible, as hearing the same clip of a bird chirping endlessly will probably drive you mad.Soldiering past those though, I quite enjoyed the game's basic concept and was having quite a bit of fun once I had the basic down. Then I got an error when I tried to buy a second post office. I closed the error message, only to have it pop up a second one. They popped up as fast as I could close them, but I was eventually able to close the Post Office Management option and ended the errors. So I was then stuck with a single post office for a while, as the game spammed me with errors if I tried to buy a new one. You can't actually play this way, so I decided to try and buy a new office in between error messages. I worked eventually, and I then went to link them (as otherwise they don't function). This brought on another error message. Closing it, I prepared to repeat the process again, but discovered the game was wise to me at this point. It locked up, and I am simply unable to progress due to the errors.As the discussion board is filled with similar complaints, I highly recommend that you not purchase this game until the dev has actually made it functional. And even then, I don't recommend it at $10; it's a casual Facebook style game, and isn't likely to hold your attention for long even if it did work.			"

												The graphics is charming and cute, which is why I bought it. However game play lasts for about 10 minutes. Once you setup your initial routes, purchase your initial upgrades and vehicles, the game plays itself and you literally have no part in this game. The game plays itself. You can check back once every 2 hours to buy more things, but why bother, there's literally no chance for user input.			"

												This postal simulation is difficult to master.  It can also be quite boring to learn.  I enjoyed playing it for the few hours that I did, but I find myself wanting to play other titles in my library since I have so many to choose from... If you love simulation games and don't mind one that might be a bit monotonous, you may want to give this game a try. Otherwise, you might want to wait and catch this one on super sale or in a bundle (like I did).			"

												It's a simple management game, but I find it entertaining.The game mechanics are rather basic, and it doesn't take much time to maximise you postal offices or unlock all the vehicles, but it fun if you like the genre.Definitely not a new game, but works fine at 4K resolutions. If it's out for less then 3€, it's a good buy, it can easily kill your afternoon if you're not careful.It's one of those old games that definitely makes you wish for a new and 'deeper' version to be able to enjoy it even more.

												I couldn’t help thinking, God, all these mailmen do is drop in their letters and get laid. This is the job for me, oh yes yes yes.After dinner or lunch or whatever it was -- with my crazy 12-hour night I was no longer sure what was what -- I said, ""Look, baby, I'm sorry, but don't you realize that this job is driving me crazy? Look, let's give it up. Let's just lay around and make love and take walks and talk a little. Let's go to the zoo. Let's look at animals. Let's drive down and look at the ocean. It's only 45 minutes. Let's play games in the arcades. Let's go to the races, the Art Museum, the boxing matches. Let's have friends. Let's laugh. This kind of life like everybody else's kind of life: it's killing us.In the morning it was morning and I was still alive.Maybe I’ll write a novel, I thought.And then I did.Don't try.			"

												Postmaste is a slow paced micromanagement game. If you like micromanage and/or you enjoy this game thematic you may like this game.I didn't find any particoular bug but the game meccanic is repetitive: is almost impossible to loose money so you just have to wait, expand, and maximise the income trough micromanagement.
