												In my opinion, one of the greatest unknown games of all time. The story is compelling, the graphics are good for the time period, and the acting is amazing for such a low budget game. You aren't going to be thrilled by how amazing the explosions are, by the thrills of the space-borne dog-fights, or even by the cutscenes. However, allow yourself to be immersed in the game and you will put at least 20 hours into the story. The best part is that there are two routes to follow, which means another playthrough is required to get both endings, with new charcters and ships to fly. All in all I give the game 10 out of 10. The voice acting is brilliant, the game is highly immersive, and for a game made in 2000, the graphics are great. I grew up with this game being one of my first PC experiences. Oh, did I mention? BRUCE CAMPBELL, the king of B-horror voices the main character. That should be enough to sell the game to anyone.			"

												What can I say? 10/10 would buy again. This little gem has been a classic and to my knowledge no space fighter game has been able to live up to this, unless somebody would like to make a recommendation.The intuitive nature to this game is beyond compelling, I've taken down multiple capital ships, overcome insane odds, all while strategically being able to manuever my craft and manage my shield and energy/ammo reserves. The ability to turbo and then slide is exactly something a space simulator should have, I'm not sure how I could play any other without it. The way the physics are set up are awkward, but make sense to how true space physics would be.While I am extremely attached to the gameplay, everything else is top-notch. The explosions aren't amazing but still satisfying, voice acting is great and while limited the playful banter between you and your wingmen is just added fun. The only thing missing? A second game, more missions/ships, whatever else. I might check out Freespace 2 eventually and see if it can truly live up to this legend.			"

												Classic game from Novalogic - it really brings back the nostalgia from the demo I got from buying Comanche 4 around 10 years ago, but goes a lot further. There are dozens of hours of gameplay and lots of customisation for your crafts, and that's without taking the other branch (the game splits into two about 1/4 of the way in, and you get to choose between fighting for the good guys or the rebels). 8/10			"

												I generally love the space exploration aspect of a lot of science fiction but I've never been able to get into to many flight simulators based around the genre. Tachyon is perhaps the most accessible flight simulator I have ever played. To simulator fans, it may be too simple but it was just right for me and I had a lot of fun playing through this.The game also features the voice talent of Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame.			"

												One of, if not the single most under-rated game of it's genre. Tachyon the Fringe takes explosive, white knuckle space combat and meshes it flawlessly with a compelling story and believable characters. Two divergent storylines play out with you at the focal point of the action; either as a Bora freedom fighter or an Ace fighter pilot for the Galactic Spanning Corperation. Your choice to join either the Bora or Galspan influences the outcome of the overall story, as well as what ships, weapons and components are available to you as you make a name for yourself on the fringe of civilized space.The game has aged fairly well, you can even run it in your native resolution with the help of nGlide. A programable joystick with force feedback support is highly recommended for the full experience.			"

												This is one of my first ever PC based games I ever played way back in 2000, and remains to this day one of my personal favs. The graphics though now very much dated, are very good for the time and are not a negative distraction today, the controls and gamplay are easy to follow and provide hours of enjoyment as you pick a side between the corporate Galspan or the independant Bora. Although the campaign is linear to some degree, the addition of small optional elements and side missions niecely mixes things up. Both factions have a distinctive storyline and ending, and are NOT just a rehash of the same missions with different flags (minus a few decisive overlaps, for good reason). In my opinon Tachyon: The Fringe is one of Novalogics best releases and if you enjoy space combat with a decent story, it's well worth a try. Rating: 4/5			"

Yeah, its not the best flight sim out there, but it is alot of fun in its realtive simplicity compared to Freespace2 or X-wing vs Tie-Fighter.

Tachyon: The Fringe is a classic in the makingFull disclosure--this game is old. So, be prepared to deal with some issues. For instance, the default resolution options are based on ancient CRT monitor standards. The graphics will not be AAA 2016 levels of beautiful. Your controller probably won't work well unless you do some fiddling with 3rd party software like Pinnacle Game Profiler. But to be honest, I don't even mind all of the issues because it is such a great trip down memory lane.I originally played Tachyon as a bargain bin purchase from an office supply store that I managed to convince my parents to pick up for the few dollars the store was asking. I was thrilled to find a first person space shooter that was fully voiced with stunning graphics for the time that allowed you to explore a nearly limitless star system as a mercenary pilot for hire. Oh, and you can play as one of two opposing factions for 2x the replay value. Plus, there is multiplayer, but I think my internet was still dial-up 56k when I first played this so that was a moot point back then.All rose-tinted memories aside, Tachyon still holds up remarkably well 16 years after release. The Steam version of the game installed and ran flawlessly the first time. As I mentioned, there are resolution issues (these can be addressed if you have some patience and technical know-how by using some external software--see the forums) and issues with joysticks/controllers (also can be remedied with 3rd party software). Aside from that, there is really nothing to complain about. Dialogue is witty, the story is interesting, graphics are functional, and the gameplay really does make you feel like a younger alternate universe Han Solo. Side bar: there are even controls to allow you to shuffle your shield power from front to back or to divert power from your engines to weapon systems to repair them faster--all while combat is raging around you and you are trying to blast some scavenger pilot out of deep space. Come on. You know you've always wanted to say, ""Divert all power to the front deflector shields!""So, if you're interested in a first person space shooter/exploration game and are patient with old games, give it a try. It is a steal for the $2.50 list price on sale while I write this.			"

												Althought the graphics are dated by now, the playability is still solid and Bruce Cambell sounds awesome as the protagonist.  Years before Mass Effect, this is one of the few other games that you feel like you're exploring a really well-concieved sci-fi world. Worth it for the voice acting alone.			"

												EVE's mission system (pre-EVE, by the way) coupled with the zero-G flight mechanics of Freespace form the core of an often-challenging and generally fun space combat sim with a sound and engaging campaign. The control scheme is daft and requires memorization of a full-size keyboard layout (the boxed version shipped with a huge trifold reference chart, which you may still be able to find if you're exceptionally good at Google searches). Also, If you don't have a joystick with twist/rudder support you might have to hit up Ebay for one before you start playing. BUT, if you've got the time and feel like playing a genuinely satisfying and entertaining starfighter game, this is one of the best there is.There is a multiplayer mode, and while the online servers are quite likely dead these days, I had some great times trying to match my wits, skill and ship upgrades against opposing pilots. The real draw, however, is the campaign. Based around jobs and for-hire missions, it'll have you chasing down troublemakers for private shipping magnates or joining up with the enlisted military against common enemies, all as a mercenary pilot voiced by none other than Bruce Campbell. The voice acting is substantial, in fact, and serves the story in a way that invites you to root for the Nathan Drake-esque protagonist's otherwise short and unremarkable journey from self-interested freelancer to potential 'good guy' with a cause. You can save your earnings to buy new ships, improve your weapons payload, and add new functionality to your ship's capabilities (lateral thrust, for example).On the downside, the learning curve is substantial, and if you want to play this game right you're going to need a flight stick with rudder controls. But smooth and enjoyable space combat and a broad range of available unique ships and environments to fly them in may have you coming back for more. Good 'ol Bruce Campbell.			"

												I overwhelmingly recommend. Honestly, I purchased this game for PC many years ago. When I saw it on steam, I decided to take a trip down memory lane. I couldn't have had more fun replaying what I consider a classic. Graphics were good for the time. New users may be dissapointed, but PLAY THE GAME. The gameplay is what really seals the deal for me, and is the reason I still love Tachyon: The Fringe. The flight side of this is intuitive, and fun. And, non-repetitive to boot. Both branches of the storyline are also excellent. It honestly saddens me that many of my friends who started gaming on PC have never heard of it. 8/10 It should honestly be 10/10, but the game is now quite dated. I think this will be a game long remembered. I certainly did. And, I'm glad steam has it. Trust me folks. There haven't been many better space combat simulators. Happy flying Jake Logan!			"

												This game is one from my childhood, and if you like a good space simulation game get this one.  The gameplay is deep but easy to get into, the voice acting is great, the story is fantastic, and even the graphics are great since it was created in 2000.  Is it a perfect game?  Oh hell no, some missions range from ""these are way to easy"" all the way up to ""This is impossibly hard.""  and sometimes the reward can be underwhelming.  But other than that it's a great game.I'm going to go in depth on the good and bad, you don't want to read this it is fine.First off, let's start with the bad:-There are no other races besides humans which makes no sense.-Some of the choices and missions have stupid reasons to be a thing.-Some of the characters are forgetable.-It's an extremely depth combat so this is only to be considered if you don't like learning quite a few things.Now that's out of the way, let me explain the good:-All the ships are varied.           This means all the ships are different.  Not one ship is the same on either side.  Just because the Mace is the Bora Variation of the Pegasis, it doesn't mean it's the same.  Same with the Battleax and the Orion.-The graphics for the time hold up pretty well.-The ships feel like their actual space ships, and you can do a move called ""sliding"" which cuts all thrust from your engines and allows you to continue in the way you were origonally heading.-The voice acting is great-The Stories are amazing, worth seeing if they could make a Tachyon 2-All the places are memorable-Both sides feel unique instead of just flip flops of the other.-All the missions are memorable in some way.-The combat is very deep and very interesting.-The Twilight for how beautiful it can be, along with how dangerous it is.-Bruce.  F'n.  Campbell.-Both sides feel like they're good and bad.               The Bora do feel like the insane phanatic collonists who just are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because someone legally is telling them to get off their new proporty and Galspan (the Galatic Spanning Corporation) seem extremely corrupt.  You can't really side with one or the other because they're both horrible, but you have to.  Bora you go with if you think they deserve their freedom or Galspan to try and get money to get you back into Sol space.  All the sides fight with different people as well, such as the barrons or dealing with different traders, thus it questions their morality.-The endings are worth it.-The weapons on both sides feel different.-The different paths feel extremely differet.  I know i'm repeating myself but if you choose Bora, you feel like you are flying a mining ship and using mining lasers.  If you choose galspan, you feel like your flying a proper fighter ship with proper fighing weapons.-The game stays its welcome and is a good length.TL;DR:I love this game too much and it's pros outway the cons.

												After finally evading the bugs, I can give this game the recommendation I wanted.  After blowing away my save and starting over from the beginning, ""Withdraw from Independence"" finally became winnable.  I also restricted the game to one CPU core in case of RDTSC-related weirdness, but that probably wasn't necessary.Tachyon is a great space combat flight sim.  The storyline is fairly compelling, the missions are interesting, and the environments are neat, too, even though it's in space.  The Twilight region is appropriately spooky, the lawless fringe has a number of interesting starbases, etc.  It's not quite as open-ended as some others of the genre, but it's not all shooting at ships, either.  I had a lot of fun with this in the mid 2000s, and I'm having lots of fun with it again.Details on bug:Apparently there was some weird persistent bug that caused the full Galspan force to be present in the Independence sector as soon as I arrived.  Let me assure you, that mission is a LOT harder when there's a destroyer right in your face as soon as you arrive.  Somehow, something I did fixed that, but those shuttles still went down way faster than I remember until I deleted my save and started over from the beginning.			"

												During the golden age of PC games this one was an instant classic. Imagine Wing Commander or Elite with updated graphics and fresh story. You got yourself Tachyon: The fringe.			"

												IF you have problems with the game starting, CHECK your VIRUS protectors QUARINTIN section. It may have hide the exe.file. As it did to me : )            Anyhow.......  the game is the BEST space single player game to date . The control  of your ship is still unmached by any other space game still at 2017.P.S. I played through this game back 17 years ago it's ashame no one can top this game yet.			"

												Yet again, another game from steam which is riddled with issues.  I suppose Windows 8 is as much to blame, but I can't recall having ever purchased a game from steam that has worked 100% correctly, if at all.  It is a credit to my own stupidity that I keep wasting my money with them.  So to begin with, to even get the game playable, took me a couple of hours of research and tweaking.  Then it seems at last, once I fixed the graphical issues, the game is still completely unplayable with the mouse.  I was hoping for a joystick game so this isn't such a huge issue, but be advised, that at best, after quite a bit of tinkering, the game will not ever function completely right in windows 8 as far as I can tell.   If anyone has a fix for the mouse issue, please respond!			"

												Tachyon: The Fringe is one of the first games I've ever played and definitely the one that forever cemented my love for space. In my opinion, its gameplay, story, and even graphics are still definitely up to the mark, even an impressive 16 years after its release. All in all I would definitely recommend you get this game, however if there is no sense of nostalgia or overwhelming curiosity driving you, you should probably wait for a sale.The story is fairly linear and the game features no open world, but it's actually pretty well written and acted out by the voice actors, in particular Bruce Campbell as the charming protagonist Jake Logan. And, despite its linearity, the story still has room for different playstyles and some improvisation. The game also provides a lot of background world-building for its universe, so you won't feel like it's just decorations on a stage.Of course, to get the full experience from the game on modern hardware you'd need to do a couple of tweaks, but you only really need to perform the 3dfx patch since the Steam release shines here as well, the game being updated to the latest version and working impeccably. Thank you to Steam and Novalogic for a quality release of a fantastic game!			"

												amazing game, so ahead of it's time... I thought it would be harder to go back to now, but stellar story and the Bruce Campbell voice overs are worth digging into this gem from the past.			"

												the graphics are not amazing it is still (in my opinion) beautifully and even if you don't agree it is hugely made up for by the game play. although it can be a little repetitive / predictable at times (but so are all other games) there is essentially 2 long enjoyable campaigns in a huge world with some fun side missions and a huge ship customising system with loads of different weapon types and ships. by today's standards there is still allot of variety. by the standard's of the day it was released it was phenomenal.

												Tachyon: The Fringe is a nostalgic look into an older era of space and flight sims. If you enjoyed the Descent games, this is right up the same alley. Sure, the graphics haven't aged well - but I found by about an hour into my playthrough that I hardly noticed this any more, as I had become so involved with the actual play of the game.There are certainly things absent from Tachyon that I would expect to see in modern games of this type - greater customization, some balance tweaks with the weapons, ways to better group and utilise multiple mounted weapons... but this is not a modern game, and despite these deficiencies Tachyon is still absolutely worth a playthrough or two - even in today's market.I do feel obligated to mention the voice acting, as well - it's a little contrived in places, but I found that the performances and the writing definitely contributed to the sense of joyful abandon that I experienced during my playthrough.If you're reading this, chances are you're the kind of person who would get enjoyment out of this title, and I say go for it. I doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

												I've forgotten how many times I played this gem of a game. Still doesn't look that bad for a 17 year old. It left such a mark on me that I *STILL* name ships in other games things like ""Cobalt Spike"". The fleshing out of the story, background and protaganists is surprisingly deep, accompanied and aided by largely voiced fluff from the TNS news service. Bruce Campbell is awesome as the main protaganist (try cheating and feel his wrath - it's a nice easter egg). The story splits mid-way, and the ethos, ships, and weapons of the two factions feel suitably different as you either aid the Bora freedom fighters/terrorists, or buddy up to the Galactic Spanning Corporation, GalSpan. In the in-game words of the Almighty Campbell ""Just play the damn game already""!			"

												This game right here... When you want a finished game, this is it. Great dialogue, great story, and great action. I absolutely loved this game as a kid and even now I'll still play it. This is one of the few games I'll log into my personal collection of hall of fame. Worth every penny.			"

												This is one of the great classics, glad someone decided to update it for this generation.  A Freelancer style space simulation with a brilliant story line and great acting.  The resolution is 1078 x 768 max but visuals are good, I recommend this game.			"
